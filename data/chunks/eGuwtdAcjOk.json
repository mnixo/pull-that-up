this new shit so we're both we're all three of us gonna do longer sets Ian Edwards you've never seen a really really funny guy and Ari of course is awesome so that's Wednesday night at the Ice House we're also brought to you by on it on accom which is you know what the fuck it is go there buy some shit buy some weapons people say we're selling weapons we're not we're selling fitness equipment at some of the best way to get functional strength is with something called a steel mace and yes if you want a box I'm in the head with it it would be a good thing to box I'm gonna head with but that's not what it's for what it's for you Fox is functional strength what we concentrate on on on it is things that improve your performance whether it's your mental performance with nootropics or your mood through new mood or your your ability to perform at high levels of energy for longer periods of time with shroom tech what we're just trying to do is improve the way your body functions and prove your fitness here your health and your fitness and that's what these mace bells are about they're these gigantic what a maze ball looks like it looks like something that you would see in like a gladiator movie or a video game as your first weapon yeah it's like it's a it's a cannon ball on the end of a long steel pipe and you you swing it around and do all these different exercises with it and in controlling something like that it's surprisingly hard especially when you grip it like really low on the end of the pole because you have all this leverage working against you and what it does is it gives you real functional strength we have 10-pound ones and that seems like oh my god what 10 pounds it's nothing trust me try it it's it's such a weird workout club Bell's the same way of you that we have these steel clubs I use a fit of 15 pound one and a 25 pound one and they're fucking hard it's hard to do with like a really light amount of weight it's all functional shit like like kettlebells like battle ropes go to on it comm check out all our shit and if you use a code name Rogan you will save 10% off any and all supplements alright freaks we got Scott Sigler in the house we're gonna get jiggy with it we got a lot of shit to talk about we're gonna talk shit good experience powerful author Scott Sigler you know you're a bad motherfucker when you look at the back of your book and it says a worthy successor to Michael Crichton that's sweet that's a powerful praise right I didn't even say that myself I know is it awesome someone else has something super cool about yeah look at that yeah yeah that's that's pretty badass dude and you said Nocturnals being turned into a TV show right yeah in the process of working on it right now yeah how much control do you have as a writer when that happened I've been shocked by it normally you have very little or no control at all and I a couple points my career I've been very lucky to work with people like let's get this as close to the vision you want as possible and this is the guy who produced Hellboy and Hellboy 2 in the watchman's name's Lloyd Levin Wow and Lloyd has been they kept me involved at all phases of this right now they're fishing up the pilot script for it so I don't write the pilot script but the guys who who are writing it kind of send me the plot steps here's what we want the episode to be like does that sort of match what you're looking at and then because I'm writing the Bible for it so we're gonna look at the 12 episode arc of the first season and make sure everything fits in so we don't have any crazy ending that doesn't make any sense and then I get to give them feedback well you could try these things and it's very collaborative so that's a main role that's a beautiful thing to hear I love when you hear that it's one of the most frustrating things to listen to when you hear someone who had a vision and they tried to express this vision to these other people that have the money and the people with the money like no no we got this we're gonna figure you need a girl you need up this you need a we need to add a black guy you know that's the way it usually works though I mean the guys are gonna raise twenty million dollars get to kind of call the shots yeah it's it's a it's a weird thing to see I told this story before there was a there was a guy named Dave I don't remember his last name I apologize but he was a really funny guy and he's a really funny actor it's been in a bunch of movies like a real over-the-top hilarious guy well he got his first starring role in a movie and I had a very small part in this movie and I watched all these people in suits this man had cufflinks on like beautiful like expensive cufflinks a perfectly tailored expensive fucking suit pinstriped a fat Rolex with diamonds on it I mean this guy was fucking loaded right and he's doing like see he's like he's giving this guy like vine Reed's telling him how he should do it like I want you to come in like bull whoa like the guy thinks he's funny like he's actually he's got so much power and so much money that he he literally is telling the comedian how to be funny and it was was a horrific thing to watch it was the mood that movie was called Frank mcklusky ci or something like that but a terrible terrible and they gutted it they had two ideas they had one that was gonna be a pg-13 and one was gonna be PG or almost gonna be armed and when they went whatever they went les it went yeah you was all toilet jokes like you cut him out you have nothing it was it was ridiculous you stopped the people who are good at what they what they do from doing what they do you hired them for that purpose in the first place it's kind of counterintuitive but you got to think a guy who is such a bad motherfucker that he did the Watchmen he produced two Watchmen that guy knows what he's doing he knows he's he's brilliant I mean it's been great that such a good movie it was an excellent movie and great source material to start with but I mean I'm a huge fan of Hellboy when this when this popped up I'm gonna watch Hellboy I'm like because I myself super hard sciencebase we try to make all the bad things plausible so when you get to the nasty bits and the Bloods fly and you're fully bought it you're like I know how I I know this works I learned about this in science class like that and you go watch Hellboy which is a little bit more supernatural but the creature effects and the way everything was shot and it was just one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen to look up on the screen and now that guy's interested in turn this it's like it could not wish for anything closer more closely matched but that's gotta be an amazing feeling oh what a perfect combination yeah the universe is probably about to send an asteroid our way it's my fault sorry yeah that must be very comforting to know that you got a guy that's willing to listen to well I had the first book infected that was a whirlwind because I started out giving all my books away as free audiobooks recorded myself chopped mumbles podcast give my boys podcast for free to build up an audience because I couldn't get anybody in New York to pay attention there's mice they don't well we don't know if you're horror we don't know if your sci-fi we don't know if you're thriller we don't know if you're military all these different ass-kicking genres coming together so I couldn't get a book deal start givin the books away for free build up an audience landed a print deal with Random House four infected and part of that deal was immediately optioned by rogue Pictures for a movie and that's the last I heard for like two years have to go down and have a couple meetings with with some people but scriptwriter never got to meet him never got to see the script it immediately just kind of went off into the weeds and nothing ever came out of it so this is pretty exciting so far to see things progressing well that's amazing man that's all I really that's an awesome thing to hear when things are just falling into place in the proper order yeah now when you write a book and then you're you're gonna have your book turned into a television series and you're sort of giving up you know your ideas other people what how does that feel is that a strange feeling like what is what does that like well the this is the second time around for me for doing this and it is it's a little bit strange but largely it's very exciting because what they do I can't do I'm not the guy with the Rolex who's trying to control things the the people who can pace this out for a one-hour television show and can kind of and visualize the 12 episode arc and then get someone to pay for it and get it shot correctly and get it up on a screen that's a skill set I don't have it all so it's really I'm giving up a little bit but largely it's exciting like I want to see the shit in this book on TV I want to see it on the screen so it's it's really not that nerve-wracking at all you have no idea how it's gonna turn out but at this point in my career I concede that I realized that the end end product I'm gonna have a tiny amount of control on it you're just kind of hoping for the best you hope these guys got the you hope they've got the right vibe and they're gonna want to put something as kick-ass on the screen as in the book wow that's gotta be a very very interesting process I wish you luck with that that's a it's gonna be a fascinating journey and tell us what is the what's the plot of the book in a summary nocturnal is uh it's a kind of a throwback to 80s buddy cop movies and I grew up on trip you know the whole Trading Places Beverly Hills Cop 48 hours on that huge and just just loved that genre so this starts out as sort of a buddy cop procedural where there are Brian clauser and pookie Chang to San Francisco homicide inspectors and Brian's having these really nasty nasty dreams about killing people and early on the book they go to a site and the murder scene matches his dream exactly and suspicion falls on him immediately that he's doing these borderline superhuman things to go shred people and body parts all over the place and then it turns into the procedural from there they kind of have to follow the rabbit trail and it gets it it's hard to it's hard to summarize it without giving spoiling right but it it gets kind of paranormal not really the supernatural there's a rational explanation for everything but they uncover this massive conspiracy within the police department there's been a cover-up that's been going on for for 200 years to stop this to let this particular group of people who are sacrificing innocence let them continue to sacrifice Brian food you got to figure out how to shut that down and stay alive Wow yeah that's some deep conspiratorial shit man 200 years of people keeping their mouths shut yeah well it's it it plays off of the the police department and one is as research in this one of the phrase that came up like the the biggest gang in New York is the cops and that goes back to when they first put in the police department they start to get a lot of power the organized crime and the gangs were you could get away with a lot of a lot of stuff but at some point if you crossed the cops whether they be good cops or corrupt cops you were screwed because you just they had a level of power you couldn't match so that that they're the ones who've been keeping this thing quiet because there are a pattern of serial killers in San Francisco and this other organization has a way of getting rid of the serial killers when the cops can't even find them so the cops are actually trying to keep this quiet and protect it because the end result is more people live and less people die but it's completely illegal as hell when you write a book like this how much when you're looking at human corruption and cop cup ssin how much did you investigate did you go and look at actual cases to find out what's plausible or do you just go completely on your instincts and what you know just by general information there's a significant amount of research and but it's broad it's not it's not deep it's broad research let's look into what kind of corruption there has been and how was organized crime set up in San Francisco and learning a lot of things that way because fortunately at this point in the writing career I've learned to try and stay away from diving down the rabbit hole because you can learn all this incredible amazing stuff and then 1% of it actually makes it into the book and all the time you've invested in researching that for these kind of thriller style books is time that you did you know you get nothing out of that right so a lot of a lot of the superficial stuff learning how you know the Mafia was run out of San Francisco and replaced by the tongs and the Russians and a lot of other groups all that stuff was super cool and a ton of that goes in there and the police department was pretty helpful in research for this there's not a it it's not your typical these are dirty cops and they're gonna shake you down they actually are trying to do something that benefits the greater good but they have to totally ignore the law they're sworn to protect in order to get the end result so it's been a more fun corruption if you can imagine that wow that's a that's that's a fascinating subject and I've always been fascinated by like the idea of secret societies that have been down for 200 years doing horrible things and then pulling it off and usually yeah yeah you know even in in jest no one takes those things seriously you know discuss Skull and Bones or something like please it's a fucking fraternity big goof off there it's no big deal Illuminati all that good stuff yeah but the idea of it is it's a constantly fascinating source for people because every now and then you find one that's real every now and then you find like a Jerry Sandusky case where no one really did tell the cops over for 20 years of trauma lasting it really did happen and you're like whoa like these things can happen or the Miami did you ever see Billy Corbin's documentary cocaine Cowboys cocaine Cowboys one and cocaine Cowboys two or two of my favorite documentaries ever they're amazing and this guy Billy Corbin who directed it one of the things he pulled out was that there was one year where the mine Police Department's graduating class from the police academy mm-hmm half of them eat all of them either wound up in jail or murdered well yeah for like half of them were murdered and half of them went to jail like the whole the whole thing was like a crazy criminal organization like the entire police force massively corrupt in the cocaine era that's when I mean if you go to Miami have you ever been no never been to Miami it's it's avoidable no that's not totally necessary the amount of money involved back then was just astronomical and you know somebody's gonna bite on that sooner or later the amount of banks there it's insane the banks per capita they're much higher than anywhere else it's because they were all laundering cocaine money I make for real I mean that's really as the root of it all I mean the the the actual impact the cocaine had on the economy of Miami is undeniable but this guy wrote about how crazy the police corruption was betting that or rather did this documentary we showed it I mean so it's possible you know people can go off the rails that was just a couple of decades ago yeah well you've got you've got the money and you've got the power and they're isolated from a lot of the self-examination you know if you discussion at the upper or top levels of the police department can make a lot of shit go away you know that's that's the place it seems most likely to that's realistic they're there they have their hands on the drugs or hands on the criminals or hands on the money if somebody's gonna go bad that's a good place to do it yeah it's fascinating when you find out that it's true though it's like wow corrupt cop a bunch of corrupt cops like they they tried it you almost wonder why it doesn't happen more often it probably does yeah well probably they they're probably pretty good at like you said it's the biggest gang around why would you want to piss off a gang you know it's right probably plenty of little subtle corruption a little bit of this a little bit of that the guys who can shoot you and it's legal yeah I think everybody knows at the end of the day really gotta be careful around those guys cuz they can kill you and it's okay the license to kill and they can just say you attacked them you know I mean how many times we've seen a cell phone camera of someone videotaping a cop and you know the cop beats shit out of the kid and then you know you hear from the the arrest papers that the police officer lied that the kid attacked him a lot of the kids spit on and we're said something over there there was a guy in our John's recently the same thing these cops just they have ultimate power and when anyway that's a bad thing whenever any human beings got ultimate power of their over other people and there's the thing people I tend think tend to forget is there's millions of cops across the country and and with that many PS sample set that big and those opportunities yes some of those individuals a very small percentage those individuals are gonna take that opportunity some of them are gonna be nuts you only hear about those guy you don't hear about the nine hundred ninety nine thousand that are just you know doing their job and willing to take a bullet for you every day but yeah it's that it happens yeah and when a like a Christopher dormer case happens Jesus Christ this is this could be a cop to that guy had that guy get through you know or what happened to him in overseas it turned him into that guy you know who knows but how much of that plays a part of your writing it's just sort of in a broad educational sense like you just pay attention all that stuff sir it's largely to weave the tapestry of reality I mean people are there's a certain amount of things people are expecting from a fictional novel things that feel familiar well there's got to be some level of corruption this one cops got to be a total badass somebody's gonna rough some guys up just because you're familiar with that you've seen that right so a lot of those things go into a lot of them are invisible in the book I tend both with the science and with culture is to put in a lot of things you're already familiar with so that you you're like okay yeah okay yeah and if you say yeah 20 or 30 times like I know that I know that then when it starts to go up to the next level where the crazy shit starts to happen we've already got this report I've already got a rapport with you and you're you've allowed yourself to buy in completely so having those elements like you know realistic police things actually using the real history of the Mafia in San Francisco anything like that allows you to to fall further into the story so it's very important to use real stuff and kind of create that illusion that's awesome man i I've always wanted to be a writer in some sense I've never had the time but I've always thought a bad awesome thing too like I brought a terrible script once but no we can do that in a way up here we're talking about starting a new show called getting my shorts where I talked to people who like say exactly what you said we stand for 10 minutes I interview about the fiction stuff do you like the movie stuff you like etc tell me you think this stupid idea we were talking about this and then at the end like okay well let's throw out some ideas for a story and I'll help bounce stories together and then when we get done you get up and walk away and then like a week later I've got like a 5 10 page short story and then that's the kind of thing that we would you off your clothes that sounds like it would be a fun idea you get to write us you get to write a story about the actual grunt work of getting down and writing you come up with a big idea and then you turn it over to somebody does this on a regular basis it's likes exactly like taking lessons for something like here's what I want to do what I want to have this and then this guy and then this chick should get naked because obviously that's very important to a story and then this sort of things happening back alright let's go see what we can do we'll go back and shut up there's so many fast excuse me there's so many fascinating the occupations out there there's just not enough time in the world but writing has always been a particularly romantic one you know it's the idea of putting together something that you know you're crafting a story entirely in your head slapping it down on paper and then it exists entirely in the heads of the people that are reading it it's uh the romance of it is so utterly overblown it's it's knife I've been lucky enough to do this full-time for five years now my days all I do is my job and it's similar to you know MMA when you see the guys come in the ring and you're like oh look at all this pageantry and all this wonderful stuff and the spotlights on them and you know except for the Ultimate Fighter show you don't see you don't see the years that go in of just getting crushed and working all the time and all the sacrifice and all the things you got to do and then you get that moment oh the books in the store and I'm on tour in that last two weeks and then you go right back into the dungeon and do it some more it's a great F and job I don't want to do anything else I'm so happy to be doing it but yeah those moments of romance or like little tiny things that pop up every now and then yeah well to everybody outside of it that doesn't have to do the work yeah that's where it's romantic yeah yeah work can be grueling sitting there smoking a cigarette in front of a typewriter like you're Hunter Thompson Crabb who your favorite writers when you were coming up definitely Stephen King is the single biggest influence on me watching his ability to tell a story and characterize I'm like a pair he the thing that always mesmerized me about him is he can take a secondary character give you one paragraph of description like here's a vocal twitch here's a physical twitch and here's this this thing they believe and then you've got you know that guy's name 20 years later yeah he's the master of that and then McCaffrey was a huge sci-fi writer that the dragonriders of Pern that series so that was kind of more of the science fiction area of things and Tom Clancy was another big one to Tom Clancy's ability to take thousands of different things research them in detail and kind of put them all together where they they come together at the end for us super over-the-top ending those are probably the biggest three and Jack London's another gigantic one too when I was a kid I read something somewhere where they were criticizing Stephen King's books and and it was in some I grew up in Boston and in Newton one of the suburbs of Boston there was a lot of snobby people there's a lot of people that were like a Stephen King like what base writing I remember thinking that like why would you ever criticize a guy first of all so fucking prolific I mean and it's really fun stuff yeah how stuffy do you have to be to not appreciate a good Stephen King book I you know it's Menachem pletely different level than say the Twilight writer but you still run into that today Fifty Shades of Grey and Twilight and these books come out and they blow up because that resonates with the end reader and all of this all this pompous arrogant bullshit about I'm writing art and you know what unless your book has sold two hundred three hundred thousand copies no one's gonna remember your name at 50 years you're gonna be gone unless you get your book dusted off somewhere so the guys who are actually making stuff that resonates with people that makes millions of people extremely happy to read it again and again and then go see the movies they get they get shat on all the time all the time and Stephen King now is getting an enormous amount of he's getting its props now from the industry I think but yeah 25 30 years ago everybody was all pissed that this dirty butt kid from Maine came out of nowhere and has eaten all their lunches because he writes great stories that people love they were they were pissed they wanted those books sold not him yeah they're crazy if you you read The Shining and tell me that's not an amazing yeah the movies great but yeah the the TV show I didn't really dig that much but the movie was good the movie although very different from the from the book but the books and so what's great my favorite book of his is misery you go through misery and and you know he doesn't he didn't just play with a story there he actually played with the typography on the page if you actually read the page Paul the main character has to write this story for Annie and then they switch font bring in the margin so it looks like regular typewriter page and then as the story is progressing letters start to fall off of the typewriter and the farther and it goes first it's the end and the e then the L and as you get towards the end of the book where not only is Paul's real life story happening but the fictional story is coming to a conclusion - there's all these scrawled pencil marks in there and just looking at the page starts to stress you the fuck out I wasn't feel like the third time I read it I'm like because I read it once I'm like okay that was killer it was killer and read it again and then I'm like million third time like why am why am I so angry what is going on and I stop and look I'm like it's just so even understands the art form of what how visually things look on a page you know why why's that who's on all sorts of drugs that shit was on some heavy-duty shit he said that I think it was Christine he didn't even remember writing it was one of them yeah like didn't remember writing it cars alive man I think bucked up man he was first of all he did a lot of cocaine yeah and smoked a lot it was fascinating they said that cigarettes we're one of the things that he really missed when it came to the the creative process are you talking about that with David Lee Roth the other day that nicotine such a huge part yeah the process well it's a I don't smoke I don't partake in it but it seems to be undeniable proof that it's some sort of a mental stimulant and it does something to accelerate thinking or does something to the mind because too many people but like intelligent people like Bertrand Russell like would wouldn't get on a plane if you couldn't smoke in there like if they didn't have a room in the smoking section they wouldn't get on a plane fucking poor guy was just attached to this tobacco tip try some nicotine just nicotine gum get outta here go fuck yourself that crazy horse but yeah so many writers have been smokers you know but the thing about Stephen King he quit and so he still puts out great stuff but he I think he struggles more do you hear what he does though supposedly I mean cuz this is a bit of Teebs that he allows himself to have one cigarette every time he finishes a novel under he write somebody know ya joke is a guy wrote thirty two novels today yeah that's funny that's that's interesting that he allows himself one cigarette a year so I guess he's probably kicking out about a novel a year if not more he just he's got a different different style of writing - yeah you can when you can effortlessly bring in the supernatural the way he does yeah there's not an enormous amount of research that's necessary and no when he wrote The Green Mile he researched a lot of things about the prison system the natural history but if it's a modern-day ghost story you don't have to research anything you just sit down and do your thing and that allows him to allows him to a little bit faster than a lot of people did you read the Tommyknockers oh yeah oh I love that one yeah he's got the the best sigh in my opinion the best supernatural scenarios he comes up with so many different maximum Maximum Overdrive yeah it's interesting now I'm coming to my fifth and final book with Random House and I write these hard science techno thrillers with the fuck ton of monsters in them and in super and you know of science fiction stuff so they always start out normally like oh I've seen this before this yes CSI episode then things go absolutely haywire and you're in for the ride but I've been kind of jonesing to get back to the the Stephen King that inspired me when I was a kid which is you know you can spend so much more time on character and plot and developing things if you don't have these large structural organizations like the cops we're trying to get like the one I'm writing now is pandemic it's the final book in the infected trilogy and I'm trying to get help on what it's actually like in the Situation Room and the series has taken itself to that level but I've I don't follow politics for shit I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about situation you mean the Situation Room the president yeah the White House right not want that like the CNN show with wolf blue yeah the first book infected is anybody reads in his read Stephen King will see the influences playing snakes it's largely it's one University of Michigan linebacker who blew out his knee in the Rose Bowl so never not to go never got to go pro was would have been a number one draft pick hands down but now he works in computer support because he didn't finish his degree and he can't play ball anymore so there's this giant super dangerous guy with a lot of Rage issues who works really hard to control his rage and then he gets infected by this this alien vector this other thing going on and it turned and he spends a lot large part of the book trying to not kill people but most of that takes place in his apartment and in the town of Ann Arbor and that's the Stephen King angle which is we're gonna take a small town we can develop this out I can do whatever I want and I don't have to justify why isn't the SWAT team kicking in the door and all these other things so now that I'm writing this complicated crap of the situation room like I think that's kind of run its course I want to get back to the the smaller cast and the smaller towns I grew up in small town Michigan and I think that's why a lot of stuff resonated with me it's the same thing it's a different accent and I wanted for the future I would probably try and get back more into that that kind of thing I thought it was amazing that Stephen King wrote so many books about a writer from Maine yeah it's like after a while you're like come on man really fuck are you doing you got another book about a writer from Maine like Jesus I know you want to write a book a year but fucking come on you can't be a baseball player or a fireman or some shit yeah it's got to be a goddamn writer from line that's that's why you gotta the Green Mile which is about it's different than anything else he's written that yeah amazing Christine is another one of my favorites have you read any of his son's work Joe Joe Hill yeah I've read horns and have read the first couple collections of the lock-and-key comic book which is what he's becoming most well-known for oh really yeah yeah he was a lock-and-key comic book lock-and-key is I forget where the family originates but they wind up moving to a mansion they inherit in Rhode Island so it's very similar to forgive me a lock-and-key fans but I have this wrong it's very similar to old school Stephen King small town family goes moves into this haunted house it's kind of shining esque and there's a lot of different keys that will open up different rooms in the house and the rooms and all these crazy paranormal portal type things but he the artist I believe is Gabriel Rodriguez and they both won Eisner Awards which is the Academy Award of comic books for this so he's really although obviously he's had an enormous amount of press coverage from being Stephen King son and writing whore you know a ton he's also developed this comic book thing with the IDW as the publisher and it's an enormous enormous success I've read the the one I think it's called little yellow box or something like that it was great stuff it's Dark Tower series is a king yeah I read the first one a lot when it first came out but all my friends are so addicted to that series didn't you write have you followed that out I I followed it up I think through book six and then I don't think it's a spoiler at this point it's 20 years old there's a point in the series where Stephen King actually writes himself into the series so the characters are actually talking to Stephen King who's going like wait a minute I wrote you guys and I was like okay that's just too meta for me I I'm out I'm out but the I think the first three Dark Tower books are the single best trilogy of any kind anywhere those three books are just effing Matt if you'd have stopped right there there's still a masterpiece the series went on I think the first three books are there's never been anything better written in my opinion since it's perfect yeah he was a bad motherfucker and suppose ya heart-shaped boxes is such a box yeah that was I read that one about a haunted haunted suit really really good stuff that he looks a lot like his dad - its kind of creepy but he's kind of his style is unique I mean it's it's very much his it's sort of influenced you can tell but very much what everybody writes or is influenced by Stephen King you know that's like I don't know how to you know cannot be there's there's no way to not be a lot of a lot of people get into it specifically because you read those books or you read Peter Straub or any of the other you know the the heavyweights back in King's day John Saul etc and you read those and those call to you and you want to make shit like that and then when you start making your own shit well of course it's going have a little bit of that a little bit of that in there and King King really admits he's influenced by a ton of people and he's like if you read my stuff closely enough you see their stuff in the book it's just the way it goes yeah he was actually a big proponent of reading other guys stuff to help your writing mm-hmm yeah I read Stephen King on writing oh yeah that's a it's a Bible yeah for me because it's specifically because it gets rid of a lot of the pomp and circumstance and the you know the nose up in the air it's it's so blue collar and you know for a small-town guy like me you read that it's like you can read on writing by Stephen King and see stop falling in love with yourself stop sucking your own dick far in the phrase you're not that important you're not that great just tell the story stop putting in words that are gonna make everybody realize how important you are and just tell your tell your story that's like the main gist of it it's not a how to streamline everything and not be a pompous windbag but still tell your great story so it really resonated with me being a pompous windbag is a problem and pretty much everything isn't all right everybody everybody yeah actually I when I on my podcast cuz I give away all my books as free audiobooks I play up the pompous windbag that's like the joke within a joke I come on and talk about awesome the stories gonna be in all this other stuff and the fans that they they eat it up it's it's funny that's my stick I can't do stand-up but I can do that thing and because you're you get used to after a while you know when people get very successful at something and then they start to they start to believe their own bullshit and that's when you start to get that crazy self-importance coming on and what's the sad thing about that is when you start to see people like that the majority of their fans are like oh god he was so awesome back in the day but now look at him you know it happens to a lot of people the pressure or something the pressure of success right I think yeah the success I mean if you're surrounded by yes men all the time yeah and nobody's there criticizing your ideas then you're not objective and you know you know sort of self-analyze yeah a lot of people don't like to self-analyze get some confused but we've all seen the the real-life pompous windbag it's a shocking thing yeah it's so gross - one of the reasons why it's so gross is because you hope and pray that you could never be that guy you know you hope and pray that if the situation was reversed and you were in his shoes that you would it couldn't be possible I feel like there's a lot of getting your ass kicked early in life and just failure after failure there's an enormous amount to be said for trying things and failing yeah as opposed to people who like the first thing they try out of the gate huge success and then you know then you haven't developed that that humble nature of I tried 28 things and 27 of them failed miserably so this one thing I'm not gonna get too crazy with this you know we're having success you tend to see that in Hollywood and in writing some people come out of the gate get that big novel it blows up then after that they don't have much success and they can't figure out what's going on because they think they're very important this is not amazing they take changed their own frequency they're putting out because their success and that sabotages them that's in that that's the sad thing that's what that's what hamstrings I'm happens to so many though yeah to so many different art forms to music musicians it happens you know you know the guys that are the lead singers of these big bands and they go fucking Looney Tunes the band falls apart and what was it was it partying drugs adulation adulation is a serious possibility adulation is a big drug the scary you can get delusional on that shit you know it's uh it's it's a fascinating one for character development though isn't it it is you can you can play off them anytime you've got a story where you've got someone a position of power it's almost impossible to write them from here's a normal humble person this position of power like you're writing about you know the mayor of San Francisco isn't the story the police chief of San Francisco it's almost impossible for them to get to that position if they're a nice regular humble person because at some point in any political construct you have to become cutthroat and you have to look at other people as an obstacle to be removed and there can't be humanity involved like everybody the top politics right now those are some cutthroat cutthroat people even Barack Obama didn't get worried it was by playing nice you know and so when you writing a character about someone in that higher position of power you have to channel some of that in there there has to be that level of self-assuredness all the way up to arrogance and that dismissive nature as well you know if you're in my way I'm gonna tell you probably shouldn't be in my way cuz it's not gonna go well for you and then that full-on confidence and then they just you just get rid of them you crush them then too bad I told you when you start to write a story do you do you have like a full idea in your head before you sit down in front of a computer or do you have like I want to write a vampire cop drama like you mean what what is it that do you have a bunch of different ways that it gives birth in your mind it it tends to come from several different places i watch and i watch as much science TV as i can and i read up as much as i can and in in the natural world there's always something like oh my look at that look this creature can do that thing the water bear can survive in space you know holy crap and that'll stick and then at some other point you will watch something about you know here's a sexual reproduction if they're in this particular chemical environment then that'll stick and then a couple things stick and at some point I'll just be working on something else and four or five things will come together and then that's the center point of the idea I'm like well what if we had creatures that did this and then this happened and then they took over the world kind of thing from there you have to go and hammer on an outline I try and hammer on an outline with the tiny bit of science knowledge that I have and then I'm really fortunate because again because of the podcast I started getting people scientists emailing me going wow I love what you're doing you're really trying to get the science right you fuck this up so if you get into neural chemistry again here I'm a PhD give me a call and like these I started getting all this shit in and now amazing now I've got this battery of people I'll do the outline and then I will send them all the outline and say alright tear it up and then they shred it they shred it and they'll come back well you can't do that but here's some other we just found out about this you could do this that is so cool what an awesome source amazing and they they they have a blast with it and then I restructure my outline do a detailed first draft and then we repeat for people that are listening right now that'll go well what's his podcast what's what's the name of your podcast - Scott cigars audiobooks and you can if you go to iTunes and search for Scott Sigler SEO TTS Igla R you'll find that and/or Scott Sigler comm we have them there we've been going on seven years now all right set off every Sunday for seven years we put on an episode I want you to pull a picture up of those water bears I think they're also called tardigrades tardigrades that's a they they can survive in space it's it's so weird when nature is as crazy as anything you could ever think of in fiction yeah and it's just undeniable well there it is here's a photograph of it this is a real thing that's why the science is you know they're super tiny but you know of course my brain immediately looks this goes okay what if that was eight feet long let's make that thing eight feet long Jesus and let's make that hide you know pretty much bulletproof let's do those two things do it for the folks listening and not watching this thing looks like it looks like a giant Rhino with like a circular diamond drill for a mouth flashlight it is the witness yeah like a super diamond alien flashlight and the thing it looks like a Star Wars creature yeah it also looks like it has a kind of like a cotton cape on or something like that like it doesn't look like it's dude that thing survives yes base well it can survive in space and the membranes get a little differently get down that that's small but you mean that's the kind of thing where maybe a graphic artist who does a lot of acid could come up with that yes it shows up and you're like that's that oh my god look at its fucking mouth yeah Christ for the folks at home it's literally got a giant shark mouth Wow that I see this is it listen to this I just realized this I'm finishing up a book called pandemic which was infected then contagious then pandemic and and there's a creature in pandemic and the mouth is similar to that and I just realized that that's where I got it from that thing is floating in the back of my head forever and it's actually popped out in this book look at that photo that is insane yeah that is insane folks it's that you could find them they're called either water bears people call them that or tardigrades I think it's a scientific name for it and they are the creepiest looking motherfucker how small of those things there's they're microscopic but they're microscopic yeah yeah they're incredibly a couple of microns I think right that's yeah spooky little creatures but then you get and that gives you so many storytelling possibilities you've got a creature that seems insignificant you can't even see it and yet if you know if we suddenly lost our atmosphere for whatever reason or the kemon vironment changed significantly and all the humans died this thing could still be around and then this thing could start evolving and yeah maybe the universe really doesn't have a sense of time and just sets up these little extra seeds laying around genetic material like tardigrades just in case you hit that button and nuke the whole planet sideways yeah these little motherfuckers can grow into something that can survive in a vacuum it would start over real quick if we got wiped out it would it would start over again pretty fast I wonder I wonder what it would be next would it be dolphins would it be some sort of busy this is this is this shit I think about all the time for the bus and odds are you're not gonna get any sea creature for a couple reasons number one no hands there's no tool use a number two no fire yeah two biggest factors that go in our tool use and flight true and then I think you also are not gonna get this is driving crazy and watch sci-fi shows about this man lion lions don't need to evolve they're an apex predator there's no need for them to change anything for the most part it's the it's the little things that have to run from everything else and especially with humanity I think is revolved up was the biggest thing was losing the hair and having to invent some way to stay warm and you start to use tools to make clothes and tools to hunt and as soon as something has to use a tool and figures that out that's that's the flash point from there it goes it goes crazy why did we lose the hair I'm not entirely sure I don't know but there wasn't a large need for it in a greatly temperate environment like savanna Africa so in the human body all evolution if there's something that you just don't need anymore and you're burning calories to keep that thing going and it taking energy to support that if you have successive mutations where that thing gets smaller and smaller there's no penalty there's no penalty oh well his hands are this big and he can't use a spear you're not going to survive that long but if your earlobes shrink and you can hear just fine there's no penalty so that's the evolution kind of gets rid of the stuff that you don't need it is fascinating what you say though about the intelligence sea creatures never be able to get like their physical environment to change right right yeah that's that's an interesting point I never really thought about the no-fire thing but yeah they create if you can't if you can't make fire and refine metal then you are cut off at the knees as far as what you can do from there and James Cameron played with that in the abyss with having his intelligent water-based species but it would be very it's very difficult to conceive any way you could get that to going so it's land-based it's got to have hands or appendages that are ready to become hands a couple of basic things so it could easily start out with some kind of primate or some kind of small mammal right off the bat but there's also some pretty kick-ass reptiles out there and yogurts you hear about the ukrainian army has been training dolphins and used like knives and and they've been attaching knives and pistols to their head and they've trained them to use them so they could now use these knives to do things history yeah so now they're right now this was on the news today that they lost the dolphins but had the pistols or the guns on them and they're on the loose right now so there's these rogue dolphins that have guns on them that are just terrorizing the sea but come on swear to god it's true dolphins apparently swam away to get laid they're out there looking for some never come back that's why would they come back they got guns man guns and bitches yeah they got guns and they're trying to get dolphins are one of the few creatures that they murder yeah they'd kill for no other reason than just to kill and also dolphins rape which is messed up so now you've got these things swimming around and they're trained to kill divers is the problem they're specifically trained to kill divers so I'm gonna write the dolphin Saturday at Ciro's and soon these dolphins are trained to kill divers yeah they're military they're trained to kill that's the program it's a program specific divers or any enemy divers many divers Ukraine I'm sure the Ukrainian controllers this is inherited from the Russian program and they would have specific parameters to train them to go out and kill a certain shape or certain color or have I fucked up as that trained dolphins to go out and be assassins yeah what a douchey move well there's Spencer Royal dolphins are very creepy though where would they kill babies they killed a baby when a female are gives birth I think she won't mate with a male for several years so if a male comes along and it's not his babies he just kills them yeah get her to mate again dolphins aren't dolphins or gangster gangsters of the sea they are not messing around except for killer whales separate killer whales eat them nobody screws with the killer whale yeah the apex of the apex humans I'm other than humans they've got no they've got no predator there's nothing that hunts a killer whale I thought happy feet was fascinating monster moving sort of away a monster alien movie because it dealt with the whole idea of living in this you know a semi-aquatic world all of a sudden these aliens from the other part of the world from the surface come and fuck everything up and kidnap people and take photographs and shit and it's really kind of interesting when you think about how much life must suck in the ocean and these crazy assholes that live out above the ocean with these giant metal machines that they've created this scoop literally scoop life in Nets just you know fuck what they get dolphins whoops sorry sometimes I give dolphins on purpose imagine what it was like for whales which are pretty effing intelligent and have language of communication and for what I think a hundred million years something like that there's nobody screws as well because you can't because they're gigantic and they just ignore you then all of a sudden here come these ships and here come these harpoons and they're screwed there's nothing they can do there's nothing they can do who's the first guy trying to harpoon the whale back I was a bad motherfucker you gotta think of yeah that's that's a gangster move I'm gonna you know I mean that guy's not playing games I don't know what I've heard about that's probably you know it's kind of a nice age thing or place where there's ice so the whales have to break the ice to come up to breathe mhm in a whale breaking through the ice to us blowhole can get out there you just stab that son of a bitch and I don't know how they did it but somebody figured out that's a lot of good eatin wow that's harsh life yeah harsh life when you gotta eat a whale the dolphin thing reminds me of I've got some of my fans were tweeting today because that basically the same thing happens in my book the GFL so I've got title flight which is what I emailed you on to start with which is an MMA sci-fi story and then we have the Galactic Football League which is a young adult series but it's an American pro football league eight hundred years in the future with aliens playing the different positions based on their physiology so you got like 1500 pound lineman you got receivers and d-backs can jump 20 feet in the air and it's this crazy hodgepodge of stuff but intelligent dolphins are part of that that whole thing too so it's uh that with the Galactic Football League series which is rookie the starter the all-pro and the MVP and then the title fight I think I'm one of the few guys is merging sports and science fiction because a lot of times the jock is anathema to science fiction guys they're like the jocks very much yeah what is uh what is that story about title fight is uh it's kind of a classic rocky ass type story but there is a heavyweight champ of the galaxy named Korac the cutter and this is octa-core full-on octagon it's straight out of a huge MMA champion of the heavyweight champ of the galaxy so in this in this universe I've created the Sigler burrs if you're going to be a combat fighter you can't have any body modifications it has to be all natural so there's no Hydra no you know no hydraulics or no cybernetics or anything like that and he is of a race called the quiff which have three cast there's a leader there's a warrior and there's a worker kind of an insect I'll type approach and the warriors are these giant badass things with extra set of arms and they're very mean and very tough and they are perennial II the champions and then along comes this nasty-ass human fighter named Kyle North who comes out of a place called the purist nation which is in my universes the backwater human only world where they hate all the alien races won't get along with anybody but they're mean and they're nasty and this guy's name is Kyle North and he was created by often him at Wallace who co-wrote this with me and that's a ex pro wrestler so he's a he's a bad MF and that it's following their arcs the human who will do anything to be the champion sacrifice his own body kill whoever he's got to kill make any deal and the highly you know almost Ronin like the honor honorable existing champion and the two different two different mentalities clashed for that final championship ring like the second half of the book is nothing but the fight it's just a brutal fight how big is the human in this this is trying to I'm trying to track out the growth of humans in just the last 50 years and the NFL in particular 50 years ago the average NFL lineman weighed 253 pounds at 253 pounds you can't play college ball now these guys like the starting offensive line for the Dallas Cowboys 50 years ago could not get a job anywhere in football probably couldn't get a scholarship they're just not big enough so we've seen the average weight go from 253 somewhere like 310 315 somewhere in that ball park and that's not evolution that's just better nutrition and these guys getting the opportunity and cultivating the big guys because 50 years is enough time for evolution to kick in but eight centuries from now you can kind of see that progressing out so the main character in the Galactic football league's name is Quentin Barnes he's a quarterback and he's seven feet tall 380 pounds and he's and they're like well he's kind of small he could play tight end he'd be a small tight end and then all everybody's exponentially larger based on quarterback to lineman so Kyle North I think is in the book he's he's 6-8 380 and that's that's the heavyweight champ of the world you know just just cut to because this is this is our cover with him so you know just it looks like gay porn son it does why is he flexing so hard we grabbed an image and we search for MMA fighter and all the image sites and that we had a lot of gay porn that's it's our yeah yeah unfortunately and fortunately depending on your sexual preference I was hoping just some gigantic like Dan Severn type dude and none of that was available phaidor Emelianenko won the greatest time he did have a body anything like that yeah his death looks like James Irvin more but even bigger than James Irvin maybe James Irvin when he was a heavyweight he was a very muscular mm they fire but most guys aren't built like that because it's either you have to have extreme genetics to be built like that or you got to spend too much time lifting weights you get that at more the lot I mean you get some really cut physiques at the middle weights and light heavyweight those guys not as much together not as much you know the best guys are longer and leaner right now they like the really heavily muscled guys it's just too much fuel those bodies require you see like a guy like spiders spiders Scott yeah that cut yeah Anderson stuff was a perfect example of what I think is like the Ultimate Fighter body but occasionally you'll see a guy who's like really thickly muscled at 185 and you want to tell him man listen you need to just get rid of all that muscle just do aerobic exercises only from now on yeah you're a plenty of muscle just wrestle and kickbox and and run like a lot and drop some weight man you're you're hindering yourself by having this crazy Beachbody yeah and that do you think that affects their fighting performance to be overly muscled certainly absolutely it's just not effective it's needs it's like having too much horsepower in a car where your your brakes can't can they you rather your your wheels can't get any traction because you're just spinning your wheels and then you run out of gas quick that's what happens if you have too much horsepower in a car and that's what how it happens in a person too if you have an overly muscular body the resources that requires are substantial you're gonna pump blood through all these extra tissues that's that's serious shit it's a lot of work for your heart so you should be as you know you should be strong but as lean as you can be close to naturally close to natural weight it's great if you can if you can if you can compete against the larger guys who cut weight it's been really cool to watch with WC coming in the MMA actually getting more weight classes yeah I used to you know I wrestle at 126 in college and there was no when you're watching MMA there's nowhere to see guys of that size at least until WC came along they started to get more of the flyweight in there and is the UFC gonna continue to expand all tal the weight class yeah they're thinking about going to 115 as well we went to 125 some people don't like it because they say those fights aren't as exciting but I think to the most technical fights like Mighty Mouse Johnson is one of my favorite fighters Demetrius Johnson he's the flyweight champion okay and I feel like the people were saying that are the same people like back in UFC one two and three when they're like you know Gracie and and would be all tied up or something like well this isn't exciting I'm like it's because you have no idea what you're looking at this is mesmeric Dan Severn fighting like Gracie is mesmerizing to watch I think for some people bigger is better especially Americans were such a knuckleheads right we want to see the biggest guy and we'll see the biggest guy in the house it's like John L Sullivan yeah and look any man in this room you know it's like that was the say back then lik I don't know why you can't really say that now I can look any man in this room everybody like hey what the fuck you trying to say man I think I was six and I got in trouble and my grandma and the grams is German immigrant and she's like I'll give you such a look and I'm like I have no idea what the hell she was talking about like I don't know what's going on grandma but I'm just gonna behave from now on because I don't want to crash it yeah that's a terrifying threat like what are you talking about old woman I don't know what you mean might hold me down like we get the fuck out of here yeah but for four fighters the the correct weight class and going in and and fighting it to your your optimum weight class can be the difference between being a successful fighter with a championship career and being a guy who never quite rises to the top like you see in a minute is a few guys that are like sort of what I call tweeners not really in 155 or they're really too big for that but they're really too small for 1/7 right there's a few guys like that that are just like somewhere in the middle there they should be like a maybe a 165 like BJ Penn fighting crazy giving up a lot away yeah BJ Penn just that's his choice you know he just chooses to fight the bigger guys he's not afraid to fight bigger guys and when he was younger and he was able to pull it off pretty well mm-hmm but you know the game is moving in a forward and progressing direction constantly you're never gonna slow down the progress of these young guys that are up and coming they're better they're gonna be better they're gonna be better than gonna be more technical I mean it doesn't mean that the older guys can't still win occasionally but those guys have to evolve as well you see like in boxing like Bernard Hopkins this week one of worry it's crazy I watched it and it's a beautiful performance yeah because he just did everything correctly he's like such a craftsman in there and he's you know he's got these old-school sort of moves and just knows how to cover up knows where the punches are going before you even think about throwing them knows what you're gonna do find your patterns and then knows how to step around you knows how to keep you moving it was beautiful to watch well in MMA there's not a whole lot of those guys that are like these old-school like perfect fighters you know like Anderson you know Anderson is one of them and then you've got John Jones who's just this phenom whose although it has all this great success really he's got a so much to learn still to which is the most scary thing about him he hasn't even tapped into his branch all right you know and then the the really good guys in the 170-pound division that's like six or seven of them you know like this weekend there's six different killers that are fighting in Montreal you get Diaz's fighting George st. Pierre yeah Carlos Condit it's finding Johny Hendricks and Jake Ellenberger fighting Jake Shields I mean no no Jake Ellenberger is fighting damn it Nate Marquardt that's what yeah okay yeah that's Nate Nate Ellenberger and or Jake Ellenberger and Nate Marquardt is a sick fight that's uh is that all in the same cart yeah that's almost a card okay that's uh live from Montreal that's exciting how long have you MMA family Oh like UFC one really yeah yeah was a big big MMA fan and it was creating this crazy spectacle cuz that's the thing like wow what a ninja beat up a karate master and naik and then somebody said let's find out and put everybody together and I remember watching the early ones and you know this guy's a fifth-degree ninjutsu black belt and comes out just gets his ass handed to him and a lot of guy and I was excited cuz I was a wrestler and you were watching this early on and I'd never heard of brilliant jujitsu had no idea what these guys are doing but when the wrestlers would come in and just mop the floor with these dudes and it was exciting for me as justifying just like great yeah I took Taekwondo and like there's all these forms and I fully appreciate what you wanted as you guys do but these forms I don't get it it's gonna go fights gonna go to the ground anyways and you watch that in MMA and the fight would go to the ground the guys never do things in the ground with the guys who would win and so really got into it then and then when Dan Severn came out he's a Michigan boy and watching his fights with it and he was just you know awesome awesome to watch watching him watch fight a kickboxer and do full-on suplexes on guys who had no idea what a suplex was yeah effin it was beautiful so me and all my wrestling buddies would get together and watch doesn't just go apeshit we were just like we couldn't even get through one of those about beating the crap out of each other it was it was awesome and then to watch it come up and and what's happened since Dana has taken / it's just been it's just been one of the coolest things I've ever seen you know it's yeah it's very strange as you were talking about the size of football players changing over the period of 50 years like look at how much better the MMA fighters got in the 20 years that has existed yeah it's really shocking it's shocking to see now like like Diaz and George st. Pierre both of these guys there was nobody like them ten years ago they didn't exist nobody was that good these guys are on a complete this is the highest level we've ever experienced and every time st. Pierre improves like he you know just beat Carlos Condit had a long time off and recouping from his knee surgery he recovers from that and has the content fight a good solid long tough fight now just a couple months later he's going in there against Diaz I love that because I think you know since it's only like four months later or whatever it is he's got time to recover time to rest up a boom a little bit and then boom get right back into it so he'll be more use of the experience probably put on a better performance won't feel the ring rust as much just experienced it recently is that is that enough time for him to to analyze the other fighters style don't work it in because they're nervous on the trainings got to be he's gonna do this here's his tendencies when he puts his right foot forward this is what's gonna happen and you think four months is enough time for him to that guy's effing killer man he's both guys are killers but I think first of all st. Pierre has been ideas for a long time because they were supposed to fight before he has tested positive in a marijuana thing and you know it took him you know all this time before he was able to get a fight again after the Condit fight and so you know he's uh he's had some you know a bunch of a bunch of weird issues like outside of the cage and that one that one being a big one that they suspended him for a long time for for marijuana she's just really fucking ridiculous that really drives me bananas but he's been wanting this fight forever Diaz has been calling out for this fight forever and Georgina beer has been cage cyphers fights and talk to you about fighting them and so these guys have been sizing each other up for a okay it's not just for months to get ready right this is a long time coming we played this yesterday there's a video of Nick Diaz hitting the speed bag for 23 minutes in a row it's one of craziest things I've ever seen it just 23 minutes that is so long those folks have no idea how I keep my arms up for 23 minutes yeah I don't hit the bag and he's hammering at it I mean it's it's er it's these guys are both in the amazing amazing shape so I'm so excited about it not just because it's a championship fight because I think it represents these guys who are two all-time greats in my opinion and it represents them in their perfect primes you know they're both in the best situation they could possibly be Nick Diaz comes off the the BJ Penn fight where you you know fantastic performance the Carlos Condit fight where questionable decision and you know a close fight but Carlos Condit used a very good strategy of moving and keeping away from Nick and Nick you know has that aggressive in-your-face style he wants to commit to a fight and Jorge Jorge does not dance around he doesn't dance around and with his wrestling style as well it's gonna be a really interesting fight because first of all Nick dance has a nasty guard he's got very good sweeps he's got very good submissions off of his back and he gets real comfortable there he knows how to tie you up you know it's it's it's not an amateur that you have on his back and he's dangerous off his back you have to mind your P's and Q's and then you know it's is he gonna be able to stop the takedown if he does stop the takedown you know what does the stand-up look like does george kick them from the outside does Nick pressure them into a stand-up slugfest you know what what is it what does it become it's gonna be fascinating I can't wait excited for that fight yeah I'm very very excited for as well you were like one of the first guys that I ever heard of that took his books and put it on the Internet as an audio podcast but what led you to decide to do that I couldn't get a book deal too frankly going back I guess geez I guess 15 16 years I I was trying to get published for about 11 or 12 years writing writing a book every two years working a full-time job all the regular stuff and back in the day you know actually writing the submission letter and sending it the publisher sending it to agents going to conventions trying to meet make the right connections to get to get something look at the book then I got an agent and I wound up with a deal with the AOL Time Warner when my book earth Court was supposed to be in every store in May of 2002 and then the 9/11 recession hit before it went to press and the economy dropped in Time Warner scrapped everything that wasn't profitable so I I gotten to that point where I had a book deal then the publisher folded it happens and it took me three years to get the rights back to my book so now when I get the rights back in 2005 I have this professionally edited book the others name was Paul Witt Kover was a great guy it was a really I thought was a really solid piece of work and we can't get another book deal for it then I have learned about podcasting see what Dave Winer and Adam Curry are doing with podcasting and I'm Michael that's really cool serialized stuff so I went to look for audiobooks to listen to because the first thing that happen my head being a writer was somebody's putting out serialized ebooks just like the radio dramas the 40s and 50s I start googling it and after two days of trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong to Google it and I can't find any I then realized nobody has done this yet and at that point I'm like I've got a professionally edited book and it was ready for mass market production here's this new technology that if somebody hears an episode they can immediately instant message it to a friend email it to a friend chatroom it and anybody who clicks on that is gonna start hearing the story right away I've got speed-of-light marketing with this and word at speed-of-light word of mouth and then I'm like shit you know I figured out how to record how to make an RSS feed how to make a website and got it all done just so I could get it out there and then put some marketing to work like the first guy to ever do a podcast only novel and hope it would get picked up by some blogs and different sites and it did and I started to get a followership and when I got to the end of Earth core I had three other books done and I just started podcasting them and I've been going going on it ever since so I was of the mind that if the publishers are the gatekeepers and they won't let me in because it's not a Western it's not a horror story it's not a vampire story they want very specific things they can sell you've got a lot of different genres they don't like you very much I was like if I can get to the user if I can go to the end listener and show him how kick-ass my stuff really is I'm betting money that my shit is so good I can give it to you for free and then they'll still pay for it anyways that was a thought process and I thought I would get a lot of followers and a lot of followers would turn into a book deal initially that didn't happen cuz I was going to publish like I have 10,000 people listening to me every Sunday how can you not put this out and their questions well what's a podcast they had no idea what it was well here's verifiable stats they didn't they didn't know what the internet was they had no idea they didn't know what the internet was they I swear to god they didn't know what the effing Internet was and it was missed i I thought I had this awesome plan and everything's gonna work out great and I get to the point where I'm supposed to get the contract and get the book deal and they didn't care about the podcast at all so then I just kept on doing it eventually things kind of caught up finally at the end of the story is we put out that novel ancestor as a print book the one you've got is the one that's been rewritten for Random House but this was just a little little trade paperback put up by a small Canadian imprint one lady working out of her garage we put that out on April 1st 2007 and it was the number one whore number one sci-fi book in Amazon and it was the number two fiction book on Amazon behind one of the Harry Potter Potter novels Wow and New York crapped an eggroll I mean it was it was awesome cuz I had a new agent at that point who had the book infected on their desk and people this is it we like this is good then all sudden this guy that they've never heard of anywhere is number one in horror number one in sci-fi and then that got us into auction for infected and then I've been rolling ever since wow that's amazing what an awesome story yeah so you're sort of self created very very much upgraded there's a love stories like that a lot of it a lot of it is my my audience so a lot of the thing like when I was all right we're gonna go sell this book on this day spread the word and they went out spread the word and this is the audience that you created with this blog this is this podcast of your novels did you profit off of it how did you have it set up what did you have to pay for it to download it like no it's always been free from square one the whole book is free the whole book is free that the model we have now is if you just want it for free or you can't afford it and you like the story because everybody gets into pickles here and there you can listen to every episode every week and you can get the whole thing for free if you download a book I've done before you're gonna hear 30 episodes with an ad and before every episode just like what you do so it's gonna be ad supported free content and you can listen to it if you don't want to hear me talk before the episode you don't hear the ads then you can go spend money and buy the audiobook so I totally leave it up to the audience if you want to buy the printer buy the e-book you can do that you want to buy the audiobook absolutely that's why we're in business if you don't want to do that or you can't afford it you can go get all my books every word of it for free everything unabridged way it's been from square one that's a beautiful way to do it man yeah so that way you pay for the bandwidth costs and all that stuff through the advertising yeah everything we've covered everything the advertising and advertisings become a solid solid thing for us after seven years of doing pretty good with it but largely it's just the the the general attitude buying this whole thing has been I don't think anyone out there mind spending money for shit that they like the problem is when you buy that record or you buy that audiobook and you heard the sample and you like that was great then you get to the end of it and you're like this guy got lazy this this story ends crappy I have wasted my time I've wasted my money you're pissed off you're angry that you spent money on something that you didn't like so I flipped that like I'm gonna give it to you you're gonna listen to it and when you get to the end you are going to miss work and you were gonna go all night long and not not be able to sleep because I'm in your skull taken over and then when they get done like that I like that book I like the way that ended this is my author then they go by everything that I've ever made right and if people get to the end and they didn't like it it's no sweat off anybody's balls like penny thing on it's not really for me and it creates this sense of this crazy sense of goodwill that even people who don't really like your stuff as soon as they hear somebody else going oh you know I really like a hard science monster stories like oh you got to check out the Sigler guy and like it everybody loves the fact that you leave it up to the customer yes leave it up it's up to them their money you decide if you want spend it or not it's not up to me to trick you that's an awesome ethic I love that and that's sort of the same thing we do with this podcast we know there's some people have like they have where you sign up and you can pay X amount of money and access the old podcast and some of them have it set up or if you want to watch on Ustream you got to pay for a monthly thing but I've always felt like that what this thing does is so amazing is the word of mouth yeah and the best way to do that is to make it as accessible as possible to put it out there as quickly as easy and as timid to make it as downloadable as possible I mean if going back to Stephen King if Stephen King was to start doing a weekly podcast of his fiction and actually read his fiction he's he could charge for that and would make a significant amount of money for that he's realizing even Kings the worst guy ever to read his books are awesome but when he's reading him I'm like oh this motherfucker read books not a thing he's not an ace he's not he doesn't command it enough I don't know maybe you have a strong voice Stephen King has sort of I was like almost like a mumbly voice while he's reading his Ahri's more momily Ari would never be able to pull it off well the performance of the book I've had seven years to polish that up when I started out the first North course like I just used all the voices they used to used to make my buddies laugh in high school like I have no idea what I'm doing just throw it in there and we'll make it as entertaining as possible and I've always tried to be as make every book as over-the-top as it can be so there's a loud Rock intro loud Rock outros I'm you know peaking the meters when I'm talking and just trying to make it exciting and energetic and fun he's not just money it's people's time right you're gonna take an hour somebody's time you better have some good shit because they can't get that hour back ever dude you're saying all the like the right shit I love you that's how you should think man yeah I think it would be awesome if everybody thought that but the fries the the biggest thing is the freaking now there's so many entertainment options you know when Stephen King was coming up in the 70s there was a movies books and TV and that was all there was and now I got to compete against fucking Xbox and PlayStation and downloaded content and podcasts and vidcast and YouTube I got to compete against all that just to try and get somebody to get like yeah I'm gonna go and ask for 10 hours of your time to read this this book that doesn't really mean anything that's a tough sell today that's a super tough sell especially with that with younger kids because video games are amazing entertainment experiences you know it for you to get them to put that down and pick this book up for a while you've really got you got to bring good stuff how many hours do you think it would take to relay these books you think and read one of these in 10 hours I think somebody can read it at 10 to 20 hours yeah 10 to 20 debate my stuff reads a little fits it looks thicker than it is because there's an enormous amount of dialogue there's a lot of regular guy dialogue and that means like two three words line two three words line go faster people are surprised at how fast they read it like this giant honking thing they're like I can't believe I finished it so fast I'm like man there's a Norma's mother just died locked in there and this other book that I have here is ancestor yeah what's this one about ancestor is an effort by a biotech company to create a herd animal with transplantable human organs every year hundreds of thousands of people die because there's just not enough organs to go around and if you got a bad liver for you to live somebody else has to die it's a zero-sum game so they try and come up with a chimera it's a it's an animal with genes from multiple species so basically something along the lines of a sheep or a cow but with transplantable lungs liver kidneys everything a growing body could need if they can pull this off and put this thing out to pasture it's just like raising cows you just harvest them when you need them and you make trillions of dollars this is old-school horror movie sci-fi so something goes horribly wrong and instead of winding up with a 200 pound herd animal with the perfectly transplantable organs and is that goes out and eats grass they wind up with a 650 pound pack predator and this of course happens on a remote island in Lake Superior so we wind up with all of our all of our characters stuck on an island with with a hundred of these 650 pound pack predators that just go through you like they go through you like a knife through butter these things look like they uh they're not all that dissimilar from the American Werewolf in London we've got out out there but the biggest thing I did in the night kind of combined um a little bit of a bar a bear and a gorilla but the defining thing they have and fans draw tons of pictures of that see Google Ziggler and Sigler ancestor you'll probably see this they had this giant sailfin so they've got a variation on the Dimetrodon sailfin because it's based that the genome is based on the ancestor of all mammals the thought is if they read dial back the genetic clock let's get back to the base set of code then we will have exactly what I want and there won't be any endogenous retroviruses there won't be any crazy stuff we can then from there customize the animal we want right and they but they don't get it all the way right this thing is yeah that that's one of the things that says no predator scroll back over to the left that's not one of my fans did a full 4 foot tall knockout of the thing that's the monster right there and they had the sailfin that they keep back and you start to find out they start to use it for communication so they signal each other when they're closing in on you so if you see that fin pop up somewhere they're kind of like a Land Shark your effin screwed Wow we're pretty there fully uh they're fully CGI in the trailer you want to get the trailer around there that's yeah someone CGI this yeah my buddy Kevin capisi who's amazingly talented look for uh go to youtube and search for Sigler nocturnal trailer and so you're doing a movie of nocturnal but ancestor ancestor trailer excuse me yeah ancestor or this is gonna be a TV series what is going on with the ancestor nothing right now there have been a couple people who've been like killer yeah I do trailers for the books again trying to compete against YouTube you got to be on YouTube the thing with a book trailer is if you make a really kick-ass book trailer and it's the kind of thing that people will share the money you spend on that is money that will continue to work for you people will keep watching that for years someone dies while waiting for a heart a liver a kidney imagine a technology that could provide those organs for a fee and imagine what the company would do to monopolize that technology who biotech firm janata tried to solve this problem by creating the ancestor a creature with transplantable human organs but they didn't get the docile heard him they envisioned instead their work awakens something something evil something very you wanna wa not monopoly on human life nothing sells like life itself when we succeed we will be the only vendor and be able to charge whatever the market will bear for the millions of people not quite ready for death the market will bear there's my favorite part I don't know what that is that sure as fuck ain't no cow so you created that yourself I know we had people do the errand Proctor shot the thing but we went out and found a guy to do it and he got all his actor friends and put together in the CGI and we got we got permission from Century Media to use in this moment music for it we shot it like we shooting a five-minute movie we went out in the mountains and the snow and had an effing blast doing it but that kind of thing people still watch that you know we're from 30 40 50 times a day my trailer for infecteds at a quarter of a million views and it just keeps getting views so somebody's gonna watch that and that's exactly the kind of book they want then they go by the book it's the only form of marketing in the publishing industry that will continue to sell books through your year after year so we go on spend I spent a ton of money on my trailers what that's really interesting is just a common thing am I just it's getting a little ooh it's getting more common yeah and a lot of book trailers are they're awful it's a floating book cover with music and words floating in but there's people who go out and just shoot they mean they do full-on three four minute movies to try and sell the book if you see what these Brian have you ever seen one J yeah Wow I've never heard it that's fascinating we did the first one in 2008 and it was relatively unheard of now but it's more common now now as a professional writer and a man I need you to explain to me Fifty Shades of Grey what the fuck is going on it's the naughty factor I think it's it's a I think and I'm guessing here so I'm trying to figure out primarily that's a female readership trying to figure out the female mind which is not something on that gifted ad but priorit ending to be straight they might read that that I I don't know but I think number one it's it's it's not your usual sex scene this is some stuff we reading you be like oh my goodness say can you put that in a book yeah and then at some point it tipped and enough people had read it that it became okay you've got the hive mentality well got a million people have read this yeah that bad and then the other factor that I think everybody just ignores is I haven't read it but I it's probably a great book it does not sell that many copies unless that writing specifically appeals to the people who are buying it and they love the reading experience I think one of the reasons why women don't trust porn stars or strippers or or prostitutes or you know other women that you know will do things along those lines for money is because secretly I think there's a fear in the female community that all would have to happen would be just a few hundred girls start doing terrible things then they would all start doing it as sort of a mass movement and when a book like fifty Shades of Grey comes along and it's ball gags and you know all the crazy shit that they're doing that live in that book go back to the terrible part what's what's terrible about 200 girls going out and having a grand old time nothing terrible I mean yeah their own social norms of you know not wanting to be a slide and not wanting to be promiscuous and I think you know look like fifty Shades of Grey can just literally change culture oh yeah I'm sure you guys go to Sex in the City Sex in the City same thing yeah I bet they're I bet the sails of bondage instruments have gone up significantly since that book has come out well you think about women in like the 90s like before Sex in the City came along it was like sort of like there was no milf world there was no you know there was no people weren't like really turned on by really hot 50 year olds like that that didn't exist there was none of that and then all of a sudden it became okay and then all these women that were like over 40 was like fucking I'm getting divorced I'm gonna go get some dick yeah hang out my friends I don't like hanging out with men either somewhere along the line I realized their marriage is a big charade it's I think we're seeing more especially a lot of the porn stars being more open about what they do and going on their own podcast and talking about like yeah this is my job to do this is super fun people are accepting it more and more in a book like Fifty Shades of Grey hopefully the norms of our parents are going away and if somebody wants to go get laid and the other person is into it what's the problem nobody's getting hurt yeah unless your ball gags on real tight yeah it hurt well you know yeah like a lip strain sooner or later the autoerotic asphyxiations gonna kick he's gonna submit strangle get choked to death and that's sad whenever anybody dies from autoerotic asphyxiation I always smell foul play always like totally you were gonna figure out a way to discredit a guy like there was a preacher that died and he died he had a wet suit on he had a black dildo up his ass and he was doing auto-erotic asphyxiation yeah and he died and that guy I was thinking well you know what that guy's a priest who knows what kind of creepy shit he did you know probably not a stupid priest you know I mean come on he'd be very well stupid that's a good way to whack someone absolutely yeah but it's a good way I mean it's like as embarrassing as possible ya know the only difference is like you could make it a little worse by leaving like pornography around like gay porn or kiddie porn or some play he crossed me I'm gonna leave kiddie porn all around you you're gonna dive Otto's fixation mop mafia threatening metal make something straight now well they said that's what happened with David Carradine I know that I hurt and I thought the same thought when that happened I'm like I don't give a shit what anybody does in their own private time but I'm not buying that he crossed someone he had to have crossed someone or owed somebody money or something because it was just nuts well the rumor was and there were some organized crime involvement in his death that was the the room but the rumor somebody easily could have just made that up I mean this there's so many goddamn rumors is so implausible that that you do that and never never try it maybe it's a greatest thing ever I'm never gonna supposed to be awesome but it's not my cup of tea yes the skydiving supposed to be great - I'm not gonna do that Brian's dad was trying to get talked into skydiving tell that story yeah his friend was always like hey you gotta go skydiving with me guy goes diving skydiving with me and then one day she hurt her her parachute got tangled up with her emergency parachute she died and this was like a week before he was gonna go skydiving with her yeah so yeah not for me now did he find out by just going to work and she wasn't there yeah not not for me more power to people want to do it but not not for me I avoid the crazy life-threatening stuff yeah that's a that's a funny one the skydiving ones a really funny one it's like you want that big adrenaline rush wait till they come up with virtual skydiving that sounds like it's gonna be pretty badass well there's little fan things some pretty fun have you ever done one of those where you're like over that big fan and you're just like floating any problems amazing yeah it's yeah they have one of the universal we should do it one day yeah that'd be great hey you fly yeah just like a technique to it too apparently cuz if you do it a certain way you can't fall does that give you the same drastic fight-or-flight response though as looking out you know jumping out of a plane you're like if anything goes wrong I'm gonna die like that's the thrill I got a thing for these people yeah absolutely that's that's a big part of it yeah it's it's the part that people don't want to they don't want to sort of admit it it's a thrill what's the thrill part well the thrill is that you're almost dying yeah you're gonna you're gonna add bungee jump it's the same thing your body is reacting like it's going to die and you're tricking that yeah but not really like you're pretty sure it's not going to so it's not a full on I'm gonna die moment well you only make that mistake once then it's very all set yeah we're weird with our manipulation of our fight-or-flight responses the things we do with wing suits and shit like that you know organized Fighting's the same thing you are you are channeling that base primitive instinct to establish dominance over another member of your species it's just the all of the things that used to go with that in primitive times are gone and it's just down to that one instinct you are going in there to test your mettle against another person and and see if you can beat them if you can establish dominance on them that's that's all that stuff is and the guys who are the best at establishing dominance of the guys who rise to the prominence in their in their sport we're starting to see younger and younger guys retire as well that's good well is it they're retiring because they've already got damaged or they're retiring ahead of damaged well everybody's got a certain amount of damage that's the reality the reality is if you've done some hearts barring you've got damaged let's just know it doesn't seem like there's any getting around that I mean how much of it recovers after you know a couple months how much is a couple weeks how much is never depends I've seen fights where guys got beat up and they were never the same guy again they just weren't though they're missing something they were at if they were at 10 before they were eight now right you know and that was where they were now and they could have a fairly successful career but they would never be ten again now that's something the NFL is facing because they've got you know a hundred years of results to look at but for something like the UFC which is new you wonder at what point does it come in when they start to do we need to increase size the gloves or outlaw some of the various and actually is less safe that's the bigger gloves is because they hit harder no the beard gloves there's two issues with them one is that you don't break your hands as much so right you could pretty much punch a guy anywhere okay not always some guys have fragile hands even with the big gloves like Floyd Mayweather he's he's had several operations on his hands because he kept kept breaking them whereas the MMA gloves are smaller and you can't take as many shots with them the bigger gloves you can take more punches and in fact it's not really necessarily the concussive blows that do a lot of brain damage it's the just the constant sub-concussive trauma that is the it's the real issue so there's a guy named Nick Denis who was a MMA fighter who just retired I believe he was a pre-med student I think but very very smart guy nonetheless whatever his educational background was but that was his concern was the sub sub concussive trauma so yeah yeah you start thinking like why can't I remember where I put my fucking car keys like is that normal absent-mindedness or am I missing a gear now and that's that's a it's it's still safer than boxing I mean by far right you supposedly yes because boxing has less options for one you don't you can't clinch in a boxing match you're not supposed to you can't take the guy to the ground if you're stuck in a situation you as far as repetitive head trauma goes though it depends I mean how your training how your training is what's really important because a lot of boxers who are very smart they don't train that hard or as far as sparring they don't spar hard they spar like they'll they'll get good sparring partners no you know box it like a 50 60 % ratio you know they don't they don't try to murder each other whereas there's a lot of MMA gyms where guys are trying to murder each other and that not said it doesn't take place in boxing because there's some camps where it certainly does but for the most part if you're watching a high-end boxing camp where there's a lot of money on the law they're having good hard sparring but there they're also working they're working on you know a guy imitating a certain guys style or you know putting a certain amount of pressure on a fighter or whatever you know in a high-end camp if you're dealing with you know Floyd Mayweather camp or somewhere along you know anywhere in that range you're dealing with it they have a strategy to it in MMA you have a bunch of gems like that but then you also have a massive amount of gems where people are sort of making it up as they go along and they think the harder you go the better it is so let's go hardware we're badasses we're going hard every day and they'll go hard even to the head like we had bas Rutten on yesterday he was talking about a holland style of sparring they would go full blast the body into the legs butt to the head they would pull punches because they realized you know you're damaging each other in a lot of the less experienced MMA gyms or the less well structured MMA gyms they don't realize that and so they they're punching each other full blast in the face and training and they're fucking each other up Wow yeah and then add up it adds up yeah there's no way it doesn't add up this is like you'll get a guy like Alistair Overeem he's been stopped something like nine times maybe even ten I think this might be the tenth time he's been stopped in his career in that big foot fight mmm and that's a lot of times man it's a lot of times of the fight being stopped from you getting punched too many times well you're just gone you know that's yeah yeah that's supposed to get nine of those in your life right I don't think you're supposed to get one actually two nothing has an awful lot yeah and you watching you watch it affect after a few those who watch it start to affect their ability to fight they're not they're not the same guy out there but certainly does and especially if they're not involved in any testosterone replacement therapy mm-hmm because one of the things about the all that trauma is there's been a lot of studies that show that it starts to shut down your testosterone like multiple concussions hmm then it shuts down it does it does a lot of damage to your pituitary apparently the pituitary is quite sensitive to concussive blows and when you get blasted a bunch of times they've shown that it starts to lower your testosterone and start to make guys depressed you know it's one of the things that makes you depressed yeah but it's a scary thing especially for a guy like you I'm sure who's you make your living with your mind yeah well I I'm just gonna get back into some like MMA boot camp and stuff and I did a little Krav Maga San Francisco had an MMA course and I was having a ball doing that but I was not not gonna get hit in the head like that's good that's my this is my business and then when I actually did spar I got hit about three times and never saw a punch I'm like it I don't process that whatever you just did I didn't see anything let's go back to grappling grappling I can do all goddamn day long but I don't see punches so I'm out yeah well the key is you got to do only with people you really totally trust yeah you got to do it it's it's hard if you do it with strangers or if you do it with a guy who's got a chip on his shoulder something some guys you just tag them lightly and all of a sudden you're in a war oh right you know yeah that can happen and you know what do you do do you stop the sparring partner and stuff most of time guys don't most time they just engage in the war with the spark right now you don't stop them and say hey what are we doing here we're not because you don't trust him now because now he's swinging at you full blast it happens all the time you know that was that's I think that was one of the biggest problems in MMA in the early days of you know mixed martial arts camps was guys getting beat up too much in the gym right before they ever even got into the cage right but yeah I don't it makes you wonder what that and that's one of those things I get into the hot net that galactic Football League series I I told you about is size speed and strength continue to increase now we're seeing things in the NFL where it's just it's basic physics and you can put all the padding you want around a guy unless they do something drastic to improve that helmet mmm when you get more the more force that is on bigger faster stronger bodies are gonna produce more force that brain bounces around inside the head yeah and when you project football players out to the four and five hundred pound size and fighters up to the 400-pound size it's something you try and try and get into that in the fiction itself too is like what what is the average career like when you're getting hit on a regular basis by something that can benchpress 1500 pounds and can run 30 miles an hour career is like through three seasons tops and you're just a vegetable there's nothing you can unless you get in the head and create some kind of additional structure between the brain and the skull there's only so much that they can do other than change the rules to stop so much damage did you in your fiction ever create some other sort of protective wear that people would wear or did you eschew it altogether which is what a lot of people think would be the solution to stop a lot of the head-butting each other and smashing heads will be given to the helmets that the first time I heard that I'm like that's the dumbest thing I ever heard of and then then I started to think about a little bit like you know rugby does not have the same it's not the same kind of contact rugby you do not get a 15-yard head start and take someone out of the picture right but a very rough and very physical and yet they don't take the impact I do reckon football players do I do some some of the magic hand waving with that I'm like well this new helmet technology protects against this much and then these don't you don't explain it because if we could explain it we would be doing it right now so there it is taken into account but the main character Quentin Barnes it's a seven book series we've got four books done and by book five he's already starting to feel the effects of you know I stand in the pocket and if I do my job right sometimes I'm getting rid of the ball and standing there when something that weighs 800 pounds is hitting me as hard as it can that's what you get paid to do and if it's gonna start impacting him so I'm excited about that the last three books start to get into character analysis what happens one one eight the ultimate professional athlete the top of his game things daren't are processing is fast anymore you can't make the decisions as quick as he couldn't his reads aren't quite as good as they were before and his body starting to hurt so follow him all the way from a nineteen year old rookie through this league to the point where he's like it's some point he's gonna have to make a decision do I continue to play and do what I love and die doing what I love which is admirable and gonna die anyway so why not or do you look to the future and be like what are the next 40 years my life gonna be like so it's gonna be it's a huge influence in the book as to what's gonna happen when you stop and think about what an actual football player today a 310 pound man who can run like like literally like a track star of the 1930s yeah you know when you stop and think about the kind of damage they can do and you sort of look towards the future and extrapolate a thousand years from now 2,000 years especially when this drastic changes happened just the last 5060 years its unbelief that out and of course there's genetic and physical limitations but as Jeanette as nutrition improves in science and proves and genetic engineering proves you're gonna wind up in the future pro sports a couple centuries now pro sport you not I mean they're not even gonna look human if you look like a different species that's how I came up with the idea for the book is I used to be loved I used to do a little stuff for ESPN when I was in college like manage the team swimming off the field or hold the dish and that kind of a thing and I has you know I was 126 pounds and Michigan Michigan State's a giant football game every year it's huge ESPN is there and my producer al Killian I'm on the headset with him and he's got me bringing the teams out of the out of their dressing room and then he starts screwing with me because I'm 19 I don't know any better and he's in my ear he's gone listen if they don't come out at the right time ESPN is gonna lose five million dollars of advertising and that's gonna be on you and I'm like he was fucking me because he could cuz I didn't know any better and I'm like so stressed out and then let Michigan State out of the locker room at the point of time and all these giant human beings are coming out and then as they're coming out they're running walking by the door to the Michigan locker room Michigan door locker room door opens up and standing in the doors Greg scrap knack you ever heard of him no he was six eight three three six two it was he was it was a giant giant man plus he's got all the gear on and I'm on and I'm like and I'm a little tiny thing I'm freaking out I'm like oh I held Michigan's gonna come out he's like you don't let them come out of that locker room I don't care what you have to do and so I he's giant he's six foot eight I'm five eight I'm 125 pounds and and he goes to step out and I just put my hand right right on the sternum I just stiff-armed and what stop right there you guys can't come out of that locker room yet and just he looked confused I was like who is this little person and he managed to wait and all the guys were behind him and he managed wait just long enough for Michigan State to come out then I got out of the way and they came out but I had I wrote the whole concept of the book in that one moment the whole GFL series I had my hand on this guy's here my nose came up to his sternum and I remember thinking it's like he's a completely different species than me yeah and that was and after that I went home and started writing that book like what if we had different species playing football and the whole thing blew up from there Wow that's awesome yeah they really are like completely different species if you're dealing with those super athlete football players I mean we're getting some really enormous enormous human beings now in the combine I read I may have read this incorrectly they had three guys three offensive linemen 310 pounds who ran for six 40s if I stand still and they run at me and hit me like that I am dead on impact that's how much force is involved I'm just dead there's nothing you can do it's crazy I wonder how many of these up-and-coming players are more aware of the risks now because of the past few years all the different stories that have been coming out about players depression most post career suicide I think the veterans probably are but you know when you are 22 years old and someone's paying you hundreds of thousand dollars to play football and that's been your dream your whole life you're still 22 and you're bulletproof I think that the rules have to come in to adjust behavior it has to be run from the top down because these these you know you were 22 and there's if I was playing in a fellers nobody could tell me anything I'm gonna go hit that motherfucker as hard as I possibly can that's how I make my that's how I make my money that's how people know me because I'm the guy who brings the heat it's not is it's never gonna stop from the players themselves yeah and you start to think if I get hurt I'll get out but I won't get hurt too bad I'll be smart they also you know try and remember back to that age there is this rationalization of maybe I'll get hurt and won't be quite as smart I'm willing to pay that price in order to have this moment right now I'm willing to give up years down the road and at 22 23 24 that is a perfectly rational logical decision you're like this this makes sense to me it's not till you get 20 years down the road like boy I'm glad I didn't get any brain damage that would suck right now yeah it's also a thing when you're 22 and you love playing football yeah that's another thing it's a very fucking exciting thing to do as it has is MMA fighting as is you know a lot of bumps or motocross riding there's a lot of crazy dangerous things that we'll really enjoy doing and ultimately that's really our choice right should we should have that across the board we're hardwired to go out and seek that kind of danger evolutionarily speaking we're hardwired to go out like we have to go get into life-and-death situations to hunt to defend to fight off other tribes and the people who have those instincts are the people who wound up living and reproducing and passing that on so as a you know 18 to 27 year old male you are hardwired for war that is what and a lot of guys aren't that's cool but a lot of guys have that that's what they inherited it's like let's go out and kill some shit like that's in you I had that in me I wasn't very good at his I was so small wrestling was a good outlet but you know you know what that feeling is like and and these kind of activities provide a safe rational outlet for those things but it's in there and it's gonna come out one way or another yeah for a lot of men so I mean and then again like as you said some don't have it in them yeah for a lot of men yeah that's it's a real issue because it's sort of just you have a whole reward system set up in your DNA that you have no control over and you have all these things that you enjoy and you know there's very little outlet for it when you're working in a cubicle and it's hard it's hard to make your body free of the influence of all these anything there's things that can't be rationalized there's just things you cannot explain away like when I when I used to wrestle and finally got to compete against people my own size cuz I played football too and played as hard as I could and did everything and couldn't I got my ass kicked I weighed 120 125 pounds when I wrestled going up against guys my own weight I was able to you know dominate people and and just things like a crossface or and it's uh you know it's kind of mean to say guess one of the greatest feelings of my whole life is a suplex the kid and broke his collarbone and when I when I brought him up put him back heel and his collarbone and broken he just stuck there and it was utterly primitive it was just you know well why would you be happy you just hurt another human being he was a good guy I know I'm he's a nice guys but when I bet that for that brief moment all that all the chemistry inside everything else is like ah that's how you do it does that help you when you're writing when you're writing something like ancestor when you're writing about this crazy gigantic pack predator I get into it I get into it a ton especially in the new book pandemic the thought process is we are modified by society we have set of rules that we live by a certain camaraderie helping out our fellow man helping our fellow women you know in our growing culture the growing equality of women and and there's no need to be a douche bag 'la by and large you don't need to be a douche bag thing you get along just fine being a good guy and then take these people who are aspiring to become these better people who are genuinely good people and then put them in the pressure cooker when you start to get into it and it's like you and me Joe we're both in this room but if I get out that door I'm gonna live and you're gonna die and if we both here stay here together we might both die and there's a tiny chance of that's what I play with a lot Israel what what does a person do when their life is actually on the line and their commission they have absolutely no control over do we regress to that lizard brain do we start looking out for number one and I don't get into it too much like I don't you protect your kids you protect your family there's a guy you've known for 20 years you two are gonna you know you're going down together but it's it's largely when the strangers are brought together get a small amount of time to gel to get to know each other so it's not completely alien its itself it's it's one of my group then bring in the 650 pound pack predators what happens what do these characters do that sounds awesome man I'm gonna read this I can't wait to read it sounds like a
