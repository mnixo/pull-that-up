oh hey fella what do you got there what is that legal marijuana and your hands see what a closer look you activists you I'm such a radical man the streets are not safe when I'm out on the loose radical seem like a regular guy yeah yeah regular guy with a irregular amount of stress The Walrus right there dude you don't mind mind putting it there no no not happy to come back and see it no it stays on the desk yeah this means as much to us as anybody except for you well it's nice to see it this is my this is my happy place this is my safe place yeah I got to travel across the country to be safe but it's a it's certainly a pleasure to be here again enjoy always have to thank you I listen I thank you too I was texting Whitney today I said you're a hero you're a legitimate hero for people don't know what this is all about I'll give everybody the backstory Phil used to work at Marineland he was an orca trainer and he also trained a walrus named smoochy smoochy is still allegedly in captivity at Marineland all those no photographic evidence but you're pretty sure she's still there I was told that she is still there and she's in good shape and I'm hanging on to that since you came on the podcast the first time which was how many years ago No so six years ago a thousand thirteen so he's been living this lawsuit life for six years trapped in a lawsuit with a gigantic corporation with incredible amounts of money that's been trying to crush him and they've made up stuff well tell me what what's happened give give me your your perspective on how it all was back in 2012 I made I was forced to make a very difficult decision I elected to speak out against the conditions of which marine lands animals were living in I did so knowing the risks knowing that marine life was a litigious company but I did so on account to the fact that the animals were suffering incredibly before quitting I had an agreement with Marineland that look I'm leaving this is long before I'd spoke out I'd spoken out I'm leaving but you know we have to establish that I can maintain this relationship with the walrus because she I am printed on her it's important to stress that that she thinks I'm her mom she was a baby she was a baby when she came in so she was wild caught and you can imagine probably witnessed her mother get slaughtered that's the that's the method of collecting babies by the by the captors in Russia and so she comes in traumatic at the age of we estimate about 18 months of age which is pretty old in fact for in our experience I Marine lands experience of acquiring these wild cut baby walruses and through a sort of traumatic experience with her that I was there with her this anomalous thing happened where her brain circuitry opened up and much like in the wild where in the case of herd animals the babies become familiar with the mothers sound sense look everything all the senses are acute they're aware of who they of where they are so that they can you know find each other amidst these thousands of animals well this happened to her so the brain circuitry opens suddenly I'm imprinted on her I wasn't prepared to leave marine land unless it was of the understanding that I can continue to help her because historically my relationship with her you know had everything to do with her health and well-being I quit with the understanding with marine land this was to be the case I'd been gone for a month I come back unannounced they don't want to let me in they're hiding something I get in I see her she's in terrible shape I snap a few photos I leave now amidst this you see terrible shape what do you mean she was emaciated she was bone dry she hadn't eaten in my having been gone a month was the longest she and I have ever actually been physically apart I'd been trying to wean my presence off of her so that other trainers who would be able to maintain a healthy you know healthy diet for her healthy life she was emaciated because she wasn't eating because of stress I wasn't there for that month I can't say but she was certainly not eating she super-skinny they had of course on a bunch of drugs which include psychotics valium antidepressants I when I saw her my jaw hit the floor it's important to note that during this some newspapers had been calling they wanted to know why I quit if we back up a little bit it should be noted that in 2007 my relationship with smooshy sort of took off in the early sort of internet viral days and whatnot we made front page of like CNN and Jimmy Kimmel did a piece and so there was sort of that backstory of the and I guess you would call it a fluff celebrity type thing but nonetheless my having left started people started asked questions I started feeling calls from this newspaper who was looking it was keen on doing an investigation of Marineland so I wasn't gonna participate I had no interest again stressing marine lands litigious history and also look I've got this relationship with a walrus that I I sort of have to maintain I have to really have to keep this relationship with marina and healthy enough so once I'd realized they weren't holding out of that end of the bargain you know the panic sets in I'm a first-time mom it should be stressed so I I basically called the newspapers and I said you put my face my name and it doesn't matter you just print it let's go let's let's get the story out story gets out well Marineland as expected starts their lawsuits they'd it's like a it's almost like a scorched earth they take a scorched earth sort of method and this was when the original owner was alive yes it's no longer alive he died he died last year in in June in fact so years into this litigation so they sued me they sued me for a million five they sued my girlfriend they sued other activists they sued newspapers they they're suing everybody the mistake they made is in all of their absurd allegations that they've yet six and a half years into into litigation yet to prove any of it they cannot it's never gonna happen it doesn't exist it's a fictitious lawsuit it's full of lies and bullshit bottom line the mistake they made is they sued me for plotting to steal smooshy that's where the headlines take off and they also called me the Kanye West of animal training yeah I got your attention on the Internet that's not how you got my I said the Kanye West part didn't get right well no you said they called you the tweet was I said Joe you just say when I'll book a flight to come to LA I sent you the link to the to the story the headline was Kanye West of animal training being sued for plotting to steal a walrus you wrote they called you though what and then you slip the DMS and said dude if you're ever in LA I said you just say when well I started reading the story when I started I've you know I wrote a piece a long time ago on my blog and I talked about it in one of my comedy specials that I had a crazy experience with dolphins once when I was really really high and I had this I mean it's it sounds silly to even talk about but I almost feel like I kind of understood that they're like us but they just don't alter their environment well I realized like when they were playing with us and they were jumping by the boat and they were looking at you they're looking at you why they were jumping around with the boat and I was like they're playing and they're looking at you like a person would like a water person interacting there's almost a language at this point there's some level of bridged gap in the communication when you get to see that they're expressing themselves in interest in you and what not and scoping you in when you get really close and established a relationship with these animals that's when things start getting real squirrely because you start to find that happy medium language and now all of a sudden you are starting to sort of speak so to say yeah well I started getting really weird feelings about SeaWorld and and an animal captivity like this what why do we need that in this day and age like this isn't the Dark Ages we shouldn't be putting whales and orcas and dolphins putting them in these tanks these fucking water swimming pools they're fucking swimming pools and you have these things that are probably as smart as us in some different way like we're so prejudiced in that we only think of intelligence is something that can manipulate its environment that's our problem like we'll like look at them their bitch a swirl they don't have any houses they can't write a letter they they're fucking stupid man stop it they're stupid but the Dolphins apparently have a cerebral cortex it's um something around 40% larger than human beings they have super complex languages their emotional intelligence is the mystery and it appears that it's far beyond anything we ourselves can understand as same as orcas they've got that they've got another part of the brain in the front which is that it's function in that the front of the cerebral cortex that function is - as for communication and for and for it and it enhances their emotional capacity to a point where we don't really know the depth of which they are the power of their emotion but we know that they stay with their families for their lifetimes the males born from from the mothers will rarely leave the mother's side quite literally the distance of an orca itself the only time that male will go on is when it's matured it will go - so it's procreate and then back to the mother and it will live its entire life as such and the sad fact about that is in my experience working with male orcas caught from one of which caught from the while the big bull Orca is he was a mama's boy you can see something was missing he was traumatized from something and of course even myself as a regarded whale expert in the capacity of working at a freaking place like marine land even I would have never known this information when I started this this is not information that was available to us back and I started in 2000 it makes sense now this animals traumatized from birth he's his will to live is just gone it and the male it appears to me and in my experience the male sex of well I've worked with seals I've worked with sea lions I've worked with walruses dolphins belugas and orcas all of them died younger the males die younger and I think definitely in the orcas and in the Dolphins cases is they just don't have that will to live without that strong turtle figure in their life this is what I try to explain to people that don't see it and I think that the Dolphins get treated well or the orcas get treated well this is what it imagine if someone stole your son and put him in an air box at the bottom of the ocean and dolphins and whales and fish just came by and stared at him imagine and he lives his life like that with no contact other than with his his dolphin handlers or whoever's taking care of him and he just lives in this box missing his family missing his loved ones missing his life and feels lost and with with a language that is especially with orcas and dolphins they have a language it's so complex we haven't been able to really decipher it we don't understand how it works you know John Lilly spent they spent I think decades working on trying to get dolphin to speak human noises he had a bunch of studies that he did and he even had a dice it's a crazy story I'm sure you've heard it on the woman who lived with the dolphin she she'd tried to establish a relationship with the dolphin where she they made an apartment that was half underwater but the dolphin always wanted to fuck so she just jerked the dolphin off and when she jerked the dolphin off that was the only thing that calmed him down and then she'd do her work so for her it was just like a technicality I just got a jerk this dolphin off it's an animal it wants to be rubbed all the moral stuff that's attached to that is all in my own head she's like I'm just gonna be a scientist and they were like guys get that fuck what I think they were also injecting ketamine into the Dolphins or something I do not know if they were doing that into dolphins but I do know that they did some experiments with LSD and that John Lilly who was one of my personal heroes he's the creator of the floatation tank this was all John Lilly stuff he was a pioneer in interspecies communication he would take acid and think that he was communicating with dolphins did you know you're on the cover of one of his books what yes we talking about your face is I mean it's it's a spitting image on in one of his books one of Lilly's books yeah maybe this appears in time traveler shit dude I'm sorry how is that that's fucking weird man that's fucking weird yeah Wow so that's pro grant read that what does it say something human bio-computer yeah I didn't read that one I read the deep self the deep self is really interesting and the deep self i think the deep self is the one that also has diagrams on how to build a tank he was trying to get people to build tanks he was like listen man I found some shit out you gotta try this the last time when I was here not the last time two times ago you actually sent me to crash yeah man crash I have to crash the float lab and he you know I thought I'd be in there for an hour turns I was in there for a couple and when I came what I'm like dude was waiting for the knock just like let you stay in there like oh shit look at the time crashes a little like a legit hippie yo yeah he's great he's the mad scientist behind float lab yeah that's why those things are so well engineered when I met him I was like what I was like cuz I tanks before that when I I first got a tank in like 2002 somewhere around then 2002 2003 and it was it was great but it was like it would break things would go wrong it flooded my basement it was like there was disasters it was it and then my friend who was a tank technician there's actually tank technicians he said listen you gotta get to check out this guy in Venice so some mad scientist down there in Venice was just making these super over-engineered float tanks and he was they look like walking meat lockers right oh my god you had like a pod install I had it was a very good tank it's just that uh it just it wasn't as well constructed it also wasn't nearly as expensive just he went the distance he went the distance and he still keeps coming over here I've got to change things I got a we're upgrading we're doing that he's like he's always for him enhance the experience for everyone yeah he's always trying to make it better he's the front of the line and when I first started working with him like when I first started having him on the podcast and and I hired him to build me a tank and all that chance like there was no tanks it was it was real rare that you'd find tank centers now they're fucking everywhere man they're everywhere I'll say this the experience I had in his tank versus the one that I'd there's a local place from where where I'm from was hands-down at different events because he really isolates you there was this was like a pod that they bought and installed in a room I mean it was great this is super insulated so there's no fucking noise getting in that thing he gave me the tour of the whole backstage too I was all back to check it shit I was like wow it's got a serious complex there it's hard to appreciate but when he first started making tanks like that which look again I think I bought one of his tanks in 2005 I think somewhere around then dude but there was no one making anything like that he's making this super high-end crazy fucking double wall insulated tanks and you get in there it's just yeah just nothing and you just you just get taken into the I this in it's a good place to think about the subject that we're talking about today we got to stop doing that with dolphins and orcas it's gonna be thought of the same way we think about slavery today it's her that it's horrific we can't understand that we can't believe that compassion and human beings would be willing to isolate members of a super social highly intelligent animal species and just put them in swimming pools it's fuckin barbaric it's crazy it's torture it's it's what's sad here is you know we're years removed from the documentary blackfish yeah and you know that was really impactful I mean arguably responsible for the paradigm shift that we're that we're experiencing here in North America and other places of course but maybe it's time for people to revisit it I know SeaWorld their stock and their value is sort of going up now granted they you know they changed their numbers they skew it they have free beer day they pump the numbers up you know they have all these different promotions whatever I mean everything that comes out of these these facilities these assume it to be all bullshit by the way it's all bullshit but not enough people question them on it but as we speak while we're amidst sort of a paradigm shift here and I mean I can speak to it because I mean I'm very happy to say that we have very effectively decimated Marineland and we'll talk more about that but over in China this is now a burgeoning business and I and I did we discussed this a year and a half ago and it's it's tenfold now it's happening very quickly and I'm sure you're familiar with the whale Jail situation in Russia have you seen that no I'm not they've got enclosed in this Bay they've got over a hundred wild cat belugas and orcas so there's about ten orchids if I'm not mistaken and some activists flew a drone over it this got worldwide attention a lot of outcry a lot of anger of course so what happened was Jamie show us right now for the folks that are listening and we're looking down at what looks like swimming pools with I guess those are belugas those have all been sold those are essentially sold and ready to go to China but on account to the fact that the activists got this and created a real worldwide stink all the negative press that came of it they've now resolved that they wanna try to well they've they've hard considered releases the governor in the area signed a intent to release agreement with the world sank with the whale sanctuary project who sent a team to assess the animals health and whatnot and this was all of like three weeks ago it's not a long time ago and they assessed that all these animals should be released there's a couple of issues there's a couple of things that that are becoming conflicting a it's going to require a lot of cost if it's done responsibly be it appears ok so what's happened is as we know Russia is not exactly a democratic environment only one person makes the decisions on account of what becomes of these whales whereas there was some PR stunts to say hey we're gonna we want to release them we want to do this to sort of mitigate the global outrage the captors have propagandized this entire effort to free these whales as a means for the West to undermine the Russia's Russia's economy so the whale trade economy here's where Marineland comes into play in a theory at this point but it has these very intense implications what we know about what Marineland is doing currently in their transition from brilliantly successful business to virtually decimated thank you is there shipping there whales out we know two are going out if it's not this week it'll be very soon I'll be shocked if they're not out I'm in LA so I can't say that it's happening right now I think it may be very well be happening this week they're going to Spain we know that five other permits have been requested to send these animals now to the states so is that they're liquidating their the intent that they're going through liquidating but the issue is if in fact Russia catches wind that marine land is sent sending their whales but let's use the worst-case scenario to China it validates the Russian captors propaganda and concerns suddenly what we're concern is going to happen is those animals suddenly Putin says forget it sell them ship them out that's that's a scenario but why would you do that because again the the captors are propaganda is that the West wants to cripple the Russia's economy their wild whale sale economy so if marine line is selling whales to China from Canada and then suddenly the captors have a point they'll say the Putin look there they're selling whales why is it such an outrage that Russia is doing it when marine lands doing it hmm so there's that concern the other one and this just came up with in the last twenty hours is it appears rather than go the most responsible route which we know is going to be a costly endeavor but you know we're game and we're ready is there now considering just dropping the nets and saying see you later and letting all the animals go here's what we suspect they're gonna let the orcas go because they were captured illegally there's some gray area as to whether the beluga whales have been captured illegally or not so I think it'll probably start with the orcas rather than move them to where they were at the same time of year when they were captured so that they can be next to their putt they're Trent transient pods or their their their pods they just want to drop this this net and say see you later well that's as responsible as it can get but that's crazy it's like making someone a slave for how many years well here's somewhere on the planet but imagine their hope you can imagine would be OC it didn't work Jesus there's a lot of there's a this is a big issue we're on it there's a there's a great team of activists over there would it be accurate to say that maybe what these groups are doing right now is recognizing that there's probably gonna be some radical changes in the way these things are permitted what's legal what's not legal and what people are tolerating is just not the same as it was ten years ago catch them and sell in as fast as you can yeah I just get out while you can because it might come a point in time well not only could they not sell it but they might be responsible for doing exactly what you said and bringing it back to the area where its family would be it did which would be an incredible cost it'd be an incredible cost it would be an undertaking unlike any other rescue that we know of and how much would something like that cost I can't even imagine I mean I would be the wrong person to ask I can't put a figure on it I just know that it would take a lot of time there would be a lot of dedicated I mean we would need a vest a pod yeah you'd have to figure those that would be able to bring the whales out I mean and you would have to be able to somehow or another get it close enough to the other worlds without freaking them out it's a whole thing but it's possible I mean that's the important part of fuck man the whole it's just one of those things that I really think as people were gonna look back on and we're gonna go man how did we in 2019 not know that that was insane does that is not a chicken you know I'm saying I mean it's not like something you could just keep in a cage that's dad so let's back up to as you know it for well over four and a half years five years now I've been advocating for Bill s 203 which is AB and against which is a national connect Canada wide ban against whale and dolphin in porpoise captivity so that would include no more breeding no more important more export and that okay during these this by the way is going down as the longest bill ever researched in Canadian history because it's been a lot of issues from opposition a one one senator in particular in fact if I can have a moment to just give senator Don Platt a big ole I win you piece of shit which camera do I look at for that I win you piece of shit so I should I should be more humble but was that the other guy this is me no no this is the senator that has put every possible Block in front of the passage of this bill he's tried to kill it silently forever I mean this is an epic epic story we've had to as activists and the community at large and again I have to stress how much you've had a hand in this is I've had to read I've had to have these campaigns where we literally flood the Senate servers to the point of crashing it on a couple of instant instances where they were gonna kill the bill very silently through a sort of procedure he's got as uh his role is a is called the Senate whip so he actually yields a lot of influence and power he creates the committee's where people do the studies and everything he sets the the dates for the committees I mean he had this thing studied for like seventeen straight months it was absurd again longest tenure in in Canadian legislative history it appears but this guy was you know doing his so he kill it do you think that what do you think like why was he doing that he's one of these guys who looks at this bill and he sees it as a activist sort of left-wing Liberty you know liberal sort of fluff bill he doesn't see that it's necessary he went to Marineland as an invited guest he's very publicly declared his friendships for John holder I don't want to speculate as to whether there's been any money exchanges but I know he's certainly very interested in killing this bill and by virtue alone of activists pressuring and exposing all of his as efforts we actually saved this bill on a number of occasions the most notable of which was just a few weeks ago we're in the House of Commons it appeared this bill was going to die and literally at the eleventh hour I packed up we drove to Ottawa I had a tweet storm we put pressure on I tweeted individual senators are rather individual members of of Parliament and I promise them and you know this is a sensitive time in Canadian politics for Justin Trudeau the leader of the Liberal Party I promised them if this bill dies on account of the fact that what was happening was the Liberals were gonna propose amendments to the bill at the last second that would send it back to the Senate for further review at which point we know Don Platt was waiting in light to kill it there was nothing we could do at this point this was going to be his to kill the fact that this was being facilitated by liberals was really an infuriating thing but nonetheless we applied an incredible amount of pressure I drove my ass down there I got that I stood in front of every which one of them and I look them all in the eyes I'm just like I'm gonna make you famous I'm gonna make you famous and I'm gonna make you famous and I make you famous and I don't want to speculate if that's what if that's what saved the day although it was mentioned in the House of Commons that special interest pressured them at the last second but in a in a less a legal can you say that to someone I'm gonna make you famous I think it's it's my most if it's my most effective tool it's like a scene from like what's that what was the cowboy movie where Val Kilmer played Doc Holliday remember tombstone yeah sounds like a line in tombstone right no you know what it's from the one with the Bon Jovi song you know those those you know shot down or blaze of glory you know you know those those those cute guys in the it was at the 80s or 90s that are all like did a western movie the other gun yes it's from that I'm gonna make you famous oh shit sorry I knew I'd heard it from somewhere I think it's from that I'd hoped I'd hoped it was my line but nonetheless what member Emilio Estevez this is arguably the campus cheesiest of the cowboy movies right is it the campus I don't today I didn't see it I don't know they're all handsome Devils sorry so I so I show up at a show literally they at the BRIT before the meeting starts the entire committee stands up and leaves the room what now we're we're there and we're prepared for this to die I'm there for a funeral they come back in the conservative members of the committee proposed their amendments the Liberals which away the the Conservatives are you know they're all voting so they're just knocking these things down knocking them down knocking them down and then suddenly it comes to the Liberals time to propose their amendments first guy comes up and he says I'd like to withdraw my amendment noted on the record sits down okay we'll go to number two I'd like to withdraw my amendment sits down number three I'd like to withdraw my amendment with the same interest as me and you know I don't even know exactly what's going on at this point I just know that their faces are indicative that this we might win this thing and the fourth member of parliament stands up and he withdraws the amendment and we saved this thing in the last second and I absolutely know it was a pressure campaign because like I said I was gonna come on this podcast I'd already had this date written for some time and this was going to have political implications that I don't know that the Liberal Party could have sustained it's a really bad time I think this came from the top down whereas efforts to kill it came from the bottom up this came from the top down you're not killing that bill I think people are understanding what dolphin captivity really is what Orca captivity really is I think they're understanding that now I think it's just one of those things that exists because it's always existed but if it didn't exist now there's no fucking way anybody would ever let you do it if there was no captive dolphins and orcas if someone just went around and kidnapped them with what scientists know now about their social structure and their community dude they're so complex the way they they have fucking dialects right it's they have dialects orcas have they have they share languages in different regions and actually have a different accent of sorts I mean it's it's really remarkable stuff yeah right it would be a global outrage if today as day one they someone said hey look at this thing let's put this in this box because we I'm already well because we have them and there's some legacy businesses that have been around for a long time that's a great way of putting you know they have the means to fight they know now that look this is not going so well you can you can see it in all the advertising these days SeaWorld almost rarely shows any orcas and their commercials although it seems the industry is sort of switching to baby walruses in fact they're there they're the new orcas they're sort of the new brandable cute really yeah it really is it's happening all over it's happening in Canada as well the Vancouver Aquarium is running with it yeah and the same as SeaWorld if you go to their their Twitter it's you know I can't say that present day it's it's like literally the case today but yeah a lot of baby walrus stuff it's where it's going it's just they know that they can run with that at least for the time being what's crazy and all this is here this bill is passing now we know it's going to pass it's it should be it should get Royal Assent comes second week of June shy of some some catastrophe this thing will become law that's why Marineland is trying to get rid of these whales as quickly as they can they gotta get them out of here because at least now they can just well it sounds like to to export permits have been approved to the so to beluga whales are going to Spain you know now granted that's being facilitated through the Vancouver Aquarium this becomes an ugly mess here because when it comes to zoos they're all part of these associations okay and these are these are industry voices anything that's if any time you're told wow this is an ace at a accredited facility you know most schools for instance or general people would say oh well it's a credit it's a good place no no no what that means is these places facilitate animal transfers one not to other member facilities it's really just a club and this club protects the interests of these parks and keeps any type of oversight lack their lobby groups basically so what's happened is now through the Vancouver Aquarium marine lentsoe marine line is sending these whales to Spain but they're claiming them to be Vancouver Aquarium whales which is not true they were never on these animals inventory or rather this facilities inventory list there's never been any knowledge of any of this but happened is because Vancouver Aquarium is accredited and has an affiliation with the ACA so in Canada we call it cats of the Canadian Association of zoos and aquaria and it is in fact not they no longer have their accreditation they did they didn't have the best of relationships shortly after all of our revelations it's all just right now it's just the industry as a whole is breaking all of its own rules to facilitate getting these beluga whales Marineland has 51 of them okay there's five born every year but they always have 51 and they don't they haven't shipped an orca out in nearly a decade at this point I mean you do the math that what's going on exactly so they're dying they're always have 51 they don't ship them anywhere else I can attest that yes when I was there and in my experience you don't have to watch my words because I know marine lands lawyer Andrew burns is listening hi Andrew I'll see you next week in my experience yeah you're for as many animals are born you're just about losing as many so you'll lose to old ones you'll lose three young ones not all the ones that are boring it'll be successful just about half are so so what's happening now is the industry wants that bloodline there's 51 captive orcas whereas you know there's a lot of controversy and importing animals from other place that the states can't in fact they can't bring them in from Russia without a public consult period it might still be the case with Canada so actually the public might actually be consulted about the import of these five belugas that Marineland is seeking permit for it to export so that's something that certainly has activist level I'll be I'll be you know helping to guide it towards the proper resolution but yeah that's all happening it is a race right now to to get rid of marine lens animals and and it is a wild time is it's a wild time to be inside the doors at Marineland as I can imagine in the fences and it's it's a most wild time for me to be on the outside because I've never in the last six-and-a-half years of litigation just of my advocacy and being sort of an you know basically being engaged in war with marine land I've never seen them work harder to suppress me and to try to silence me than they are now uh as breaking news just today marina and had built this fence aptly named Phil's fence around the park and just today we found out they blacked it all out with tarps because come this Saturday May 18th and certainly I'm inviting everyone to come join me I'll be joining as an as a guest a big demonstration outside of Marineland and we're gonna protest it as there and as they're anticipating because on account of my coming on this show they worked very hard to try to keep me from a coming be speaking of anything see certainly not promoting this event so I certainly hope that this event is it is well it's how do they try to do that well because we're in litigation what happens in litigation is you come to a point where you start to negotiate and so there's things that they want from me there's things they really want from me they want my silence the problem is they're never gonna silence me it's not an option I've said it before I'll say it again they can offer me a million dollars to shut up go away it's not gonna happen I'm not gonna delete my Twitter I'm not gonna delete any of my tweets that have the word Marineland in them this is a request these this is layers and layers and there have been layers of requests basically they'd hoped that I wouldn't come here they'd hope something could be worked out in our litigation we have so now I chased Marineland so back when marine lands owner was still alive I put forth a huge campaign to try to get him to be examined legally by my lawyer much like I've had to sort of submit myself to but as these lawsuits and as litigation continues to reveal itself as just a perfect method of abuse you know that they're just the only resolve these things appear to serve is to exhaust both parties and have them come together with a resolution two six and a half years Marineland seems intent on a resolution they don't want to go to examinations so while we were in so while I was there to be examined a couple weeks ago my lawyer said take a walk and the two lawyers began their talks we put off the examination because we believe there could be some good faith that could be shown between parties it became quite evident that it was not the case and when we were to resume our examinations which was to be last week Marineland on account to the fact that I was coming on this show through an absolute tirade and said we are not doing this now bear in mind this is a court-ordered examination date I've got a trial coordinator who is trying to nudge this thing forward because I mean that's something that's so that's a motion I had to win in the litigation itself is to try to get someone to look at this thing so that it can actually move forward like let's get someone to manage it so we're in case management so that case management judge has issued a very aggressive schedule it's in back in February we had a court date of which thank you very much I won handedly marine Lynette to pick up just a little more than twelve thousand dollars of my legal bill which is really on this particular motion in this event a kind of a drop in the pan but nonetheless a sound victory in court you know we have a case conference call next week now I don't know where this stands because now murrayland has breached the court's order so we went they didn't show up the examination I got a fourth what's called a certificate of non attendance it means the person that was supposed to be examined that they didn't show up Marine Lines owner John holder who's now passed away didn't show up to two of his examinations knowing full well then I'd have to pick up the 1700 bucks - caught - just to be there to get the certificate and he's just not going to show up no big deal there doesn't seem to be any punitive damage out there and they they're I mean we're almost seven years into this thing and they're still like brutalizing me but we're at a point where they're actually in a very uncomfortable position of having to keep this thing if you don't want this litigation to be on the public record and transcripts and evidence and everything you have to stop it seems to me the court appear to facilitate resolutions of that sort they like settlements I was promised a trial on day one it's what kept me going they're lying about me they're lying about everything everything they're saying and they're trying to exhaust you financially well of course they are I mean that's the premise countersuing them as well I'm countersue them the premise of my countersuit is so that they couldn't merely drop my the lawsuit against me over a period of time and then that'd just be it and that I would I would then have to actually file a motion to get some cost back I'd be lucky to get 50% everything in the early days my lawyer said let's sue him back and so we did I'm suing them for abuse of process they're using the courts time resources they mean even for that matter we can extend that to the police and other you know departments and organizations they're exhausting these things in bad faith they're doing it because they just want a shredder basically they want to take away my right to free expression which is a Canadian chartered right I mean I'm protecting my own history here I mean this is insanity I can't even believe that after six and a half years I'm still here at risk of being silenced that the fact that I mean look full disclosure I'm out of money the last time I was on this show we raised I mean and again thank you so much 60 or maybe almost 70 thousand it's in a year and a half that's gone I spent my last penny last month it was a very aggressive last three months do you have a go fund me I have a go fund me information yes please what is it it's if you go to save smooshy calm SAV ESM oh oh shi calm you can go there there's a small documentary it's a little dated now but on account to the fact that legislation nothing's really moved forward in the lawsuit and the legislation is only just wrapping up it's still very current so please spend the 14 minutes to sort of appreciate the story more I guess you'll get a better more context to it there's you know some some footage in there some back backstage stuff some pretty you know it tells the tale quite well it's a it's a it's a good piece yeah folks if you're if you're hearing this please help it out if you can you know joy say it all the time it's the thing I hate to do most is ask for help understand Smith well your intentions are pure you know you really are a person who is going about this because you feel like you are uniquely qualified to talk about it you have the actual information you know what's wrong you know even you know and you're a part of the system you understand it better than anybody and on the outside can they have my walrus and they have your walrus still we think and so when and so when in the litigation my lawyer says well here's what marine lands prepared to offer I say to my lawyer but what about the walrus and he says to me do we talked about this this is crazy you're not getting a walrus and I said to Marineland I don't want no money not a penny I want the walrus there's two left three have died in the last it's really in mere months secretly I find out what would you do with her I mean ideally what I would like is I just want her transferred at this point to another facility I would love to see her transfer to the Vancouver Aquarium or there's a facility in Quebec as well I just want to be a possible to possibly be in her life if she needs me which we I mean there's a reason she's in one of them to still alive I I would a comment listen would you move to Vancouver if suddenly Dan Bilzerian gets on the horses Phil I got this uh yeah well actually I hit my wait there's a backstory to that too I actually got some beef with him inadvertently but we'll get back to that but you know if he were to suddenly say hey I got this arctic beachfront home and do you don't buy you a walrus yeah I move absolutely I mean she's got another ten years of her life uh do you know there's you only one way of artists to be with this walrus play the music is there a better this to the story I mean really it all sounds so crazy Joe but here's sixty six and a half years ago I was like I want the walrus right suddenly Here I am negotiating for a walrus call me crazy but so are they willing to negotiate for the walrus is this actually in consideration yes yeah not without layers and layers and layers of compromise and but bear in mind not in the capacity that I see it more of a yeah maybe maybe we won't send her to China how's that maybe we'll send her somewhere and not deter that facility from you visiting maybe we could do that for you that's what I mean it's it's really bad faith negotiate the problem with the thing that I have a hard time dealing with is look we're in litigation in you know in in litigation you have to exercise a certain amount of decorum and it's not exactly my strong point it's just not I find decorum to be just a thick layer of bullshit I just do yeah you want to hope that there's gonna be some type of good faith negotiation I I want that Marineland negotiates with additional hostilities and threats it's not worked for them in six-and-a-half years what makes you think it's gonna work now so here I think we're going down a path of possibly good at good-faith negotiations the the owner the the villain of the story is gone he's out of the picture the the new president who is the the widow the wife is a wonderful woman I mean listen if I honestly and truly believe if the lawyer himself wasn't the controlling mind of the business now he's got sort of facilitating this transfer of the business as it was to just being sold off piste off and and you know distribute the wealth to the for the remaining family members I think that we could I think this story ends on a good note I mean I have no hostilities you know I have every reason in the world to despise the man who sued me and I don't I don't even think about him it was never about that they made every case in the world every argument that this was personal between me and him and well that's because you look in the camera and say fuck you two people it's personal between me and Don play you can bet your ass that's a different story but you don't I'm saying did I make them famous well you've um so where do you stand right now well I don't know so next week we're having a case management the case manager is gonna talk and we're gonna see what becomes of marine lands once again skipped examination it's so hard to believe this is still going on dude welcome to my phone from the time you first came on the podcast to now this has been just this scratch and claw every day of my life I live with this looming cloud of threat of like there's people out there that really want me I'm not talking physical threat okay they did they played their games you know I called every one of their Bluffs every at every corner of this thing but there's something about when you say they played their games they sent goons to my house yeah there's video in fact that there's on that documentary you'll see these they sent some tough guys I mean they were sending people at 6 a.m. harassing my girlfriend while she's taking the garbage out I mean it really got pretty intense but we stood our ground I was like this is not gonna go down like this it's like you're fucking with the wrong guy dude like listen I come from a place called Welland Ontario I don't know that you're familiar with I'm gonna assume not probably few people are unless you're an avid hockey fan because we have produced some pretty amazing NHL talent but you know this population of like 50,000 I'm a well endure I don't know any other nm Frenchman I mean it's probably another thing to stress but I don't know any other way to deal with things other than sort of fight it out you know you know cower and run you don't you know you stare the threat especially when you're on the right side of things I'm not gonna sit there and take shit I'm not gonna it's not gonna work for them to continuously try to threaten me because dude I'm invested and I'm not talking money I'm in on it's like a hostage situation it's how it started my only interest is ending the hostage situation that not my only interest I shouldn't say that of course not you know I have interest in sin you know I've been advocating for the bills and obviously advocating and letting people know they're sort of taking the veil off the bullshit that the industry or feel like you're negotiating for a hostage in smooshing they're they're using her as that type of chip yeah that's their bark that's their bargaining chip that's what they got the end they're keeping this constant pressure on you this constant final threats constant like my lawyer in fact and this is where it gets kind of weird because listen I don't understand he's supposed to be representing me the answer is no to everything fight fight fight I want a trial he instead is coming with listen this is not how litigation ends feel like you don't seem to understand how this ends you don't have a grip of how the litigation work and I'm just like I'm glad that I don't because my guess is I representative about 90% of the population that don't know and it's important that we find out I was promised a trial because they said I was this this this this this well let's get that fucking trial this is what I've been doing this doesn't end with negotiations I want the trial yeah I don't understand like what why would you sue me unless you want the trial oh because it's a bullshit lawsuit well then I want the trial because I need to show that I need that on my record I want that I want the truth they fucked at the wrong guy I hate to say it I'm the old allows suits they've launched and launched in you know in excess of like 12 and threatened and and it's important to note I've been threatened and I'm constantly under threat of additional litigation I'm the only one left and the only lawsuit that's I'm the only person who hasn't had to compromise their free expression it's the dirty secret about the legal business right that says a loophole this is something people can do to people to silence them just to drag them through hell for six years maybe ten who knows how this goes right I mean this is a case manager I mean I had to fight in court at great expenditure to get this case management and if you put this up to the general public and have them look at what the actual facts are and have them look at what these people what their businesses what they're actually doing it's game over it's game over it's a real problem for them the real problem is it's an indefensible activity having those animals in swimming pools for people's enjoyment like but to follow that up with trying to crush people brush my fiscal sovereignty I mean look no there's nothing good on their side find what they tried to do to you for what the businesses like to operate in full sort of transparency because look I'm I guess I'm sort of sponsored by the public so I feel like a level of transparency and all this but you know I had a little bit of money I'd won a TV show called wipeout and I had 50,000 Canadian dollars tax-free in the bank which i sat on because I didn't know precisely what it is I was gonna do with it I felt like there was the potential of a rainy day around the corner it took that in the first six months six months to to hire lawyers for everybody everyone I was getting sued I was cutting $5,000 retainers for going there's a purpose for this money I only have it because I got on the show because of my relationship with the walrus so I'm in for a good chunk of change here it's crazy the lengths of which and the ability corporations have to destroy individuals the fact that the court is there to facilitate it is precisely why I want to go to trial I've been told the figures are and please don't quote me and I'd love the facts but I've been told that's something in the area like 90% of lawsuits get settled without going to discovery I want to be I want to be the 10% or less I wanted I want a resolution by the by the judge I can sleep at night if the judge says okay it ends with this fill you get fifty thousand dollars of your at this point in excess of two hundred thousand in legal bills and Marineland you lost so you know you you got to eat the shame and walk away I would assume be more comfortable with that than if Marineland said here's a hundred thousand dollars don't talk about the I mean let's say and the best kid scenario they said here's a chunk of change let's just use a hundred thousand dollars and said just don't talk about the terms of the settlement but other than that you have no impeded speech you can just be free I would be more comfortable with the judge's decision then that hundred K because then at least I know exactly what it is that I went through I that world can find out what function these courts have and what their version of justice is I mean I'm just still I'm trying not to be jaded because obviously it's a heavy load to carry as in your day to day it's you know I've been on the cusp of crazy I'm thankful for plant medicine for sort of keeping me grounded and keeping me and with the proper perspective but plant medicine listen you happy they do try to call me hippie a lot too it's interesting I mean a little bit of a different version of hippie I suppose I mean I don't mind war well your your God cares about these marine mammals now walruses like my daughter do did you consider that fact you're just like dude that he's got they've got your daughter that's a mess doesn't try to put yourself in a perspective that if they had your dog your neighbors got your dog and his unimpeded ly by your definition abusing or neglecting their life and you're there to just watch silently I mean that's disgusting that's a disgusting scenario this is the poison that I live with I hmm I need I need a proper closure I'm relying on there being a level of justice so that one day I can live in this world without being just that old jaded dude look last time I was here it was not nearly as fucking gray like I'm starting to feel the effects of long-term litigation you don't have a podcast do you I want to do a podcast I'm to do a podcast I'm surgeon you well people you know they just you know feel you we should have podcast do a podcast do and I have to get a real simple thing for you to do I know I'm running on you got a lobster saying you're great talker thanks Joe I appreciate that why don't you do it I am considering it yeah I really get mad at me that I keep suggesting that people get podcasts which stop bro stop doing the you know you said to me when we were in Toronto at dinner you should be a comedian I said I've heard that before sure but spartax i've heard you mention that on number times - that - I've said people well this so few of us on there's more podcasters and there are comedians for Shore not even close there's like I think there's more than 600,000 podcast now on iTunes so yeah there's not 600,000 comics there's like that's a big pool to wait in you know but I mean I'm in I mean happen if I did it would be up for my own purposes you know I would because there's categories of course and for someone new I guess you'd probably be in his conservation a category or wildlife or something like that you know you would you would launch pretty quickly and it would be fascinating for people to have you ever heard like one of the really well produced NPR podcast like the drop out was it and did NPR do the drop out the one on Elizabeth Holmes and the Thera knows controversy the blood scanning stuff anyway it's an amazing multi-part series that describes how these people made this phony blood testing technology and sold it and made millions of dollars and was there were worth valued at billions and now they're literally virtually worth nothing so it's by ABC radio that's who did it nightline that's what it was ABC News Nightline but something like that could if someone wanted to follow this and and document it from the beginning in a podcast form this is something that really could be like six one-hour episodes yeah if you were talking about your history with training or cos what you thought it was when you first got any when we went into that and several the other episodes but think about this me you and I have talked now how many times you've been on now this is my fourth okay so each times been like three hours so all those all those hours of discussion if someone condensed that into your story I think it would be super compelling and then you could also update people on the case you could update people on the state of marine mammal captivity legislation and and because there are countries that are right now waking up and realizing this is crazy like this is almost like human slavery it's like finding aliens and just keeping them in a cage somewhere I mean the timings right I don't that so yeah I mean perfect again with the looming litigation I do get a little bit sort of tongue shy because this is just gonna be a poppy suit again man this kind of freaks me out I really what you know it's the same premise of writing a book it's like great write a book but it's like I can't do anything with it because I'll be sued I'll be soothing it's a virtual guarantee now the the the bright side is it seems to me like Marineland is not going to be around for terribly long a terribly long time once they're dissolved oh you bet your ass I got lots to talk about I mean I would love if I could speak of everything without having to sort of watch you know I really do have to keep from saying a lot of stuff not on account of it being illegal but just on account to the fact that it will it'll virtually guarantee me additional hostilities and you know yeah it's kind of I completely understand I do look forward to that day where I'm sort of free and unencumbered and just can just be fucking me again you know yeah well if you're in that business right now you got to be looking at the future going we got to get we gotta get out before they take us out that's precisely what's happening so the speculation is a marine lands lawyer is now the sole controlling mind and he that's precisely what his job is to transition this from we know that they've sold property they sold the golf course they sold the campground we know now that they're there I'll say I'll use the word selling it might not be the right term because marine land claims they'll be no financial exchanges but you know that that's yet to be seen yeah the writing's on the wall they're gonna be gone I don't think the wife has any interest what I mean she's she's pushing 70 something it's probably doesn't want to be a part of this she's never really had a heavy hand in it I mean she had her she had she sort of took care of the cash business aspect of it she's sort of she had her role in it but it wasn't like a management position making decisions on animals health importing exporting things like this like it's just beyond her so what we've been told is that's marine lands owner in his final days there's a wish list this is what happens to the park this is what happens with this this is what happens with this and you can bet your ass that there's something about a walrus and there's something about me in there what it is at least that I know of right now is obviously hostilities till the end I think that what's happening is the lawyer is fulfilling John holders wishes with me I think it's I think it's in the books that he can't just end this thing or I don't know it's time I know the guy's dead let it go folks a lawyer doesn't like me I can't be on the same you talk a lot of shit bro well you know what he actually said camera Feldman go fuck himself or whatever he said that's gonna be in court document I didn't say that I said that to Senator that's okay will it be in court documents oh he's watching he's listening I mean I sort of half hope that he Sue's you joy to say that my sort of fuck up so I don't wish that on my best of friends but man would that's he's something it's not gonna happen but fuck do you know it's not gonna happen no you're just talking shit you just put it out there man yeah it's not gonna add you jus we talked about this last time too I think that what they do in terms of that business for their own sake they should stop for everyone that's profiting off that you've got to find an exit strategy and I don't just mean Marineland I mean anyone who understands my language that's that's hearing my words you should stop this is not the future this is you can't do that anymore this is going you this is going to look horrible just a few years from now where people who've seen blackfish people who do understand what those things are the more we find out about dolphins and orcas the more we understand them it's gonna be more and more it's not like oh wait a minute we just did some tests we found they're like crabs bro they're dumb as fuck like you just eat them that's not gonna happen man we're more and more impressed with them the more we study them I am more than happy to negotiate with marine land that rather than signing any type of non-disparagement because I don't want my speech virtually locked in a in a in a legal document I'm a forgiving person I don't need I'm only responding in kind to their hostilities they come at me with war I bring it back I don't want to I have to yeah I take it right back up to where they bring it then they do this I got to do this then they do this I'm like what he fucking thinking it's like if they would just just dial it back I can be a happy smiley not chirping Marineland guy I don't have to be I don't have to do that I've done what I've had to to be where I am the man who was who created this scenario is gone we don't need the hostilities anymore so what is the lawyers motives exactly I don't know but I can assure you now that they've blacked out the fence they're doing everything they can to suppress our information they've bought up all the billboards in all the available billboards in Niagara Falls so that they've got Marineland signs because we have put up like as activists activists have put up billboards one of which was like right at the entrance of marine land last year is a thing of beauty so they you know they bought all these things up they really don't want bad PR right now my guess is trying to get rid of the animals mitigate the PR losses because it's already at the sound foundation of it of bad PR and sell the property get rid of it all and I think you know they're trying to fast-track an accreditation so that they can facilitate animal movements and whatnot my greatest weapon right now unfortunately is that I can assure them a great deal of of financial risk I have and I certainly can and am right now they need to take that into consideration when you consider the price of a walrus and let's just use the number a hundred thousand which is a grossly inflated number for a walrus and let's say marine land were to say hypothetically well why would we give you $100,000 asset when it's gonna cost us less than that just to finish this litigation and we'll owe you 25k at the end of some shit why would we do it doesn't make sense and I say to them it's because I'm gonna make that walrus cost you tens of millions consider that lose the hostilities I'll make you guys heroes we can do that too the Nair this narrative doesn't have to continue the narrative of war can end with with the dead owner it could have ended but well they're all invested in it and one of the things about lawsuits it's like people when they get it started there's a game going on you're trying to win you're trying to win trying to get the other side to cave I mean this is a lot of what this is all and obviously you've taken this very personally and this is all part of you now can I explain something really messed up yeah I now because we're coming to an end the the law that I've been advocating for is going to pass this lawsuit is going to end the animals will that I mean we're gonna find out what's gonna happen to them in in the in the near future we already know it's what's becoming of some I don't know what it's gonna be like to live without a lawsuit once the prospect is not a nice bro you're gonna be on the beach to feed up when the prospect came round of me not having one anymore that's not how I saw it it's weird I'm oddly connected strangely addicted and married to a fucking lawsuit I get it you'll be fast it listen we'll get you through that's right that's be real stuff that stuff will put you on the planet that's outside Pluto that we haven't discovered yet and I see you've got the Tyson ranch box yeah man I got a Tyson ranch box he hooked me up and then that big box is from what is the company that gave us the big box the speed weed that helped but right like it I think the extracts company ABX extracts or I'm not sure who honest don't know we should help the shout out that company different things in there I had I was elbows box speed they're the best and they're they're fucking they brought me a war chest so get in there I'm actually gonna be on the UM Tyson's podcast tomorrow are you really and I was kind of stoked in and it was a Thursday and I'm really in what world am I sitting down smoking a bunch of weed with Mike Tyson well it's the one that was created on account to these crazy decisions that I made the fact alone that we've come together like this dude I'm talking with with Whitney who's you know she she says to you that I'm a hero unless she's my fucking hero man like I say it that crazy lady drove all the way to Texas with a fucking pig she tried to like help this pig out that she found she fed the pigs and they drove all the way to Texas with it I love her level of crazy I think it's just fucking perfect it fits exactly what this needs and again I'm blessed that you that you sort of turned around to me and I know she was she was looking to have a conversation with you with regards to some legislation the dolphins and will kept to me whatnot you sort of steered her in my direction yeah let me touch on the Danville's area i think i is he coming here on in may is that right on the pot yes nothing I know okay someone had said to me oh I heard and he's gone before though yeah I know he has I thought that was coming out sooner kind of made me nervous cuz so I a couple weeks ago Whitney's like just just drilling dan Bilzerian on Instagram for having this polar bear right there's video of a polar bear to fucking party and he's feeding it she's just she's what a party yeah I was like a big there's a big brown bear grizzly was a big grizzly bear morally yeah on a you know electric fence around everything else so she was he probably one of his crazy his house yeah oh Jesus Dan Bilzerian what the fuck bro oh my god he had a fucking brown bear at his house look at the size of that thing oh my god anxiety did he ever see the fucking what was the yeah yes yeah the one where the bear rip the guy's throat apart that was one in a movie to us no the bear was in a movie the bear was in a football movie what was that movie let's go on with the basketball I think he's been a few movies but with Will Ferrell were they playing basketball you like wrestled him in the middle of the basketball game was that the bear yeah I think so well there was a bear that had been in movies and had done stunted movies and this guy video was awful because the guy is literally just standing there and the bear just goes up to them and just decides to attack and rips his throat out in a second it's exactly that video - the this yeah it can happen at any freakin time only you got 45 girls in the back scantily clad easily could happen you know what's really crazy is that that bear that killed that guy they went back to training them they're not gonna kill an animal that has value it's the same as the Orca that killed all the trainer's they could they're not gonna kill him it's just not gonna happen but they were trying to like figure out whether or not he was gonna do it again like Jesus Christ what do you uh soothsayer how are you gonna figure out what a bear is gonna do it's gonna be a bear asshole there's gonna be better air stuff the people that are bringing that are trying to have you interact with these animals like that they're they're they're relying on the animals shock factor the shock and awe you know they're bringing these animals in the close proximity to scare you that's a fucked up thing man that's the bear right there look at that throat apart so so horrific so back to the the Whitney thing so Whitney's just just harping on Danville's and he's deleting the comments as quick as she's tossing them so I decide okay well I'm gonna weigh in now right so I throw a comment and I forget about I turn to go off do my thing and then that night I'm on the Phil DeFranco show not me personally but he actually takes the comment because they know he got a lot of likes and stuff I said something to the effect of you know that's an abuse then I'm all blah blah blah it's not I said something you know smoke more weed they put the comment up oh by the way the guy who handles the animal he was sort of he was using some legal sort of jargon with me as if he's maybe was talking about lawsuit nice - fuck it sue me legal jargon to the guy who's Anna Tori because I said that's a starved abused animal I mean I know how do you I know how in the history of wild animals when is a bear ever walked out today I'm gonna become fuck friends with some you know fuck this well there's a garden out when there are little Cubs you know that of course so they starve them they abuse them they have them I mean but do they have to do that to train them I know there are people who claim to love bears that train bears to take care of bears and I guarantee you they don't all do that it says big no-no there's nothing fun about abusing a drug starved animal delete this and your penchant for animal exploitation smoke more weed I don't know a smoke more weed just like gonna help that but it wasn't a chirp that what do we feel the Franco said it was like I was like smoke more weed you fool I was just like no no smoke more weed like go inside one thing okay got it no longer yeah it see I feel like there are people that have bears that raise them and I'm not in any way shape or form endorsing keeping bears in captivity but what I see is people that have these sort of intimate relationships with these really well-fed bears they're big and happy and they feed them and they're get in the pool with them and it looks ridiculous but I don't think they're starving that bear and I don't think they're abusing that bear and I don't think you have to do that I don't think you couldn't automatically assume that a bear is starved and abused so I assume the starved part I certainly can't say but it's a big bear those a fat bear nice feeding it might be hungry that day I mean it's more than saying we'll look at the body on the bear Oh big not even well-fed bear you can have a well-fed animal that's hungry for a week there's no question about that but it's not likely that that thing started my definition of abuse is there's an electric fence around that fucking thing which is that yeah you can see it at about the ankle at about ankle there's a fucking electric fence it yeah well I'm sure whoever so back to that pic I'm sure whatever installation the the person who brought this thing does has to keep the animal within confines of so much you imagine you just went on a model killing rampage like that's an electric eye that's again an assumption I'll say but again I don't see how that wouldn't be what the hell does that serve as a barrier it's just a trip line otherwise for that is so and said that's a well-fed bear though son look at that the motherfucker eats that is a big ass if you want to get an animal to do something if you want it to be docile you have to try you have to sort of there's there's braking the animal in many cases but I'll assure you Joe that food deprivation is in training is your most effective tool it just is you can find a healthy balance right but food deprivation is but we've got one you've talked about this particularly with dolphins to be fair in my my experience of wild animals it is with marine mammals so yeah not worked with bears there are bears at Marineland it's a really it's a disgusting display it's an archaic it looks like it's out of the eighteen hundreds even I mean it really is a disgusting place but the practice was to starve them mm-hmm and what people do there is they pay like I think it's a buck and they get like this this is a little cup full of corn pops and you the Bears are like waving yeah historically there's been bears I mean he's got they've got like 40 or 50 bears in this little confined space I mean there's nothing there's no more no greater abomination of nature than I can imagine than a solitary largely solitary animal sort that confined to a bunch of them of the speech and then historically they have ripped each other apart and though I can actually delve into marine lands history deeper than I can and you get to hear the full spectrum of some of the things that happened and bear in mind and it's important to note it was a different time different times different things happen and that's just that was the that was that was the norm it's it's you know starkly contrasting time to when marine lines started so but the stories are like really it's jaw-dropping it's really jaw-dropping stuff but yes it's on one hand when you have children and you bring a child to the zoo on one hand it's really fascinating to watch this little person look at all these different animals and and and freak out and and see how amazing it is but that's the only Pro is introducing human beings like little human beings in particular to these animals everything else is a con except for the animals that are like really endangered and they protect them and help breed them and then sometimes they were responsible for some reintroduction efforts but other than that it's an animal prison weird I don't take the position or ideal I don't know not this person that's trying to represent an ideology necessary not against all zoos but I have to say that there's nothing more sad than seeing elephants cats bears in cats man the cats when they're pacing back and forth I mean just get them out of there whoo-hoo sir whose purpose are you serving is that good for you I mean seeing an animal that's got Zucco sasai mean it's it's it's it's a mental case and we don't know what the fuck's going on in their head so we have no idea that most people just watch and think this is just maybe normal or something right a lot of people we're not see because the veil is only now sort of coming off and people are started now getting the truth on the matters you start to see things for what they are I watch the video on YouTube some weeks ago and it was Marineland in the 70s and man was this place busy and the people were just I mean they were they were climbing over each other to be next to the pool I've never seen anything like I worked at 12 years I've never seen the amount of people that this thing had and we looked into pool there's a bull Orca who's he spans the literal length of the pool that he's in on the side with his this dorsal fin over and he's literally staring at the wall not moving and then you got two other massive orcas that are in this pool like maybe five times the size of this room kind of thing and people are celebrating like it's and the view the video has like this sort of quirky music and it's kind of funny and fun and I'm watching this going what a disconnect of time like where this you're looking at exactly what you see today in terms of the animals and the conditions that they're in yet here these people having knowing nothing about it just in awe the beauty that met the majesty of these animals is the majestic nature of these animals and yet we couldn't see for ourselves whatsoever how abusive and gross this was it's it was really a weird and strange thing but that's you know marine lands a legacy business they built they built themselves on having people come and experience the shock and awe of these animals and they did very very well but that time is long gone now long gone I think we're gonna come to a time in the future where people think the same way about zoos I think it's we're just we're gonna realize like I get that you want to see them I get it I get you want to see them I get I i'll on i want to see them too but god damn we got to stop doing that like this is no way also for you that the problem is humans don't have any real experience with animals we have experience with dogs and cats which are these domesticated weird little fluffy friends they are not animals we don't have much experience with real animals and even the animals that you have experience with they're urbanized you know like pigeons that you can feed or squirrels that take peanuts from you you can out into the world in the the world of the wild of forests and mountains and you you see actual real animals and it's almost psychedelic there's like a weird like paradigm shift that goes through when you see a wild animal in though in the actual like oh this is where it's supposed to be it kind of feels weird because you're in their world you could be that because now you're like oh what because the series of tools that that animal has in its world that doesn't translate in captivity for instances like wait a second that thing can spring on meat why mom out like like I'm in its world now it's to me that's the AH of the experience of witnessing animals because since the year and a half that expired that from our last show you know I had the blessed the gift of seeing dolphins in the wild I went down to I can remember what Beach it was but it was while I was in California and that was my first experience in fact again I'm from a small place and then this year I was able to go to Washington State and see orcas in the wild now I've jumped off orcas rostrums into the air so high that you're looking down into Dixie cup to land and that's pretty awesome but there's nothing like having seen fucking Bull Orca with an eight-foot mass on his back swimming next to his mother and all the never my heart sunk into my stomach I'd never seen anything more majestic Wow Wow yeah do you know anything about what's going on in the Pacific Northwest where there's a pod of orcas that exists primarily on Chinook salmon and they're starving oh that's the so in fact it's important it's a I'm glad you mention that because just yesterday and today a bunch of different protections are being announced for the southern resident killer whales which are in the Salish Sea so it's going to impede sort of vessel you know they're getting their real focusing on doing what they can what's happening there is they've got this Snake River Dam system that needs to be what happens they put this system in and the Chinook are just dying they can't get through the flow is gone so and they put the system in a long time a long time ago so it's virtually over time has been decimating these populations no one really knew why but we're at the point now that we know that these orcas exclusively chinook and there's just not enough and whereas they used to be massive ones now they've got these two little tiny ones and you know there was a I mean that the plight of the southern resident killer whales is really I'm glad that it's got getting global attention I'm sure you're familiar with the mother who lost its calf and mourned for an excess of like 40 days and carried her on on her head yeah and the type of vigil I mean this was this captivated the world and you can't look at an animal capable of such suffering without being acutely aware of the damage you're doing when you separate them from their family the natural environment let me explain the difference when bears see their cubs dead they eat them yeah that's a difference yeah this is the you're talking about something that's insanely emotional it's a different kind of animal that's the thing that we're learning is the most notable aspect of these animals is their socialize their emotional intelligence capacity I'm afraid of what it is the depth of which we're gonna find out that they're capable of of bond because particularly if there's ever some sort of a way of translating communication if they figure out a way of breaking down those sounds and expressions into something that we can decipher we right now they don't I don't think they know much I've been underwater with orcas and dolphins and I've heard them you know I've heard forget I can't even tell you the sounds I mean they've got a wide array of sounds but you know I could you know to the best of my abilities I could tell you when an animal was excited based on their sounds they were making like when when our Orca Neosho was pushing me underwater to do a rocket ride which is when you jump off into the air and you do this big majestic jump you knew it was gonna be a good one when she let out this squawk at the bottom of the pool before pumping her tail and launching you just knew it man this she was on she was on fire and then Oh you just you just knew she wasn't into it and I could just I could know by the sounds you can really determine underwater sound alone you could really get to know your animal again I was there 12 years I mean I really got to experience a lot of things other people could never really truly understand which is really why it's important really important that I'm able to speak to these things because I mean even when it comes to the legislation that is passing I've had my name mentioned in the House of Commons I mean this is a national stage of how to mention in the Senate I mean some people care about what is coming up just yes just a few days ago in a Niagara MP actually this would be a great video if you could if you could pull it up it'll be on my Twitter it's one of the things i retweeted with the MP the local MP he he bashes Marineland I mean that is a thing of absolute beauty I'm glad that I'm able to talk and explain to people what it is that my experience has shown me and the things that I know because if people know they'll do better problem with their videos if we play that video gets claimed oh really so House of Commons video it's public the government thing they lose your okay but I don't know if it's from is it from a news oh but you know what the app that the group that put it out because they okay if you go to my Twitter your check you have to be really careful no I just leave had a shitload of problems Niagara region one I can assure you this marine animal justice will have no problem with you doing this I'm good friends with that's okay gives me a lab chuckle will just helps try to get to it but put that back up so I can read this it says marine land and unfortunate place with horrible conditions okay yeah he's I mean this is a member of parliament this is on the non you know this is the this is the big stage right here and he's finally it took a long time for people anyone in in in the in in public policy to ever wade into this subject now we got people outright saying like this place is a hole I mean wow what what how far we've come in the last six and a half years the world is changing my friend very changing whether people like it or not and this is one that I think it's it's unavoidable this discussion in this resolution this this has to the we have to come to grips with what that is it's just it's just all kinds of wrong man it's all kinds of wrong and the fact that they're still suing you after all these fucking years as if they think it's working as if it's serving them any purpose so here I am again on the fuck adjey are you like are you kidding me dude you don't even know the favor you're doing me if you don't even know what you've done come on what like what what what are you what do you want to accomplish what have you failed in accomplishing and what do you think you're gonna accomplish by kin like continuing jamie is the virtual definition of insanity it's not a good move Jamie who was it that was on the podcast who was explaining the the processes in place of reintroduction into the wild they were gonna have stages and nets and stuff like that and these big outdoor areas where they can transmit dolphins and orcas - who was that do you remember too many goddamn conversation is that me was it you we talked we spoke of the whale sanctuary project I mean that would be of the I mean that's essentially the the basis of it the goal it was that maybe it was you was it discussing how there's places where they're gonna have like intermediate steps yeah absolutely maybe maybe you guys expanded on it was someone else but no that's is the basis of this project is and I mean the good news is the whale sanctuary project I mean this thing is going to happen it is the future if they're there they're there they're well into the process of finding a site considerations are being made for a washington state's site at a vancouver site but it appears as though they're settled on maybe nova scotia the community there at large is looking to work with them that's a wonderful that's wonderful news and I'll tell you something Joe once this law gets royal ascension becomes law what happens is marine land is not able to export the animals unless the Minister of the DFO the Department of Fisheries and Oceans concurs that it's in the animals best interests well if such a site exists and marine land is keen on getting rid of their animals we'll have a place for them I told you last time I was here that my dream is to save whales this might happen additionally if there's a real concerted effort a real effort to rescue those animals in Russia I may very well be a part of that team so we're six and a half years ago I was talking about speaking of a crazy dream where there was no blueprint there was no foundation I just I'd sort of threw myself into the universe and said I'm just gonna hang my hat on a dream I'm watching in real-time as it's materializing that's a hell of a perspective humbling that is amazing this thing that we were talking about with the Pacific Northwest there are it's the resident population that has an issue because they only need each and no salmon but then there isn't there a another pod that comes through there's transients and they're thriving because they eat everything the transients are there they're giving birth to doing quite wealthy marine animals they eat marine animals correct yeah all sand stuff when I was there the guy that was with us literally said can you smell that I'm like no what is this smell that's sort of oily weird she's like a seal is getting eaten somewhere next thing we know we saw the activity or the dorsal hmmm everything and yeah sure shit there's a lot of a certain smell you could smell that that the seal was being why can't they teach these smart whales to fucking eat what their friends are eating why they have to be rude it's like they won't eat Chinese food fuck Chinese food are you starving to death no I want a burger it's a rare occasion but there's something called a super pod where it's actually a congregation of all the different families of orcas into this into this event where they all think they congregate and it's a big social event and and there's a conference that happens every two years in Washington State called super pod which is organized by a good friend of mine Jeff venturi it's an amazing event I look forward to being there again and speaking I gotta get to another place for me to speak and and and roam about with experts and whatnot and learned a great deal of things but I was we were on the cusp of that almost happening because the boats are radiating to each other like okay well we've got family going this we got a family going this is like wait a sec there's three families going on the same the same directions think there's gonna be a crossing of pass and this is where the boaters get really excited either at the prospect of a super pod of sorts or conflict or they have conflict if a that could be but I mean for the most part it's verbal they just tell you like staying yeah I imagine their messages are quite clear and you've got a fifteen thousand pound bull male Orca giving you the bird yeah you're gonna listen fuck yeah associate ranch holds man oh yeah when you see their mouths wide open and see their teeth you're like what the fuck are you why why don't they start eating mammals and I wonder if anybody's ever studied the difference in the behavior between the transient pods that eat the marine mammals versus the behavior the ones that only exist on salmon like maybe they have a different maybe they're like you know like Avatar like there was different different kinds of people up there my go to my go-to source is Ingrid Visser she is a top she's the woman in New Zealand that swims with orcas rescues because I mean she is a top the the really the global spectrum of wild orcas scientists she'd be the one to talk to you about that I mean you want talking what a fascinating person to talk to holy shit the wealth of knowledge she has and and she is a she's a very passionate advocate I'm very proud of done some very very let's do good work with her I'd love to talk to her when I have her on the show yeah I would love to talk to her I'm so curious about those things oh she would join her mile but if there was a difference if at all and behavior if you were to invite her on the podcast she would get on the next flight from New Zealand and come here I can assure you that so say what I think I think she may have a universe maybe she told me that now they're amazing animals I've always said that I mean this is coming from a a self-admitted Bigfoot dork I'm a Bigfoot dork I really wish Bigfoot was a real thing but if Bigfoot was a real thing it wouldn't be nearly as cool as an orc no I give if we found some big stupid stinky ape that's been hiding from people forever like wow that's cool but is isn't much cooler than a chimp or a gorilla what just because it's bigger know what an orca is is really cool that is a super intelligent super killer that eats sharks tell killing machine that that has great whites turn tuck and tail and run just fuck up a great white shark like it has no business no business being in the ocean or the perfect weapon in their world I mean there's nothing that touches them they're literally at the zero risk they have no predators I mean they're just too damn strong and too damn smart and coordinated they do their kills as teams I mean that you're literally up against an army out there try to be a 500-pound Seelye and that would be a big seal and army of thirteen thousand pound killer whales who has a who sort of enjoy playing with you a little bit before you die I mean it's all interpreters play but more often than not it's training the young ones and stuff it could be a brutal thing I mean I don't love watching it personally because they know I've worked with seals as well I mean it's I take team Orca all day yeah you know you're not getting great odds but put the hose on it and you'll you'll get some returns one of the win every time amazing videos I ever saw was an orca with a beach seal the seal he had bitten it and tossed it through the air and the seal it made its way to the shore and it was actually on the land just with a little bit of water and the Orca beached itself grabbed ahold of seal and just start smashing it in the water there and you see the water just flood red with blood and then it hops back and Wiggles itself back in the water and swims when you look holy fuck crazy holy fuck these things we beached themselves that thinks 15,000 pay now do they ever get stuck yeah they do they do in New Zealand in fact that's where Ingrid's work is is really special that she's dude this is a crazy story I have a friend that I grew up with Matt Harrison he went on to the to be real involved in the army so they could decades into the army now he was on a training mission in New Zealand they were doing this training on a beach and didn't they get called to go perform an orca rescues just like Oh what so now he's running and now they've got shovels they're trying to figure this thing out and now Ingrid shows up as the you know it she's the person to call and now there's a photograph I'm waking up in the morning to a photograph of Ingrid at this end of an orca and my friend Matt Harris from the same place as me a little town and well at the other end of the Orca and I'm like you gotta be fucking kidding me and I got to reunite the two of them back in Niagara Falls in the summer cuz Ingrid had come down again and I'm like dude it's these are blessings that I couldn't have even ever imagined and yet here he was and you know and he'd be the first to tell you when he came back it changed his world it changed him never again Marineland done whereas before it might have been you know wouldn't necessarily case he was part of this rescue he's changed man like he's just I mean now he's fascinated with our cousin he can't imagine he got the bug now that's amazing um listen is there anything else probably a million things but no no we're done for sure I I'd like to give a couple shutouts let's these do give you a shout out to the Kanye West mammals would they call you the kanye west of la yay west of animal trainer oh there you go absurd so animal justice canada i got a do shoutout to Camille who's who's next way they're calling you the con us that's it from November Wow bro 2013 that started it all man I say wait they're calling you the kind of Wow the Kanye was a Wall Street so how's it defend himself against 1.5 million a lawsuit Wow yeah yeah shouting man it's it's been an honor to be your friend oh dude you've you've changed the landscape of all of this by the way I know you don't look I get it I can do this all day the first shout-out is to you the last ones to you the one in the middle Steve every one of them like you've changed my world personally but you've really changed the landscape of this entire thing Whitney said it best today she goes you know Joe really is the guy to move the needle on this thing and I'm like you're damn right so like a couple of Fuxi worlds out there as often as you can and just you know keep this stuff up because you you've had a heavy hand in all this along with for instance senator senator Wilford will Wilfrid Moore who is the person who to table this piece of legislation Maurice Sinclair I gotta extend a thanks to to the leader of the Green Party Elizabeth May who's really taking this thing it's her baby and processed this thing through and yeah if you didn't hear me shout out your name sorry it's there's some very satisfying things about having a podcast and one of the really satisfying things is being able to let people know about something that for them is very important like if there's many people that are listening to this as many people that are hearing this that are trying to understand with your busy life with your bills and your relationships and your work and your your also living in a world where something is happening that most likely would be thought of as a horrendous act in just a decade or two decades and then we're going to be looking back saying how the fuck did we let this slide how did we do this and I think guys like you if it's not for your sacrifice many millions of people don't understand this as well and that's real that's you that's 100 percent you your sacrifice your ability to describe it so eloquently and your courage to keep fighting this this is very important I have for the human race I've had faith through and through and it's no right it's not failing listen you're right you're right when it comes to this you're right when it comes to and these marine animals that are super intelligent being stuck in swimming pools it's fucked up it's got to stop yeah it's got to stop while we understand what it is you can't keep your head in the sand with this this is this is madness this is a terrible terrible thing and we need to stop it well as much as I've had a hand in it thank you Joe my pleasure listen thank you walrus whisper on Twitter Instagram yeah I'm just learned Instagram but I'm getting precise it all walrus whisper if there's a the the one on Instagram has got a little it's got a little bit of a different but I'm Ted you know
