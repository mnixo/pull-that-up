but papa bryan callen had his first taste of turmeric coffee he throws an r and turmeric yes a lot of people did I been eating turmeric since well the seven days back when I was living in India I would have bet my life there was no are not about months ago and if there was an our tumeric I thought it was tumeric tea um er IC or whatever now the Indians have been using it forever oh yeah they have I don't know how to spell it that's why is it kid I had no inflammation in my body you just hate turmeric all the time that's your pee smell weird how was the tumeric kid what else makes your pee smell where besides asparagus I think sometimes coffee my looking I'm 52 my body is betraying me which is why I'm having my Laird Hamilton super coffee right that's good stuff right look at him his body's not betraying them yeah but what what happened five what happens is when your body is when I feel like I'm in wet cement when I wake up now now for the first time in my life my feet I got a warm them up forget about all that bullshit now now old Brian is going to a doc I'm tell you this right now on Joe Rogan we're gonna get jacked if I look a little vain here and my skin looks a little more flushed don't ask questions just know that I got a good dog again on the trt I can't wait a long time ago why don't you listen to me I don't know I just cuz I cuz I want to think that you know my body my testosterone is a little higher than everybody else is it was an ego thing but now you know what we're all mortal yes like little things well I have wear and tear for sure from all the years of beating up my body like joints and stuff like that like I just had to get some stem-cell shot into my knee I've had some shot in my shoulder stuff like that but in terms of like energy and like vitality and health I feel fucking great Jess here's what I do here's my here's my I can see if you got a real getter who your weight on 52 I feel fucking great I'm in the sauna almost every day I have a sauna here mmm we got a sauna at my house you and I are gonna sauna Russians let's do it alright dude it's so good for you man it means something something's happening for sure after I get out of there I'm just like a little looser it's a it's a percentage I don't know what percentage it is it's is it 10% is it is it more but there's a feeling that you get after you do a good sauna where everything is just like yeah but this also has to do with arriving at a point in your life where you're happy with this what you've done the decisions you've made so I sleep for me eight hours of sleep seven and a half hours peak and then I if as long as I don't eat for 12 hours so if I eat if I finished eating at eight and I'll start eating at eight again or ten and that for me twelve to fourteen hours I guess it's intermittent fasting those two things I haven't had a cold in I don't know 15 months you're so trendy and Pavel told me told me to Pavel taught Selene yeah who's a metal valve loved that monster fucking such an honor to have him in here I'm a big fan of that guy he told me it's once a day really big giant meal at dinner that's it at dinner yeah so how does he stay he's just like nails yeah but I think I guess fucking skinny shake shakes your hand like this oh good looks you in the eyes shakes your head at my bro we fighting dick what's happening here this is a fucking heavy-duty handshake just done a resting alpha he's an animal an animal and his his methods are so uh you know like contrary to how you would normally think about like weightlifting in particular going to failure all the time but yet also makes sense yeah like you saying do it more often have longer breaks like it's about strength like strength is the most important thing strength his company's called strength first for that reason really yeah he's like you want to do likes if you can do something for ten repetitions you want to do about five and then you want to wait between five and ten minutes before you do it again it's right yeah it makes sense if you just do most of us do not have that kind of fucking time and for sure you can get in tremendous shape with a CrossFit workout yes or a height what does it hit high intensity we doing box jump for that you can certainly get what there's some people out there that are in phenomenal shape working out like that yeah but what makes sense about what he's saying is just like you know the amount of time required for your body to recover if you give yourself your body's ability to recover in between sets you let everything sort of come back to baseline before you Jack it up again with another sad right like your body has more time to recover and you can perform more work and so your body adapts better the idea is that you're overwhelming your body when you're going to fail you're just beating the shit you're also getting injured it Busey how many of his the guys are not a state and get injured and because my in it's not fair so fair but my impression of every CrossFit athlete that I know is always like this watch now I'm getting back into and I just got to pull the something's always jiu-jitsu to me yes same thing you know and I'm a big proponent of that as well as you get older you I don't I can't get injured I'm yes I'm doing you know I don't know if you know this but I'm a thespian I'm gonna show called school they'll see guys and you jump around a lot you lot you're very physic I'm very fit by the way a dancer by the way it's do you want to talk about physical on the show we had Bill Goldberg on and you know Bill I love that dude the best I love him now he walks around a very trim he's my age Oh 260 when he was wrestling was 280 and and you don't judge what you don't realize is he played professional football for I think was for seven years so he's the real deal and just a real athlete so also a very nice guy the best I love him he did a hosted a show called was it called Garage Mahal yeah they redid my garage and turned it into like like a whole training center like with a cage the cage and hung heavy bags and sauce put pictures of like old UFC fights in the wall it's fucking amazing he's a guy who brings it 100% like every time whether it's acting and so and by the way he comes in and I'm like your neck looks so thick he goes first thing I workout first thing he's well those guys like Chuck Liddell when you're close to him he breathes differently like you know what he went with an a race car like he's Shelby did you sleep he's like I don't sleep up in a band why are ya and anyway so we had this thing where I was playing a quarterback and that guy oh it's ridiculous that's what he looks like right now that's what it looks like right now and insisted he had he had a stunt double the stunt double didn't do anything he did all the stunts himself to the point where he had he had to rush at me in a touch football game I am the quarterback and he had to hit two dudes for a look at that picture no I mean smoked a little weed before this podcast and I got a lot of people yeah but that pictures kind of freaking me out he's gotta go he's so massive he's but here's the thing about him Matt it's really interesting that the the profession of professional wrestling is unbelievably brutal in your body yes all those guys I don't think get respected enough for how hard that job is to do they're doing it hundreds of nights they can hundred plus nights a year and they're throwing each other around they get smashed but what I was gonna say is he has come out of it better than most yes for sure because he's never stopped working out and he never stops stretching so we'll be on set that guy's stretching he says that length of strength he's he's always moving his body yeah you know it's like Kurt Angle told me instead of warrior he told me that he got injured way more he said gold medals in the Olympics it was a wrestler got what injured way more doing professional wrestling and over sure and he totin and bill told me the same thing but he had to come at me and he said look I'm gonna come out I'm gonna knock these two guys down and I'm gonna I'm coming for your head I'm gonna dive in come on so you have to dust on schooled yes but I had never seen I've never been that close to a prog a former pro football player is they these are stuntmen strong guys but it's a different thing he would just come off that line and his speed and he would hit these two dudes with his he got dirt like that and the thud that it sounded like maybe went when two elephants hit like just you know that that and they would go they would they went flying backwards horizontal and then he comes and dives and would come for my head and we kept Devin to the takeover because I'm a coward and I would I would you know I look like a potato bug you know worried I do anyway I feel like Goldberg is a guy who could do the same kind of movies that the rock does I do too I feel like he may be a gigantic movies I think he's a good actor that's the other thing I think he's really good on the show look at him he's a gigantic dude and I think he could be a big movie star I think he could do any kind of those action movies I know he's done a bunch yep but I mean I think he could be a huge megastar he's got all the personality so really nice I hunted smart funny yeah he's with it I could talk to the guys right there mm-hmm and very humble for a fucking ridiculously huge giant person just but such a weird athlete his hands his fingers like I was like how do you dial a cell phone if hangs it to fuck dick you hit two numbers Jimmy Pedro who was working for Fuji at the time and they installed oh no he was working for zebra excuse me at the time and they if he works for Fuji now and Jimmy Pedro was a gold medalist Olympics for judo and Jimmy Pedro set everything up and he he put the they put these mats down on like a raised platform so it had a little bounce to it like if you if you fell you got slammed or something like that and so they tested it out and so by testing that out Jimmy Pedro who probably weighs 175 maybe let me say you know with lean thin very strong guys throwing around Goldberg oh he was yeah I mean Gober was letting up yes executing Goldberg will throw himself but you see Pedro's technique is such that it's so good that he can do this Oh like look how easy that's my garage son so watch how it watch it watch how he does this I mean this is also this is Jimmy Pedro way after he's done competing he teaches now but look at that boom look at that technique those hip toss is fucking perfect just perfect technique look how much bigger Goldberger is them but he can throw them around and I was showing cold we're gonna do it yeah God knows on this shit already here see em kick and punch I have I've seen him work out he's fucking legit as fuck very much done that's a statement he's fucking said it's fucking legit as fuck I had an extra fucker to ruin the whole sentence it's all about harmony yeah but um he's uh like I said he's with it it's there he's also um like remarkably uninjured for someone who did what he did for so long he knows a lot about exercise physiology he's got some bumps I know he's got some shit going on but he still looks like him and I mean a lot of these guys are fucked up man where the back injuries have forced them to be like like very tight rigid they can't move so good anymore now that's where Diamond Dallas Page has done an amazing job is like getting these guys into yoga and getting these guys specifically into his style of yoga which is like a lot of dynamic tension stuff too he's helped so many of those guys get over like serious back injuries yes yes because dad douses back was fucked up man you know all those years were getting body-slammed all those he is picking up giant guys yeah all that shit his back was fucked up and he still has a fucked up back but he does yoga every day and his back is so strong that it keeps everything in place so all those yoga techniques with the what's really done better than anything for these wrestlers is stabilized their back like through through like a dynamic range right now you're doing standing bow you're doing you know you're leaning forward and doing like that T thing when you stand on one leg all that kind of shit is tremendous for your spine in your court and so that protects like a lot of guys with back injury that's him right there yes let me bad bro he's in his 60s he did that without God he did that without even warming up out here in the garage I could never do that I got his foot and stands up like that BAM I think Dallas is like 66 or something he's in tremendous shape he's a great guy that's super easy super infectious personality like he's so friendly and happy and he does so much for other people that are sick and injured he's got a bunch of videos of these guys like that guy right there who was so fucked up that he was walking with crutches who could barely get along and by the end of it Dallas had him running he had doing yoga look at there he's standing on his head like the guy lost a shitload of weight you got to do you keeping flexible is more important than anything else Dallas helps these guys he even had a foot he had a separate house right where he's keeping like jake the snake' and a couple of these guys and he had a separate house for them where he was like helping rehabilitate them and bring them back to health the other thing about getting older is you get sore faster I had ever such a stupid thing I had to have a wrestling match with my jeans don't ask together I couldn't get him off and why are you show only show why don't you get stretchy jeans no but it was part of the comedy you know oh that you couldn't move good new jeans I want to give away the episode of school you can have to wait i tied to my leg aware no sir as you know cuz he's unruly and he's always wanting to get in the feed bucket you know what that wasn't part of the joke those are your hog no but I do that like 10 50 takes and well I was sore the next day oh yeah ever sure I was sore the next day you have mats from comedy I was sore from physical comedy yesterday that's some serious physical comedy and that that is a point that I've I've heard before and I don't know if this is true but many people have told me and this is like this long-standing thing that you know Chevy Chase is kind of known as a grumpy guy yeah they said that Chevy Chase did so many pratfalls that he's in pain all the time that's it that's interesting just stop and think about all the times you saw Chevy Chase fall down in movies and in TV shows and one of the things that happens obviously to older athletes that play football or combat sports or boxing is getting beat up like that getting slammed around like that they got bad backs they get headaches they get some feel good you're always named yeah you know especially the athletes get the PTSD but what what you're seeing with him it very well could be that that guy hurt his body real bad doing pratfalls Buster Keaton who's like the very first ever stuntman who did crazy shit man if you ever watch like some old Buster Keaton films the stunts that that guy did back when they couldn't fake any yeah like nuts but I was always getting beat up his body was fucked up man yeah listen here Chevy Chase falling down bro I got news for you this is all legit and he fell a lot man constantly he was like almost like a Tom Green type character but now so yeah yeah but also a brilliant actor and comedian so he fell all the fucking time so I'm guessing as a person who's fallen a bunch of times yeah that guy's probably in pain a lot like all the time like people always say Chevy Chase is so grumpy yeah maybe he's just fuckin in pain oh yeah maybe just doesn't feel good how do you can't feel there's no way dude that's just a few he fell on Saturday live all the time he felt didn't he fall in Fletch remember that cop movie actually improved I think he felt everything bro you fell through everything so for me some of them might have a stuntman I was boxing so much and what I would do is I would just get in the ring and I would just start hitting mitts kind of light and fanned by light I mean you know I don't know 30% and then in about a minute I'm trying I'm going full because I'm warmed up I might feel great yeah and a guy who is a trainer walk by he said he used to be a pro football player and and now he trains a lot of pro athletes and he knows his shit and he walked by and he goes he looks at me and he goes think Chris Camacho Chris lifts the man goes he's not warming up again huh guidance fifties cool just going at it huh he just left them in common yeah that's all he said he knew but he knew and sure enough sure enough I'm still now I haven't mailed a box and I don't know three months dude cuz I fucked myself up cuz I didn't warm up you talk to a moron who had stem cells shot in his knee the other day because I tore my meniscus in a kicking contest with Joe shale and I saw my pants on I'm a moron no like there's no full blast it's gotta get gives a little bit sure cuz it's a padded thing that's a block that sits on the board whatever measures the amount of power whatever that's watching you kick and con that's not good that's not good that was not given yeah yeah done it it's not I'll tell you one thing though it's I'm not confident enough to sidekick it like turning back kick it like really really like right to like the hardest kick that I could do into it I don't want it doesn't give enough right you know like a spinning back kick or turning side kick the amount of torque that's involved when you have that knee up and you turn in the corner and then you shove that fucking thing through yeah oh my god the amount of torque that's involved if that thing doesn't move that's it that's gonna all be in your knee yeah I'm not interested in doing that so I won't do that but I'll kick it roundhouse kick roundhouse kick you just ride out kick you can kick a fucking bag that's not even gonna give it all like they have those fairtex bags they're like 300 pounds you've seen those big giant yeah that you can dig into that motherfucker and get okay your leg kind of gives - there's like a little bit of flex to a roundhouse kick but a straight kick it's like so much of it is on the joint of the knee so much of it like a side kick in particular so much of it when you extend like there's a lot of lot of pressure on that knee and a lot of pressure on the foot - if you if you hit it wrong look if you hit it with the ball of the foot instead of the heel oh my god you could break your ankle but you know some feel like guys like Henry cejudo those guys come out of the Olympic training centers like the national coach for the gym USA gymnastics team he was like my athletes don't get injured he I mean for the most part he said because the way we build them structurally and the boring is shit exercises we have our athletes do before they start kind of putting that kind of pressure on their joints so is pedantic its piecemeal but I was wondering like I'll see someone like sudo who is a fuck obviously a maniac with the way transmitted but he there's there's a science that when you're when you live at the Olympic Training Center there's a science with all those guys they're there they're working out there's no meathead shit oh no question they're working out is very specifically he had those neuro Force guys in here that's the name of the company right neuro force that helped train him they have all these like really like high tech cutting-edge training methods yeah and but you know he did get injured all right he fucked his shoulder up in his last fight he's actually had surgery in a fight yeah yes that's not natural yeah the TJ Dillashaw fight which happened you know so very quickly yeah oh no no no Marlin rice that's right it was a Marlin mirai's flanker it was post TJ Dillashaw damn island Mirage fight was fucking incredible the fact that that guy was able to weather that storm with that first round and and look Marlin mirai's in that first round looked like an assassin he looked like one of the best fighters ever and then says oh yes but pseudo just changed everything in the second round he got in his face he put it to him he'd be pressured him and Marlin was he felt too big too big when he's cut in the way like he he came right to to heaven it was too much of a drain on them and so who they're just overwhelmed them how would how would Aldo do against so that I've heard from other MMA fighters that they would never know until they fought you never never know but I like all the 135 pounds he looks so good against my eyes it's interesting they like the UFC it seems like is saying that Aldo could get a title shot even though he lost the decision to mirai's so I haven't talked to anybody I don't know what their position is on that decision I didn't think the decision was right I felt like Aldo controlled so much more of the fight yeah I don't like to I've said it a hundred times I'll say it 101 I don't like the way these fights are scored I don't think we should be using this really blunt tool for fine work right I think there's a lot that goes on in a fight and we should probably have a conference where martial arts experts and you know whether it's from different disciplines wrestling kickboxing whatever everybody get together and just like let's try to come up with a better solution someone should be able to come up with a better scoring system it doesn't have to be 1 to 10 this one to 10 is so are did you see although landing more shots yes you thought he was pressuring what way more he felt he was hitting him harder particularly after the first round the first round Maurice has one of the very best switch kicks in the game and his left high switch kick he fucks everybody up look at that man walks at me well he got hit with it yeah like the first shot Morais through was that fucking switch kick man his left switch kick is a thing of beauty it's so fast but it's also so loose he throws it like a whip man it surprises you it surprises me and I've seen him do it to Jimmy Rivera I've seen him do it too who else did he do it - he's onto a bunch of guys just comes out of nowhere yeah yeah the fuck else he did he catch with that left switch kick I can't Algie mean sterling that's right he caught him in this - dude the AL he knocked out remain out cold it's a bit we'll check this out see if I watch this watch this shit so Marv I switch kick is like if you wanted to model yourself after switch kick it would be his to the head and Barboza's to the body they're very different two very different switch kicks yeah because his is like faster it's weird man it's like he throws it and you don't see it coming yeah I throw it there what's it I want to see the actual one that he landed on although see that that was perfect right there but go to the one that he did on all dos he can find that the switch kicking landed on although early in the first round he does it so it's like a whip it's so loose it seems like he just does it effortlessly Barboza's though to the body and to the legs i've been stabbing catering for that against paul it's so crazy holy shit Barboza switch kick is so crazy just go what this is their frames missing from that video horrifying it's like there's frames missing yeah right yeah who had who had yeah well the guy I think the 35 or the guy who just fought our boy Urijah Faber right great - 40 years old and I'm a monster he's a monster he's so strong - stacked division man it's we he's strong man like not I mean he's one of those dudes that looks normal yeah but I think he's way stronger than he looks yeah there's guys that exist I set yes and a chimp strength a lot of them are Russian that's right Russian there's something about some of those Russian hands you grab them and you're like hey yeah what are you yeah I'm Russian by the way you can you can also say most of the great wrestlers and several from places like Jean Dagestan the Turkmen people where fighting is a way of life more as it's okay watch watch how it does this watch hallucis is oh man that's amazing yeah I mean that's amazing yeah but it's very sweet Oh see how whips yeah like I'm telling you man he might be the best in the world that left ice which the others still had his hand up there I saw yeah oh yeah yeah yeah I mean look all those fun but he did rock him he being definitely caught him yeah and I don't care who the fuck you are that right there is gonna hurt yeah yeah see it didn't really block it just glanced off the top of his head dude although it looks amazing at 135 he looks amazing I think he could be a world champion at 135 no bullshit I can't believe he can suck there anyway and by the way some 933 he's gonna say and I've no problem with him fighting for the title you know why cuz for nine years he was untouchable yeah nine years he's either 32 or 33 he is not old he's in the party thirties in his athletic prime yeah dude a lot of miles on him though oh yeah for sure you see a lot of scar tissue on them and you know yeah but still he's got a zest for fighting he fought really hard this past fight I mean whether or not you'd agree with the decision not it's it's a conversation really I mean I'm not right I have my own opinion I felt like Aldo did enough to win and I felt like I think people they I think there was a moment in the first round where you could say more eyes took control early landed some good shots and then he did get the take town later in the in the fight in the film that's that that first rounds like a tricky one first runs a tricky one like I can see you giving that close fight it doesn't matter yes I was fine with that I want it all though because I love although but you know I just don't by the way their scoring things it just doesn't make any sense to me I just I just don't I don't know how you're gonna get a ten nine and then another ten nine is a totally different thing you could have a 10-9 where a guy beats the shit out of a guy and you can have a 10-9 where who knows who won the round you could have a 10-9 where almost nothing happens or you have a 10-9 that's crazy right that doesn't make sense to me it doesn't oxidize to weapons yeah two extra two weapons no takedown what's better a takedown or punches what's better a jab or a body kick right better what's better I don't know we're gonna figure this out yeah you can't just have guys lose decisions and those decisions being made by people who shouldn't even be in this conversation well as far as like what's I worry less valuable in terms of like technique I would score it like this I think so if you're a boxer landing a jab is always easier than landing a right hand against somebody who's equally as good as you are okay so landing a right hands at motherfucker so for me I would always count so so I think that you know a push kick with your front foot is not the same as a switch kick that blasts somebody in their fucking head or their ribs so I would count those kinds of I don't know how you would how you would categorize it but maybe like the equivalent of what a right hand is which is somebody trying to actually close the deal knock you out versus set you up with a jab setting you up with a jab sending over the front kick setting up those things is different than blasting somebody with a double leg blasting somebody with a back foot roundhouse kick or wheel kick exactly there's so many weapons yeah there's so many on how you do that that would you because that's a strike regardless and sometimes that strike doesn't you know it doesn't do anything well you can yeah you can't have a guy who's like super durable right and you catch him with a couple of really good shots but then he takes you down and lands a couple good elbows who won the exchange I don't know I mean maybe if the end of the round is the guys on top I have no evidence that you're gonna get up you know you might get up eventually but so far you're on the ground and he's holding you down he's punching you that means a lot then again somebody can take your back right in their control you're doing great defense yeah but it means a lot the guy took you back we got it we got it mean we have to look at in terms of like your your percentage of being successful once you get to a position increases right with the complexity the position the control that you get in that position so if you get a person in half guard that is not as good as you having someone's back with the body triangle on and one arm around the neck and one arm controlling the hand right even if the guy is not tapped that guy is in significant danger well wrestling wrestling you get a point for an escape you get a point you when you take somebody down you get a point for that but when you take their back that's two points right that's fine that's good but you're close to finishing his life and you have his back yeah this point shit I don't want to hear this yeah then you get a guy's back you got a body triangle and you got an arm around the neck and you controlling the other arm somehow or another you're really close to taking his life yeah that's the difference so will this point stuff it's great like what's more important than escape is when a guy has your fucking back and he has an arm under your chin and and you're just fighting hands yeah you don't want to be there man and if he has enough squeeze and enough energy to just fuck like Demian Maia can make people tap across their face he can he gets you across your face and he cranks your fucking neck he knows how to manipulate necks so it's not just like him squeezing and hoping that it works he's gonna get his shoulder into it he's gonna get all this torque and you know he doesn't have to go into your neck never see his fight with Rick story yeah he's choking him and blood is squirting out of stories nose as he's freezing his neck I mean it's all that's Demian Maia Yeah right you know who I turned with now who's nice enough to teach me it's he can Machado I love he I love bother where's this school I'll give him a shout-out it's somewhere right now it's on it's on Wilshire eight one two six Wilshire Boulevard Brett he just gave Aston Kutcher a brown but I know he Thurston could just basically do it he must be legit I got jobs so riled up on the podcast cuz I said to shop shop goes it just bothered me that he ghen said that Ashton could could beat Conor McGregor in jujitsu and I went I knew I'd get to him I went well he's 6 for he's got very long arms and he goes he would destroy Ashton Kutcher and I got him so riled I was like I don't know bro I just kept going I don't know he lost his mind it's like it's not impossible for someone who's really dedicated to jujitsu to get to a point where they could tap an MMA fighter because most elite MMA fighters have many many skills and many many different like things that they're working on constantly if you're just concentrating on jujitsu courses guys yeah they're gonna be better at it just like if you just go to box you know if someone invites you you know like Terence Crawford invites someone to go to his camp and box like in fact TJ Dillashaw said that about lomachenko that he box with lomachenko and I felt like he was just being kind to him of course like he said he felt like who's like once the guy opened up he's like oh shit yeah yeah that's sport no mokou is nice to have a divorce even fuck him up yeah speaking of warming up there's a great video of him warming up and I watched I was like that's how a pro does it lemme tell ya I'm switch dance which dance one arm one arm one everything is slow and methodical he's not doing anything stupid he has like a whole system that he does to warm his body up before he starts moving really fast and throwing punches yes and he's 26 or whatever yeah here it is right here but you watch this and he goes yeah this is what you're supposed to do when you're a fucking professional I've had a chance to see it live once with Manny Pacquiao really yeah Manny Pacquiao was doing this thing at wild card Boxing and I got to watch him train a little bit and I got to watch him warm up with these bands he has these little little bands and he does his warm-up things he warms everything up me his body is a race car you know he's not doing that dumb shit that you and I would do just go in there to see what how much just getting in there and going yeah re and Burton and Tom we're in the back fucking around my weights and none of them could do 225 and so I went back there's ours our crew drew 225 and I was drunk I was like fuck yeah could do 225 so I did 225 for 12 how I stopped you have no warmup 51 years old terrible yeah it's pretty damn good I'm glad I didn't hurt anything that's exactly I could've easily gone pop of course weights come down boom pin me to the chest but you got competitive and then my arm swells up with blood because it's you ever see a guy when they blow their bicep or their their chest their pack out yes oh it's so nasty I feel like you and I should do a dance competition and Schobert and Tom but time Bert are both athletic dudes they're actually both athletic guys here's my prediction yeah Tom can dance assassin yeah and legit dance but can you ever see him swing a golf club he's an athletic dude yeah he's a big dude too guys um here's my prediction yeah they keep ramping it up really I don't think we're done I think I think you're good about to see some epic shit really I think they're gonna keep ramping it up yeah I feel like I want in I mean I know that I I know I'm being derivative and I'm copying but I want to I want to fucking dance you know why don't you have your own I think they both already have scripts written for their retorts and I don't know who's gonna go first well it's gotta be birds birds got to be next because Tom just murdered them you can't you can't double down like this shit was ruthless I mean come on man this shit was ruthless and what happened you spill over yourself spilling you hug fuck this is this video you've seen this video right come on oh it's the best bro it's amazing but here's this amazing cell layer it's actually good I know like this part like watch this I mean come on look at him moving around dude he danced great I know and that's why he was offended by Bert's he's like this dudes pretending knows how to dance just cuz it takes his pants off I'll show you you got more mad when people gave him credit for it - they're like oh look a bird dancing mmm he did get mad yeah I didn't understand that I was a little confused I felt like he was laying back like if we're gonna do a hip hop dance contest you know I mean like he's the guy at the bar that pretends you can't play pool I mean I played a couple of times oh by the way selling those machine shirts machine you go buy those at your mom's house calm I'm gonna bother I said I said that I say to Rogen I put them on right this idea was before they were doing the dance thing I remember I said to I go I had sob Eddie you and me and I said let's do a fucking dance-off and then and then and then Brogan comes back with a if we do a dance-off you're gonna want to win and I don't know if I had the time to dedicate to that shit I was like you got serious right away you get competitive I'm a moron yeah I knew what you would do whatever you had to do to win I have kept my most ridiculous moron tendencies at bay yes for most of my adult life but when we did sober October last year and I was making the fire alarm go off from my sweat like I was telling them I'm like you're gonna die I'm like if you're gonna show you I'm willing to do you're gonna die you don't understand I work out 8-10 hours a day you'll kill yourself we're gonna die it was like I know when you're a young man you said to me like I I think I might fight was the snipes and and you were I was cuz you looked you were like pulsing you look like a fucking the top like one of those guys who gets caught in nuclear waste your veins and everything are just like and you were breathing like chocolate down I go hey what's up it's not really much I'm just training I'm training all the time I was training all the time I was training twice a day it was really hard but I thought it was really gonna happen like we had Moses and athlete he owed a lot of money to the IRS that's what it was he he got in a real bad situation apparently where someone was advising him that he didn't have to pay taxes you know what man oh man you ever checked the Constitution you're you're your own here your own Island your own country that horseshit shit doesn't work my friend did that my friend did that this is what he did he he said he declared himself a sovereign state and then he had decided he was going to run illegal substances cross state lines he gets caught and he goes I'm my own sovereign state I can do whatever I want the cop goes that's awesome you're going to jail now they put him in court he had a whole defense he I'm a sovereign state I refuse to give you my name they were like the judge was like very cool you're going to jail now for eight months we'll see you later Ken Ken and I had a record okay I have that work out for you not well at all some people read the Constitution these somehow or another decided they're experts yeah but what is it what is it going there's a lot of that going on these days where people like have this idea that fuck all these legal scholars yeah like I see the loophole yeah and I'm gonna point this out in front of the judge and it will be undeniable like rub pay your taxes right who's gonna who's gonna fix the streets because they listen to they listen to but usually people just want to be part of a larger thing right so actually most people are saying what was given to them and it feels good emotionally and one of the things as you get older that's really important to do is to always be willing not only to change your mind and admit that you probably you could be hopelessly wrong and it could be completely wrong but also to always be able to justify with reason and with measured argument your most cherished beliefs okay because so much of who we are is what we believe right so much of who we are is just where I stand politically whereas all those things that I've worked hard to kind of come up with a comprehensive political and philosophical you know mooring to stand on well if if I am if I if I then relax and I I listen and accept what's given to me without you know putting it through the grinder and really sitting down and testing it then I'm I'm guilty of being philosophically complacent and you know and basically it's just your slave to your ego right you just don't want to admit you're wrong about things yes but I think you can't be married to ideas know who you are as how you go through this life yes and it's how you go through this life now this is what's very important for people you know I try to talk about this as much as possible you can't get you can't get stuck in your past because like mistakes that you made when you were a child can haunt you deep into adulthood yes because you decide that you're the person who got bullied after seventh grade and you're a loser and everybody hates you and those feelings you can cling on to those fuckers and they'll weigh you down you can cling onto them and you can take them into your later life and I know people that are like man they're in their 60s there was this this maybe you told me this but did you tell me the story about this dude who's like an older guy that was afraid to walk down a certain Road because this other older guy who used to bully him in high school lived there no he didn't tell me this somebody told me this and this guy was in his 60s and he was scared to go down this road because this guy lived there who used to bully him in high school and the guys still fucked with them still fucked with them bro there's some people that get stuck like that you have to get close also those guys that's why I think for a lot of guys you know walking into an MMA gym it's terrifying but it's ok everything start with you know one tiny step and I like I like doing anything that makes me feel uncomfortable and and takes me off my pins and huge because I it opens up new pathways of understanding somehow or it certainly forces me to so what I do now with people who I disagree with philosophically you know like say I'm talking to somebody who's a hardcore socialist or something like that it's okay but what I what I try to do is I just try to listen to them really but I try to kind of zero in instead of like immediately throwing my hands up did you see what Britney Cummings said the other day Britney Cummings Whitney Whitney coming no did I say Britney did I I think I was slobbering it's okay too much of that chimeric got american coffee does people say why you coughing so much I don't want to tell the truth it's to merit coffee um shit what was I just saying you said Whitney Cummings oh she got reported to HR on a show she was on cuz as she was leaving she said Merry Christmas some intern no yes intern was offended it's called human resources because she said Merry Christmas and her response was hey I really don't give a fuck if you have a good Christmas it's just a nice thing to say yeah I gotta give a fuck about your Christmas I don't even know you like something that's reported or that that's something that's very fucking important for people to realize about the West something that's really unique about the West and Western civilization is that imperialism racism sexism all these isms that we are guilty of well the West didn't invent these things but we did you know we were egregious violators in some cases of that you know slavery was a real thing in this country but what's what's unique about the West and I'm getting this thing is that we were the first to label it and condemn it and the West has always been a country that seems always to be in the process of for its past fencing for instance that is not common that is unique to and self-criticism is part of it as a society we are so people like that silly girl who that's been going on actually in one way or another for a long time now it's the intern yes now it's way more I don't know if it's a girl or a boy no no it's a little bit more it's it's way more but but that's actually to the character of this country we have always had people who kind of went mad you know that's wrong I don't want to do that the this is this isn't fair all that kind of stuff and it was a fucking it would always cause all kinds of problems but that's extreme that's a silly goose whoever's doing that is well it's Hollywood there's a Hollywood thing where these people can't be liberal enough they're trying so hard to be progressive that they just become a ridiculous yeah they get so reactionary and everyone's scared that they're gonna be out of the woke loop like maybe they're behind they're letting something slide they should have stepped up for because now you can get in trouble if you don't come out against someone saying Merry Christmas like hey man you know where were you when that fucking pig said Merry Christmas do you know what Christmas means yeah like do they want to take away the word supremacy and quantum supremacy which is quantum computing it's next level next step computing and yeah there was an article about Google achieving quantum supremacy and they were like well we don't like the term supremacy because it reminds people of white supremacy do you know what I think about those people do you know anything about a lot of people they're already there they're not they're young they're not experienced and they're not that bright well this is the thing is they are bright they just aren't wise they're very smart and they know they are which is one of the reasons why they want to make an argument to push something like that through and think that it makes sense it's because they're so smart but what they're not is is you get seasoned by your interactions with human beings you're naive when you're younger and then as you get older you get seasoned in mind changes but you also get seasoned meaning you experience so many different human beings that exhibit sort of stereotypes and these like patterns of behavior and you got to know when people are being knuckleheads and you've got to know when people are being wise and objective and you got to know when people are being kind and loving and you got to know when people are being assholes so you can see all the different things as you get older you get more data you know and a lot of these kids are like 20 22 and they're yelling about the world like that Greta Thornburg check the heat breaking ever she's sixteen he's a kid listen you've got some good points but this they're using you well what happens is as you get older and you try to solve problems at the level of detail so if you and I had to really solve some problems let's say health care and if you and I'm sitting here I'm not solvent she if we had to try right what would happen is we might come with more of a Republican or Democratic or a liberal or conservative sensibility initially I think once you get down to the level of detail and you're trying to solve these problems already that ideology kind of goes out the window because now you're dealing with hard numbers and math and you're trying to deal in percentages and you're trying to deal with what's the best policy for the most number of people and so it becomes way way grayer and way less teeny if you are somebody that has to solve problems if you are somebody who has to turn a profit if you're somebody who has to figure out what your what your clientele actually will buy and I think sometimes that's why people who own businesses and and people have to make the trains run on time have a different philosophical and political point of view then do people who essentially spend a lot of time reading thinking and writing in an academic institution right because you don't need to get down to the level of detail you can stay in that wonderful world of theory and that's an important world it's not to say that you shouldn't have that but a lot of journalists come from that world they come straight from that world of theory that world of that intellectual pursuit and and they come right into then they see the world and I think that might be why a lot of times people in the media tend to be a little bit more ideological maybe a little bit more liberal depending cuz you could say Fox News is just as fuckin ideological on the other side but I do think your your perspective changes when you have to get down to when you're in the real world yes yeah no it's like both though yeah right and this is what what I think we need to make this distinction like you need these quantum theorists you need these historians you need these people that are just completely yeah engaged in whatever the subject is yeah and you know and they're just lifelong academics and this is what yeah but what the real problem is when people come out of these universities and they have these sort of hard blind ideas of how the world needs to change they're revolutionaries yeah yeah and they there's it's very exciting yeah it's very exciting so they want to burn down the whole bill and that's what you start looking for witches okay and then you start going that bitch said Merry Christmas yeah and that's what that is yeah that's what's nuts Google's calling it quantum supremacy can you fucking believe this shit yeah we gotta break it down down there yeah it's a lot of it is being young but young people can do some when they get together and then the Communist revolution was you know this is also what discourse is so important right like young people need to talk to other people you know I like a lot of these people with these ideas are one day gonna laugh at those ideas they're one gonna look back oh my god when I was twenty I was so stupid just like you have done just like I have done just like basically everybody does is they get older you start thinking oh my god when I was 18 what a fucking moron I was oh my god when I was 24 you only have a stupid shit I thought I should do I mean that's part of life you also have to realize that is historically that thing I sent you but there's a people ask me what I read and stuff if you go to audible.com and go to the great courses I listen to these courses I just listen to 48 lectures by a guy named Robert Buchholz who is this fucking amazing professor on the foundations of Western civilization one of the things he says in it is he said Europeans I mean the history of Europe I mean culminating with World War one and World War two as bloody and as violent it's beyond what we can imagine how many how many millions were killed in World War two it's it's beyond what we can imagine but Europeans figured out and it's a huge accomplishment and first time in history for anybody they figured out how to solve their differences without killing each other and that happened after World War two and it took that long they actually figured out a way to solve their differences by disagreeing by fighting about it by fighting dirty but by electing their by by winning election here's a question the war in Europe all the countries involved yeah what was the what was the size of the landscape we're looking at and can in like relationship the United States when you look at France Germany and England like what is that well it wasn't just Germany oh yeah sure Russia I think it's five time zones right Russia's giant rich Russia is a different animal right because Russia is you know that's Asia yeah and Russia Russia would just rely on old general winter but the European aspect of it the European part of World War one and to how much what I was thinking is like it's almost like having a war inside America right yeah I mean it's really close I think I think if you look at if you if you take France Spain Italy you know Germany Poland all those areas if in Rhode Island Hungary Austria yeah all those you know Bulgaria Romania Yugoslavia and Florida was tough doesn't floor how big is that area that's not a Google thing they're like World War one map forty maps that explain World War one so it was a different thing that's how you're talking about right now the whole world yeah - is everything right World War one the Ottoman Empire was crumbling right so Turkey's Empire was crumbling so Turkey got the Middle East involved the British weren't were you know we're involved in Middle East they were fighting the Turks that that whole area became theater for Sudama I'm on my third wild west book in the last couple weeks really yeah yeah about the history the bar wasn't me tell you this one it's a blood and thunder yeah blood and thunder an epic tale of the American West it's about Kit Carson and the mountain yeah bro rough dudes bro and just the the the wars with all the various tribes and the chaos and the way they would kill people oh my god it's so crazy the Native Americans oh yeah one of these stories that I was reading I don't think it was this one it was wasn't a Kit Carson one it was the the one on General Custer General Custer was the last one which was son of the morning star that was the last one when I was reading burro is one the one guy one Native American guy wants to fuck this other guy's wife so he he tries to get him he can't get him eventually finds him one day kills him eats his heart cooks his heart comes back and tells everybody then marries the lady well you got to eat a man's heart because you impose his will on imagine you're married you're a woman you're married to a guy and this other dude who wants to fuck you he kills your husband and eats his heart and then you say getting this teepee big boy that's that's pretty fucking gangster that's pretty fuckin because the guy loved you and I'm gonna eat his heart I'm gonna eat his love for you he cut out he cut two fingers off of his hand because he couldn't get to her and he loved her so much damn he was angry that he couldn't kill any winner over well he must have won her over he cut two fingers off his hand before he got to her damn and then found the guy after he cut two fingers off his huh yeah killed the guy yeah ate his fucking heart served it came back told everybody liked ate most of the heart yeah that's a stalker that's it that's it that's a whole stage five stalkers know or is that go past it's yeah yeah made his heart ate his heart remember like when we used to have those terrorism colors like today's yellow no worries yeah remember was a flag yeah that's it that's it this is it my defense of Europe this was from 1917 and paper in London made this this was explaining the battle area battle zones so all of it fit in the center of the country right and they compared it even yeah goddamn dude just imagine if that shit was going on in the center of the country if Montana was at war with Wyoming and Colorado it was all it's all trench warfare to see is really interesting because there are some parallels now world war 1 if you look at World War 1 it was a time when first of all the world hadn't been Europe hadn't been the war for a hundred years and so when people went in the war in World War one they were I mean they went in every young man volunteered and even women volunteered to be nurses and to cook so it was this increasing in songs never gonna be gone for two weeks and it was gonna be really exciting and it was romantic and and no one including the soldiers really understood the technology like machine guns and and that kind of technology and mustard gas and they didn't know they were still fighting the way they had been fighting for millennia which was on horseback feathers in their helmets and charging with great bravery and so what happened was they would charge and the other side would open up with machine guns and and artillery and then ultimately poison gas and so the numbers are too staggering to even imagine but like for 800 yards to you know to try to capture that much land or whatever they would lose they lost something like 300,000 men and a day and that's what was going on they were just getting mowed down that many oh dude the numbers are crazy the Battle of the Somme my camera what it was it it was beyond like the number of men that were lost per foot I remember I had to ask three times because I couldn't believe it and because they were just so you're you're arrogant commanders would blow a whistle sometimes they would kick a soccer ball and you would follow the soccer ball over the ditch and run as they were shooting it uh-huh and you'd and if you didn't you'd be tried for cowardice sometimes you'd be shot by your commanding officer in the back your head because remember a lot of these armies were conscripted they were brought in against their will from you know this was the time of imperialism when the country that was bigger and stronger the austro-hungarian Empire Austria so would come in and say you belong to us now there were these secret alliances that would happen and so that battle was so insane and they it was just it was a true meat grinder it was a true meat grinder and then you'd have no man's land right so you'd have no man's land and that was the area where they would they would come in they you know they had to cross to kill and Men you'd hear them dying and groaning but nobody could get to them it was the fucking it was the worst man it was the worst and in those trenches the body parts and everything and then people would have to go to bathroom there and then the rain would come you were living in a gutter it was beyond what people can imagine it was beyond it was the most horrific thing and the only thing that was worse was something called World War two which is essentially a continuation of that first European civil war and and I don't know man it's it's beyond what we can we're so far less than this time like that yes sir less than a hundred years or so inside of one person's lifetime yeah the 1945 sorry Ahri's dad is a Holocaust survivor yeah yeah Ari Shaffir is dead yeah there's a fucking Holocaust survivor you know I mean that's how close it is and that all came from this idea back then that you could perfect society and perfect human beings yes six inch howitzer yeah human bones you know where this is where the idea of where ideas can be so dangerous this idea that human beings are a blank slate and they'll that you can make them anything you want you can re-educate them in a camp and they'll be what you want this is the history of of Europe and and those ideas lost ground that's why the individual it's so fucking important for the individual to take precedence over the state this is also why it's so important for people to be able to express themselves that's what I mean for people to you know but fidelity to the state and a fascist Society in Gunness was fidelity to the state the collective must be superior to the individual the individual you're a tiny leaf on a tree if you have a society like that somebody's gonna run that somebody's gonna set that doctrine and they and they will justify killing twenty thirty million all the ways I say if they're doing it for the country sure yeah you know there's so many patterns like that that just repeat themselves over and over again with human beings and power you know Hitler by many accounts seem to genuinely enjoy World War one he enjoyed it and then he got blinded by mustard gas and he couldn't believe Germany surrendered he couldn't believe it and a German physician there's one record of the German physician saying characterizing Hitler as follows again this is from Buckholtz lectures it said because this person is not fit to command humans and is a and is dangerously psychotic and because of a lot of crazy reasons he was able to start the join the Nazi he's worked and he actually started as a minder for the German army what's the mind oh so a guy who spied on subversive groups oh look a rat yeah revolutionary groups that's how he came across the nationalist socialist pardon our National Socialist Party yeah then nuts you know the Nazis and but kind of went you know what I like these guys yeah joy yes I want fucking war so that's like if you had an undercover FBI agent he became one of the Hells Angels took over the organization because that's he took over right but World War two like like that but the crazy thing about right before World War two Todd everything like today so you ever notice how today we can't agree on really even source material if you have an argument something where'd you get your information CNN what or right box news you fucking you and if the conversation that he came and start right because we don't have now we're talking about a simulation maybe this whole thing maybe we you and I are just self-replicating machines you know what so nobody really knows at this point it's really hard to arrive at a fixed point of truth right back in the day the Bible was your fixed point of truth maybe Aristotle but at the turn of the century like right before World War one man like you had Darwin comes along you had your the he'd come on but you had Freud who said something to the effect of hey were animals and we're basically we will kill and use as sexual tools if we don't have a strong Society and there were all these like there were all these sort of new nietzsche marks who said god is dead Arad Nietzsche said god is dead but Marx basically said religion is the opiate of the masses human beings are the masters of their own fate and all of these guys who basically took God out of the equation and all of them were basically saying that we are animals and God isn't it God is no longer here we're animals and if you don't create a society control our animalistic impulses we're gonna fuck and slaughter and rape each other and World War one proved all of those guys right basically but it was a time when they're worse everything was up in the air Einstein comes along and says time and space hmm not so fast it's actually relative why huh because yeah time doesn't exist like a stop works God didn't start a stop watching that's what Newton said but actually if good luck trying to work your way through that you can't the one way if you though if you go fast enough into space and then come back everybody here will be old and you'll be the same age did you know how that works yeah I do but it's still like what it's really weird do you know III think this is true this is what I read he was walking he was like in where was he surance with Solano motherfucker this he's gets off that he's trying to come up with he's he's thinking about the theory of relativity or whatever and he gets off the train and he's walking away from the train station he turns and looks at the clock and the clock says let's say 6 o'clock it turns miss Clarkson he turns back around and he stops and he goes wait hold on I was walking away from the clock so when I saw the clock it said 6 but that's how long it took the light to get to my eye by the time the light hit my eye was actually later because the light has to hit my eye for me Jim Stan by a fraction it was ya later so he said what about was moving at the speed of light time would stand still tunk tunk cuz the light would never hit my eye it's a weird thing to say but I was like that's a fuckin yeah but I wonder if that works with biological aging they wonder biological aging is on constant right oh that's interesting entropy right well I know that like time would be different right but I wonder like when you say time standstill but it's gotta exist if you're alive it's got exist somehow biologically your body's not gonna stop heart beating and breathing right so how many heartbeats do you have in you I mean that's part of what life is life is like you got a limited number of heartbeats if you wanted to really break it down like how many of them you're gonna use where you're going through Lightspeed those don't count I know you're gonna beat your heart's gonna beat right right so how long is it actually gonna take in real time down on earth while you're up there cuz it now I think it's gonna be like where you're moving so fast that it feels like ten minutes because it is ten minutes to you and then you come back you've only aged ten minutes but it might be ten years down here well didn't you have somebody on your podcast me was they were talking about how you don't what what ages you the reason we look older than we did 25 years ago is because of entropy so things mix things mix and you can't unmix them just listen to this book about time and these concepts just came up swear that you're talking about after the whole book I was more confused about time the order of time but by the way that's a great name Carlo Rovelli it's like if you uh if you were a Czech and your friend was gonna introduce you to a guy and this name was Carlo Rovelli yeah he's a New York Times selling author bestseller he plays jazz at night okay he goes Valley yeah he'll smoke one clove cigarette a month okay according to this book sighs I cook different like up higher than it does lower for instance if you had to synchronize clocks even on the top of this table in the ground they would not be synced up over at about times why why because because this is what Carlo Rovelli moves slower at sea level so if you live at sea level you will live longer than people that live higher okay that's because Jenny's much I want to be fucking Italian so bad they dude where's your you have a lot of Italian in you like what percentage do you have in you yes I'm 51% 51 but I want to speak this way you know I be romantica this is something about being born like in a country that has like a long rich tradition I know you know if you're born somewhere like if you're born in Spain you know your grandfather was a bullfighter you're born in yeah I love a flair for the dramatic as you know halona about Helena I was in I know I was a young man I was like 19 I was at fucking Club Med with my family and he just the girls and everything there was odd a shit like CrossFit she wasn't doing cross her but she looked like it she wasn't such an athlete I've always liked muscular you know and I'm looking at him this guy who saw me that I am her he was and I remember forgotten just cause he goes oh she's beautiful and you know I wanna be you man I want to say that once in my fucking life I never watch like that show Vikings you ever see that show vows it's a fun show it's actually a very good show under very underrated show yeah a lot of people get fucked up and killed but one of the things that I was thinking a lot of it happens in Rome a lot of it happens in Europe is a lot of crazy shit with the Vikings but while I was watching I was thinking those people had kids and their people had kids and there be blood kids and their people had kids and their their kids have iPhones like it's not ago yeah those people that live in that part of the world those people that live in Ireland those people that live in in Great Britain and a lot of that area like a lot of the folks who lived there are the ancestors of these people that lived this insane history right insane history of warfare with swords and shields and shit and these motherfuckers yeah that's the movie or that's the show runs a good show man hey whatever happened to one of my favorite UFC fighters who's a Valhalla Viking motherfucker the guy he's from Sweden shredded out of his mind which guy meet Emil meek he fought at 170 yeah the Sameach he's a beast he's art he's a rock and rollers they say Mecca say it's a guitar - I think pronounce his name Mac you get more shredded you mat it he's a he's a fucking gorilla and he's super strong - yeah a good fighter I don't know what's going on with him I haven't lassic classic viking he was at the event last weekend so what is one was his last fight when did he have a fight yeah it's been him well you know sometimes these dudes they'll hurt something yeah you know they're out for like Cub Swanson just tore his ACL I know and yeah he's gonna be out for almost a year he'll to fight in February oh yes okay who's he fighting Matthews oh that's good fine hmm um yeah cub was in a grappling match against Jake Shields who's a fucking huge guy he's quite a bit bigger than yeah just huge and jake has SiC grappler and Jake had his legs laced up and cub was trying to work his way out of it and just a freak thing it just popped and his nina's meniscus is ACL blew out and he just got surgery on it Jake used me as a dummy once I would say I rolled with him and I'd he used me as a dummy mm-hmm I said why did you beat me up so bad he didn't know me because I didn't know if you're good I'm watching a position that you talked about on your podcast I was like hey doctor and hurt yeah no he just he had to make sure that I was one with the mat though Oh make sure that I was getting the mat get your let's get let's go get your fucking face against here let me go well I gotta clean the mat a little dirty so let me just you know well he's a competitor professionally you know he doesn't have no time to be fake rolling with people no don't ever girl he has like these he's a pro I had no business being on the mat with him he's still doing like really competitive grappling too like he's he's hung with him he's really smart he's a very good guy but he's also intellectually curious like Jake does a lot of reading like I have very good conversations with Jake really smart guy super good grab well he submitted Mark Munoz at that event too yeah Jake's legit and I've seen him in grappling competitions like long before he ever fought in the UFC I feel like we hundred and eighteen pounds in his last has been missing any meal mark looks big yeah I don't know how make sure he definitely is not in sorry Marcus I'm sorry mark if somebody was choking maybe you're not that yeah that's cub CC's they're laced up like this and as he's moving there his knee just copped good that's all it can happen man in weird ways when you have legs tangled up like that just sometimes someone will just lean one way and it puts a lot of pressure on your knee and it just explodes it might be the toughest being in on the planet he's not a vegan he's not staring eyes eggs I enjoyed your I enjoyed that game-changers with Chris crecer and it's there's a little bit like listening to a Protestant and a Catholic argue over the minutiae of how to worship God like they both believe in God like or like a Sunni and a Shia it was it was very interesting in that sense like how human beings get steeped in in too much information and then we'll start parsing out stuff that's not that helpful - well it's a long conversation the conversation about health is very long and unfortunately when Chris was talking about the game changers he got several things wrong particularly the big ones were the amount of protein that you can get in peanut butter the amount of protein that's in bread and whether or not that is equal to three ounces of ground meat right and what Wilkes are showing is that it is and he made his point very well and that made Chris his argument not look very good right and then there was the other problem whereas Chris Crestor sort of personally defined what he defines as low car versus medium car versus high carb and wasn't making a distinction that this is not the consensus amongst nutritionists what they consider low carb medium car partner James accused him of that Chris denied it and then James pulled out all of these different articles that show that he has a different version of what he calls the low carb medium carb or high carb the problem with all this is he's just making Chris look bad and he's not necessarily proving that a vegetarian or vegan diet is better for you but he is rightly pointing out that he was wrongly criticized yes so I guess I was very impressed I was very impressed James ability to come prepared here I do believe he spent 3000 hours I'm in an hour a thousand hours I believe that yeah I believe that now he knows him after talking to him about this in the way he handled it how but I kept going back to what Chris was saying which was hey hey I believe in plants I eat mostly plants a little animal products that some animal products is gonna it's gonna get is this an easier way to get p1 yeah that's the problems not gonna kill you that's the problem with doing a documentary and then that's a problem with someone criticizing the documentary you know it's like but but the documentary he's got enough stuff that he can say you were inaccurate with with the criticism so that then we get lost in the argument like is meat bad for you is it like that's the main it's not that's the best era me but the way they're conflating it with people who were advertising for cigarettes and doctors advertising for cigarettes back in the day and saying that cigarettes are fine these are the same people that are doing this like no the problem is everyone was aware for a long time that cigarettes are not healthy right this is not the case with me no these studies that were you connect people with all these diseases with meat they connect their diet as a whole they could be eating cheeseburgers and bread like soda and lifestyle and drinking and smoking but they also eat meat versus people who don't eat meat well if someone is going to be conscientious and think about even if they're incorrect and they just assume that the science says the eating meat is bad for you you start eating more fish or more chicken or more vegetables you clean up your diet I bet just statistically those people have less drinking and statistically they have less it's cigarette smoking they're probably healthier on the whole because they're making choices that even if it's incorrect they think are good for you like not eating meat or as much meat but as a non nutritionist there's no shit yeah when I watched game-changers I have to say that it did seem like the narrative the story of the movie was that being a vegan is better for you for all these reasons all these scientific reasons then eating any meat that's that's what I me it was a vegan film the honeymoons would probably disagree with that for me just as a viewer the argument was being made that being a vegan that from what I from just what I got right the retros what was meant I got that being a vegans better for you it keeps your dick hard you won't die of cancer and you'll have less inflammation more endure those things are more endurance all of which seemed you know I talked to Lane Norton about this for a while and he had written this thing I don't think he had a video you could watch his video game changes debunked we broke down basically every single claim that they made that was incorrect okay scientifically as a PhD scientist I mean he absolutely understands the the the what's really going on when it comes to nutritional science and I would just said at the end of the day this is a debate about can you eat some meat in there but here's the problem because of cursors criticism of the film he was in every right he had every right to defend I respect criticism respect and he did it right yeah the problem was we didn't get any closer at the end there was there was some confusion that was about whether or not it is healthy or not healthy to eat meat he was citing some studies and Kresser was saying those studies aren't valid because of this and that and that's where we would have been if we had a guy like Blaine Norton in here would have helped a lot we could have someone actually explain but you could also have a guy who comes in and goes hey guys here's the thing man let's just look at cultures that live a long time and have vibrant you know lives and good lives some of it is like I'd like to look at the Blue Zones who eat meat and they have stayed a lot of times they eat some form of dairy and they drink they have good communities they don't retire there's a lot more to longevity and health and living a good life than being a purist for sure whether or not it's in this direction or that direction I think it's all in like though it's the result of a real conversation that we really need to have because overpopulation is real so the conversation is really ultimately what is sustainable you know and it's not what is sustainable right now for your lifespan it's like what is sustainable for the future and should we engineer for a better tomorrow because it already are though we sort of are we're not though people are acting as individuals there's not really a whole lot of engineering in terms of slowing down the rate of childbirth or trying to prevent people from having too many kids trying to and overpopulation whatever but there are a lot of cultures I mean a lot of countries and societies are at zero populations something yes but the thing the thing is there's plenty of people that live below the poverty line in terms of like what our perception the poverty line is and what you're seeing in a lot of these more industrialized nations is as people start developing careers and men and women get careers you have less childbirth like you've seen that in Japan Japan has apparently an issue with a lack of childbirth not as many as they should it's not sustainable they worry about that with some countries and Herman's heard that about the United States that one day it's gonna what even out and then everyone will have careers and then we'll have less children and then it's a statistic that China is having trouble we're having enough they have more elderly so they're having trouble yet is this crazy but China has is having trouble getting enough people to handle their economy and skilled workers which was shocking to me yeah but there's so many people right yeah so they're importing labor which is like what because they were kept at one child per family in China can do that I didn't I went to Beijing and I had to do a retinal scan and they were very specific about they give you a phone and they were like no no shooting a movie they give you a phone you have their firewalls you can't just surf the web and they very they very clearly have signs that say any criticism of the government and when you're an actor they say this will not be tolerated you will be and then you talk to people that live there and they'll date they say say things like dude you disappear that you can just disappear on the street if you're us if you're a you know so I don't know man what I fuck man I've got billion of them yeah I got problems with that a billion of them and they're being controlled by his crazy oppressive government always been ain't nothing but your regular I know but it's weird to see that in 2019 right it's weird to see that online become more authority yeah in some ways well it's I guess their grip is looser so they're clawing more you know they're trying to squeeze harder if you you think about all of human history this is the way that empires were run but they weren't run with technology and the run while the people had access to technology so the fact they're clamping down on web searches and well you know what sites you can visit and you know there's a lot of companies that felt like they had to do business with them too like I was talking this lady who worked at Google and she was saying look they're going to copy Google or we work with them yeah so like this idea of like you shouldn't work with them because they're gonna censor the people I get listen they're censoring ya no matter what but if we don't go over there there's gonna copy our shit it's a massive market well the copying thing the intellectual property thing they don't give up that's true espionage is huge it's crazy yeah Wow the Huawei thing that fucking head of Huawei his daughter is being held captive in Vancouver do you know about that yeah but Google that the head of Huawei Huawei has been accused of some crazy backdoor shit they put into routers and they're really worried about their technology getting into this country in the United States has stopped the production of their cell phones in the United States like you have to buy them from somewhere else and bring them in sort of you know what's it called what's it called when a it's not connected to someone who's buy a cell phone it's not connected to somebody you know in the continent now it's on tether it's like that though whatever I'll remember it but you could buy one of those on like Amazon or one of those tech websites but you can't get it at Verizon you can't get at AT&T they blocked all that and they're like terrified that this company that has become their number two now they're right behind Apple like apples number one is Apple no Samsung Samsung is number one they're number two and apples number three so they've passed Apple in cell phone production China's always had I think I had a humility they were humiliated in their past you know by the British by a lot of different you know by the Japanese who are behaved atrociously but you know that you know the opium wars were where where the British were traders were bringing in opium from India to China and China developed a major opium problem so the Emperor and the government said this is a major problem guess what Britain you can't sell your opium on our docks you're unloading huge boxes of fucking opium from India and I know you're making a lot of money but no because we have a major addiction problem and Britain said you're interfering with free trade and we should be allowed to and China said you're not allowed to and so they went to war and Britain won that war and forced China's to continue buying opium what was this called the opium wars and pull up that of 19 and that's why Hong Kong became well that's why the British took Hong Kong and leased it for a hundred years look at this under house arrest in Vancouver Huawei CFO lives in luxury and spends her days out shopping [Laughter] where GPS so take that in life you make her wear a GPS monitor she it's she has to stick to 11:00 p.m. curfew so by the way she's tired by 11:00 anyway so her dad owns Huawei is that what it is yeah she's well she's the CFO also so I don't know bring her up she queue doesn't her dad on Huawei it's not what it is it didn't say that let's just say she might be a daughter of billionaire founders so she can okay why is she under house arrest though because they think Huawei is doing a bunch of really shifty things well they are the u.s. wants to extradite her on the grounds that she tricked banks into potentially violating Iran sanctions has sparked an unprecedented diplomatic row yeah now they don't give a thoughts they're doing business on everybody that's showing up with a briefcase full of cash and nuclear weapons fuck you and this is what the United States government is worried about like these people becoming the number one technology provider in the world like if they provided all the cell phones that everyone in America uses like what if like they were close if they came out okay and they got onto the Verizon network or the AT&T network with some of these phones these phones when you look at the the tech people the tech be like the the people like like unbox therapy and mkbhd those guys who developed these of YouTube videos breaking down the components of cell phones they're always super favorable about these Huawei phones they have crazy cameras some of them have this fucking insane ability to zoom in really yeah they use compute learning and they have that they had within the iPhone the new iPhone is pretty fucking good yeah but when the wha the latest huawei mate pro whatever the fuck it was one of them one of them their most high-end phone there's a video of them doing a zoom and that you can't believe how much bigger they can make something just in the distance and make it look really clear they have image stabilization and crazy I mean they're about to come out with a hundred and fifty megapixel sensor on a camera that's on the phone means they're there and they're going hog-wild with technology and providing like the state of the art shit and just a few years ago they were like a non heard of brand I mean five six seven years ago you never heard about people talking about Huawei now Huawei has a direct competitor to the MacBook Pro where I mean a lot of people think it's the best laptop that you can buy but it'll display it works on fingerprints the web camera pops out of a key like you press a key and it pops up so people can't see you while you're jerking off if you're one of those guys that worries you have them it's watch yeah sure em while these Huawei computers have figured it out and they basically but maybe the design of an Apple MacBook just made it way better yeah but don't they have of course but don't they have encrypted don't they have built-in spyware stuff with some things with some things I don't think this is what's funny this is what I like about my always my argument for the marketplace because you know you don't want unchecked capitalism but what's great about the marketplace is you have to allow for for creative destruction that like the the fact that member that flip the camera all the stuff that we had GPS you have a GPS you had a little camera then you had your phone and you had to allow certain businesses to go out of business to get all that technology into one fucking place which is your phone that we all use and that requires people to it cry requires creative destruction it requires like you know people lose entire businesses fall down there I'm gonna new ones born imagine if people bailed out all those portable phone businesses and that's what we have the government did that's what what has the market that's what happened in a government controlled economy in a socialist economy I promise you you would have you'd have boards or or or committees that would decide whether or not it was fair you you they would never a government organization would never allow for that kind of creative destruction fucking never yes you have to protect jobs no no no but you would not in this in the situation like with if China with technology they they're not like trying to save those stupid phones like when those phones became irrelevant because the cameras on the phones were bad that's because they had to compete when the cat's because that's gonna come out of China came out of the West and Technology yes initially innovation and all the all the innovation everything you see that comes out of Apple you can swipe all that stuff don't forget that's all that's all that came out of the free market that came out of the gun throat competition oh yeah no no I'm not but it's fascinating to me that they just take that don't heal it better of course I mean the Japanese used to they would mimic still have they still do it look that's what Lexus is Lexus is them looking at BMW and Mercedes and going hmm I see some holes in your game son and then they decided to do their own version of it you know and here's the thing about those cars versus any other car they don't break that's the number one thing man-made cars I've had the Lexus truck I've had like over the past 15 years I had three of them that's problems with any of them f00 they always start they always Drive perfect I've had three Lexus trucks sitting there so they're so well engineered they're so well designed there's something about Japanese vehicles man I like my tests I thought I had no problems of that here yeah I have had really anything major I had a like one little glitch once where the windshield wiper wasn't working correctly but they fix that quick yeah but that's it other than that still driving their Tesla bitch number one car yeah I Drive more than anything so easy right it's so easy and it allowed one of the things I really enjoy is that I have a lot of loud cars I like loud shit yeah but the Tesla's silent I know so it makes it I can think so when I Drive that I really like driving that with no music on mm-hmm I just like driving it cuz it's like silent I make my way to the Comedy Store and I could hear all the sounds around me in a way that I could never hear before yeah you know I mean because I never noticed that but that's how I guess that's what because the car is not eat you you're interfacing with the world differently like if I'm driving my Porsches probably my loudest car that gt3 that thing's loud I'm driving that I'm being obnoxious that's real loud - that's Brennan Brennan revved it and I jumped like a bitch all right I went like that like my hands went up I sent him a video that is so ridiculous is the gt2 RS his car racing against all these exotics likes all these McCann I see that Ferrari just burying them really oh yeah yeah that car is like one of the fastest cars that you can buy he drives it you know what I love about Brendan well he drives it like it's his number one car it's his only daily driver it's his daily driver yeah it's ridiculous fucking hilarious a giant man in that ridiculous Porsche yes daily driver you gotta love it you gotta love him for it oh yeah well listen he needs a reason to work so hard he's no those guys he likes to be he likes to be rewarded but those and I do too those those vehicles like that that style of vehicle it's like you're not doing what everybody else is doing everybody else is driving to work you're on a ride yeah oh this car I wish I liked cars that Jesus Christ why don't you drive that for a day you like cars that much especially have to get to the doctor so much work get you some some of that man juicing sorry buddy contesting you'll get one of those wouldn't make so much work what work could you fucking get a car like that I'm gonna get jacked I'm gonna get sick I'm gonna shave my fucking body what about straight razor I'm manscaping the funny thing we're Bloods are my manscaped by the way if you want to see me in person this Saturday at the celebrity theater I'm in Arizona and then where am i where am i a joke will a fuck of my New Year's Eve where are you New Year's Eve I'm at the Wilbur theater in Boston oh shit at the Wilbur

me get my hand at my band's the biggest place was with Chapelle but that was me and him that doesn't count that was $25,000 Tacoma fucking god yeah he broke the record for the Tacoma Dome so ridiculous I it was fun all right that was that was really fun but um by myself probably San Diego that's like 14 that's fuck yeah done some other ones that are in the neighborhood of that it's weird it is so weird it's so weird it just seems weird like you getting out there like what in the fuck is going on yeah you know and I always come out to ACDC long way to the top if you want a rock and roll you know what is our basis why man I was at The Improv it's a funny story and there was a dude who is the the DJ and he and I are standing there and I was going up a little bit later and it was a girl who's going on was doing a guest spot who was very new and wasn't working so well it was rough she's bombing a little bit and I turned to DJ go it's a long way to the top and we high-fived and you know I I left the room then when I went on stage he played it very smart and we looked at each other I was like yeah great fucking song it's a great song it's one of the best Road songs ever goddamn I come up to a cashmere buys up just get on the hunt canada ticket down they had so many fucking amazing songs have you heard Greta Van Fleet yes they're sad every good they're so good like they sounds so much like Zeppelin but I don't mind it's they get away with it cuz they're so good right they're like the best tribute band they are man I listen to them I just live right now I'm fuckin really young right I feel like 21 it's just hot they're pigs of their babies listen man I'm down for any 21 year old kids it appreciate Zeppelin bogger yes still astonishing oh yeah to me they're the great there might be the greatest you know you got Pink Floyd you got the Beatles you got the stones you got the who but rock and roll in terms of like a group that we still listen to and everything stops yeah I think it's deply well you know they're certainly one of the all-time greats but it's like almost like every different style of music has its appropriate moment where it hits you perfectly yeah you know like there's a there's a moment where like you want to hear voodoo child and it comes on like ah but then there's a moment where like sitting on the dock of the bay is the perfect song here they're very different I like thank you bye son sometimes I was at a shitty bowling alley and kickstart my heart came on I couldn't have been more happy mood that's a fucking great workout song but that's the song like if you're at a bowling alley and Motley Crue kickstart my heart comes on it's like the right song for the moment right there like Sarah McLaughlin there you'd be like what are you doing to me what are you doing to me but other times Sarah McLaughlin is the perfect sauce the perfect size it's it's all different men it's all they all have their own little spot yeah and the wave of time yeah they do they do it's like they do and you never know what what you need to hear sometimes until you hear it sometimes a song will come on the radio and like at the perfect time like you listening to Spotify or something like that and his song comes on like just when you needed to hear it yeah there's kickstart my heart and he was the driver wow that's the downhill moments for Sam Kinison hanging out with these motherfuckers doing coke til fuckin seven o'clock in the morning and then trying to do a show at The Comedy Store and being half out of it can't do it that's what ruined a man yeah is uh success in partying I still to this day maintain that the Kinison between 86 and 88 was probably the best comic that ever lives he was a monster he was a monster he was making fun of shit that no one had the balls to touch he was crushing things I'm gonna go watch him oh my god that year this is this is him from the rent Don Ronnie Dangerfield comedy special well he was a monster another head injury victim you know that yes siree Bob him like Roseanne Barr well no I know both haven't died no no no no no he was hit by a car when he was a kid yeah his brother bill wrote a book called brother Sam and it was it's like a story of Sam's life it's a really good book if you're a Sam Kinison fan I recommend it highly I mean his brother bill is it I think it's called brother Sam I think I'm right anyway in the book he talks about a Sam was hit by a car and like really bad when he was a little kid and then after that his personality changed can very impulsive very wild you couldn't control him it's a head injury it's the same as Roseanne Barr the exact same status and that she was 15 this is one of the main reasons why I wanted to have around my podcast after her controversy and have her air this out to people like you guys have to under I love that lady I've known her forever she's a wonderful person and she is a person with like legitimate mental illness she was hit by a car when she was 15 years old a lady couldn't see because the Sun was coming in it was hitting her windshield and hit her in the middle of the fucking intersection sent her flying she was in a mental institute for nine months after that she couldn't count anymore okay she they put her in them they put her in a fucking insane asylum okay she's losing her mind she's on a host of different pills and it's one of the reasons why she's such a great comment because she doesn't give a fuck she's brash and she just says things like when they and when she first came out man people don't remember but when I remember when I was a kid and Roseanne Barr first came out I think it was a HBO or one of those comedy specials we had to see her do stand-up you like why is this this is like a new type of lady comedian yeah like how can is a new type of male committee but it's the same thing they didn't give a fuck they had head injuries yeah yeah and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to have her on to tell everybody hey the your team is someone who's on a host of different medications they fluctuate they go back and forth they're always changing her meds and moving her meds around plus she takes ambien Plus she smokes weed plus she drinks like listen little session she's a nice lady Sapolsky talks about like you don't know what's going on our brand if you did you'd be a lot more sympathetic exam but he's a huge proponent than the idea of freewill being a farce right it's not real I know yes well the scientists who can look at things from a completely non emotional level I see what I see where they're coming from with that well I do think sometimes I wonder if we are you know we're programmed I don't know what I don't know what my motivations are what drives me I know like I think about for me I think about stand-up and how much I love it and so I'm very guarded of my my insert my body right like just as sometimes I just don't want anything to fuck up so I can keep doing it like worst thing would happen to me is I couldn't do stand-up you know I think oh is that me is that the item I'm I just remember loving making people laugh there are there a whole host of personality characteristics that have been there from the start if I think back what certainly is you certainly is you and you certainly are responsible for your choices but also you are the victim of your circumstances you're the product or the benefactor of all these years of things happening all these different events all the people you know which is one of the big ones yeah this is what I concentrate on I think more than anything in my life the quality of the people around you dictates the quality of your life and this is an equation that people for whatever reason don't put down as significant or primary but the quality of the people that you have in your life is everything you could be camping like you and I were in Montana nine degrees out with a bunch of great guys we had a good fucking time didn't we didn't have a house no I'm gonna stay warm by fire but the quality of our life was significant it was great because the quality of the people that you're around that's everything man people that are worried about money or fame or credibility or whatever accolades you think you deserve that you're not getting the quality of the people that are around you is everything they drive you they change your opinions they challenge you they show compassion they show they show warmth and camaraderie that allows you to be more comfortable with who you are you open up to each other I mean this is everything in this life is community and one of the things that's most lost when we're dealing with urbanization and large groups of people one of the things that's most loss is our sense of community the more people we have the less value those people have more of a nuisance they become they're just some fucks ahead of you on the highway they're not human beings with lives and hopes and wishes they've become a burden they become locusts yeah they're not just a pretty grasshopper they're fucking everywhere yeah it's just an overabundance and that's what our problem is and and an overabundance and no quality but no quality in your job choice no quality and the education that's thrust upon you know quality and the people that you're running into and your relationships that are on pills and their wacky distort the truth they're always a victim they're never wrong or you could be around a bunch of cool people what's cool about podcasting because you at least you can listen to people you know positive you should start a podcast called Bryan Callen as your friend yes hey kids here's my tip first wasn't that Brody's um Brody's Twitter handle wasn't as Brody as me friend yeah I wanna start my start on the wall hot cats with me me Sasso and D'Elia there's a rumor that the 10 minute podcast why do I give it 10 minutes once you guys yours are just getting warmed up it's on this I know just makes me that's what I might do one where we start funny - top secret guys why not just don't bring back the one with the three you guys yeah maybe that's in the works going per hour maybe that's a big secret maybe one I don't know yeah I got an idea why why don't you do a podcast with Chris D'Elia and Will Sasso oh yeah who can't take credit for that idea it's a good idea you can have it you don't know if it's in the works or not yet have that idea alright I'll think about it do you mention it maybe we will mean the credits inspired by Joe 100% other cities will bring you in good luck there are people out there that actually want credit for coming up with an idea that they didn't come up with there are people out there that want like like showrunners right that step in after someone's created a pilot and they say I want created by crediting it and then I'll run the show dance oh yeah that is one of the most bonkers things your conversation in the goddamn room mm-hmm and then a year later you got this show and that person will show up and sue you oh yeah and it's happened oh yeah yeah yeah well I knew a dude who submitted a script to a major Hollywood production company they turned him down and then they went ahead met that made the movie yeah and they made the movie it was a blockbuster with big-time stars he sued them he won he shouldn't and he got his name on the book on the move well that's that's fair because people do that all the time a lot of times if you had a writer and you're an executive you know you're under so much pressure to come up with an idea somebody comes up with an idea and you're like that's a good idea we could but I got a better we could add some shit to it right but you're supposed to have a deal you're supposed to know it's called don't take what doesn't belong to you don't be a fucking thieving okay don't be at the time the movie was Expendables yeah it's very I was though he was a writer for he was a student of Eddie Bravo's lately yeah so I was around when the whole thing was going down wow we're all like wow they just stole your idea they just jacked it well speaking of Expendables you know my new favorite person allegedly I should say allegedly to all the things I've just said yeah I don't know if this is true could have been a big giant lie someone was on adderall and just started lying to me my favorite one my new favorite person there's a guy named Sly Stallone he went to his house for the fights yeah but like I learned some shit about him me David Blaine showed up and you gotta have my on the podcast dare blame showed up and did magic actually a jump how about that listen don't I can read the rest of my life and not have David Blaine on the pot just saying fine I'm just saying he'd be a great guest I think you'd like it I don't like you telling what to do all right st. bro this have to have him on the fuck is that look at that picture I told his daughter to take that picture and I just got because I wanted to jump and while they're all doing that neutral me in behind them pop thickest Stallone's hair that is preposterous it looks fantastic I was it still so good couple things about sly you don't know my hair so good cuz he's fucking slide do you think he has like someone who like does him up before the picture like he knows you guys are coming over so he has his hairdresser like puff it all up he shows up like that and just looks you know I like I was got the Jay Leno shirt on to a great fucking sense of humor oh he does I interviewed him once for spike T so fun he was hilarious someone heckled he goes hey MA oh yeah he's got an a' on top of that you he's I know I'm sure I I'm you think I'm

tactic we'll go through a course a box I do jujitsu I take that fucking shit on god you're crazy fucking man hey how long do you think you can hang from a chin-up bar we're gonna we're gonna go try how long do you think you can I'm gonna say because I don't practice it I'm gonna say no more than a minute but I'm gonna try it's really a minute I don't know you don't are you skeptical remember I could do a lot of pull-ups no I can do more than a minute I'd do 2 minutes and 15 seconds that's a long fucking time you've been practicing it don't tell me otherwise been dedicated ok over the last two mile right so now I'm gonna do it I usually was doing a couple minutes a day but I was breaking it up into like thirty-second chunks or maybe I'd go a minute and then I decided about two months ago to see how long I could hold on for it's good for your shoulder okay what helps me is if I hold on for like 15-20 seconds and I rest for a long time and then I go back and do it I could do it a lot longer so I should one side yeah okay let me ask you powder my hands to a choc my hands up that's big - doing that - because your hands get sweaty and then it fucks with your grip no let me ask you this are you when you hang are you do you have tension or you totally lose totally loose you are yes but one trick that I do when I start getting really tired as I tense up yes so I squeeze the bar harder and I start doing these we're almost like it's distracting yes from the fact that my hands are burning it okay and I feel like it also engages like maybe almost like a different way of holding it that gives you like a little bit of a break not much of a break you're still hanging on there goes the podcast coz all I'm thinking about now is doing that yeah it's worked out today well here's the thing it's made my hands thicker it's harder for me to get my wedding ring off cuz my fingers are actually getting thicker I worked out with hanging I worked out with my friend Rudy Reyes do you know that is bring up Rudy Reyes who do you do to you don't worry about it let's take a look at his body for a second he's 48 years old please please understand what he's about and make you get pumped we worked kettlebells bro and we did some body weight oh you told me that this is like the first time you've ever really worked kettlebells right yes sir it's amazing or isn't it it's what's up fuck it's what I love what is the second time and I was Sissis ass or it really for me is the best thing that translates into jiu-jitsu there's some about like if you have like a 50 or 70 pound kettlebell and you're cleaning and pressing and do windmills and all that that to me is like that really works for intensive that's not a good Jay gotta see him now what are you talking about I don't

decreases performance that's that metformin stop yeah that is there's a lot of controversy with that like as soon as that we did that podcast people that I know that are more into the performance side of athletics and nutrition and well-being they were yeah that that stuff is not really I talked to my daughter about it he said your you know your nicotine amide a dean adenine dinucleotide Wow say

that thing's pins gonna say it's crystal here goes hey everyone don't go to this he said the first ball my bang everyone don't go to this your um your fake feud with him is very strange don't make videos about each other he did the podcast yesterday it was the funniest thing in the world the most insulting one time one time we were doing the podcast and he was just lying there and I go be respectful and sit the fuck up and I started talking and he just got up and he slapped me in the car I was like I'll fucking kill you and I came at him and he started when he tried to kiss me it was like kryptonite yeah he's a weirdo yeah weirdo he's from out of space yeah I mean well SAS always say he's from outer space there it is look look Wow he smacked you right in the face mmm funny motherfucker man hilarious and a great guy too just just a good dude I like being around them it's fun yeah these are my inner circle well we're all weirdos right he's just he's a weirdo weirdo we're buzzing reminded me of what misfits we are cuz I I want to do this idea where I was like I was gonna do this thing for on it we're gonna come up with ways funny ways to sell product I thought it'd be a good way to recruit some comics and get him a job sit around a table and create like a marketing thing and none of them like all the two of them got back to me everybody else like sorry I don't have time they're just fucking misfits misfit like you can make real money you fucking idiot man tired too tired to get up too high got a show at the Laugh Factory two hours off and that's not funny that's quite you're funny all right yeah that's a lot of them yeah a lot of people are funny because of the fact that they you know they're impulsive that don't have discipline and they just yeah that's part of what makes them funny is that just a little thing they're also wild they're wild people they're not good at like being disciplined and rigid and on a schedule that they create themselves I can't like yourself I would tell you that my acting I was in Jeffrey Tambor's class and doing an acting thing and Jeffrey Tambor looked at me he goes get a little self-esteem problem huh I feel like you're second banana in general in life and some guy goes thank God everybody looks up at me cuz well you wouldn't be funny if you didn't if you didn't hate himself so I'll take him this way never forgot it I was like all right that's hilarious yeah I don't know if you have to like yourself that much I think you should always be a little dissatisfied with yourself works for me yeah I don't think you should be satisfied very often if you want to be good at anything you know you're on a path right you're on an improvement and growth path you're trying to get better whatever it is but it's tennis right you're trying to get better at it all the time like you shouldn't if you want to get better at at all time you got to be scrutinizing you can't be happy about certain moments where you were really good and think that's you I've got to be thinking about the things that didn't go good yes oh I gotta fix that part is that story whether it's true or not but I think it is Rafael Nadal had just won Wimbledon one of the greatest of all time you ever see him play like his athleticism his power he hits the ball so hard that the ball camera of this is the ball revolves twice as fast it makes it 22 so many revolutions is the average high level tennis player that's how hard that's how much spin it is like it's 80 versus 40 or something and he he got out of a need just one Wilton and he's back he's back in the locker room going I know I just I don't know if my grip should have been a little bit I feel like it should I think I'm gonna change it you know that it's still adjusting everyone you have to be yeah that's how you get to be that guy yes and as soon as you get to be that guy and go up I got it then you're gonna fall off you're done that happens - don't you feel stand-ups that way too though you know well what we're talking about with Kinnison right you know Kinnison when he was on fire he was longing for acceptance and longing for respected attention and he was gonna take at yeah he just went out there fuckin guns blazing like an animal but then once he got he's partying with Bon Jovi and Motley Crue and they're doing blow fucking on the tour bus and you know drinking vodka till 5:00 in the morning all that chaos it's just it stops being the same thing life is now you're celebrating the fact that you're the shit instead of you're desperate to make the best work you can make desperate to work I talked to this I won't say the name of the famous Elton John but may as well be but he made it he made it he made a seminal album like an album that's a classic album and I said what do think it was he goes I was just so desperate to be heard mmm I was desperate to be heard and then you get older and you get rich and you kind of prove it you can do it and you lose the Bob Dylan talks about that he goes I don't know who wrote those songs like I don't I don't remember like they said they read his lyrics back and he said isn't that something you know like who did that not me I don't know I can't do that anymore that's a that's a that's a fear of mine I want to be I want to stay hungry and what would stand up the difference is you can't just go back and redo your old song now you have to constantly be relevant and you have to have stuff that works right now and you the people can't have heard it too many times it's not like songs like I still want to hear like if you went to see the Rolling Stones you'd want to hear brown sugar yeah you'd want to hear it yeah there's like there's songs they're just iconic and they give you a good feeling when you hear them yep not jokes I appreciate old comedy I go back and watch it with it looking looking like I'm watching art or something like that I'm watching someone's work and I can appreciate it but I don't appreciate it from like the feeling that you get when you see it the first time and you laugh and you're surprised and you know the punchlines come out you're like listen I was surprised that Bill Cosby had only done one album what yeah one or two albums I was really shocked at that I was like I thought he'd done like 14 or so is that true yeah did mostly what he did was videos I guess no he was just hmm didn't he have like thumbs of his videos though I don't know really fans that looked it was like I thought he'd done like 14 or 15 albums I mean there's I mean I just typed in Bill Cosby albums he's got three separate vinyls so three albums is three vinyls and smudgey 3 7 7 7 4 70 71 67 68 all right so much for that oh we had a lot whoops me and job looked it up and we're like we only find what you guys are morons and you know that Google Jamie's it was maybe you're good hey fucking chin fucking type Cosby right goddamn it he built bill burr and I were supposed to go see him before the scandal hit we were supposed to go see him we're gonna make a trip to go see him in Vegas and I think bill will bill wound up see gnomes another another time come on hey man that's what I thought I said albums I said then I I got stop music albums dude he's got one too let's stop stop stop stop he's got one two three four five six seven eight nine why did I think 17 music albums no he's crazy we got all these music albums wanting those yeah marching band bro concerts he had music albums hmm so 12 albums more than that right now we have waiting for way more 16 17 couldn't have been more wrong and yet you stated in Italy 21 chin you're fired god damn it cuz I I said this and then yeah we'd only found one I was so embarrassed I'm really gonna burst again that's what's really a shame out no I was right no cuz I was right the first asset fuck off and all that out I see what you did I see what you did he's got a bunch of Grammys - yeah even after you in jail for rape sure only person number like oj was supposed to lose his Heisman and they can't find it I think her tampon to the know Atlanta hate Twitter the world can't find my husband yeah his his Twitter feed is so bizarre watching it because he does it different than anybody everything is hey Twitter world and everything is about football it's like it's all about like what this guy needs to do and obviously he knows a lot about football he's a fucking world-class player my best of all time but in the end the comments or where the real show is the comments is all knife emojis and you really killed that one Oh J it's like everyone takes their own crack at him in the comments damn what's he doing now I wonder if he's he's playing golf until March oh my god summer this should be like a hidden knife in there so you know like that an angle where like like you know Sierra's legs are crossed this should be like something at the bottom what if you look at the silhouette it looks like a knife here to the world look at this oh yeah that is crazy I wonder if he makes he's gonna sell out well I don't think he can spend it um he owes the Goldmans a large sum of money from a civil case they can't get the money out of his pension you know because he's got an NFL pension yeah that's one of the reasons I think might move to Florida like Florida certain laws and protect you now he's in Nevada I think you know there's places that have like different laws to protect you from lawsuits where your your pension is protected you never have to worry about being broke because of a lawsuit he's paid he's paying a serious price for all that two people are dead Brian yeah that serious he's out there playing golf and going hey tour the world yeah and he wasn't really even charged with that he was charged kidnapping yeah what's funny is that he's allowed to be on Twitter whereas I think about some of the people that have been for Twitter for saying things like a woman is never a man or a man is never a woman dead naming you get if you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce Damer Jenner that's a dead naming Caitlyn and then you are banned for life from Twitter is that really true a hundred percent 100% of this all come from or that Hyper's what we were talking about earlier with people getting mad at someone for saying Merry Christmas or Co same thing Jack Dorsey does not want this Jack Dorsey is calling for some sort of a decentralized version of Twitter yeah he was talking about it when he was here like having a Wild West Twitter wherever goes yeah and I think he's right and Jack is a very Internet minded guy here's the thing you have to understand when you're talking about being the CEO of something that is literally responsible for billions of pieces of informations every single day he doesn't compete managing its scale he's a CEO of a company that you know he's under pressure to make more profit there's it's not as simple as anybody would like to think and it's not like he can say hey I think no one should ever be banned and he can just go ahead and do that he doesn't have the power to do that no he has the power to suggest city is the power to give his opinion there's a lot of moving pieces a lot of move how does he make money how does Twitter make mine it's a good question I don't know how do you scale that yeah I worry very little I don't think about I kind of like it I wanted to stay around I think it's kind of interesting but I'm a hundred percent convinced that with the implementation of a our augmented reality whether it's through Apple or someone's gonna have glasses I think anything we're doing now is literally like the myspace of the future in terms of technological interaction I think the stuff we're doing right now is all like MySpace like it's not going to be here so what do you think we're gonna be doing I think we're gonna be doing something where they are there's something good we're gonna be interacting with each other in some sort of way our augmented reality glasses like like Minority Report type shit yeah we're gonna have glasses where you have things in front of you can access menus and pull-downs with you can make gestures you could say things it'll Google things in front of your eyes you're gonna be able to you know here's a real thing people are gonna this is something that I think was in a movie but it's probably would work that people would have a social score that you would see when you're coming near that yeah like a cursor like that's very scary right you know how like you go on a link and there's like a bunch of restaurants and you could put the cursor over it and a little Yelp box pops up and says it has four stars and 400 reviews and you can get like that pops up that could be you I think it could pop up like the kid 52 years old still fucks like a teenager it'll say thank you and people could walk by ago hmm interesting I'm Terence he's a bit of a Peter Pan is he well you know I mean you already had that with uber uber can see how your by the drivers that's interesting so it in a way it's interesting this is making us you can't hide behind like assholes are getting exposed like you it's making this more nicer to each other but it's very it's also a form of it's it's kind of a prison yeah you've got to always behave everybody's watching everything you do now well this is the new world then and we have to adjust this new world because in the future there will be no barriers between people and information right those barriers are dissolving in front of our eyes and people are scrambling to try to accept it or not accept it or fight against it or keep up but it is but it is it's not you can't deny what it is it is it is real it's happening and it's gonna keep happening it's gonna keep getting weirder like we didn't see Twitter coming we didn't see the internet coming we didn't see cell phone implementation on the global scale coming nobody ever thought you're gonna carry a phone with you everywhere you go 30 years ago that was never even the concept so you got 30 years which is a blink of an eye in human history 30 years later everyone's got a goddamn phone they are literally everywhere 30 years from now it's probably gonna become some next-level shit well it'll be part of our body we're not around but also I think it's interesting because it'll almost be like if everybody was naked all the time nudity would be no big deal I'll show a little tiny and tell you they have a little tiny dick and that would be and even then you'd find your niche really Wow I always say like even if you have a little tiny dick a lot of lesbians get hot girls yeah man you just find our girls that don't care our girls that don't want to deal with my 9 inch piece you know what I'm saying no I know and my personality my money if you're into that I'm you're good like a snake god that's that's what the media says I'm not gonna describe my this attack I mean it's it's he's got he's

a big turquoise belt buckle and no shirt yeah no shirt when he was younger my favorite actor of all time one of those ties calls this is just a string yeah the western time yeah you know I'm talking

a gun maybe a bow around his neck whatever the fuck you want yeah yeah maybe walks through your house with a knife and his teeth yeah like what's going on with Mickey just make a even it's just they gave him alone just as regular Mickey yeah the world of actors my friend they are out there he was abused by his stepdad really well was he yeah you take great a great interview with Alec Baldwin on Baldwin's podcast called here's the thing it was very heartbreaking very heartbreaking he was abused by his um his his stepfather was a cop and a brutal son of a bitch and really abused those two boys well his brother Mickey's brother died in his arms Oh drug addict because of his father he blamed his father his stepfather then he saw his father he'd never seen and he's so heartbreaking till the story he saw his father in New York father's come out of a bar his father goes and Nicky was stand there and he goes I'm your son his father goes I thought I'd run into you one day and then his father died a week later of alcoholism mmm see we ran into him as a grown man yeah you tells you everything about someone you know your hearts broken at a young age well almost everyone that's fucked up in this life is fucked up because of something that someone did to them whether it's a relative or abuse that they suffered or you know things throughout their life that have gone horribly wrong especially for children the big one I mean that's the most formative time of your life right when you meet people that were abused as children you everyone like universally feels for them you're like oh no when you have children especially oh for sure you realize what a catastrophe and an impossible thing to deal with that that's so terrible to me it's the special evil you know it is abusing children I mean you're ruining not just a moment but the full potential of a child's life they're never gonna escape the fact that that was done to them but someone used them this is a child psychologist she wasn't stalking her and I said give me some advice with my children you know she said to me she goes just don't leave just me in their life that's big I was like that's true right because when your dad's not there your mom's not there if someone's not there this is like the feeling of like displacement everything's wrong the world and then on top of that what these kids get abused it's like oh my god you've you've compounded horror on top of of sadness and loneliness horror on top yeah and it's also it this is the really fucked up things it repeats itself like they say that people that are molested when their children are much more likely to more or less children which is like the Saints it's the thing that happened to the abuse that happened to you it's almost like you want to put it on someone else did the fact that there's so many kids grew up in single-parent households in this country is the problem that's the problem that's a job you can talk about racism you talking else you grew up without a father you grew up in a single-parent household that's that is that's abuse that is men who have children men who have children and walk out on those kids that those the people I have no time for my hate them I don't give a fuck what your excuses you have I would make it a law like you you'd be I would make it very uncomfortable but that's just one kind of abuse there's also abuse by your actual biological parents there's a service by other biological relatives there's there's people that is abused by stepfathers and that's your brothers and sisters there's abuse by neighbors there's this abuse man but it's all boils down the same thing it's like what happens during your developmental period when you're a really young person to becoming an adult and once if someone's abusing you and fucking you over that just ruins most people's lives most people don't bounce back from that you know and then you get caught up in this spiral of this cycle of crime and violence and prison and abuse and you're done you're done I wonder how long it's going to take before the human race eradicate that because I think if you look at like Pinker's work and some other people just studied violence and abuse and all the various things that we love least about civilization those markers are going down sort of across the board whether it's violent crime or rape those markers are slowly going down like how long does it take for there's none of that part of it's part of it so they say what crippled the Mafia was just the fact there are cameras everywhere you can't just drop bodies all the time because it's you don't know everybody's got a fucking ring the cops just go can we take a look at your ring footage right and and you know you got to make a getaway somewhere you're always on camera you're always on camera and they can do this they can just follow the dots well Snowden just posted something that I retweeted it see we can find that Jaime about China and the citizens are sort of revolting against this constant surveillance state that's overtaken China I'm saying over the next ten years is what's going to be America absent sweeping reform this is the whole world in ten years remember both parties in the u.s. defend mass surveillance programs China's advantage here is not technological but that there's no strong civil opposition to slow the descent into nightmare so China is not I'm sorry I read it wrong China is not able to slow it they're just slowly descending into the surveillance date this is the biggest one that's why that's why not trusting your fucking leaders is very important we were lied to it I've gotta stop for 18 years by senior US officials the authorities can scan your phone track your face and find when you find out when you leave your home one of the world's biggest spying networks is aimed at regular people and no one can stop it yeah and this is in China yeah all in the name of security there's never been a regime a government that didn't use that as an excuse yeah you take so the Nazis take that Hitler when he became Chancellor took away all all civil liberties because in the name of protecting the fatherland from rent from essentially terrorism because a communist lit lit the Reichstag on fire well what's interesting is how long is it going to take before some version of this makes it over here because it seems inevitable it's coming but you have to be you have to fight it tooth and fucking nail Americans should always be missed distrustful of their authority figures I don't give a fuck how much you like Trump or anybody else you should hold your leaders accountable and you should not you should always have a healthy distrust well we were lied to for eighteen years about how the war was going in Afghanistan we spent over a trillion dollars on that fucking war over the past how long has it been since 2003 good and and we were trying to turn into a modern nation you have senior US officials with our intelligence military and everybody else they knew this was an unwinnable war I know too many people who spent out ten years over there they all knew it too and somehow that just never made it out and every general kept saying we're at a turning point in the war we're going to defeat the Taliban no you weren't and you know the difference and you knew that at the time and I understand that there's a lot of pressure and everything else but we spent all that money for fucking what and a lot of Americans got injured and fucking killed for it and we were lied to I know what this is what's interesting about what you're saying this is the argument for something like this in the first place have you had this he had mass surveillance everywhere people wouldn't be able to plan terrorist attacks that's what they always use as an excuse no but that's what do yes that's how they would implement I know that and they could get something like that implemented in Afghanistan and put a giant kibosh sure on the amount of terrorist activities yeah right good luck I know I would say good luck dunny history study history to see how that turns out that's so the thing is this kind of tools never existed like you could study history all day long government it's usually gonna prepare you sort of peripherally it's not really gonna prepare you for what what technology can do today there's nothing in history that can really tell you where this goes I agree with you but but politicians use the same exact language they've been using ever ever which is we have to protect the public from these inserts and it's this danger there's a solution that eventually there's no more government here's a solution to that you what this is doing it's making it almost impossible to be a traditional to have a traditional government right because if this stuff starts making it into there then we can find out what they're doing all the time so what if we what if it turns out well we'll let you mass surveillance on we want 24-hour seven access to anyone who is any sort of representative anyone who's a congressman and it was a senator anyone is the president we want 24/7 access to everything you say and do we want to know we want to know who you are no more backs my problem with that is that you wouldn't have the best people getting in you don't have the best people now that's true but it's gone it's over you're already dealing with that as a politician and stuff I don't know if that's the answer my saying is the answer Brian Cowen I'm just saying imagine oh I'm not saying it's a good idea it's a terrible idea but imagine if this this is what the world becomes everyone has access to everyone's life see the way I believe it is is you want to if you want to learn about somebody as a government agency you got major firewalls and you need warrants and make it fucking difficult right but the reason why a country like the United States goes to war with a country like Afghanistan or against the or Isis because you have leaders and groups yeah once there's no leader and once there's no groups and everybody can see everything that everybody's doing then you have no no more need for government somebody's gonna come but all societies are meditative resources no but also but you also have to have somebody no moral Society has to have the monopoly on violence well they understand himself or or all the resources get distributed evenly all natural resources like income all natural resources on earth are owned by the human beings that inhabit the earth not the human beings that live on that one particular spot although out Saudi trillionaires and all those dudes are making fracking money that's our money bitch it's our earth you're stealing the fucking essence of the earth and selling it back to the people how did Karl Marx right here man no problem Jamie a magic test but all the other things you could sell you could sell cars you can sell this you could sell that make buildings you can I'm not stopping capitalism but I'm saying is all natural resources all of them belong to the conquerors of the earth which is us the human being so no no no trillionaire oil barons no dependence on fossil fuels because yeah fossil fuels are great but if no one in particular is profiting entirely off fossil fuels because the money has to be distributed evenly to everyone the same with solar semen than anything anything that's a resource any natural resource yeah but you need minimize the technology to to harness that stuff you tell that you sell that which you can't sell is oil well we've sold on the open market not anymore not when I'm president what the fuck dude so oils everybody you got robbed stealing it we're just dealing it we're gonna well nuke the world if they don't give us the oil just listen let's start off start fresh with amoebas let's you see this is not going well let me be your vice president all right you run okay and then what's our platform what's ours the tuna in the sea what's our slogan how do we grow more tuna let free tune are you fucks yeah no more no more dinner theater everybody that works in dinner theater now makes tuna you work in a tuna plant where you make tunas fuck you like this so we have more more tuna you run for it you forced a breeding program yes yes yes and you're gonna have to filter the ocean we've know a great president we fucked up the ocean there's all these heavy metals and poison in there we need a filter for the ocean sort of like the filter that you have at your house yeah the filters the tap water yeah right yeah yeah we need one of those for the ocean expensive shit not really right not when you get rid of music dinner theater all musicals oh you use the money yeah yeah I got to make those people go to work in a real job yeah yeah all those people who think that it musicals are what people want to see if fuck you really fuck you go oh you son of a bitch now that time when we got really really really really really high and we went to see one of your professors one of your greatest sing-sing musicals yes I do that was that was a wonderful night it was out it was a while I love that kind of stuff we were so I couldn't walk fast no me neither like be real well I knew I knew how to walk but I wasn't totally sure I could keep doing it I never I never smoked weed and but when I do it to you it's like I got high one time I was with patty Jenkins we were in a fucking Atlantic City and we didn't swimming and I smoked weed and I didn't I was not a weed smoker and you swam in the water at the ocean fuck you at night dude you're doing huge waves I lost Mike we lost the car keys and we're looking everywhere dude everywhere and two hours later I sit down on the curb son my BOB just tired we don't worry too much looks at me and she goes Brian yeah open your hand please of course I had my sunglasses on top of my hat and looked for him for 10 minutes before the other day I'm like I'm with my I'm with my son and I'm looking for my phone and I'm like where the fuck is my phone fuck is it he's he's next to me I'm on my phone playing a game right next to me snatch the phone up yeah those kids download the game form oh you forgot yeah you know yeah I mean that TRT he was playing a sniper game and I said you're not allowed to play that shit at all and then I saw how cool it was and I own the planet whoa you try to keep him from violent games I do but it's a it's like telling a tree not to blow in the wind it's interesting Dakota Meyer who's you know decorated veteran and you know Medal of Honor yes very few to ever win it well alive yeah he thinks that video games and violent video games desensitize people now when someone like that who's open with the struggles with PTSD he share killed a man with a rock okay tell me the start about he it was in a fistfight with a guy you know in war with with the enemy and picked up a rock and beat his brains oh Jesus if this guy is telling you that videogames candy cents you I'm gonna listen yeah I'm gonna listen to him I am to he's you know he I just a that yeah you shouldn't get very good at these kids who have the guns but it also for some people that don't have any tendency towards violence like you or me or Jamie or anybody else that we know that's fine and healthy they're not gonna make you more likely to go shoot people and that's a fact yeah that's the thing it's like are you saying that you playing Red Dead Redemption that's gonna make you want to go out and fucking shoot people no it's not going to have any effect on you as well at all but will it have an effect on minors I think they're couple things going on one is I think they're addictive oh yeah I've seen that with my own eyes with my children they're addictive and when you and when you take the game away they exhibit withdrawal they freak the fuck out man come on yeah one more game yeah Jesus crazy they stomp the ground I know yeah and then and then also I think when you play video games you can get so addicted that you will isolate and you'll play those games all day oh there's what's that kids doing that yeah what's that do to your social interaction what's that do to your body should you be doing a sport what's that do to you later on can you get a girl but when you've been sitting in front of it there are lots of things that we don't know I mean do they lend dude do video games when you play them on that level do they retard your social skills and your you know I mean there's a lot of considerations I don't know I'm also in favor of you doing anything you want if there's some people that would make the same argument about someone who's addicted to reading sure there's a lot of people that are in their head is reading novel and they were it yeah but those arguments were argued before video games you just don't hear it anymore because you just hear the more accelerated version what it is is basically an engaging human creation yeah an engaging human creation that's designed to captivate your attention whether it's a novel or a film or anything yeah like things are designed that's what art is in a lot of ways and you go to an art gallery and you stare at someone's work it's like some human creation that captivates your attention and gets you locked in and we see a really beautiful piece like we were in Italy and we were in Florence and we went to say ancient a ancient Church and they had this beautiful works of art on the wall and it is fascinating fascinating stuff and you try to picture like the people that painted this a thousand years ago and what life was like and you looking at the intricacies of these dresses like that's an engaging human creation that captivates your attention we just we have merit in that kind of engaging captivated piece of art we have put merit in that but we don't put merit in video games for some reason yeah it's almost like it's too engaging it's too much it's too captivating it's - it's an interesting question why why not you know because we know it's detrimental we inherently know that you gonna waste giant chunks of your life unless you're someone who like got a trust fund you never have to work again you got fucking ten million dollars in the bank and you could just chill forever and you want to play video games all day am i all right like if you mean I don't know what to tell you you don't have to work yeah but what is it something like Picasso's wanker or you know that that painting of when Spain was bombed by the Luftwaffe before World War two and to bring that up because it's a kind of a haunting painting but what is that why is that still something that's considered a masterpiece and then like you said there's like these incredible image there's incredible imagery and what we can do with an iPad well it's all the same thing in some way it's a human creation but the thing about these digital human creations is they have this alien like cold feel to them like there's something about digital things even if they're spectacular like there's no emotion in this thing this thing is a creation so one in a zero it's it's yeah where it's like if you're just reading novels all day like if you're that person that just yeah fuck the world I'm gonna go in my house I'm gonna shut the door I'm gonna light a candle I'm gonna sit there and I'm gonna read novels all day I have 10 million dollars in the bank that I got for my trust fund I just like reading yeah no one would say you're a loser like what does Brian do he's amazing you know he got his trust fund and then said I want to educate myself I just want to read and he just reads all the great works and he sits at home all day and just reads it's amazing but that is somehow more intriguing because what you're doing is is developing and expanding your understanding inside I think when you do that what what that means is you're someone who is worth speaking to you might have some secrets and some understanding I can use so when you talk to somebody who's really gone down that rabbit hole like Joseph Campbell mm-hmm you know who read all the philosophers and everybody who influenced them you want you want to hear what he has to say because he's organized his brain and his thoughts in a way that might shed some light on the things that are confusing to you that are you know that are depressing or that are scaring you or whatever and and you do need leaders like that the leaders of thought that can put things into perspective you know that can kind of tell you why there's a difference between say Picasso and this other mmm shitty artist I don't know no yeah for sure yeah for sure but you also need people that know how to play the fuck out of a video game the thing is those people don't get any credit when you see these kids today that are winning these video game tournaments and winning a million dollars in a parent and not play games meanwhile the dad works at fucking IHOP like hey asshole you know these guys are making real money can his stupid game that you told them to never play and they're feeling like arenas arenas crazy this is where the world goes the world goes to the most engaging creation and human beings have that locks in other people's attention and the most engaging creations for young people or these goddamn video games yeah they're just group efforts they're giant group corporate efforts whether it's you know grand theft auto or the new doom once I knew do them coming out but but I feel like doom and but I do think there's a difference I I do think that when you're really good at a video game there's there is an addictive quality to it yes you're really good at do shows thing right but at the end of the day it's a game right and that game is somewhat masturbatory that game I don't know that when you really get good at fort not night or doom I don't know if that game in any way expands your understanding or your ability to contribute to the larger conversation okay but I'm just saying does Snoke so is that the strategy game no how dare you what is it yes what no chess just a good one but what no there's a reason why said snooker yeah the reason why I said smokers because you're executing you're actually doing you have to do you have to keep it together and you have to physically execute a move it's a giant pool table that they played in England and they play with red balls and blue balls and pink balls and and black balls and I don't know I don't understand the game I've watched it a bunch yeah but uh there's these people that play it and you know it's less popular now one of the guys one of the best time guys got busted he got busted doing a fixed game like someone someone paid him off to lose and he agreed to do it for a certain amount of money but the thing is that a game like that is well respected because someone has to execute it's not just yanking you have to get off the shot yes it's a skill and also people love to watch it who play snooker yeah probably not me but people know the difference right a video game you have to execute as well but it doesn't seem like you're doing it because you're not physically just moving your hands around and moving a keyboard and it doesn't seem like it's as skillful or but it is yeah that's a really interesting question I don't know you're asking a really interesting question right so because what they are doing is they're providing entertainment for people just like a great pool player right right so when you watch pool you're doing it for stakes you're doing it for money but you're also watching these people who have mastered this insane geometry what we respect some versions of that like golf yeah we respect golf yeah you watch some land and also the the money that's available that's why we don't respect bowling yeah someone's get boy like congratu you pat him on the head good for you good for you nobody cares but if you're fucking one of the best golf players of all time yeah you know that golfer is gonna make millions and millions of dollars a year but that guy is a baller he's a golfer and he's at the top of the food chain when it comes to any of those skills require you to master yourself in him anyway oh yeah yeah sure but the thing is that the video games it seems like it's happening in a digital realm and because of that it's not taken as seriously even if you found out they made more money like when you find out someone's a successful video game player there's a certain part of you look like why are you wasting your time with that even if you go he makes five million dollars a year oh well huh good for him yeah huh seems weird yes right there's like a weird yes you don't it's still not good you know like you notice for us who are older its subversive yes that for guys that are A's it's subversive it's we don't trust it we don't like it we don't understand it and it scares us a little bit because it also reminds us of our own immortality we're also brainwash the thing in the video games are for all of that so so so we have a we have an stereotypical idea of what a video game player is all that stuff so so for older people I'm I'm feel I feel left out I don't understand it you know and I and I feel like they're being bad and they should listen to me whereas chess is noble you all chess is someone playing chess that's noble special special yeah you find out someone who's really good at chess like fuck it guys impressive they can organize a can thing deeply if a girl could teach eclis beat your ass at chess I dated a girl once she was really good at chess I'm so humiliated mm-hmm shut me down well jujitsu is a form of kinetic chess probably sort of you can make that argument I mean yeah but force and there's mat there's mass it's all there's also leverage there's also understanding when to use your energy when not to when to be relaxed when to be strong it's more complicated even than chess probably no I think it's more calm I'm not good in either one but you know yeah yes you but there is an understanding of the moves and then when someone's countering the understanding of the counter and then the counter to the counter and it's like constant thing that's like Hicks and Gracie want things he always sees to say about people's they can't keep the rhythm you know he'd be like he would put a rhythm on people he just made you attack and you count our attack and you counter attacking you counter but I know what your counter is I'm preparing for your counters I'm moving he does it so often that he keeps this rhythm up until you don't know what you can't just explode all the time you don't know the the moves it was a boxer who was fighting Duran you hear him in the corner came up with the fight was he goes he's reading my mind he's reading my fucking mind well Duran knew the patterns so well that he was like I know what he's doing here yeah I know what he's gonna do see he would cut him off and he'd be like the guys fucking catching me every time I try to work on our game plan that's what boxing is right boxing is like understanding the patterns of someone throwing a left or a right moving their head side to side moving forward moving back moving side-to-side you get these patterns these are the only things you can do you can only move back and forth side to side or you can move left to right or you can throw with your left hand or you can throw with your right hand all the variables with different kinds of punches you can throw but you get a guy like Terence Crawford in front of you he's seen all those and so he starts setting you up to see like what are you doing like where are you doing where am I gonna there's a beautiful combination to use to knock out that cat the other night he fought some very rugged dude who's the the guy Crawford fought this weekend I want to see I only saw the highlights of it because it was I guess it was on ESPN rag here it is like saying I watch this I want to see him fight all spent so badly oh yeah be phenomenal that's the fight but the the end of the fight man he just did some oh my god willful creative shit he's amazing man he really is amazing took some shot oh duty for real the guy's very good Matt oh yeah now watch that die he dropped him there now watch the final culmination look at this watch his step faculty that step back Bing how beautiful is that that step back and then that uppercut that's like recognizing patterns then he stepped in and hooked him in the head he's brilliant brilliant he's there's guys that hit this level right when you watch boxing or any combat sport really this is guy that hit this level you're like oh during that fucking super champion zone yes and that's where Crawford is why he needs to fight all Spencer yes that's where low mischenko Howe was Earl Spencer live and not injured I don't know because he's Superman that video of him flipping the adequate Ferrari and watching it fly over him and he doesn't get crushed now how what are the odds that who makes it out there without a scratch and thank God because I had aficionado that work of art needs to be preserved some days fuck yeah it's fine little gay all about people that are gays fuck yeah you did sound yeah he's a beast man the way he shut down Mikey Garcia he hits too hard on saying what Shawn Porter gave him the what for Shawn Porter was that's where you realize so important seven-time world champion this we've already talked gave him the what for game the watchful of that flavor I say things like this I go I'm gonna keep him busy I'll give him the what for give him look let's knew what
