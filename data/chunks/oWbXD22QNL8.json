hello freak bitches it really does bring to mind this incredible verse in the bhagavad-gita where Krishna is revealing his true form to Arjuna he's like the warrior figure and this is Oppenheimer's quote mm-hmm this is Oppenheimer's quote when he that he said after the atomic bomb went off and I recorded this part of the bhagavad-gita where he said I have become death the destroyer of worlds but it doesn't stop there krsna's saying to Arjuna something along the lines of look in my teeth there you will see them everyone on this battlefield because I'm eating them right now so this is like this is like Khurshid being like oh you really want to see what i'm like because they've just been friends hanging out and stuff and he like suddenly became the force of all destruction in the known universe and the point of the thing was listen all of this is already chewed up it's already been devoured it's already gone game over you're done no Kurzweil is gonna get you new blood cells it's gonna keep it's gonna keep you alive at some point I will come to you wearing the costume of your death and that is an inevitability so just surrender to that and you're going to be a lot less freaked out if you just accept that that's the way it is because if you're a war that you're engaged in right now is the war to live forever if you're war that you're engaged in right now is a war to try to make some lasting change in a universe that's defined by impermanence and change then you're fighting the wrong war there's a better war to fight you know and it's actually the way you fight is by surrendering not by fighting by letting go and sinking into the actual hum of the universe the way it really works not the way you wish it work not the way that you were hoping that the universe worked where you know lions like and and hyenas rescue little boys like early and like an ice age but the cartoon but the way it actually works the way the universe actually works is everything comes into existence it exists for a little while and then it dies and most things come out of explosion yeah yeah I don't forget that yeah most things come out of big fucking blasts including the whole universe itself yes whole universe itself is predicated upon a violent event yeah it has to have a violent event right that's Big Bang it couldn't be the the the slow expansion of beautiful life-giving particles throughout the universe now nope it's a big fucking bang no it was a big fucking bang and it keeps it it keeps going the Big Bang keeps going and is but it's just like this man if you want to dig your heels in and sink your claws into the expanding universe and try to keep that fucking thing from expanding you're gonna get ripped apart that's just the way it works but if you want to let go and merge into the thing if you want to allow yourself the fantasy that you're not some individual with the social security number and a name and parents but allow yourself the fantasy that you're 13.8 billion years old and you're part of this incredible ocean of happening instead of just this one individual and just let yourself experience that for a second the glorious knowledge that you are a never-ending ever-changing flow of matter that's temporarily manifested with the ability to express love into a dimension where things are supposed to be cooling off then that's a fun way to spend your time here before you end up getting eaten by a lion or have a heart attack or whatever happens it's just a backflip this is a this is like a high dive this is like when you see people come off of a high dive and you get like a few seconds to do some cool fucking tricks that's what you get here we're like dolphins jumping out of the eternal and we into time and while we're shoot up into time we get a chance to do a couple of back flips a couple of chirps and that's our life's work and then we plunge back into infinity again do it all over again it's like if you're creating characters for fiction and the idea that you can't create a cunt you know you can't make a slut you can't make a girl who's all fucked up in the head well they exist in life okay and if you're making fiction your fiction doesn't necessarily have to represent anything other than what's in your head what's the wacky story you're trying to get out you don't any obligation to use a certain amount of Asians you don't have any obligation to use a certain amount of white people or black people your obligation is to make something cool up make it up pull it out of your head well is look people worry about entertainment like that that's so very that when I was religious that was our well as drovers witnessed dude like every fucking thing I watched like smart like Smurfs was off-limits for some fuckin bullshit reason right it wouldn't let you watch the Smurfs yeah I mean so white really but there's I don't know what there's some demonic thing with that and it's always fucking and then I remember there's Simpson somebody came in and gave a talk brother Tucker his name was he was like the traveling overseer was his title all right and he would come and like give talks in the congregate I was in meetings like three nights a week so he this whole fucking talk about all this shit that would like how et was bad because yeah cuz He healed the boy they're like yeah who do we know is the only person who can heal like I might start believing et is the real Jesus right that's the fear and then the Simpsons had rebellion against Authority mmm more in disrespect of like your elders so that's so I could hear the mothers well I'm not like my kid watch it I could hear them chattering after that like that's what this shit is now it's like what is what's the representation it's not propaganda so shit's just candy you know so we were talking about this before the podcast do you think that some like overtly upset PC people that what they're doing is almost like a form of like protecting Lorde almost like a form of fighting against blasphemy my church I remember all of them that were like oh well you don't think like absolutely just doing that same behavior I believe that 100% I think you're right you know the exact same thing yeah I don't even mind them as long as you're trying to get me fired I don't you say whatever you know but if you want to criticize I'm not against criticism right right that's fine just do I have to be fired just can we not do that part of it well that that is where you find out like exactly what kind of people they are like what it would exactly they try and accomplish they're trying to engage in discourse with a reasonable person you're a reasonable guy you'll have conversations with people but that's the thing they want you instantly labeled as an unreasonable person who's not to be debated well you shouldn't even have to bring it up you shouldn't know what the right thing is to do remember the anti Seinfeld mm-hmm like well you know so I felt like Chris rocks is the same thing right yeah about college but he's allowed to yeah that was not since Seinfeld comes out and it's like well he's irrelevant and an old man something which by the way that's like saying someone's fat yeah see the difference in him right I mean it's defusing his his argument and what he's saying is you know what Jerry Seinfeld was saying was that the colleges are too PC you know call you on everything this daughter of they don't even know what the fuck these words mean and what constitutes that right that's exactly right that's the I don't think that PC ruins comedy like people who are funny are still funny it kind of fucks up audiences right so we both I have the same goal as one of these pzp like I think people should be more sensitive to each other and all that shit right I do as well but their system is not going to create that just gonna create fucking people that shut down at buzzwords right so that's not helping [Music]
