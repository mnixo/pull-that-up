the girag and experience I'll be alright um the books called the disaster Diaries how I learned to stop worrying and love the apocalypse and its really fucking interesting stuff man and you went you went really deep with this you covered so many aspects of the whole idea of survival and the whole idea of like really chaos situations and they're trolling your adrenaline and relaxing and how most people really have no idea that like when this shit hits the fan most people are just literally gonna like shut off yeah they're gonna shit their pants and shut off and that is a much more common reaction than not totally yeah it's so interesting to see that like you know a lot of people don't know what they don't know you know what I mean and that's that was come so one of the major you know sort of things I took from this book was what stress does you know you and I you know you've been in the fight game for a long time and I've written about the fighters mind and stuff and I was shocked at how you know the Cooper's color code wasn't talked about in the fight game you know what I mean which you know it's a shootin thing explain the Cooper so it's in the book the Cooper's color code which anybody who's does any shooting will know about but but it's basically Jeff Cooper was a very well known farms instructor in the 60s and he came up with this color code about your sort of alertness level and you know white you're at home kind of off or listening to music or watching TV and then yellow you're on the street and now orange you're you know you're sort of seeing maybe possible danger and then red you're fighting and that was how he sort of quantified it and then the Marine Corps later came up with black which was the catastrophic failure of your mind basically like the total breakdown and it was just so interesting this sort of you know I've been sort of hearing about this anecdotally and I'd seen it with fighters you know guys freezing we're just doing dumb shit over and over again you know it's not working but they can't stop and they're getting punched in the face so that's definitely not helping them there but you know the fact that I mean I'm sure some of these trainers knew about it but nobody had mentioned you know there's this huge raft of data and research that's been done on stress and what it does to your body and it wasn't you know really being utilized in the fight game but you had Kimbo in fucking side control you work to get it you got you were in a dominant position he was tired and they stood you back up Kelly shoulder side bitches Joe Shaw said we did a radio interview you know everyone's on the other line I've just finished training so I'm on the phone and one of no one was asking me fucking any questions and I thought yeah I'm just the guy came about to be so and then because someone asked to go show a question he said this is how he was holding fom the ask our show the question I like they just I had it ever sister just in case you can't visualize it he said to him what would you do James Tom someone and he said I'd hang myself and I thought wow that's the dumbest motherfucker in the history of MMA productions the the idea that you have one guy that's the most important thing in Bangka everything on him winning yeah those stupid eggs by says if you kick that guy's ass it would have been awesome if they left you inside control would have been awesome just like it was awesome for him when he won it was been awesome for you then you know you gotta let the guy who's supposed to win win there's a lot of fights where the referee airs on a side of caution and protects the fighter and in a case like yours you feel like you were denied an opportunity because of that right yeah and that what what I was saying before so I was and belen but I was backstage and it just happened I'm goes on that fucking shit yeah Carlos over the column or yes Carla what seems like a nice guy with a fucking dollar sign fucking yeah is a chain of dog sign chain oh the esses yeah it's clever yeah well he grew up with a Rich Dad I mean boy yeah you know it's an interesting way to live your life but he came up to me and he said you got what's the hospital you got the hospital name I know you got to go the hospital yeah I'm okay I turned to him and I said yeah it said yeah but it turned away oh you know because it was a lot going on so you hear me I'm gonna turn back I win you have to go to the hospital now I'm taking you now and I'm you really want me to go to the hospital right too much so then I went to the press conference instead and as I walked into the past conference Gary Shaw was going we just have to take James Thompson to the hospital the ads breathing for a number I'm someone caught into it and I was drinking a drink yeah I mean and I think that's something really here's the legit asyou for real a woman like Jodie Foster can come out of the closet and still play someone's wife no problem no one has a problem with it right if Tom Cruise and I'm not saying Tom Cruise is gay but if Tom Cruise was gay and he came out of the closet and then wanted to do a movie where he was making out with a share so it's over that's that's reality I'm United I believe I mean I shouldn't say it's reality because I'm basing it on my own personal feelings of how it would go well they would go down it might go down differently but I think that you know the people who do polling for politicians and stuff like you know that I mean you'd be amazed at how irrational voters are how finding out one little thing about somebody's past can really sway an election so people are very you know for the most part people are pretty conservative in their ideology yeah it doesn't seem to be an issue when you're women that are coming out it's like we don't really have that much of a problem with that there's not there's no like there's not a situation I really think it's all your bump and moms and you're making out yeah there's a neediness to cock and also there's also the stigma of disease and all that so that comes with it too right with the gay side yeah well if they're just in a jerking off each other really plain staring each other in yeah they're looking away looking away what are you worried about all they see you dick for a second as a goof I'm a jerk at often I've been shaving around my because they say it makes my dick look bigger but I'm not convinced give me an opinion I mean I want you to be objective here let me give it a look I gotta give it a look I don't think you lose any bigot that looks a lot bigger I'm telling you it doesn't look can I be honest with you it doesn't even when you choke you with this you look like you should have hopes you just suck it and they wouldn't even feel bad it would just go all the way in your mouth I mean I bet you try it right now I bet is going out you mean you don't think you could feel it we need to I'll try I need to do another Mikey yeah yeah absolute on e in the bass all right suppose the characters names to remember Mikey whatever was Mikey and my mom who's Kelly Kirsten yeah she was great when I was involved in boxing some of the best fights I ever saw her in the gym oh yeah you know oh hell yeah won that one day I saw livingstone bramble and Roger Mayweather oh fucking go at it at a fucking gym in Vegas yeah another time Wow one of the gyms cuz because we all work together I worked with Mayweather I worked with Nick one kick of Floyd when Floyd was first coming I mean we all work together in these gyms you know and uh one time there was this dude he was a heavyweight his name was Tracy and him and Roger Mayweather fucking got into it he was Tracy was a young heavyweight twenty-four year old kid

and start a fight man yeah yeah they started fucking fighting and at the end of the round when the bell went off Tracy tried to stop and Roger fucking lit him up and he goes no rounds motherfucker no round oh so they just kept fighting straight fucking through until fucking Tracy quit oh my god Roger fucking whooped his ass and he fucking quit and it's in 40s yeah and then and then when he quit Roger hit him another eight nine times after he fucking quit and he's basically like don't have a fucking mouth off to me in this gym a 147 pounds forty year olds yeah but Roger like Mambo yeah you know a lot of people don't know Roger you know a lot of people everybody knows Floyd but Roger his uncle in his time he was a bad motherfucker he had a piston right hand yeah he had a nasty jab and he
