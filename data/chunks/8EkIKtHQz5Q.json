four three two one hello Michael welcome thanks ma'am thanks for doing this thanks for coming in a hundred percent man people don't know the story we'll give them the brief synopsis I found out about your story online because there was this viral thing that was going on about a chef who was getting protested by a bunch of animal rights activists and vegans who decided to camp out in front of your business and try to the restaurant called antler in Toronto try to I don't know what the fuck they were trying to do but you decided to butcher a leg of deer in front of them and it became this horrific thing like how could you do that in a place that serves meat how could you prepare the meat right in front of them like how did this all get started how did it become such a crazy viral story and why why would they mad at you when there's a million other restaurants around you all right so it started in about December that's why it went viral cuz I wasn't being nice I wasn't the stereotypical Canadian no you weren't even be mean you were just doing your job and doing my thing so they started in December and they really this right in front of your eyes they they really got pissed off with our we have a little chalkboard sign out front I'll give you the comp we have a forty-five seat restaurant so we're a small have one business partner who's a my best friend and family friend and we had a little chalkboard sign up front that said venison is the new kale and you know we get cute with our sign we tease other restaurants around us like we have fun with the sign and it's fun and this cyclists vegan rode by and took huge offense to our sign and all of a sudden one day these protesters just showed up so originally I was just kind of frustrated because of their totally misguided because we take a lot of pride in where our food comes from we have vegan and vegetarian dishes on the menu and I really respect that type of diet so we were just totally floored with why this was happening and so this started going they'd started come every week and they went from like 2 or 3 people being kind of peaceful to being like 10 15 people not so peaceful so it's when it turned not so peaceful they were shouting at our guests and shouting in our door and really trying to harm our business that I just kind of got fed up last resort went down we get a whole deer a couple times a month and we we butchered ourselves and I just said screw it screw it I'm like I'm gonna get these people to get out of here so I thought that that would make them go away how did you think that was gonna make them go away not escalate it I don't know I was it was just totally like last resort totally fed up I wanted to defend myself defend our customers you know you could see people walking in visibly upset you know they're being shouted at being screamed at called a murderer as they're walking in for dinner like you're going on a date you want his time and then people are screaming at you you know just for eating so I was just fed up and I just kind of thought like you know buzz off and why so just one sign what's in is the new kale one sign set this whole thing off yeah and you're surrounded by restaurants I mean I know where you are so we're surrounded by restaurants Anto there's an actual butcher shop across the street and if you go in there's like whole cattle hanging that's okay in there butcher shop you're a problem with your comparison to kale you attack their sacred hail we're promoting meat I don't know that's really bizarre because you were promoting we were promoting it or yeah so I just didn't promote anything yeah and they were allowed to cycle by and dream of broccoli yeah interference yeah man I have no idea I'm sorry how many times did they protest you I think it's about eight now hey they're coming weekly they still do they still do there's one this Friday oh Jesus organized them there they organized them there's like Facebook groups there's a they're basically giving us an ultimatum we have to put their slogan in our win and they'll go away what yeah what's their slogan arm cunts there's there's like I can't remember it you know word for word but it's you know like killing animals is wrong they have feelings why yeah do you have to put that in your window we don't we're not going to but no but that's what they want that's what they want yes eco-terrorism extortion whatever you want to call it Wow well the part the part of this addresses you the most crazy is the fact that you're surrounded by restaurant we're surrounded by restaurants you're surrounded by like you said you're across street from a butcher shop 97 percent of the people in the world eat meat it's something something crazy like that I mean I'm sure everyone hasn't really been polled I'm sure it's not that accurate but it's somewhere between 95 and 97 it's big it's big and I think we know we're an easy target you know our name is antler we were I think they're mad because you know their thing is that we're promoting ethical farming and their beliefs is there is no such thing as ethical farm right that all meat is murder and you know if you look at murder in the dictionary it has to do with humans you know has nothing to do with animals and there is such a thing as ethical farming and sustainable farming and we work really hard to make sure that where we get our meat from is from the best possible place we can and it's local so it's supporting our local farmers that are you know within hours of our restaurant now when you say that they started out nice like how many people were there in the beginning 2 3 4 and once they had signs and they were just kind of you know promoting their message but they weren't really yelling and screaming and what escalated it so we would call the police we kind of got wind of it on their Facebook groups so we would call the police and have the police there to make sure everyone's safe because one thing like customers are scared our staff are scared like no one's dealt with this before I've never dealt with this before so we would have the police there you know they were the police were amazing and then you know one time we kind of okay let's not call the police let's see what happens like maybe they'll just they'll go away and so then like a megaphone came out our neighbors were coming down and getting in fights with them and it was it was ugly so we called the police to come in Jesus Christ he's the piece yeah a megaphone yeah part of the problem with these kind of things is it becomes a contest becomes a battle you know trying to see who's gonna win mm-hmm and they're absolutely on a team I mean this that that's one of the things that happens with veganism and I think it happens with hunters too people become very tribal you know and you know it's us versus them and they want to win and then it becomes this thing where you know look the reality is a lot of people are idiots and they don't have a lot going on in their life and so when something comes up where it becomes a primary focus of their life one restaurant is illogical as it might be that becomes the battleground and it's an ideological battleground for you know don't eat meat ever versus sustainable farming you know just look I'm sure I know you're a hunter I'm sure you feel a certain amount of remorse when an animal dies a hundred percent and you know that's a big part of sort of my beliefs in my philosophy and why I'm working on this cookbook right now is because I think that you know if you do eat meat you should be able to kill an animal and experience that and I think that if people were to actually kill an animal they would see you know what goes into that and I don't think people would consume as much mean and I don't think people would definitely you know there's certainly wouldn't waste as much meat as they do and it's it's just really upsetting and I think it's totally misguided you know why we were targeted well I mean like I said I think it just becomes a game yeah it becomes a the big tribal game you know there's there's a real argument a real argument that I support against factory farming and factory farming is the way most people are getting their meat in terms of like in terms of like cheeseburgers and fast food and stuff along those lines I mean you're not getting it from the most ethical sources it's just it's not financially sustainable to do it that way everything would cost more money yeah and that's a real problem that we as a society it's not obviously not you were either set up the system but that this system is a system that we find ourselves a part of mm-hmm it's a real problem I've removed myself from it for the most part but occasionally I'm on the road and I'm hungry and you know I'll eat some meat that's just whatever totally it's it's a necessary evil you know in sort of sort of but really necessary at all that maybe that's the wrong way to describe it but it's how the system's been set up and it's it's actually why I started hunting and doing what I do because I watched these documentaries like Food Inc and these things that kind of Shawn a light on you know the system and how this stuff is actually being produced and it's horrible it's it's terribly is yeah and I think that's the real number-one problem and you know and this vegan activist message to go after you know these types of farming you know we support as well we agree with so the fact that we were targeted for this was really really frustrating yeah I think vegans I understand where they're coming from but I don't think that they have seen the big picture and the big picture is there's some animals that need to be harvested they they're not sustainable wild pigs is the best example yeah there is no way you are going to stop wild pigs without killing them there's no way you're not going to give them birth control you're not going to unless you're gonna let loose fuckin packs of wolves and I mean packs to deal with like what's going on in Texas does that mean they they're forced to shoot them out of helicopters they're crazy they hire people to come in with helicopters and shoot them from the sky it's that bad and this is farmers there's companies called hella hunting they have it on the side like if they have a wild boar and a fucking helicopter blade on their logo it's crazy they have to do it ya know and I I don't I don't have a lot of experience with that because where I am we don't have that wild boar problem but I hunt with these guys from from mossy oak and I've gone down there and done one of these Pig hunts and they've shown me their fields and like 1/3 of their cornfield is just destroyed destroyed and they have to hunt them at night or they hunt them with dogs and it's a huge problem for farmers trying to make a living it is a huge problem and vegans themselves need to understand that's your food supply totally you're not growing your own food mostly most people listening to this that are vegan are not growing their own food you're getting your own food from a farm that farm is being attacked by pigs that's only one animal another one is deer I mean there's a shitload of deer in North America what's interesting is California has a very weird way of handling it and I kind of get it in some ways the weird way that we handle it in California is we don't hunt mountain lions okay there's no mountain lion hunting this is very few deer yeah I mean I see deer in my neighborhood you know I'm live in a fairly rural area yeah I see deer you know a couple times a week but it's nothing like if you go to the East Coast have you ever been in the east coast of California or of the united states like New York State that kind of area but New York City yeah I've been to the east coast now this state if you go upstate like New York State there's so many fucking deer up there it's one of the reasons why Lyme disease is so horrible up there it comes from the ticks that were on the deer yeah and people get these terrible terrible cases of Lyme disease and it's fucking everywhere up there man I have several friends that have really bad Lyme disease yeah they have to take go to Jim Miller's Instagram Jim Miller is a fighter in the UFC high level fighter who's been competing at the highest level for a long time and he has serious lyme disease to the point where it's like debilitated it's scary he has to take a fat bag of pills and he held up his pills the other day what he takes Wally's look at that this is what he takes while he's in training camp that's insane 19 days of medication supplements he says he said fuck lis me 31 capsules a day you do the math remember the carried is seven and it just says Lyme disease is one of the hashtags yeah he's got it really bad and I mean what's crazy is the guy could not be healthier works out constantly eats right he's not boozing his body's just falling apart because of fucking Lyme disease and and it's being carried by these these deer overpopulation of wild animals is handled in one of two ways either you introduce predators or you manage them with hunting there's a place in Mountain Maui where they are that Maui has no predators you know and but they also have a bunch of wild game that was brought in for King Kamehameha I think it was in the 1800s they brought it in I'm not sure when but there's tons of access deer on Maui and on lanai and on Molokai a couple of different islands and one of the things they've started doing is they were trying to figure out how to eradicate them from this area so a bunch of hunters got together and they're hunting these access deer and then giving the meat to poor people like making it free for them yeah and it's a it's a really cool program but that's another sort of situation where you kind of have to hunt yeah there's no other unless you're just gonna poison them or you're going to somehow or another capture them all and neuter and spay a certain amount of them every month there's really no other way to handle it yeah I think that's a big misconception like people that don't educate themselves about hunting their dasai cunting is bad killing animals is bad and they get on this bandwagon but they don't have enough information about it yeah and I think people confuse trophy hunting you know with like they see Cecil the lion and everyone goes after okay it's hunting is the is the problem but you know trophy hunting is the problem but the hunters that that hunt for food and then hunt to you know help the the sort of environmental impacts that they're having like people like snow geese I don't know if you know much about you read that article that you retweeted actually yeah they like a Nat Geo article that I that I posted you know these birds fly in flocks of like 2030 thousand birds and they land in a farmer's field and they eat everything everything and they destroy it and you know like 10-15 years ago these populations of birds they weren't like they are now so well large scale agriculture is also responsible for the boom and the population of deer right you know deer in America particularly like in Midwest where all the farms are it's what is it a fucking coincidence that there's all the deer where all the farms are no it's not my good friend Doug durin he has a big-ass farm in Wisconsin beautiful place in the Driftless area do you know what that is no it's where the the glaciers didn't pass through so it's not flat there's all these hills and it's very beautiful in lakes it's phenomenal place but essentially he's got the deer that he hunts and that that he and his friends hunt on his property there farm animals their own corn greetings I mean he grows corn he's a farmer so he grows all this corn the deer are eating all this corn and they're fucking delicious man they're huge they're so good but there's a reality to population control now in Wisconsin they get it because they're around them every day they're hitting them with their cars they see them everywhere they look there's this is not like the idealistic view of someone who lives in a city street in Toronto and is driving around their bike looking for signs that are criticizing kale or whatever the fuck they're doing they're not in the real natural world that these animals are they don't get it they don't understand you know they live in their bubble and you know another thing they don't understand hunters actually you know we have to buy tags we have to buy our licenses there were rules and laws that we have to follow and those fees actually pay for the Wildlife Conservation and I'm sure it's the same in the states as well from at least talking to my friends and it is pikmin Robertson Act and they don't there's 11 percent of all the proceeds from hunting gear go to wildlife conservation and that turns out to be billions and billions of dollars it's far more than any other conservation group far more than any wildlife conservation group or animal activist group no one contributes more to conservation than hunting no because we want it we want it to be there for our kids and their kids and it's its nature it's it's how the world is supposed to be it's also this contradictory thing that seems it seems like it doesn't make sense but we love the wildlife and love the animals just because you eat them doesn't mean you don't love them but you recognize them as this is a weird way to look at it but it is a renewable resource right and it is also a magical beautiful thing just because of that doesn't mean you shouldn't eat it yeah I mean it's this this disconnect that people have with the wild I think is a real part of it a real part of the problem good luck finding a vegan in Alaska you know there's not a whole lot of them that live out in the bush that are vegans more salmon you can you can bring in vegetables I mean I'm sure there are some I'm just talking shit but the reality is if you are if you're embedded in that world you understand it and you appreciate it it's very humbling I mean killing an animal is very humbling them it sounds like just some what is an animal lover that sounds fucking crazy it's hard it's also really hard like when I see a deer commit I hunt with a with a bow crossbow and I see a deer come out it's I'm trembling I the hair on my back is standing up there these beautiful majestic creatures and I'm gonna kill it and it's it's really really difficult and I don't think that people understand that that don't hunt and then haven't killed an animal they don't understand the respect and the amount of effort that goes into that no they definitely don't but they don't care I mean what they have an idea and the ideas animals should not die yeah but they're going to die it's they're going to die of old age they're gonna die of starvation they're gonna freeze to death they're gonna they're gonna be eaten alive they're gonna be eaten alive and people think that animals they died peacefully in the wild it's it's absolutely incorrect if you you know google anything about how animals die in the well and they're being eaten alive like deer being taken down and eaten alive by wolves or coyotes or whatever it is there's bears and it's horrific and to be shot with an arrow to be shot with a bullet it's a way more humane way to go in my in my opinion oh it's it's unquestionably a more humane way to go I mean it's the one of the reasons why you know I hunt and I practice so much I practice every day ever one of the reasons why we got this building so I could put a 45 in door to practice well we could shoot afterwards with awesome I have to fucking practice you have to be you have to be able to make an ethical shot but now when I sit down and I cook something for my family I know where that came from if we have vegetables that we grew in our garden there's a great satisfaction for serving up some cucumbers or some some kale or whatever it is that we grew in our garden it to taste better when you when you go out there and you cut that cucumber off the plant and you cut that kale down it is like half an hour old you know and it like nothing compares to that freshness that you go to the grocery store that maybe a couple days a week a month old you have no idea and for me as a chef that's why I love hunting and foraging and having a garden in my backyard because when you go and pick something nothing tastes as good as that right you know I mean I appreciate where vegans and animal rights activists are coming from because it's coming from I think there's a lot of distortion with like really angry ones and but this is my take on a lot of this if you get a group of a hundred people one of them for sure is a fucking idiot just out of just sheer odds right like what are the odds one of them is a fucking it's pretty strong right well if you're gonna get a group of 100 vegans you're gonna get at least one of them that's fucking idiot and they're gonna be some of them are violent some of them are super aggressive about I mean there's a ton of them online you can go their identity is completely wrapped around veganism these vegan in their name it's always I'm the vegan this or the vegan that that is a hundred percent of their name so a hundred percent of their identity so they can't they can't separate from it ever like that is who they are forever and they have there's been some serious problems what was the name of that cafe again Cafe Gratitude there's some people that were running a vegan restaurant I think they have a couple of them right you know I and they were having health issues and some people the vegan diet just doesn't agree with them and maybe they were doing it wrong maybe they have unique dietary needs but they started raising cattle and they started eating those cattle and the fucking vegans freaked out death threats all this crazy shit coming after them protesting and you know these people were terrified they're older folks they're they're you know they're elderly they're it is vegan restaurant owners received death threats over animal slaughter scandal yeah I mean this is the bad ones right and it's not most of them most vegans I think are vegans for all the right reasons yeah misinformed if you choose to not to not eat meat and and choose that kind of lifestyle like power to you that's it's amazing and I think that it you know if if it works for you and your body that's great and for me it doesn't work for me like I've done vegan cleanses I've done the juice cleanses I've done you know I've gone out for as a chef to vegan restaurants and I'm not full you know I also I'll eat three or four courses I'll spend tons of money and half an hour later I'm starving starving and it's I just need to eat something with protein and lots of protein and it's it's meat or fish or you know I've made tofu from scratch from soybeans and it's just it doesn't it's not the same yeah well right now people are screaming it through you're doing it wrong but I'm not some of it is some of its good I mean I vegan all the time like there's a vegan restaurant near me I go to all-time sometimes and get dirty looks this motherfuckers here why are you here it's just it's very unfortunate that I think these ideological groups get tainted by the most extreme members and I think that's true on the hunting side too and you got guys like fucking Ted Nugent you know and all the the people that I think that they distort the the real sort of fascinating and mystical qualities of wildlife and harvesting wildlife and being out there and experiencing nature it said it's an almost psychedelic experience to hunt and be in the wild that sounds so counterintuitive to someone has never experienced it but the world of these animals when you're away from your cell phone when you're away from you know television and all the bullshit and the computer when you're when you're out there in the wild you are host in another dimension if you're in complete silence in the forest in you your mind goes into a completely different sort of mode that is familiar but yet alien its familiar in a way that your body's like oh this is hunting this is what humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years this is why we became human I mean it's literally one of the reasons that scientists believe that our brains grew is because we started eating meat we started cooking meat the nutrition became more accessible and also we started thinking about how to hunt developing tools to hunt with I mean all of this is the reason why humans are humans today and I'm sure the vegan argument against that would be well that's then and we're past that now well we're not no we're not we're not because of controlling the population of animals we're certainly not because of controlling the population of predators and that's another thing that people need to accept and understand there's a reason why they eradicated all the wolves in North America before they reintroduced them to Yellowstone and now the thriving in many parts of the northwest it's because they were fucking killing everything and there's they don't have any predators and the only predators that they have are humans and if we don't keep the populations in check of them and of grizzly bears of black bears and all the other predators they start eating each other they start tearing each other apart they start coming after us starting crouching on people but we're in their territory we shouldn't be in their place we humans incredible look I'm on Team people so I don't know what the fuck you're saying here you know if you're saying that we should move out of San Francisco and give it to the wolves you can go fuck yourself alright and this is literally what it boils down to because you have to draw some line the sand somewhere because if someone doesn't control the population of animals then what's gonna happen well you know you can leave them to their own devices and they can sort of sort it out but you know how they sorted out through disease and starvation I mean what happens is there's too many animals and not enough food so they get horrific diseases that's where mange comes from that's where a lot of like serious diseases that an infect wildlife come from they come from a lack of food or overpopulation that's how nature sorts it out you know and that's how nature sorts it out with people - we're just sneaky we've used a vaccine shit and we're the type of food chain yeah we've worked hard to get there we are and I think we it comes with a certain responsibility and that responsibility is really we're really doing a disservice to that responsibility with factory farming and that's one of the main arguments for veganism then one of the main arguments is the horrific treatment of those animals whether it's veganism or whether it's rather factory farming or whether it's a large-scale dairy farms where they mistreat their cows or the chicken farms or all these different factory farms where they treat these animals not as a living being but as a commodity then it becomes a giant problem but if you look at guys like do you know Joel Salatin is know Joel Salatin is a very fascinating guy he runs a farm called Polyface farms and what he is essentially done is made large-scale animal agriculture possible in a humane and very natural way he has enormous electric fences that he uses for his pigs and he just moves him around moves the fences around so the pigs wander around he has a huge rolling chicken coop I mean it's fucking huge and he pushes that thing around he moves it to a new space the chickens go out they wander around they do the chicken thing and they go right back into the chicken house and this is where he gets the eggs from this is how they raise chickens this is how they raise cattle they do it with all these different animals and his perspective on all this is that if you if you do it right it's not horrific it's not an evil thing and that these animals are living the way they've they're meant to live right that's one that's one of the things that we do at antler is to find those farmers and guys like that one of the farms we get our deer from they have a thousand acres the deer roam as they please they're eating nuts and apples and acorns and grass and everything they're supposed to eat and then when it's time there they're collected and harvested and that that is where we get our meat from and we try really hard not to buy from these facts we don't serve chicken beef or pork we have bison pheasant duck wellbore because you know these game farms they don't have these massive large-scale operations and I I direct from the farmer and they can tell me what their diet is you know with their good months their bad months we know all about these animals that we're bringing to the restaurant and and we know we're really proud of that I have an issue with people that keep saying wild boar why would they say wild boar when it's wild pig so it's male it actually is a different breed so the the the pigs that are in these you know factory farms or even regular regular pigs there's there's tow there's many different breeds and a lot of them are hybrid hybrid breeds the the wild boar breed has long black hair and tusks that actually come out so I can buy whole pigs and they don't have those tusks and when I buy the wellbore breed the meat is darker the the hair is black but we're getting them you know there's no hair by the time we get them and they've got the tusks in the jaw right my point is that a boar is a male right you're definitely eating females - that's true yeah so why they call it a wild boar it's just yeah it's just a breed yeah but they're do you know that they're all the same breed I did not know that they're all soo scruffa is the the the I guess the genus is that we say they're all sort of interchangeable right well there's a breed with each I I dunno there's tons of different varieties like there's the Berkshire there's Tamworth there's all these different kinds of short breathing of hogs there's variations yeah but they're all the same animal what's crazy about wild pigs is if you took a domestic pig mm-hmm you know like babe yeah let release babe out into the forest they morph right with a very short amount of times there's now it extends their hair becomes darker and thicker their tusks lengthen interesting it's very weird they're a weird animal pigs are a weird animal because we're we're a weird animal when their domestic they're sweethearts yeah unless you fall in their cage when they're hungry then they fucking eat you crazy it's one of the main ways that farmers die fall into cages that's even better if something happens all the time it does happens every year Kyle fuck up and fall into a pig pen and the pigs just fuck him up that's crazy yeah especially if you're you know you dealing with those really enormous pigs I mean those pigs need a lot of food and they're fucking big yeah and once they start chewing you that's your ass this is just a side have you been paying hunting yeah yeah yeah I've been shot a couple pigs yeah the meat is definitely different it's a lot of darker darker yeah it's delicious though yeah and where I do it what's really interesting is in California a lot of the pigs were introduced by William Randolph Hearst that crazy asshole that ran you know from the movie Citizen Kane of course and Welles depiction of him yes this crazy guy that ran Hearst publications in the 1930s he's literally one of the reasons why marijuana is illegal right William Randolph Hearst decided that when there was a cover of believe his popular science magazine that said hemp is the new billion-dollar crop and they were they had invented a machine called the D cor Decatur and what a D cor Decatur does is it effectively processes hemp fiber much more efficiently and for the longest time they used slaves to process hemp fiber but then Eli Whitney came around with the cotton gin and they switched from hemp clothing to cotton cotton is easier to produce with the cotton gin but is this an inferior cloth hemp makes better paper hemp makes cloth you can make houses with it Henry Ford made the first fenders for the first Model T out of hemp I mean helps a crazy thing William Randolph Hearst read this article saw what was coming and realized that he was going to have to transition all of his paper mills and he owned forests that they would cut down the trees and make paper with they were have to transition those to hemp if people were demanding hemp so instead he undercut the entire industry by saying that there was a new drug that blacks and Mexicans were smoking and they were raping white women and he called this drug marijuana which was really just the name of him it was a Mexican slang for wild tobacco so he start printing these stories Congress made it illegal didn't even a lot of people that were voting on it didn't even know that they were making cannabis or like hemp the the the textile and the commodity hemp they didn't know they were making it illegal they thought they were stopping a drug scourge that was forcing blacks and Mexicans to rape white women who's all William Randolph it's one crazy asshole with Harry Anslinger in the fuckin 1930s that's when it became illegal well this is the same crazy asshole let a bunch of wild pigs loose on his property so he can hunt them because he was a gentleman hunter so the pigs that I hunt in California when I go pig hunting ya probably are direct descendants from the pigs that were let loose by this asshole and then I think what a lot of people don't understand is how fast they breed you know my my friends in Mississippi were telling me you know Pig can lay a litter three times a year four times a year yeah up to 1012 piglets per litter and they have no natural predators so what are these farmers going to do and they start decimating their crops yeah they're not a native North American species no yeah and it's a it's one of the most destructive invasive species and if you if you've never seen them before you see them on TV they look you know oh it's a pig pigs are cute I've seen my friend has a pot-bellied pig I pet it that's that's great what they are as adults when they're wild boars covered in mud and disease they're fucking a mammal plague they're vicious and they would they go through everything they will spread across the country they'll destroy your garden to just delete your dog I mean no bullshit they're fucking dangerous yeah a lot of farmers actually ask me if I'll come hunt on their property a lot of vineyards will ask me to come in and they have a problem with the turkeys the turkeys are eating all the grapes you know stuff like that that you know a lot of these a lot of regular kind of city people live in the city they don't understand yeah turkey populations some places are exploding too because they've realized always just go to the suburbs know even hunts us there's one running down the street in Toronto last week a turkey people were filming it and sending me the TV they're delicious too yeah that's actually the the first bird I hunted I didn't actually start hunting until I was in my 20s and I had grown up cooking I was interested in becoming a chef and a family friend told me he was going turkey hunting and I said well what do you mean you're going turkey hunting like I thought turkeys were I didn't know there was such thing as well Turkey I thought there you know a domesticated bird like a chicken so he takes me turkey hunting and I actually I couldn't believe it we you know we shot a couple birds you know we plucked them out and then the skin was yellow and then the meat is dark like like the chicken leg meat is like the breast like it's dark and is not like wow like this is incredible and then when I tasted it I I just couldn't believe that this is what Turkey was supposed to taste like yeah blessed flavor and you grow up you know at least I grew up but you know Christmas Thanksgiving these these important holidays eating turkey and you see it and this is big white blob and it's humongous yeah and then you know wild bird it's leaner it's not like super round it's it's it's lean it's it's how it's supposed to be and that for me that was like the lightbulb moment that this is what we're supposed to be eating we're not supposed to be eating that shit yeah that shit that that really white meat turkey running down the street I'm so thankful to be here cuz it's still snowing it's still snowy I love winter and snowboarding and going out and enjoying the snow but I'm done yeah man I was talking to a buddy of mine from Montana on the phone yesterday it was fucking freezing cold up there thick snow everywhere and you know they're about to open up their bear season and he's like Jesus Christ it's just nose everywhere and I'm like dude I'm in my underwear right now outside I love it here man I have a soft spot for fur California I mean I've been coming here since I was a little kid to visit my dad in the summers and I come here two or three times a year and I love it I love it too I you know the mountain lion thing is a weird thing of California because I see their point what the what they've essentially done is and this is one of the weird things about California is like California is one of the places that doesn't have Fish and Game Department really yeah it's like you don't know Hall at that okay call it wildlife okay they don't call it like like they don't think of it as like you have to hunt them right like if you say like Fish and Game or Arizona calls it Game and Fish okay because there's more game in Arizona right in there are fish desert yeah it's kind of interesting the way they've switched it around but I think the way California calls is fish and wildlife see we call the Ministry of Natural Resources damn that's a good way to look at it but you know I can't argue with the effectiveness of their approach because you do not find dear in California right and deer hunters are extremely frustrated by that and I get it if you're like a local guy and you want to be able to hunt your own deer it's a hard going man it's crazy I actually didn't know there was hunting here I had no idea and through through hanging out with with my friends at mossy oak I met this guy that lives actually in Orange County's named Jeremiah dowdy from field to plate if you I don't know if you know this guy he's a local you know la guy and he hunts all over California I had no idea that there was so much hunting he's a really good friend of mine and I'm saying well what so he's like well there's turkey there's well Pig there's the the pronghorn there's all kinds of stuff that can hunt yeah - there's Rocky Mountain Elk near the hoenn ranch then there's tule elk that are natural on the coast there's just a lot of different animals here yeah but there's also a lot of motherfucker mountain lions whoa yeah and they still kill but the way they kill them now is through government trackers it's really kind of crazy what they do is mountain lions start eating people's dogs and cats and you know they get they get scary and then people call one of the you know I don't know who you would call that would take care of it and they hire people most the time they use dogs these dogs to tree the mountain and they shoot them and when they empty the contents their stomachs when they do an autopsy on them they find it filled with dogs and cats which is really kind of crazy that is no there was one near my where my dad lives a lady was attacked and they're running a pair of pair girls were running in the canyon and a mountain lion actually attacked one of them and she was like having a tug of war with the mountain lion like with her friends oh and I think was about five or six years ago when I was somewhere in Orange County someone was attacked running purple cyclone or something that yeah and they had they had to they went and and found it and shot it but well when they get hungry we are encroaching because we're encroaching on their land no it's it's just land yeah it's not there as you fuck this is what's crazy about people we're encroaching in their territory no no they're dead and then with the whatever was there that claim that territory is dead and then there's a new one that comes along and they take it there's a fucking constant battle this idea that like we're in there community like they have on an established gated community that we've entered and we start putting up houses and pissing off their neighbors no that's not what it is it's just land and if you hate people and you don't like cities well then go fucking live in the forest until then fuck off and stop saying like we're encroaching on their left do you go to the supermarket yes do you buy your vegan food at a vegan deli well that's a place where a deer could have lived okay do you go to the movie theater you do well you piece of shit that used to be like a squirrel's house that was a field at one point yeah I mean large-scale agriculture this is the other thing that kind of drives me crazy about vegans it's not I'm not saying you shouldn't eat grain I'm not saying you shouldn't eat vegetables but large scale agriculture in terms of just raising vegetables is responsible for a tremendous amount of death first of all there's the pesticides that they use that kill bugs now if you only like mammals and you don't mind when people kill bugs that seems a little hypocritical to me it's a little weird but does get weird and then there's the fact that when you're making these when you're using a combine running through the gather all the rabbits all the bunnies all them around dogs are being decimated decimated my good buddy lives in Iowa and you know he takes pictures he's like look we just chopped down we just cut the field look at all the vultures and the vultures just circling overhead and landing in the field right out they know when the combine rolls through they come in dinner time they literally know it's like there's places in Alaska especially on Kodiak Island where rifle shots equal I've heard of this dinner bell yeah the four bears come running this is crazy crane hunters are carrying like big Magnum 45s like pistols to defend themselves against these Grizzlies I'll send you a fantastic podcast that do you know Steve Rinella is no Steve Rinella is a really really interesting guy and he's a host of a TV show called meat-eater he's just oh yes yes he's an author he has a podcast that he recorded when they were in a fog nack Island which is like one of those chains of islands near Kodiak so it has those enormous coastal brown bears just like Cody and they got attacked they got attacked when they shot an elk and they were packing the elk out and they got rushed by a fucking tanker of a bear and it is a crazy podcast because they recorded it right after the fact whenever everyone's freaking out still and you know one guy had a pistol on him but he set it down next to his pack and they had all these ideas of like what it would be like if an animal came in like if they got attacked they had all these preconceived notions of what it would be like what it would feel like yeah it was like throw all that out the window it was good you weren't your brain it's like a reptilian level your brain is so terrified and this thing was so big my friend Jana said that he saw its teeth gnashing literally feet from his head as it ran through the camp oh my god that revenant is just like you I got rushed by a deer one time and I was losing it I didn't know what to do it was it was before sunrise it was like you know 5:00 in the morning I'm walking into my deer set up and I had to cross this little river and it was like full of stones and stuff and I'm kind of walking up this river and all I hear is I put it on put up put up and I'm like hold like what the hell is that noise and then it stopped and was pawing at the ground and snorting and I was like holy shit this is a buck and like I've my my I got goose bumps right now thinking about this and this is my boughs in my bag and I'm just like I'm gonna get taken down by this deer and then I think if thought it was another buck because it's you know it's in the right it's it's rutting season for these deer and it then it smelt that I was a human and it did that I got blown it whistled did that whistling blowing kind of sound and took off but I thought I was fucked I was like this is it gored I'm gonna get gored by these antlers and that's it those are big animals they're big we have big whitetail and 300 pounds sometimes they're big we and even our dough's are huge like we get we got a lot of doe tags where I grew up in in Caledon which is about an hour north of the city and a horse farm we don't have a gun season for deer so that's how I got into archery and and hunting with a bow that's interesting why is that you know what I don't know I think it's because it's it's the farms are kind of closer together it's sort of like you know it's not huge agriculture they're more kind of hobby farms so I think they're a little closer together they don't want letting loose bullets let loose both the main thing is rifles so deer season and turkey season you can use a shotgun and it's really stupid because you can you can shoot coyotes too with with a rifle or shotgun but there's no shotgun or rifle for deer which is weird that is weird so that but that's why I got into archery and yeah I'm lucky because it's it's so close to the city I can I can kind of go and hunt and then come back to work in the morning yeah the coyote thing is interesting because it's very counterintuitive the more coyotes you kill the more coyotes breed the more Kyle populations increase coyotes are off they're a big problem at least in Caledon where I'm from they've you know like you were talking with the mountain lions that's kind of our version I don't think there's any mountain lions where I live but the Coyotes are a problem they're nabbing people's dogs and cats off the trail people are we walking on their leash and they're coming out and oh yeah Nayland there yeah it's out here I had one kill a chicken of mine two weeks ago crazy yeah I've got a video of the dead fucking chicken and my chicken coop and then there's it's really dark I dug a hole and buried the chicken we don't eat our chickens we just use the eggs for eggs and they're like pets I mean like there's a video me from my Instagram walking in my yard holding my daughter's bunny and the chickens they're like they're follow me around I wrote I'm the motherfucking chicken this one because it's a crazy video because these chickens just follow me yeah I mean they literally they're like pets yeah so when this chicken died I was bummed out it was a sweetheart of a chicken too and this is a chicken that we was too we would turn over rocks and she would come and get the worms and so she would follow you around I'm like come on sweetie here we go and it's really like a pet I hear it is there's a video of me walking like look at them that's so cool they just follow me around man I know and a lot of farmers and people a little hobby farms they use chickens as insect control yeah they're vegetable garden oh they're great for that they're great for their they will fuck up some mice too man you ain't never seen no I didn't like it no you never say I did not know that dude this is how I found out about it well one one way I found out about it a mouse got in the chicken coop and they fucked that thing up and I was like wow that's crazy but and another thing happened was my daughter's found a hawk my wife decided in Oliver uh you know women are was trying to like spruce things up she decided she was gonna change some of these fences to a glass fence and the Hawks didn't get the memo and they suck a shit don't they they swan dive into this this glass wall and when we first put up the fence there was like three Hawks that got fucked up and one of them died and we found one of them that was just Kayode in that blood coming out of its nose like literally it was like a UFC fight it was down and fucked up so my daughters took this in and they put it in a large cardboard box and they had to figure out how to feed it because it was I think it was on Saturday and the wildlife rescue place was not open on the weekend and so we had to bring it into a place on Monday so over the weekend we went to this pet store that we go to and they sell something called pinky's it's a very cute term for baby mice that can't really see yet and they're separated from their mother and they feed them to snakes it's mostly reptiles that for him to but these Hawks would fuck these pinkies up and so to try to give this hawk some food while it was there over the weekend so it didn't starve that my daughters brought on the pinkies and there was one pinkie left that the hawk didn't eat when we brought the hawk to the wildlife rescue place so they they fixed up the hawk and they told us the hawk was they they took care of it swaying and eventually they released it back in the wild so it was a nice story but there's this one pinkie left over and the thing was gonna die it wasn't with its mother it was too small to drink milk and they were like we want to keep it we want to keep it as a pet I'm like that doesn't make any sense you were just feeding its brothers and sisters to this fucking Hawk and now you guys want to keep it so I said listen I think we should feed it to the chickens like no I was like what do you guys what are you crazy you can't keep it it's gonna die do you understand that and they said okay okay okay I go well listen you don't have to watch I'll just go out and do it dude I put that fucking thing down and I have never seen those chicken so voracious attacked that Mouse and then we're all chasing the one chicken that had the mouse trying to steal it from her watch this here's the chicken with a mouse right here look they get a mouse and they they fuck that mouse up man they try to steal it from each other tonight there's one where a cat is playing with a mouse a cat you've seen the one with the cat and the chicken Jaime that's the best one because the cat everybody thinks of cats is being vicious cats are pretty vicious chickens are fucking dinosaurs man the way the chicken attacks the mouse like here is see look at that it's got he's gonna eat that shit out of that mouse - he's got a she's got to keep her eyes open I can't still come and steal her mouse see look at her they're experts in bobbin and Weavin and turning in their heads but so the cat is stalking the mouse and the chickens like bitch you never know what you're doing the chicken just runs in and snatches it right in front of the cat the cats like my mouse they're way more ruthless I mean birds are ruthless creatures and chickens in particular are just I think it's just a part of their natural diet like when a mouse would get look at this see the cat the cats like wow check out this Mouse I can't believe how lucky I am so he's like you know cats for a cat half of its a game right this playroom yeah there's chick hanging back but as soon as the chicken finds it meanwhile that Mouse does not seem scare that chat he's not scared and I bet that mouse has talked so the chickens like fuck you give me that that is crazy crazy I did not know that about chickens oh dude they'll fuck my way they do it to you fast - and they think of it as purely as food they're not think like the cat it's its sport you're the cat it's kind of fun yeah that's probably fully fed and it's a house cat it's a house cat he's just looking to kill so that's nature that's nature people don't understand that they want to they want to remove themselves from it and that's great I don't want to understand it they don't want understand it they want something that aligns with their ideology and their ideology is love and compassion except for people that eat meat and then their death death threats I mean that's really what it is it's it's an ideological battle and in that sense veganism becomes very much like a religion because you like you support all the people that are on your side and the people that are opposed to you are like apostates they're like they're like the negative people that are trying to bring you to the dark side to hell it gets it gets really crazy and there's a lot of evidence on their side in terms of like factory farming and their horrors of factory farming and even the the really incredibly poor modern American diet that they see a lot of people when they go vegan what they're doing one of the best things that they're doing is they're eliminating all the bullshit they're eliminating all the trans fats and all the fucking all the terrible shit that a lot of people eat that isn't vegan yeah but the negative thing is most of them are eating diets that are far too carbohydrate rich and if they're not getting their blood checked they don't even know how unhealthy they are they convince themselves they're doing much better than feeling much better but a lack of cholesterol can fuck with your hormone functions a lot of vegans have low hormones because of that we one of our regulars at antler was talking to me about about his experience he used to have a organic vegetable farm and he's a six foot seven big huge tall Dutch white guy and he goes to me he says you know I was vegan for a long time I had this organic vegetable farm and I thought that I was doing my body a service he said I thought I was doing something great for my body and he got really sick and he went to the doctor and the doctor said listen man you have to take supplements to supplement the the the things you're not getting from from eating meat or you have to go back to eating meat because just some people's bodies do better than others and I said a lot of Asian cultures are more susceptible to two vegetable diets but he's like in reality he's like you know your your northern European you know descent and you need to eat you know this stuff to be healthy and that's when he he went back to eating meat and it doesn't matter you know what what your truck he was living on an organic vegetable farm like what what more healthy you know vegetables could he be eating so yeah b12 is a big one and b12 essentially only comes from things other than vegetables you can get some of it from algae you can get I mean you definitely can get it from meat it's rich in meat and the other thing is iron iron you know people say well there's iron and vegetables there is but it's not very bioavailable right a lot of the various vitamins and even protein in vegetables not very bioavailable in most source and it's how your body absorbs those nutrients as well like it might it might be rich in that that that substance but your body can't really absorb it well it's just everybody's body's different I mean there's just that is an absolute fact that there are some people that can eat certain diets and be very healthy and then other people eat them and they have a really hard time with them yeah but the other thing is that most of these people that are talking about how healthy and how great they feel there's a lot of it is sort of a placebo effect and they're not getting blood work done yeah everyone regardless of what your diet is you should get blood work done just to find out if you have any potential problems that are on the horizon because there's a lot of times you'll feel ok and then you get your blood work done that the doctor will tell you him and you're really low in vitamin B and D and a and you know you need this and that and you know this is the health consequences of not having this stuff and your diet and if you are committed to a vegan diet there's ways that you can supplement and this is my advice to people if you want a supplement first of all algae is a great one you know tastes like shit but it's very good for your body and you just add it to smoothies you know just add it with coconut milk or a bunch of other things you can do it I mean you definitely can eat a vegan diet and be healthy but you got to be on the ball you know and the the b12 one is a big one it's a a massive amounts I was reading some crazy article the other day said something 90% of all vegans are b12 deficient I've heard this it's terrible there's a guy named Chris crasher that I had on my podcast before who's a brilliant guy who is he's an expert in diet nutrition who started out as a macrobiotic vegan and had massive health problems and then switched to eating meat eventually and then really became a connoisseur of meat which is like probably the most nutrient-dense food in the world I love I love that's my favorite thing about hunting is the organ meat meat tomb and I love liver liver and the heart I I went hunting and I came back and I brought the heart into the restaurant for the guys I wanted to you know share with them like the experience of eating like fresh-killed like the heart was still warm when I brought it to work and I the way I like to use either tartare like just mince it up raw or cook it like a steak so I cut it you know horizontally and into like it looks like a tenderloin steak and we all got like this like buzz like we just like shot a double espresso or something it was just like whoa and it's like it's so nutrient-rich the organ meat I had Alexander Gustafsson the podcast yesterday is the UFC number one light weight can light heavyweight contender big Viking motherfucker but he gets all of his meat from hunting for his training camps and everything like that he hunts Red Deer in in Sweden it's where he lives and we were both talking about how when you eat really nutrient-dense wild game it gives you like a stimulated effect like your body is like yeah more of this give me more of this it's there's something in it yeah I don't know what and it just tastes it tastes like it's supposed to taste and it's you can't explain it the flavor is totally different even when you know we're buying from these really cool game farms it's different than the deer that I go and shoot because you know that deer eye I just shot could be like six seven years old versus at the farm it's maybe one or two right but again it's eating such a diverse diet and it's you know my belief is that that's how we're supposed to be eating well it's definitely how we were eating for the longest time yeah and it is entirely possible that if humans like to say if you got an isolated group of humans that stuck to a very very rigid vegan diet for many many many generations it's entirely possible that our genes would adapt to that die and lifestyle it's totally possible the reality of your current physical form is its most likely not designed for that and this is just based on genes and on genetics and epigenetics and all the the various things that they've methods that they've devised to try to study what makes you a person and where where your ancestors came from and how did how did your ancestors develop did they mostly fish like there's people that live like in the in the northwest like the extreme like in Alaska and Inuit sand people there their entire history they've evolved from eating fish and whale and whale blubber and seal and seal fat and there's real changes to who they are as people like first of all one of the big ones is the people that live up there their hands don't get cold like ours do their hands that when the indigenous communities there was some program where they were trying to get them to stop hunting whales or and stop killing seals and the government was supplementing with them with with with beef and cattle and their argument was this is not what we're supposed to eat this is not what we're designed to eat you know we need the fat in the whale blubber to stay warm yeah it's kind of weird it's weird like why would we be forcing these people to eat something that you know is foreign to them and it's it's it's not that the fat content and beef is way different than whale and seal like it's like apples and oranges well it's also you're looking at what we were talking about before like white meat from Turkey domestic turkey versus the turkey that's a wild turkey when you see cows but you get these corn-fed cows you have this pale meat that meat is pale because it's not as good for you it's it's more filled with fat which tastes good but it's just it's not as nutrient-dense when you have a moose steak you've seen a moose steak before right it's fucking it's linked yeah but it's almost like like purple the dark dark oh yeah it's fucking dark man that's that's way different it's a way different thing yeah that cow is just some it's like the fattest laziest person you know like if you thought about like taking athlete like LeBron James who's just like this super athlete and compared like the composition of his body to some fucking slob who just drinks soda all day and is tired is on antidepressants and antibiotics because his body's fucking deteriorating rapidly he's got arthritis in all of his joints cuz he's too fat that literally is a cow that's literally one of these fucking farm-raised overstuffed corn-fed cows and they grind that fat fuck into a hamburger it's just not the same I'm not you know I'm not endorsing eating LeBron James but I'm saying there's a difference in what the the composition of their body is it's a different thing it's a very different thing totally yeah I mean I think wild things whether it's wild salmon or you know even wild vegetables I think would be probably better for you so it's a big part of what I do is is and it's one of the reasons why I love nature so much as is foraging and I take my kids out to the woods and we go pick mushrooms and since they were like you know babies my son's been dragged in the woods since he was one what kind of mushrooms so my favorite one to harvest where I live is morels oh yeah they're really funky looking they kind of look like a brain or something something weird I wears them online I've never seen him in the wild there's nothing that tastes quite like them that you can you can buy it's like a meat they're very meaty they're very meaty and there's a couple different kinds there's like black ones and kind of white or yellowish ones and they're just like it's so fascinating to go out into the wild and pick your own food and when you come home and cook it like nothing else tastes like that and like mushrooms from the store they're totally different and it's just it's something really special that you can go and experience in the wild yeah morels are a real weird one and I've been reading up on them but one of the strange things is when there's fire forest fires yeah they pop up like you make the next season they're like cleansing they're they're cleansing the earth I don't I'm not on my call just so I don't know you know I just enjoy finding them and eating them but I do know there's a cleansing property to decaying to decaying matter so when trees fall down like the the best place to find morels is I look for trees with no bark on them so they're they're really super old that's called a dead elm tree and they like the rotting roots of these dead elm trees and you know you're in the bush and or in the field and you kind of see this one tree that has no bark on it and it's about to fall over they'll be like 20 morels at the base they're kind of they're feeding off the root system that's underground yeah I'm absolutely fascinated by mushrooms I had Paul Stamets on the podcast so I saw that one how great is that guy super cool he gave me too much oh that does my am I gonna do it too case one breaks yeah extra mushroom app there's a really cool documentary actually it's called know your mushrooms I think it's by Ron oh I'm by Ron man and he he he travels along with these mushroom hunters I think a lot of its in Oregon and up the coast of California down in New Mexico but they're they're professional foragers that then go and sell these mushrooms but they tracked these foragers and it's such a cool movie that's interesting um the wells gonna say you better know mushrooms cuz they'll fucking kill you if you don't that that's the thing man it's like you know what my first experiencing foraging for mushrooms I was like an apprentice chef at this restaurant and the chef comes in was like hey check these out and I was like whoa like what the hell are these needs like all other morels like I found them mountain biking and there's this stigma you know like as a kid like your parents like don't don't eat those don't touch those they're poisonous they'll kill you and it's like okay well then you just you just have this idea what mushrooms come from the grocery store well it's like no they grow they come in the wild and you know that's that's like my thing with me is I teach my kids like meat doesn't come from the grocery store it's not it's not a styrofoam package that's not where it comes from it's an animal yeah and and yeah and it's just like you know mushrooms that grow in the wild and they're just they're crazy David it's like Michael micro Michael Raizel yeah it's Michael Reiser relationship with the animals with the the trees rather do you know story of the Amanita muscaria I know what they are I don't know the story the Amanita muscaria is the most fascinating one to me cuz that's the one that looks like looks like Santa Claus or the Mars red with white shirt yeah that is the subject of a book by a guy named John Marco Allegro who was one of the head scholars for deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls he deciphered the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years he was an ordained minister but he was also in his study of theology became agnostic and he sort of when he started realizing that there was all these different religions that had similar stories and he was you know found all these different connections and trying to like figure out what the origins of all these stories were well after studying the Dead Sea Scrolls for I think it was 14 years before he wrote this book he decided that all of Christianity was a massive misunderstanding and what it was originally about was these stories his collection of stories that were about fertility rituals and psychedelic mushroom use and he traced the word Jesus back to an ancient Sumerian word that was a mushroom covered in God's semen and that when God would come on the earth that's what rain was rain was God coming on the earth and that these mushrooms would rise up out of the ground they would eat them and trip their fucking balls off right it's a crazy story so he's got to think yeah people that were foraging for food especially back when there was no agriculture right I mean it was it was touch-and-go you could easily starve to death you mean you're a bad winter you know a drought people would starve to death it was very very common so they would take foraging extremely serious and they knew what they could eat and they knew what they couldn't eat but they knew that there was a relationship between carnivorous trees and coniferous trees would grow these weird-looking shiny red and white mushrooms under them that's what coniferous trees is pine trees that's what we use for Christmas trees you know those red and white packages they they are like the shiny packages underneath the Christmas tree they are the color of Santa Claus you know they're common in Siberia they are eaten constantly by caribou caribou are reindeer reindeer are addicted to these to the point where when people are having psychedelic mushroom rituals and they go outside to take a leak the caribou will knock them over to get to the Amanita muscaria piss in the sand because they smell the Amanita muscaria in the piss and one of the ways these guys trip their balls off is they eat the mushroom and then they drink their own urine that has a second process of this here's where it gets even crazier in the times in Siberia where it become extremely snowy when this the shaman would visit the way they would get into the house is through the fucking chimney because the door would be snowed in so they would climb in through the chimney I mean there's so many parallels to Santa Claus and to Christianity to this one mushroom that they think was a massive part of shamanistic rituals there it is right there this is this Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer such a cool story oh dude it's fucking crazy so he wrote this book called the sacred mushroom in the cross that was bought out by the Catholic Church this I have to verify but I do know that they stopped production of it I don't know if it was bought out by the Catholic Church that's always been what's been told to me but I do know that they stopped production of it forever he came out with another book called the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Christian myth which is still available then more recently like really recently within the last decade a guy named jaan Irvin republished the gianmarco Allegro books with permission from his family I think it might have actually been one of those things where when a book is over 25 years old it becomes like public domain or something like that too but this this book and this this story behind it is incredibly fascinating and what he's basically saying is that and it makes sense if you were living thousands of years ago and you stumbled upon these psychedelic mushrooms and you took them you would experience God you literally would think that that psychedelic state was you communicating with God they would want to hide those from the Romans so they hid them in parables and stories and he explains what the original meaning of all these parables and stories are because of course you're going from ancient Hebrew which is extremely complicated language that also involves numbers the letters are also numbers and then that's translated to Latin and to Greek and then eventually to English so a lot is lost in that translation so it really takes a linguist and a biblical scholar to kind of understand whether or not what this guy is saying is correct I'm obviously not one of those so I'm just talking shit but it's a there's so many parallels it's almost like how could it be just coincidental that Santa Claus is red and white at Santa Claus likes reindeers that the Christmas tree is something that we use and the presents are under the Christmas tree that Santa Claus lives in the fucking North Pole which is Siberia which is we're caribou live and which is where these mushrooms are very common I mean there's so many parallels it's really kind of fucking crazy and that's cool yeah it's a great book anybody I really highly recommend it because it's one of those books we just got a you read a few chapters you got to go I think I'm gonna have to go back over that again go over yeah so it's it's so freaky very cool but I've stumbled upon those in the wild those amedy I've never found though and there's like those there's like you have to cook them first you can't eat them raw you have to boil them yeah we made together we'll make you sick apparently I don't do it right but ya know I Forge more for morels of my favorite chanterelles obviously like awesome culinary mushroom what's that yellow one that grows on trees it's like a thick chicken of the woods yes that one's real and it tastes like chicken it is unbelievable that one's amazing it's really funky we found I was walking with the kids in a park downtown Toronto and I look over and there's this massive saw my Instagram massive yellow kind of looks like goo growing on this tree and it was a premature chicken of the woods and it just looked like this blob and then if I were to leave it it would start to kind of shelf out into like shelf common mushrooms and so I left it for like a week and went back and harvested it and it's like it's like tender juicy chicken flavor it is bizarre oh that's kind of cool so yeah you were just like hoping nobody else saw it yeah and it wasn't like a really public park I was like man like I better get this before someone else finds it well how many people would know in a public park in Toronto there's a few there's there a stuffy I've kind of walked up to ladies like picking herbs and stuff and I was like hey like what are you doing and they do kind of looked at me and kind of went away they didn't want to share their knowledge with me so that's this bizarre man that's hilarious oh that's so cool something's like a little tiny one you know on trees I don't know I think well that one you can see the bark is like deteriorating so again it's it's it's feeding off the decaying tree so if that if you actually go and I found ones like that too if you go and harvest those they're really woody by that time and they're kind of little too tough to it oh really so you want it you want to get them when they're kind of younger like that so is there a color change I guess I guess when they when they're older they get a bit more orange yeah from that kind of yellow premature stay see that one where there's like yellow yeah those are like perfect yeah right there perfect yeah oh wow that looks almost like cauliflower totally yeah it's really really neat Wow it's fascinating you know the the mushroom world is is super cool do you know they breathe air I did not know that they breathe air and they breathe out carbon dioxide yeah they're closer to animals and there are two vegetables that's really cool yeah they're weird fungus is a weird thing man yeah well a lot of it's like misunderstood well I guess I was I was watching the podcast with them with the mushroom guy yeah but like a lot of it is is is still being learned today of the impact on on the earth and when what they do did you hear a story about how would he take 10 grams of psilocybin mushrooms and climbed a tree and was in a lightning storm and like connected to the fucking universe first time ever doing hers ever doing it yeah he did that I think he was in high school right there's something somewhere around that very young yeah crazy he's awesome such a trip though well and I was reading that like the the filicide band is linked to your and curing depression and things like that which I don't know a lot about but it's fascinating the effects they have on on on people John Hopkins is doing some studies on them the most fascinating of all the mushroom theories is by the late great Terence Mckenna and his brother Dennis McKenna who's still alive and a scientist explained it on my first podcast with him so if anybody's interested find that and download it it's Dennis is a brilliant guy and this the theory is called the stoned ape theory and this coincides what we're talking about about with hunting and consumption of meat leading to us becoming humans there's a doubling of the human brain size over a period of two million years it's like apparently one of the biggest mysteries in the fossil record they do not understand why something so important like the thing that act they created the theory I mean that of evolution explained evolution like this very organ doubled over a period of two million years and don't know why Tarrance believes that the reason coincided with climate change and that as the climate changed these rain forests receded into grasslands and these lower hominids like our ancestors came down from the trees and started experimenting with new food sources and one of the things they experimented with was psychedelic mushrooms and that through psilocybin which they found by flipping over cow patties a couple things happened one it increased visual acuity mushrooms especially in low doses increase visual acuity which would make them better hunters they could see better made them more intuitive made them more creative and also the way Denis explains the effect of psilocybin on the brain he was saying that it could have possibly led to the development of language and that all of this could have come out of the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms it's fuckin intense man so the parents called it the stoned ape theory that's what he that's how he thinks we became human that's amazing yeah it sounds stupid sounds stupid until you do mushrooms yeah that makes sense then you go oh okay okay okay maybe yeah maybe yeah why is this illegal then you start going what everybody should do this oh my god everybody do this now when you first started cooking did you went how old were you when you became a chef well it's kind of a fluke funny story I was a 13 year old kid and I wanted a part-time job you know like a newspaper route or something like that and I went to I lived in a little town on this horse farm in the country and I rode my bike down to this gas station and I applied to pump gas and this guy had a diner on the corner and was like hey man like I don't need any would pump gas but can you cook and I grew up cooking at home with my mom because she would work late and she would call me on her way home and tell me how to start dinner so she'd be like turn on the oven get the chicken out of the fridge get the shake and bake and you know she would walk me through it and I'd start dinner and she'd get home and finish it so I totally yeah I can you know cook or whatever and I had had me in there you know like dropping the fry baskets and flipping eggs and you know doing the brunch shift on the weekend and it just stuck it's one of those things that you just kind of grow up doing I knew I wanted money to buy skateboards and pot and stupid shit and yeah I just it just kind of stuck and then all through high school I had a job cooking and I really I started to struggle with it because you know I was taking all these world issues courses and learning about the environment and watching these documentaries about food and I didn't know you know how being a chef could help change the world and how am I going to make a difference as a chef and then and then I had my daughter when I was 19 and I had all this experience cooking and I thought well you know I'm just gonna go to chef school and and make it go with this like I've got all this experience I'm already this far ahead and it was it was having kids at such a young age that really made me focus and it was like okay like I have a job to do and I fell in love with food I you know as a 17 year old kid with a vegetable garden like who does that you know and and then I got to hunting and foraging and learning about food and I just I totally just fell in love with it and so how did antler come about a bunch of these yeah so this photo I actually took this photo it's blown up in the restaurant all the green on the ground is wild leeks so in the spring and that actually took this turkey hunting and I looked over I was like whoa cool that's amazing and yes postcard this is actually a sketch my friend did of a of a deer skull that I shot so any antler came about because I worked for a celebrity chef he gave me his cookbook and I was hunting and foraging doing all the stuff and I thought well you know one of the ways I can make an impact in the world that I can teach people about what I'm doing and I went I got a I got a camera and I would take it with me and shoot photos like this and I wanted to teach people about hunting and foraging because what I was doing is not new it's really really old but you know people seem to have forgotten about it you know at least people in the cities anyway people don't really know much about it so I thought you know I'm gonna help educate you know modern civilization about hunting and foraging this will be like my I make a difference in the world and I ended up hanging out with a really good friend of mine where my best friends today and he's a family friend documentary filmmaker by the name of Jody Shapiro and you know we had this deal and he said you know I'll help you with the photos if you teach me how to cook and he was he was taking some culinary courses at the local college just as a hobby and you know we started hanging out and shooting this cookbook and we started to kind of get some press about it you know eater magazine did this article on us and we started doing these game dinners out of his house and I did hear this really nice condo and so I put on this game dinner i we sold tickets and I knew there were laws about serving game in restaurants so in Canada and I pretty sure the u.s. is pretty similar you can't serve wild game in a restaurant so there was Public Health excuse me all meat has to be inspected through a slaughterhouse Europe is different you could kind of do whatever in Europe but so I thought okay cool we'll have this game dinner out of his house and we're in the clear but with the with the Ministry of Natural Resources you can't sell game meat so for any kind of profit but we weren't profiting off it we're just going to have them fun and we do this game dinner a local paper a national paper actually wanted to buy a ticket they came we thought they're gonna write this little blurb about it they did a two-page spread in the national newspaper about this game dinner so we started to get all this press about it and we just said hey let's let's open a restaurant let's let's have a home where we can we can you know work on this book possibly shoot some documentary and really just have fun and explore Canadian cuisine it's something that I'm really passionate about something that really you know hasn't really been defined there's a bunch of people trying to define it you know and and and it was just sort of our home now when you say Canadian cuisine are these traditional recipes or they improvise well I you know a lot of it is is improvised a lot of it's my take on it you know I definitely want to do some more kind of studying about native and indigenous cooking you know traveling across the country is something I want to do and learning from the indigenous communities but sort of my take on it is you know if there if there wasn't these farmed animals what would be what would we eat and and for me it's it's morels it's maple syrup it's the wild leeks in this photo it's deer and turkey and rabbit and these things we all we serve at antler because that's what's growing around us in Canada wild fish and thanks again for the maple syrup I'm gonna have to break my diet to enjoy some of this liquid is looking richest looking old ever seen looks amazing so I'll tell you earlier that takes 18 liters of SAP boiled down to make one liter of syrup and the cool part is you can drink the SAP it's natural it's full of a natural electrolytes and minerals so it's kind of like a coconut water type of beverage what's crazy to me is how someone figured out to do that like and they've been doing it for hundreds years right yeah super cool and it happens only you can only make it in the spring when it's freezing at night and it thaws during the day and what happens is the the tree roots are sucking up as much water as it can to feed the buds that it's trying to to make to make leaves again how the fuck didn't anybody figure that out yeah sap from the trees like that it's so simple it's really really cool when you when you go you know you drill a hole in the tree you put in this little tap and hang a bucket and it just drips out and Wow yeah and how long does it take to drip when it's when it's like kind of perfect conditions I put up these 16 litre buckets and within like three or four days they're full oh wow so it's cool it's fun and it gets me out in the woods I call my spring training because I'm lugging around all these buckets you know okay my winter fat off so when you were talking about indigenous people how they would cook their food have you learned any of those dishes yet I have like I said I'm not an expert but it's something I'm we're gonna be kind of studying moving forward our you know the growth of antler you know where do we go from here and you know as I mentioned my business partner is a documentary guy so we want to travel and travel across country and learn really what that is in there's so many different indigenous communities in Canada like Canada's on three coasts you know much like the states with Alaska you know you normally think of the Arctic up there but you know there's three oceans you have an ocean of time that ocean so but yeah it's it's something that I definitely want to learn more about hmm like how would they cook moose do you know a lot of it would be open fire and a lot of its raw you know like the the seal meat and whale blubber you know they don't like in the Arctic they don't have a lot of wood to burn you know and they would have like oil lamps from the oil from the blubber but you know a lot of the cooking is is raw yeah Steve Rinella went to Nunavut is that it knew that yeah yeah like I said even the back on the North there's the Northwest Territories and there's new food and they were eating a lot of fish frozen fish that was dipped in seal oil crazy to dip the fish and seal oil eat it tremendous amount of oil and fat in their diet yep you know which kind of makes you know diet yeah I mean they're they're up there in the coldest of cold climates one of the things we do that's kind of cool is uh I know the native the indigenous cultures would make sea dirty and it's it's full of vitamin C and minerals and nutrients but we do a cedar sorbet so we boil cedar leaves and then I just add sugar and make it into like an ice so it's a frozen kind of sorbet Wow which is really cool and it's it's like when you eat it it's like the forest in your mouth it's real and then you get the cedar from we did we just go into the woods and cut it down we bring that into the restaurant there's all kinds of cool stuff that we do that we you know cuz I go up I try and be in nature a couple times a week then I'll go and you know forage for all this stuff and bring it into antler another way we use the cedar is in a cocktail we do a cedar gin sour so we infuse UVU's the gin with with cedar leaves for like a week and then we shake that with some simple syrup yeah make me hungry yeah so when you want it's interesting that when you go to the woods to forage for plant life it's totally legal yeah you could sell it yeah but if you forage for animal life you can't do that I think that is because of market hunting that really decimated most of the population of North American game animals in the 1800s and early into the 1900s like most people associate that with the death of the Buffalo yeah the it makes sense and I think I think if there there are ways to do it where it could be controlled I don't think I could hunt enough meat for the for the restaurant yeah but 25 seats 45 seats but you know what do you think I do think that you know I think as people's right to be able to eat well meat I think that as a human being you have the right to try that and if you're not a hunter if you don't know how to go do it you have the right to least try it and I do know in actually Newfoundland they're allowed to serve well game and the hunter has to go and get a permit to sell and then he has to bring it to a butcher that has a permit to process it and expect it and then that butcher can then sell it to a restaurant oh well that makes sense yeah and it's it's controlled and like I don't want to decimate the population I don't want to hurt anything is that the way to say it though Newfoundland Newfoundland yeah I think it's definitely call it Newfoundland it's like a calling Chicago Chicago good fake Canadian I have an aunt from there yeah I don't want market hunting of wild game you know it's because I love wild animals again yeah well I just think it's very complex that's what I think I think just staying a lot being a human is very complex and I think we have very simplistic ways of looking at it yeah I also think that it's entirely possible that plants are communicating with each other and they have a level of intelligence that we don't totally understand it's not supported by data yeah it's supported by more and more research every day there they're finding out that plants have some interconnected network of communication with each other and that they recognize when they're being eaten and they changed their flavor profile to make themselves taste terrible to animals that are eating them there's some communication between them and there are some sort of a primitive life-form that many are you are far more complex than things that vegans won't eat like mollusks like mollusks although we think of them as animals they're the simplest dumbest fucking things on earth vices did an article that questioning whether mollusks were vegan I think for health purposes people that are vegans like hey man they're they're sustainable I mean you could farm them you could have any given property - I've watched something that they were using mussels to clean up ocean beaches yeah filtered water and fast and mushrooms - apparently are very cleansing there they're trying to find ways to use mushrooms to clean kind of oil spills and you know yes screwed up environmental things people should eat mollusks they really should and they should also eat eggs eat eggs folks just eat them from ethical animals and I'm just saying this just as a person who values health yeah and a person who's I mean I I put my body through a lot my body has to it has to perform and it has my whole life so I'm very very concerned with nutrition and I'm very aware of the impact nutrition has on physical performance and I think eggs are gigantic they're so goddamn good for your health and this idea that somehow another you're doing something cruel my chickens are my friends you see it from that video that's improvement in the pudding they're not scared of me at all run around with they're running around with me and I eat their eggs and those eggs are good for and I know everybody can't do that but you can get these now it's eggs and you vote with your dollars that you're spending you know if you go to the store and you buy organic eggs and you buy the healthier version yes you're paying extra buck or two bucks whatever it is but crack open an egg from like the mass-produced place and you crack open an egg from the organic place one is like the organic ones are like bright orange and like super dark and even the yolk is like really thick and then the other one it's like pale and runny like yellow and you crack them and the yolks break sometimes and they're just like it's garbage and who knows what's in them and what conditions those chickens are living in a lot of times terrible conditions I think whoever started I mean I guess it's just economics right and you give people the option to make the most amount of money and not have to account for ethics or cruelty standards or whatever you know whatever issues were in place that allowed factory farms to materialize that's one of the worst worst pieces of evidence about the cruelty of human beings yeah it's one of the worst it's horrific I mean and it's it's something that I think we should really collectively do something about and absolutely it's one of the things that really ramps up the the anger on the the side of the animal rights activist and the side of the vegans I get it I get it but to go after someone like you is in my opinion so incredibly misguided yeah and it's why I asked you to come on because I thought it was so frustrating and watching you carve that venison up in front of those people what were they screaming at you murderer that's not true yeah it's like saying you know it's just it's like saying you're a thief because you cut grass kids no it's not it's not murder it's it's killing animals leave it even the video someone's walking by and they're like they're saying they're murderers and she's like they're murdering people like no other murdering animals they kind of laugh well how those people are sad like a lot of like what you're dealing with with these animal rights activists that they're they're so engrossed in this struggle and it's the part of their their daily existence and they're they're angry and sad there's one crazy video where this lady goes into this restaurant and she starts yelling in front of everybody about her friend and there's this beautiful creature that just wants to live and it's a chicken she's talking about chicken and like my friend the chicken was killed and it's like what whoa and everybody in the restaurant is like what the fuck I've seen these videos and like they'll storm a restaurants they'll be like fifty people they go and like occupy steak house there's this crazy lady Oh God for her entire life terrified she has a very determined look in her eyes wherever she goes and she was hurt and abused her entire life because of this establishment and because of establishments like it she was locked away she was hidden she had nobody there for her she was crying she was scared every single moment the maitre d someone's gonna murder her I can see you smiling at least I think at least I'm not busy yeah that's true jeez where's the chicken party crazy town disrupt speciesism it's unfair to those mice she's a mouse murderer it's not food now here they sing it together look at they all get together with science in regard leave this ok you should see the way your cunt little bird snow fucks up a worm you crazy bitch fucks up mice throw a mouse in the cage no snow only grain fuck you that guy's funny this guy's amazing so yeah there's like you know I get that there's there's protesting and it's like it's it's our fundamental right to protest and have freedom speech and have these things but that's not protesting that's disrupting a business yeah there's not it's not the place for it that's harassment look if you the best place for something like that is really what we just saw a video make make a video about your thoughts yeah you know if you I mean if you if they honestly think that what you're doing is wrong like this is what something like YouTube is for make a video where you state your case I'll come and talk to me and alright they'd even come and talk to me my restaurant was science but at least with the video you leave the comments open and then people debate they decide whether or not they agree or disagree or you fucking crazy asshole let that snow loose watch what she does watch what she does to every fucking bug she finds she's a murderer she's not she's not a vegetarian you fucking chickens not a vegetarian you know it's just not you know people like vegetarian fed well then you got a sick chicken because that's not what they're supposed to eat yeah same like cats cats need meat you can't eat a cat a vegan diet well you can't one of my bits I have a bit about it really because something that I found online when someone's angry at me when someone was angry at me I went to her page and one of the things that hashtag vegan cat and went oh Jesus that was illegal it should rights people will come and should danger can we'll talk about that later I don't want to do my bit I'm doing a comedy special soon but the the the problem with this is that as we said before it becomes like a contest mmm it becomes like like a battleground yeah that's my concerns like how does this end yeah how do we bridge the gap how do we get people like how do they stop fucking with you I have no idea that well they're their thing is they want us to put a sign in our that's just plain that that you know we're mistreating animals and animal lives were there right and they say you know this extortion if we put this sign in our window there go away well we're not doing anything wrong you know nothing we're doing is illegal we're not infringing on anyone's rights have you talked to them out at all have you gone outside so no we had one of our managers go outside and there they just screamed at her they wasn't the time I think just murderer what about snow so you know we we did send an email trying to we invited in to go foraging with us and we talked about our different ideal ideologies and how you know they're they're really far apart but maybe we can come to some kind of understanding and and you know at the time they didn't respond didn't respond for a while and you know now I don't I don't think you know I don't think that anything good would come of that meeting at this point so so what do you do how's business by the way business has always been good for us we were very lucky well it sounds like you have a great restaurant I mean I'm sure thank you part of it thank you but we've we've had some international recognition we've I've done a lot of traveling last year I've been five continents in the last year two of them cooking I went to Abu Dhabi with there's a company called IMG if you know them they own the UFC now mm-hm they run that they have a culinary department and they run these festivals called taste and our first year opening we we were part of this taste festival and I didn't even know there was a competition going on these people came by and they're like yeah we're judging this competition and we want to try your food and I was like these people are trying to get some free food out of me they're like you can win a trip to Abu Dhabi you know I was like okay whatever and we actually won and they sent me to Abu Dhabi to to compete against 11 other chefs from around the world it was amazing it was incredible and then from there I think six six or eight months later there was a festival in Australia so they brought me to Australia to to cook in Western Australia this event called the gourmet escape really really cool event and it was down the road from a deer farm and we were putting on a lunch and dinner for 200 people so we actually roasted to hold dear asado style over open fire and where'd you do that in the woods it was incredible those photos on our - grammar in the antler kitchen bar dot or at angler kitchen bar on Instagram there's photos of this this asado it was super super super Sato asado is I think it's the Argentinean cooking style and it's it's a whole animal that's kind of split down the middle and kind of like flavor Wow it's really cool so pig is probably the best one to do it with because of the fat content deer and lamb and something that you kind of have to baste it to keep it moist how do you regulate temperature when it comes to something like this just place it stacking up the wood and kind of how far it's leaning on how do you know how to do it I just practice just playing around I'm fun it just low and slow before many times yeah yes we do at the restaurant I do it in my backyard a lot I actually did for my wedding we did two pigs for my wedding do and like poke in the fire in my suit that's so graphic it's great yeah that got a lot of hate they don't want to hate on that but its food you know and like people want to just connect themselves from where it's coming from but anyway back to your question you know business always been good and business is business those good days and bad days you know right now there's a lot of attention on and there a lot of media of attention on antler so we're you know we're a little bit busier than normal right now it's gonna be nuts down there there's gonna be a bunch of people on your side too yeah and hopefully nothing bad happens like people don't get into anything physical or nothing starts shouting at each other yeah but the shouting stuff was happening but but yeah hopefully you know this this will kind of all smooth out and people can learn to get it to get along and live together yeah well it doesn't seem like that's what they want though it seems like what they want is for you to bend to their demands I mean that's like what a lot of this is when it comes to change you know when it comes to people wanting change they want you to change yeah they and they want their right and they want you to admit you're wrong and this is this is a real problem with something that's complex yeah and the funny thing was like we've had vegan and vegetarian items on our menu since 2015 when we opened and so I think it was like the second or third week they came we thought okay we're gonna we're gonna feature one of our vegan dishes on the sign and hopefully like that makes them happy and so we feature one of our vegan dishes on the sign and then we saw from their online post that they thought that we made that their posts where we made them change a meat dish to a vegan dish we have to keep pushing them and it was so frustrating like no you guys don't know who we are well that's exactly what I'm talking about it becomes a contest or a battleground an ideological battleground yeah did this this thought that they're making you change they want you to change you know I mean I've seen I saw a video once where people were mad at me too and they were like he's listening so he's open to change and I was like no like I'm listening because I want to hear your perspective like you're not right like and I'm not right it's like we have our own perspectives yeah and I'm not gonna change if I change it's because of the evidence and because of thinking and careful consideration and I've done that I've done a lot of thinking I've done a lot of care for careful consideration and that's what led me to becoming a hunter in the first place yeah what yeah how did you start hunting Steve Rinella took yeah I've been thinking about it for a long time and the main reason I've been thinking about it was because of those PETA videos right those fucking horrific factory farming videos I was like yeah I don't want to eat that I don't want to be a part of this I want to figure out how to not so I started buying grass-fed meat and I tried to you know figure out a way to get around it and I really started getting very very interested in hunting mm-hmm but I didn't know how to start I didn't know where to start and we were filming a Fear Factor episode at Tejon Ranch says 270,000 acre ranch the middle of the country Wow middle the state rather and they were saying that they have wild pigs there and they would teach you how sorry that was something that I had considered before I met Rinella yeah and when I met Rinella he took me on a hunt for his TV show and I shot a mule deer and we ate it that night over the fire and I said that's it it's amazing - yeah I'm like that's it the quote the cool part about hunting is nothing goes to waste so I take I take the hides to a guy to have them tanned so I've actually made a knife roll out of one of the hides I have an apron out of one of the hides my wedding ring has antler in it yeah that's pretty cool I'm proud of that that's crazy and yeah and I use all the bones to make a stock and then when I you know a lot of the cuts and one of the reasons and I want to write this book is to teach hunters how to use those tough cuts one of my favorite parts of the deer and different animals is the neck and the neck has got all this really super flavorful kind of gelatinous meat kind of in-between the cartilage and stuff like that and you make a stew with that stuff and it is unbelievably tasty mmm and you know I think and a lot of guys when they go hunting they kind of breast out the birds and they leave the little legs and they don't really know that you know how to cook the legs of a turkey or a duck and so that's one of the reasons why I want to write this book and really educate people how to use those tougher cuts that you know can be kind of tricky to cook when nella has a couple of good books on that and one of the things that he's really into is making shanks and yes buco so good braising so good yeah yeah and he's also you know a big advocate of not wasting anything that's why he's into organ meat love liver and we the fire that night oh so good I had turkey feathers in my little boutonniere on my wedding day from it was really cool well it's one of the reasons why it's so kind of crazy that you're the guy that they picked on and not to butcher shop across the street or not you know some burger joint down the street that's getting factory farmed meat isn't you do have a respect and appreciation for the wildlife but that this ideological battle battle ground on their side it doesn't leave any room for for giving in there's no room for reason it's just you're either an animal murderer or you're that the the most amazing person ever because you're vegan go vegan you know it's it's it's a really it's a new thing in terms of first world problems at first world countries I mean people been eating vegetarian dishes forever but in terms of like being ideologically rabid about your you know your position this is this is very new it's within the last couple of decades yeah it's it's unfortunate because we're getting you know we've had a lot of support from our community and Canada and the international community and we're actually getting support from other vegans and vegetarians people writing to us and say hey yeah the same like hey these aren't our beliefs we're really sorry what you're going through you know you have our support and it's some of our customers are actually vegan and they come for our like vegetarian risotto and like mushroom risotto that they know are like you know really cool wild
