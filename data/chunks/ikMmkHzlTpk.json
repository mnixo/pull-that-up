ready boom and we're live hello Lex hey what's going on the sequel part 2 you have a very similar if not the exact same suit on this is all I wear you look very professional yeah very Reservoir Dogs Reservoir Dogs well let's go to the best sequel of all time Godfather Part 2 that's the best to go of all time I think John wick might be quick how dare you sir Godfather Part 2 I mean that's that has to be the best sequel ok then and if this is godfather part 2 let's definitely not do part 3 yeah part 3 was terrible right well let's let's not offend anyone but it was good yeah yeah I don't remember it it was the older Pacino oh that was like way later right those 90s oh okay so it's like Point Break the remakes yes right look when they try to redo things like way way way later they almost never accept the Alien franchise they've done a pretty fucking good job with the alien threat they had a couple of duds yeah in there but for the most part I've actually never seen the Alien franchise what who are you well you aren't you in a science intelligent man can disagree but United in the science I don't know I prefer to prefer Al Pacino I would say that the older sent a woman Al Pacino you know that merely yeah what that's one and yeah you got the Oscar for that one what about the one when he played the devil and the devil for friend okay there's this to those duds for everybody that's not one that was advocate uh-huh there you go that was with canneries ah Keanu Reeves from John wick I heard John Waite par threes Rory the matrix the better movie not true did you see this that happened this High School in North Bergen Jersey put on the alien play a couple weeks ago Sigourney Weaver showed up right oh she showed up I could cut just the other day to like say thanks or whatever tell them they did it awesome but oh it looked like crazy and I was just wondering if they did this when you're in high school do you think you might have joined drama like if they did the alien play I want to loved it a little watched it I'm not getting the drama those people cry too much there's too much work it's cool suit though yeah okay let's talk about this is two kinds of movies there's fun movies and there's movies that are like transformational for society get sent to a woman what okay listen you can I say Scent of a Woman is transformational for some that's one of the greatest scenes between a man and a woman on film the tango scene are you not married no I'm not married yeah it's like someone talking about French you can't speak French I see yeah it's nonsense that movie sucked I read about friendship incentive a woman your favorite movie no it's not my favorite I don't think that movie sucked either by the way if you get mad right now I don't barely remember it but it is it is up there I'm sure it's a good movie that's one of the greatest performances all right we're off to a good start yeah yeah I bet you there's thousands of people agree with me right now yeah there's millions that don't I'm not called haters everyone who disagrees is always a derp okay so what's your favorite love scene in a movie not like like between us you need to get married bro okay you're into love movies and shit no I'm not by yourself a gal there's no doubt we're not talking about romantic comedies Adam Sandler here uh rom-coms we're talking about serious like dramatic moments right okay so Godfather good movie yeah great movement does it have to have two guys like shooting each other or not okay so you're seeing Santa woman yeah I'm sure I saw it yeah what I barely remember it all right well there's I could watch it today it'll be like a new movie to me okay there's this broken man I spoiler alert considering suicide right it's deep so he is tortured by you know by his involvement in the war by being responsible with all this kind of stuff he's now mentoring a younger version of himself who has more character more integrity and throughout all of this he meets this beautiful young woman he's blind for the dance and there's this beautiful moment where they can hmm I mean okay listen Phil what what's the purpose of film all right entertainment or make us think I mean make us think hmm you know you're gonna think if you want to think nothing makes you think a film can engage you you can it can resonate with you or not I have a movie that I throw by people whenever I want to find out whether or not I want to listen to anything they have to say about movies it's not gonna The Big Lebowski yeah yeah that's one of the greatest news oh look at you okay that could be Leia that could be like slightly better than sent a woman oh boy that also is one of the greatest scenes between a man and a woman when he is uh when the fine young lady's painting her toenails right and and she's offered him sex money yeah that would that's that's a beautiful moment - he's a beautiful yeah really that girl that used to be a hot mess what's her name Tara Reid yeah she's still a hot mess if she get her shit together she's been like struck the sharknado series is uh she's in there yeah yeah so I passed the big lebowski test and you failed the sense of woman test well I don't remember it I gotta wrap this cars really don't remember it okay I mean I'm sure it's great I'm sure it's great if yeah you're a wise man if you like it I'm sure it's good and you also recognize that Godfather three it kind of sucks yeah yeah but I like the old Pacino reminisce listen Godfather is about your people the Italian people have dominated the the mob the brilliant mob movies right mm-hmm I mean Godfather's about family right there's something deeply like genuine about that that like in our modern society we really crave for just like bigger than the individual bigger than the rules of society the government the man its family above all right that that's a good I don't know that's timeless yes that I groove that the the moment with the young Pacino when he talks to what his brother Fredo hmm says don't ever take sides against the family again ever yeah that's one of the greatest moments that's great mom alright alright alright I'm romanticizing movies here but just like John wick though huh never seen it Wow never seen it it's good excuse me it's good movie to watch on the treadmill is uh is he playing a Russian mobster in that um no kills a bunch of them though and he speaks Russian and he works for the Russians kills people for the Russians canneries is one of the greatest human beings ever you think so yeah he's like the nicest guy yeah I heard he's a really nice guy but he plays a badass gangster what am I gonna be a little bit more fit work out a little bit more I see without a shirt on like hmm not quite buying it okay average man yeah but the average man is not the fucking best assassin of all time with all this martial arts skill waiter yeah but fatal words big phaidor might have like a gut but he's a thick motherfucker okay young phaidor ever see young fade are when he was in his prime like back when he fought like Fujita like back when he there's a picture of phaidor standing around with a bunch of kettlebells you ever see that picture nope around say Dornan's lifting days I suspect and this is coming from then that's that's one when fader was fairly young up there but that's uh that's not the one I'm talking about you know that one with the kettlebells is that picture up see beef on that picture never a six-pack in sight no no six-pack but I suspect that Fedor might have been on some performance-enhancing substances during his prime you mean like hard training lots of drilling technique so so how dare you sir dude he's in pride everybody was on steroids man yeah that's him look at him that's him in his prime that's a big motherfucker now I do not know if he was on anything but everybody else was I mean literally everybody they they had it in their contract that you we will not test for steroids you know ensign anyway he told me that they like essentially encouraged people to take steroids yeah the pride days that's right yeah and it's not Russians don't have a long history of using performance-enhancing substances I'm sure you saw that movie hey Chris you see it yep fascinating right it's it's it's fascinating it I mean I don't steroids often feel to me like a bit of a witch-hunt often times you assume people are on steroids I'm a bit of maybe I'm naive or an optimist but I tend to give people the benefit the dow until proven otherwise but it Chris obviously proves yeah throws a monkey wrench of those gears but you know with with fate all right the technique on that the technique to execution the timing the brilliance of elements no doubt no hurt no he's phenomenal yeah I just wanna if not the greatest heavyweight of all time he's certainly one of them and I don't think steroids would help that yes they do to help yeah they have that guy in particularly yeah they help everything they help your training they helped your biddie ability to recover they help your explosive power they help your speed they help everything the but they they also it's not just steroids like a lot of them on EPO EPO radically enhances your endurance and they're starting to catch people need they just stripped TJ Dillashaw UFC bantamweight champion for starett for EPO or other it's tragic yes it is tragic especially TJ he's a just phenomenal fighter if not I mean certainly top 10 pound for pound and then this is one of those things it comes up and you go oh man it's a legacy killer in this world about to kind of reconsider what kind of what should be allowed or not yeah I agree with that that there is an idea of what you should make steroids legal right all right not legal sorry a lot or some kind of supplementation like where's the line when you when you start to talk about the future of martial arts the future sport if you can control the levels so that they're healthy I mean isn't that the reason that they're not allowed is because if abused they become unhealthy they long term well-being of the person there's look if that was the case we wouldn't allow fighting because fighting is more damage steroids for sure for sure getting punched and kicked and fucking kneed in the face and elbowed into unconsciousness that is way worse for you than steroids the route the concern is not for the athlete the concerns for the opponent the idea is that you will be able to inflict punishment that you would not ordinarily be able to inflict you will have more endurance you will have more power you will hurt someone potentially even look there's going to be a time where someone dies and it mixed martial arts of that and if that's someone who was the the victor who did not die was on steroids it is going to be a huge national tragedy and a massive disaster for the sport for everything if that ever it does happen we can only hope at depth it never does but for sure you know it's a it's a very very dangerous game you're playing and when you are martial arts a very dangerous game and when you are enhancing your body with chemicals that are illegal while you're doing that game the real question is though here's my take on it and this is it's one of the most human subjects and that being meaning that it's messy humans are messy like there's good and there's bad you know look like abortion is a messy subject it's messy you know whether you have the whether you agree with someone's right to have it or not it is what you're doing is especially as the fetus gets older it's messy you know when it's a complicated discussion it's not a clear it's not like you should drink water you know I mean it's like it's a very complicated discussion steroids are a very complicated discussion you're not allowed to do them but they exist for a reason the reason why they exist is they're really effective they're really effective at enhancing your body but how much of that will we allow we allow creatine we allow supplements in terms of you know there's there's certain things that can slightly elevate your testosterone slightly elevate your growth hormone we allow sauna and ice baths and all these things that have shown to enhance recovery but that's that's too much it's too good they're too effective but it's weird it's weird that this thing that we found that makes you better you can't use yeah and so I have to go back a little bit and disagree with you on something so in terms of fighting being dangerous and that's if we want it to fit things that are dangerous for you would forbid fighting I think the main thing you're doing can be dangerous I mean the main thing that we're talking about the sport the the combat event that can be dangerous because that is what we watch to people at the height of their skill ability heart passion putting their life at risk that can be dangerous but the supplementation around it the way to make it to make their training better more effective that can't be dangerous and I thought that can't be named can yet to be dangerous so I thought steroids were considered what sort of band because abuses lead to long-term damage to health now we see steroids is cheating mm-hmm but it was banned initially because it has detrimental effects I don't think that's true it's not no because there's no real evidence that it's detrimental it's not as detrimental as alcohol when you allow people to drink but even a bit even when abused where the body's like there's there's not a lot but like there's a great documentary on it called bigger stronger faster and it's by my friend Chris Bell and when you watch that documentary and you realize like oh well the real negative consequences of taking steroids or that it shuts down your endocrine system so it stops your body's natural production of testosterone and growth hormone and hormones that's the real problem and for young people that can be very devastating and it can lead to depression and suicidal thoughts and all sorts of really bad things when your testosterone shuts down but as far as like death boy I mean there's people are prescribed pain pills every day of the week and fighters that are on injuries that have been you know that have gotten surgery they were they're prescribed pain pills every day of the week and those pain pills kill people left and right that's just a fact people die of those things all the time much more so than die of stare so I'm not advocating for the use of steroids I'm just I'm being pretty objective and neutral about this but I'm just looking at it like it is a it's a very messy subject yeah it's very eloquently put but so so your problem in terms of damaging the opponent is if one side takes there wasn't exactly what happens if both the problem is you would require someone do that maybe someones a holistic person they don't want to introduce any unnatural exogenous steroids into their body and hormones into their body they want they want everything to be produced by the human body they want to they want to eat healthy food train hard sleep well and compete naturally yeah that's Ct Fletcher here yesterday yes is natural bodybuilding yes or not bodybuilder powerlifter yeah yeah but that's not required right this is you're not requiring people you're giving them the choice so you know it's an interesting possibility we're in moderation you'll be able to allow steroids in future of athletics because with an argument that if done in moderation you can actually create healthier athletes yeah that's I mean that's a real argument for the Tour de France the Tour de France they say that you actually are better off and healthier taking steroids yeah and EPO then you are doing it without it because it's so unbelievable ruling on the body yeah I mean those athletes are basically some of the best people in the world at suffering yeah long-term suffering it's incredible yeah ultra marathon runners all guys it's a different sort of thing you know and you know the thing about ultra marathon runners didn't even test them because they're like good luck those people have iron wills like like Kourtney de Walters woman who you know she is ya know she's been in here she's candy just drinks beer eats candy and peanuts doesn't make sense yeah I mean she just got a fucking iron will her will is indomitable and you could take all the steroids you want when you're running for three days that chick is gonna beat you it doesn't know how to quit yeah just has no quitter did you see the podcast with her we actually talked about how she fell she couldn't see she was in saying I think it was in her ocular hemorrhaging so her eyeballs were bleeding internally something like that where it was impeding her vision she couldn't see I would stop I would stop running no she fell because she couldn't see busted her head open bleeding all down her face keeps running barely barely can see her feet that she's running keeps running I'm glad those people are out there they don't let you know like that like I don't know how to quit really yeah I'm like I do a lot of stuff like that like stupid like I ran yesterday I couldn't sleep I ran in here yesterday 13 miles I'm not a runner just just this weird obsession you don't run no I run but I'm not a runner I got my why I'm I have a similar body like yours we're not exactly we do like better built for short sprinting and then maybe killing somebody with our hands versus a long distance well you're a black belt in jujitsu right yeah yeah where do you train at now train at Broadway jujitsu in Boston nice and that's and before I was in in Philly balance Studios a film agrees and so on right but Cobb acneic actually trains in Broadway oh really love that car yeah he had last time I was on actually want to talk about this a bead fight cuz I'm I'm Russian so I loved the Russian way yeah but I also love the I mean Kyle to me represents like the American he's like the Rocky if you if you remember that fight with against the third round he was winning I mean that's the know the best of what martial arts is MMA is to me is like you have two technicians they just throw everything away like screw this yeah I was just gonna throw down well as it beat had broken his hand broke his hand somewhere I think in the second round so he was pretty compromised going into that third round couldn't really fire back and Kyle's just has zero quit in them there's an animal yeah I mean that's the most beautiful you talk about like technical fights in the ground or technical striking like when like two technicians throw everything away this I'm sorry but that's what is the I love the most about any kind of fighting any kind of sport I enjoyed in the MoMA I discourage it heavily I don't think it's a smart way to fight yeah well then I get it that's probably your job well it's not just my job it's like what I like like I get I get the impulse but I don't want people to give in to that impulse I think fighting is something that you should do correctly you should do you should do there's there's principles that you should follow to fight correctly it doesn't mean that you shouldn't take chances but you know there's moments like Ricardo Lamas when he fought max Holloway and they just stood in the center of the ring for the last few seconds of the fight and max Holloway pointed down at the ground he's like come on right here right here and they just started swinging hey make it was amazing well it happened but if I was in Max's corner I don't know don't do that man this macho shit is gonna give you fucking brain damage you're gonna get hit with shots you wouldn't get hit with that's a difficult you like you said human nature is messy I would say that is the greatest that is the greatest moment of their lives at that war no listen or this is the greatest moment of max Holloway's life max always the greatest sentiment all-time discussion no but max Holloway is the greatest featherweight of all time is a guy who destroyed Jose Aldo twice he's a guy that he's he's beaten everybody in front of him that feather with the idea that this one moment where they decided to throw out all his skill and technique and just swing for the bleachers in the middle of the Octagon it was a fun moment it was great to watch but the idea that that was the greatest moments life is for a crazy person yeah there's moments in sports they're just magic Olympics bring that when like the thing that you don't think should happen or can't possibly happen or is not wise would people just throw everything away you know you like that yeah you're a passion person yeah action person yeah for sure that's an interesting thing for someone who studies artificial intelligence I mean if anybody listen this podcast book what the fuck does this guy do dogs they talk about movies nice vehicle we are we have plenty of time sir we have plenty of time but that's the beautiful thing about this podcast we're just talking so tell me what you got here with your notes man I mean you are fucking prepared I mean you have a lot of shit here yeah many many pages for sure I don't miss I don't miss stuff I mean there's a there's been a lot of exciting stuff on the autonomous vehicle space since you came on I got a Tesla and I've experienced what that thing is like when I put it on autopilot and it's stunning it's crazy I mean this is the performance of the V's amazing well in terms of its ability to change lanes and its ability to drive without you doing anything I just put my hand on the wheel and hold it there and it does all the work so because like one or two people listen to this podcast I want to take this opportunity and tell people if you drive a Tesla whether you listen to this now or a year from now or two years from now Tesla or any other car keep your damn eyes on the road so whatever you think the system is able to do you will have to still monitor the road and you just still have to take over when it fails if when really so we're throwing with this is like the moment we're throwing down right now I think it's know this is your level of expertise obviously no I think it's really important to in this transitionary phase whatever the car company whatever the system that we don't over trust the system we don't become complacent we don't think he can do more than he can the currently 40,000 people die in the United States from from fatal crashes the number one reason for that is distraction so texting smart phones how much has it gone up since smart phones people don't exactly they're trying to understand that there's a lot of studies showing that it's significant increases but it's hard to say it's because of smart phones but it's almost an obvious yeah it's pretty obvious the the flipside is even though everybody's now using a smart phone texting so on they've become better at you the smartphone so they're better at texting and driving no the better balancing that now this is a horrible thing to do so if you listen to this podcast you should listen to it in your car and keep your eyes on the road and not text I think worst was Pokemon when Pokemon was in its prime I was watching a guy on the highway playing Pokemon as he was driving and I know more than one person two people a guy and I saw a girl do it once - holding the phone on the steering wheel playing Pokemon yeah yeah it's incredible what are you doing Jamie it's grandpa I'm confused what is this this grandpa in Japan he drives around on a bike oh this guy is 15 phones this guy needs to find hookers there's people that do this also in their car with maybe four or five doing exactly what you're saying this man needs a better hobby this is preposterous look at look at his father he can't see what the fuck's going on in front of him he spends about $300 a month to buy virtual currencies in the game wow that guy's bored or in an innovative genius in the perspective one night people misused their innovative how is he innovative he's just playing a stupid game while he's driving around his bike like an asshole well he's back to the set of a woman thing it's passion it's the most amazing moment of his life that's right I'm sure most people are on my side sensible woman do you think most people are in your side they think sign of a woman's greatest asset to a woman but I was defending Godfather sent to a woman you were defending Godfather against me I mean I'm gonna throw you under the fan okay I'm gonna manipulate this conversation Jamie can you edit this in post did you see the video that just came out yesterday of a Tesla on autopilot avoiding a crash all right so yeah I have and there's a lot of exams quite a few those of course it's like hard to prove exactly what happened and where the auto powers involved just like on the flip side it's hard to prove that a pilot was involved in the dangerous stuff but I think by any measure the media is really negative in terms of their reporting on Tesla there I think I think you've talked to this about before in general and negativity gets more clicks right right and I think Tesla negative stuff on Tesla gets a lot of clicks so and well not Tesla let me speak more broadly about autonomous vehicles if there's any fatality any crash its over-represented it's over more wrong yeah so I need to me people who are interested in AI helping save lives in these systems like autopilot I feel you carry the responsibility of being at least as good of a driver you are when it's under manual control so don't text and drive keep your eyes on the road yeah if I say anything over and over in this podcast is that yes I'm driving of course is the other one and so don't drink and drive but the number one thing is distracted driving yeah put your phone down I agree um listen to some music some classic rock classic really into yeah yeah click Creedence put into no like I know no like it like you've changed the channel now you're gonna put me in this scent to look for that Sun comes excited there you go I take take my shirt off no that's a plan Lynyrd Skynyrd course Hendrix Cornell jerks I have to admit something I thought about messaging a couple times I wanted to I play guitar do you yeah good you can't are you good at jujitsu yeah I'm good okay come on black belt I'm pretty good you're a black belt too I'm sure you good yeah I'm not world class and I'm always fucking me up I'm a three-strike purple belt guitar ah that's a good way of putting it yeah yeah I see that what about hunting I'm like a blue belt in hunting yeah yeah yeah I've been doing it like I got the purple belt by doing it a long time mm-hmm as opposed to being amazing did you take lessons no I learned everything myself I have a couple of videos online me playing comfortably numb' did you learn from watching videos or did you learn from books like how did you like let me see this give me this look at you yeah it's there it probably won't pick it up and if it picks it up it'll be to my channel and I'll be short yeah it's me playing it's so good it sounds a lot of people from humming song freeze yeah so this is this is it no I did not but this thing get blocked if you were humming a song yeah and then someone made a claim on that song it would block our YouTube like literally we could get D monetized and put we we lose our streaming will be lots of things will happen lots of things like we've we've gotten flagged for watching something on the screen picture and picture no sound commenting on it and we get flagged and they want all the advertising revenue from a three hour show for five ten seconds of a video it's a slightly broken system oh it's broken but there's a lot of scam artists too so I played another song Black Betty oh yeah and I got I don't know yeah I played the damn song but they they said it was it wasn't they did exactly that oh they said it was the RAM jam or what everyone said it was there and I may have borrowed the beat behind it from them I'm not sure I just don't know yeah well that's what I was thinking about that song like it sounded like there was other shit going on besides just your guitar mmm oh no that's all me real it's all made bad the bad we hear that again that's really good man it sound good that's a great fucking song too comfortably numb' know the scariest thing for me what to play guitar on this podcast so it's like going back and forth oh really I do it said didn't that do it actually play play play no it was only a few people that have ever played play ever last been and Suzanne from honey honey Gary Clark didn't write and he just came out and talked and brought his guitar I wanted to play Hendrix here really yeah live what you got it right with you right now no I in the tar yeah well no I meant I was okay sure in the future now I'm not promise skin you wear a Hendrix wig with the bandana is that racially insensitive though you're allowed to know Joe I will not take my face you're allowed okay the hair is like just you know it's just hair is this not you can't wear dreadlocks though yes of those rules but I think you have all the rules though right it's well he's the goat you know of guitar players that's the goat doesn't them you know the reason why this call this shows called Aryans yeah yeah it's I stole it from Jimi Hendrix yeah what's my I don't remember if we brought this up last time but I just remembered to see in this video or you're playing guitar while you were driving yep well you shouldn't do that dude it was the reason why it was doing it why are you doing this on a test track Oh what kind of car is that looks like a Lincoln Lincoln MKZ yes sir oh they do that the Lincoln's do that we converted it and we that's the our code controlling the car Wow you know that is crazy so you converted this car to drive autonomously honestly Wow and what what exactly do you have to do to a car to change like because that car does not have the capacity to do anything like that so the right my correct no no no absolutely not but you are absolutely correct the there's the first part is being able to control the car with a computer which is converting it to be drive by wire so you can control the steering and the break in the acceleration to basically be able to control with a joystick and then you have to put laser sensors all around the cars that we can find a sensor and software so what's the best kind of sensor the optical laser a lot of debate on this and this is the big this is the Throwdown between Elon Musk and everybody else oh you know musk says the best sensors camera everybody else well everybody else says that at this time lidar which are these lasers yes is the best sensor so I'm more on the side in this case on camera Anil musk so here's the difference lasers are more precise they work better in poor lighting conditions that are more reliable you can actually build safe systems today that use lidar the problem is that they don't have very much information so we use our eyes to drive and a camera is the same thing and they have just a lot more information so if you're going to build artificial intelligence systems so the machine learning systems that learn from huge amounts of data camera is the way to go because you can learn so much more you can see so much more so the the richer deeper sensor is camera but it's much harder you have to collect a huge amount of data it's a little bit more futuristic so it's longer-term solution so today to build a safe vehicle you have to go lidar tomorrow however you define tomorrow he almost says this in a year others say it's 5 10 20 years camera is the way to go mmm that's that's the the hard debate and there's a lot of other debates but that's one of the core ones it's basically four camera you if you go camera like you're doing the Tesla there's seven cameras in your Tesla mm-hmm three looking forward there's all around so on one looking inside no you have the Model S yeah yeah so that that one doesn't have a camera that's look inside so it's all all cameras plus radar and ultrasonic sensors that approach requires collecting huge amounts of data and they're doing that they drove now about 1.3 billion miles under autopilot Jesus yes it's it's a very large amount of data so you're talking about over five hundred thousand vehicles have autopilot 450 I think thousand have the new version of autopilot autopilot two which is the one you're driving and all of that is data so all of those all the edge cases what they call them all the difficult situations that occur is feeding the machine learning system to become better and better and better and the open question is how much better doesn't need to get to get to the human level performance like one of the big thing one of the big assumptions human beings is that we think that driving is actually pretty easy and we think that humans suck at driving those two assumptions we think like driving it you know you stay in the lane you style for the stop sign it's pretty easy to automate and then the other one is you think like humans are terrible drivers and so it'll be easy to build a machine that outperforms humans are driving now there's that's uh I think there's a lot of flaws behind that intuition we take for granted how hard it is to look at the scene like everything you just did picked up moved around some objects it's really difficult to build an artificial intelligence system that does that to be able to perceive and understand the scene enough to understand the physics of the scene like all these objects that it like how to pick them up the texture of those objects the weight to understand glasses folded and unfolded open water bottle all those things it's common sense knowledge that we take for granted we think it's trivial but there is no artificial system in the world today nor will there be for perhaps quite a while that can reason do that kind of common-sense reasoning about the physical world add to that pedestrians so add some crazy people in this room right now to the whole scene Ryan being able to notice like what this guy's an asshole look at him was he doing was he doing get off the skateboard oh jesus is in traffic yep and the considering not that he's an asshole he's a respectable skateboarder it that in order to make him behave a certain way you yourself have to behave a certain way so it's not just you have to perceive the world you have to act in a way they have to assert your presence in this world you have to take risks so in order to make the skateboard or not cross the street you have to perhaps accelerate if you have the right-of-way and these are that there's a game theoretic running game of chicken to get right and you wouldn't even know how to approach that as a artificial-intelligence sort of research community and also as a society do we want an autonomous vehicle that speeds up in order to make a a pedestrian not cross Street hmm which is what we do all the time we have to assert our presence if there's a if there's a person who doesn't have the right away who begins crossing we're going to eat the maintain speed or speed up potentially if we want them to not cross so that that game there to get that right that's a dangerous game for a robot it's for a robot and for us to be rationally if that God forbid least a fatality for us society to rationally reason about that and think about that I mean a fatality like that could basically bankrupt the company there's a lawsuit going on right now about a an accident in Northern California with Tesla yeah and are you aware about yeah that one yeah this was the circumstances about that one so there was I believe in Mountain View a fatality in the Tesla where it this is a common problem for all all link keeping systems like like that slaughter pilot is there was a divider in the highway and basically the car was driving you know along Lane and then the car in front moved to an adjacent Lane and this divider appeared right so you have to now steer to the right and the car didn't and went straight into the divider oh wow and it's you know the basically what that boils down to is the car drifted out of Lane right or didn't adjust properly to the lane those kinds of things happen and this is because the person was allowing the auto pilot to do everything nope that you can't so we have to be extremely careful here I don't know that the really deep details of the case I'm not sure exactly how many people do so there's a judgment on what the people the person was doing and then there's an ounce of what the system did right the system did it drifted out of lane and the question is did the person was the person paying attention and was there enough time given for the person to take over and if they were paying attention to catch the vehicle steer back onto the road hmm as far as I believe the only information they have is hands on steering wheel and they were saying that like half that's half the minute leading up to the crash the hands weren't on the steering wheel or something like that basically trying to infer where the person paying attention or not but we don't have the information exactly what would where were their eyes right you can only meet guesses as far as I know again so the the question is this is the eyes on the road thing because I think I've heard you on a podcast saying you're tempted to sort of look off the road with your new Tesla or at least become a little bit complacent that's the yeah we're worried the worries that you you just rely on the thing that you would relax too much but what would that relaxation lead to that the problem is if something happened if you weren't you know when you're driving I mean we've discussed this many times on the podcast that the reason why people have road rage one of the reasons is because you're in a heightened state because cars are flying around you in your brain is prepared to make split-second decisions and moves and the worry is that you would relax that because you're so comfortable with that thing driving everybody that I know that it's tried that they say you get you really used to it doing that you get really used to it just driving around for you so the question is what be what happens when you get used to it yeah you start looking off-road dstyle texting more do you start watching a movie etc right that that's a that's a really an open question and the like for example we just did it the study published a study from MIT on what people in our data set with will collect this data set of 300 thousand miles in Tesla some instruments all these Tesla's and watch what people are actually doing and are they paying attention when they disengaged the system so there's a really important moment here we have 18,000 of those when the person catches the car you know the disengage autopilot mm-hm and that's a really Tesla uses this moment as well that's a really important window into difficult cases so some percentage of those some small percentages about 10% is we call them tricky situations is situations where you have to immediately respond like drifting out of lane if there's a stopped car in front so on the question is are people paying attention during those moments so in our data set they were paying attention they were still remaining vigilant now in our data set the autopilot was quote-unquote encountering tricky situations every 9.2 miles so you could say it was failing every 9.2 miles mmm that is one of the reasons we believe that people are still paying it because remaining vigilant that it's regularly and unpredictably sort of drifting out of lane or misbehaving so you don't over trust it you don't become too complacent the open question is when it becomes better and better and better and better will you start becoming complacent when it drives on the highway for an hour an hour and a half and is opposed to 9.2 miles make that 50 miles 60 miles do you start to over trust it and that's a really open question do you think or do you anticipate a time and anywhere in the near future where you won't have to correct you will allow the car to do it because the car will be perfect the car first of all will never be perfect nor will ever be perfect autonomous vehicles will always you think require at least some sort of manual override yeah really that's interesting that you're saying that because you work in AI like what makes you think that that's impossible to achieve well let's let's talk because because you're using the word perfection I think perfect okay that's a bad word yeah so you're I guess you're a but let me see will it achieve because people are obviously not perfect will achieve a state of competence that exceeds the human being and let's put it in a dark way competence measured by fatal crashes yes yes I absolutely believe so and perhaps in the near term near-term oh yeah five years yeah for me five ten years is near term for Elon in Elon Musk time that's converted to one year have you met him yes interviewed him recently fascinating cat right yep got a lot of weird shit bouncing around behind those eyeballs you don't realize until you talk to him in person you're like oh you got a lot going on in there man yeah there's this passion there's Drive I mean it's one of the hurricane of ideas yeah and focus and confidence mm-hmm I mean the thing is and a lot of the things he does which I admire greatly from any man or woman innovator it's just boldly fearlessly pursuing new ideas or jumping off the cliff and learning to fly on the way down mm-hmm that that's I mean well no matter what happens he'll be remembered as the great innovators of our time whatever you say maybe in my book Steve Jobs was as well even if you criticize perhaps he hasn't contributed significantly to the technological development of the company are the different ideas they did still his brilliance was in all the products of iPhone of the the personal computer of the Mac and so on and I think the same is true with with with Elon and yes there's in this space of autonomous vehicles of semi autonomous vehicles of driver assistance systems it's a pretty tense space to operate in there's several communities in there that are very responsible but also aggressive in their criticism hmm so in driving in the automotive sector obviously since Henry Ford and before there's been a culture of safety of just great engineering these are like some of the best engineers in the world in terms of large-scale production you talk about Toyota you talk about for GM these people know how to do safety well and so here comes along with Silicon Valley ideals that throws a lot of it out the window and says we're going to revolutionize the way we do automation in general we're going to make software updates to the car once a week twice a week over-the-air just like that mm-hmm that makes people in the safety engineers and human factors engineers really uncomfortable like what do you mean you're going to keep updating the software of the car without like how are you testing it right that makes people really uncomfortable why does it make them uncomfortable because the way in the automotive sector you test the system mmm you you come up with a design of the car every component and then you go through like really rigorous testing before it ever hits the road I here's an idea from the Tesla side is where they basically they in shadow mode test the software but then they just release it so essentially the drivers become the testing mm-hmm and then they regularly update it to to to adjust a if any issues arise that makes people uncomfortable because there's not a standardized testing procedure there's not there's not at least the feeling in the industry of rigor because the reality is we don't know how to test software in the same kind of with the same kind of rigor that we've tasted the automotive system tested automotive system in the past so I think it's extremely exciting and powerful to make software sort of approach automotive engineering with at least in part a software engineering perspective so just doing what's made Silicon Valley successful so updating regularly aggressively innovating on the software side so your Tesla over-the-air while we're sitting here could get a totally new update remember the flip of a bit as a llama says it can be you can gain all new capabilities that's really exciting but that's also dangerous and that that balance we what's dangerous about it let it be faulty software faulty a bug so if your your the apps on your phone you know fail all the time where as a society used to software failing we just kind of reboot the device where we start the app a most complex software systems in in the world today if we think outside of nuclear engineering and so on there really nobody there too complex to really thoroughly test so thorough complete testing proving that the software is safe is nearly impossible on most software systems that that's a that's nerve-wracking to a lot of people because this that there's no way to prove that the new software update is safe so what it what is the process like do you know like how they create software they update it and then they test it on something how much testing do they do and what how much do they do before they upload it to your car yeah so I don't have any insider information but I have a lot of sort of public available information which is they they test the software in shadow mode meaning they see how the new software compares to the current software by running it in parallel on the cars and seeing if there's disagreements if like seeing if there's any major disagreements and bringing those up and seeing what by parallel I'm sorry do you mean both programs running at the same time one the original of the es at the same time the original update actually controlling the car mm-hmm and the new update is just making the same decision making the same decisions without them being without editing the actual okay without actually affecting the vehicles dynamics and so that's that's a really powerful way of testing I think the software infrastructure that Tesla's built a loss for that and I think other companies should do the same that's a really exciting powerful way to approach not just automation not just the time most vehicles or semi autonomous vehicles but just safety is basically all the data that's on cars bring it back to a central point to where you can use the edge cases all the weird situations in driving to improve the system to test the system to learn to understand where the cars used misused how can be improved and so on that's extremely powerful how many people they have that are analyzing almost data it's a it's a really good question so they have so the interesting thing about driving is most of it is pretty boring nothing interesting happens so they have automated ways of extracting again what are called cases so these weird moments of driving and once you have these weird moments they have people annotate it I don't know what the number is but a lot of companies are doing this it's in the hundreds and the thousands basically if humans annotate the data to see what happened but most of what they're trying to do is to automate that annotation so to figure out how the debt date it can be automatically used to improve the system so they have they have methods for that because it's a huge amount of data and I think in the recent autonomy Day a couple of weeks ago at this big autonomy day where they demonstrated the vehicle driving itself on a particular stretch of road they they showed off that you know they're able to query the data basically ask questions of the data saying the the example they gave is there's a bike on the back of a car the bicycle in the back of a car and they're able to say well when the bicycle is in the back of a car that's not a bicycle that's just the part of the car and they're able to now look back into the data and find all the other cases the thousands of cases that happened all over the world in Europe and Asia in South America and in North America and so on and pull all those elements and then train the Train perception system of autopilot to be able to to better recognize those bicycles as part of the car so every edge case like that they go through hmm saying okay the car freaked out in this moment let me find moments like this in the rest of the data and then improve the system so it's it's a this kind of cycle is the way to deal with with problems with failures of the system it's to say every time the car fails at something say is this part of the bigger set of problems can I find all those problems and can I improve it with a new update and that just keeps going the open question is how many loops like that you have to take for the car to become really good better than human so basically how hard is driving how many weird situations when you manually drive do you deal with every day somebody somebody mentioned there's like millions of cases when you watch video you see them somebody mentioned that they drive a truck EPS truck and we'll pass cow pastures and they know that if there's no cows in the cow pasture that means they're grazing and if they're grazing I mean they'd be using the correct terms I apologize not a car guy that that means that there may be cows up ahead on the road there's just this kind of reasoning it can use to anticipate difficult situations and we do we do that kind of reasoning about like everything cars today can't do that kind of reasoning they're just perceiving what's in front of them now outside of Tesla how many other companies have autonomous systems that are driving their cars so maybe it's good to step back there's several and there's several leaders in each different approach so first let's draw a line between the different types of systems that are okay one there's fully autonomous vehicles so these are cars you can think about that don't have a steering wheel or if they have a steering wheel it doesn't matter they're in full control and if there's a crash the car company is liable do those exist no okay it's it's a gray area though because many companies are basically saying that that's what they're doing but they're not quite there so the leader in that space is used to be called Google self-driving car program now it's called way mo they are doing that there it's called level four level five there's levels to this game and this is this particular level where it's fully autonomous now they're trying to achieve full autonomy but the way they're doing it currently is they're testing on public roads with what's called the safety driver so there's a driver always ready to take over and the driver does have to take over at some rate you know frequently and so the fact that the driver has to take over that's not fully autonomous then right so there's no car today that you can just get in without a safety driver so there's nobody behind the wheel and using your app sort of from page appointment right but out of the cars that are semi-autonomous where there is an autonomous program but you do have to keep your hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road now what what are the leaders besides Tesla there's Tesla and who else is doing it so there's yeah there's several systems it depends how you define leader but so are they yeah see this like there's Mercedes and BMW they use the same system do they did someone make a system for cars or do they create their own system yeah that that's a really good question so there's in some cases there's mobile I and NVIDIA there's these companies that Nvidia the the video card computing car company yep the same the same folks that power the quake game right right the the graphics on the quake game you can use those GPU graphics processing units to run machine learning code mm-hmm so they're also creating the nvidia drive yeah scalable AI platform for autonomous driving in fact I don't when did you buy your Tesla five months ago or something some like so the thing in there now most likely is a Nvidia Drive px 2 hmm so the and that works on cameras that that just runs code that takes in camera data but it can work on anything else so it could work on lidar as well somebody have a system yeah but it need different code so the lidar requires very different kinds of processing very does anybody use that with cars with all semi autonomous cars lighter yes the well okay so semi autonomous we have to be careful right because the way no cars like the the quote-unquote fully autonomous cars are currently semi autonomous right okay so the there are the highest level of semi-autonomous right yeah that guess it's it's not even a highest level it's a principle it's a philosophy difference because they're saying we're gonna do full autonomy we're just not quite there yet most other companies they're doing semi autonomous better called driver assistance systems is they're saying we're not interested in full autonomy we just want a driver assistance system that helps you steer the car so let's call those semi autonomous vehicles or driver assistance systems the there's several leaders in that space like one car we're studying that's really interesting is Cadillac super Krewe system so GM has the system it's called super cruise that I think is the best comparable system to autopilot today the the key differentiator there is there's a lot of little elements but the key differentiators there's a driver monitoring system so there's a camera that looks at you and tells you if your eyes on the road or not and if your eyes go off the road for I believe more than six seconds it starts warning you and says you have to be you have to get your eyes back on the road so that's called driver monitoring that's one of the big disagreements for example you see me and Elon and many experts in the field in Elon and the Tesla approach is that there should be a driving monitoring system there should be a camera why does Elon feel like there shouldn't be I think his focus the Tesla's focus is on just improving the system so fast and so effectively that it doesn't matter what the driver does that it it you know so essentially no safety net no safety net and I think they operate like that in many ideas that they work with is they sort of boldly proceed forward to try to make the car extremely safe now the concern there is you have to acknowledge the psychology of human beings that unless the car is perfect or under our definition perfect which is much better than human beings then you have to be able to you have to be able to make sure that the people are still paying attention to help the car out when it fails and for that you have to have driving model you have to know what the car is right now your Tesla only knows about your presence from the steering wheel well touching the steering wheel which is a kind of driving monitoring system it knows you're there but it's not nearly as effective at knowing you're there cognitively visually you can be tricked by a clamp you've seen people do that they had to develop these clamps that you just put on the steering wheel it'll hold a phone and then also tricked the system into thinking that you're holding all the wheel yeah you could do a lot of purses actually work really well don't ask me how hanging a purse no like shoving a person really into the somebody who did that with an orange or something I found what they said it didn't work maybe needs to be all the way we're on the outside of it I think it depends on the shape of the orange how ripe it is there's a lot of debate no I the point is there's ways to trick the system there's it's not monitoring the driver that's the point yeah it's not monitoring and driving a lot of people believe you need to you you think you need to make sense yeah I think I think not just for the safety of the system but to create an experience like I think there's value for the car to know more about you mmm-hmm sort of just like that what's happening there it's scanning this guy's eyes that's ignored your porch it freaks me out so yeah there's a lot of companies sort of springing up they're doing computer vision on the face and so on to try to detect where you're looking so what cars have that now the the major one is the super consistent it's not many cars a few cars are starting to add it Europe what's a super Krewe system that's the GM Cadillac okay they're trying to so it's in they're super expensive lineup currently and they're I think trying to add it to the full lineup of all so in like Cadillacs what is that big cruiser that they have now the big 4-door car the really high-end ct6 I don't know what it is they have a new one that's really nice is that what they're putting in the big sedan that thing yes I it's pretty I don't know if that's the C g6 but the the one we're looking at the CT six yes that's us 2018 CT six yeah it's you know it's a but they won't add it to their their full fleet so really interesting have the same amount of cameras as the Tesla system does no and it has a very different philosophy as well in another way which is it only works on very specific roads on interstate highways there's something called OD operational design domain so they they define that this thing super cool system only works on this particular set of roads and they're basically just major highways the Tesla approach is saying they were basically what Elan jokingly referred to as a GD right is it works basically anywhere so if you try to turn on your autopilot you can basically turn out anywhere or the cameras are able to determine either lane markings or the car in front of you mm-hmm and so that's a very different approach saying you can basically make your work anywhere or in cattle a case making work on only specific kinds of roads so you can test the heck out of those roads you can map those roads so you can use actually lidar to map the full road so you know the full geometry of all the the interstate highway system they can operate on and then just also coordinate with GPS where SOTA understands where like bumps in the road might be or Hills in that sense according to GPS for different curvature information but not the topography the know and like construction is a big one that would be crazy for new potholes you know I well potholes isn't a big problem I think construction is the big problem like just this quickly changing dynamic information which like apps like Waze provide I mean that puddles are a pretty big problem in Boston oh yeah no for sure but New York is actually probably even worse I blew out two tires in one day in New York on potholes it's not an unlucky day yeah but the I'd rather you blow out your tire for sure then then I mean the the kind of fatality that happened in in the mountain view with Tesla I believe is slightly construction related so I mean there's a lot of safety critical events yeah I would like if that stupid Tesla could figure out the hole in the ground know so I didn't have to blow a tire out come on bro feel your pain Joe figure it out but priorities I'll uh I'll make sure I'll forward this podcast to you lines remember they work on this I think he's busy yeah what is this Jaime Tesla auto pot will be able to avoid potholes in the road says Elon Musk haha motherfuckers on top of shit what's the date on that April April 7th okay just now yeah and that's an interesting thing that's another that's almost an ethical question whether you want a car to avoid a situation by swerving right because when you swerve you now introduce as opposed to sort of breaking the vehicle you're swerving into another Lane means you might create a safety situation elsewhere you might put somebody else in danger yeah that's why I was saying if it coordinated with GPS it would have previous knowledge you know sort of like Waze tells you where the cops are yep you know I mean so that kind of information would be extremely powerful and useful the the problem is it's hard to get it really up to date that kind of information really up to date mm-hmm it's just an infrastructure question just getting the getting the software the data in place to where the car will be able to learn quickly from all the things that are changing I think potholes don't change that often so that that's that's a different thing but in terms of construction zones in terms of other weird things that change the dynamics the geometry of the road mm-hmm that's that's difficult to to get right so Cadillacs doing a version of it but it sounds like it's a little bit less and less involved less comprehensive maybe this is a better way of drama yeah unless I would say it's more safety focused as a sort of what's the right word to use here it's more cautious mm-hmm in its implementation so GM again has has a tradition for better for worse just like Jamie do they have on their website and discipline problems showing you shows like it's a signal coming on oh wow the green a attention lady she's too hot it's not paying attention looking at people staring at her no comment one of the one of the things that you it's hard to talk about without actually experience in the system is what's more important than driving monitoring and any of the details we talked about is like how the whole thing feels the whole thing together how its implemented the whole interface and the the catalog system was actually done really well in a that there's a clarity to it like everything becomes there's a green color and a blue color and you know exactly when the system is on and when it's off that's one of the big things people struggle with is just confusing in in other cars drivers not being able to understand when the system is on or off oh all right so you think the system is doing it and then just slam into something yet it wasn't even on now when this car is operating in this manner how many cameras is it using you know that's a good question I should know that but I think it's only forward to facing cameras as far as I know I think it's two cameras it may be three cameras tell it just sat back so she doesn't have her hands on the wheel at all yep so she's watching right because the car is able to see where the eyes are it's a hands-off system so you're a lot to take your hands off the wheel mm-hmm it's very interesting it's uh and there are certain human behavior aspects that come into play to this so you start to like I found myself actually becoming a little more drowsy with this system I haven't driven it enough so I haven't gotten used to it but you have to at least in the initial stages it kind of forced you to look at the road in in a way that felt artificial I think it's something that gets better with time you get used to it but it's almost like a game a fide thing that the car when you look off-road starts to tell you that you're looking off-road so you kind of psychologically pressure to always stare at the road and you realize that actually when you drive you often look around and so having to like stare forward can be a little bit yeah exactly you start I think there's something useful and hypnotic about those lanes just coming at you and just the lines yeah why is that that confuses a shit out of me because I could not be tired at all but if it's nighttime I'm on the highway and those lines they just start to yeah take you to dream land I get the same with there's also just the vibration is that like that that hum of driving same with trains you know yeah planes as well yeah puts me out so that that there's a Cadillac system that's the big leader I would say in the driver monitoring and then Tesla is the no driver monitoring and huge data collection BMW has a system as well to use yeah BMW what do they use them I don't I don't want to speak too much to the details they have lane keeping system so basically systems that keep you in the lane that is similar to what in spirit autopilot is supposed to do but is less aggressive and how often you can use and so on if you look at the performance of the of the actual how often the system is able to keep you in Lane autopilot is currently the leader in that space and they're also the most aggressive innovators in that space so they're like really pushing it to improve for them further and the open question is the worrying question is if it improves much more are there going to be effects like complacency like people will will take we'll start texting more we start looking off-road more that's a it's an a totally open question and nobody knows the answer to that really and there's a lot of folks that convention in the safety engineers and human factors community so these psychology folks who have roots and like aviation that know there's there's been 70 years of work that looks at vigilance that people if I force you to sit here and monitor for something weird happening like radar operators in the world war two had to watch you know for the dot to appear if I sit you behind that radar and make you do it after about 15 minutes but really thirty minutes you'll see your rate of being able to detect any problems will go down significantly you just kind of zone out hmm and so there's like all kinds of psychology studies that show that we just wear crappy human beings are really crappy at monitoring automation mmm if I tell you if I put a robot and you just say monitor this system so it doesn't kill anyone you'll you know - now we have to be engaged you have to be engaged you have to be you know there has to be a dance attention come we don't have a mode for watching autonomous things right if you consider historically the kind of modes that people have for observing things we don't really have a mode for making sure that an autonomous thing does its job yeah it's sort of mindset it's not like oh you know to me like you fit my car okay I'm driving here we go driving a turn I'm thinking I'm in driving mode when you're in autonomous mode and you're observing you just like what is this I've never done this before this is fucking weird it feels weird it's not part of human nature right it's a normal state one thing it's done commonly in now is aviation so pilots pilots are basically MA during fully autonomous planes yeah that's a good point as far as I know mainly planes today could fly almost fully autonomously it's also a good point when it comes to software and updates because isn't that part of the issue with this Boeing 737 active system yeah these systems that they've had problems with they've been faulty and a couple have crashed yeah and that that's a really good point and they they've yeah there's been two tragic crashes recently with with the Mac system and if they bench those things right haven't they I'm not following they also got rid of a bunch of inspectors I think they fired like 80 inspectors today and the unions are freaking out yep there's obviously this politics have joy is I think FA is supposed to supervise and there were there was there's a close relationship between Boeing and FAA those questions around I mean there's better experts at that than me but on the software side it is worrying because it was a single software update essentially that helps prevent the vehicle of the vehicle the airplane from stalling so if if it's if the nose is tilting up increasing chance of stalling it's going to automate automatically point the nose down of the airplane and the the pilots in many cases as far as I understand weren't even informed of this update right there they weren't even told this happening the idea behind the update is that they're not supposed to really know it's supposed to just manage the flight for you right the problem happened when there's a angle-of-attack sensor so the sensor that tells you the actual tilt of the plane and there was a malfunction in that sensor as far as I understand in both planes and so the plane didn't actually understand its orientation so the system started freaking out started pointing the nose down aggressively and the pilots were like trying to reach stabilize the plane and couldn't so shortly after liftoff they're just wrong yeah that's software update that's crazy and that that that's that's a safety culture that's dealing with this new world of software that we don't know what to do with you know and and yeah it's a question one way is to be sort of a little bit Luddite I used the term carefully and just be afraid and say you know what we should really not allow so many software updates the other one is sort of embracing it and redefining what it means to build safe AI systems in this modern world with updates multiple times a week what do you think oh no so I'm a hundred percent for the for the software approach so I think updates regular updates so combining the two cultures but really letting good software engineer on lead the way is the way to go there's I wish other companies were competing with Tesla on this there on the software side Tesla is far ahead of everyone else in in the automotive sector and that's one of the problems I I'm worried that you know competition is good right and I'm worried there's people wait too far behind to actually give Tesla new ideas I'll compete Tesla on software so most cars are not able to do over-the-air as far as I know no cars are able to do major over-the-air updates except Tesla vehicles hmm they do over-the-air updates to the entertainment system like you know if your radios malfunctioning but in terms of the control of the vehicle you have to go to the dealership to get an update Tesla is the only one that over-the-air like it can multiple times a week do the update I think that should be a requirement for all car companies but that requires that they rethink the way build cars that's really that's really scary when you manufacture over a million cars a year in Toyota and GM to say especially old-school Detroit guys and gals that are like legit car people to say we need to hire some software engineering that's a challenge it's a totally you know I don't know how often you've been Detroit but there's a culture difference in Detroit and Silicon Valley and those two have to come together to solve this problem so I have like the adult responsibilities of Detroit how to do production well manufacture how to do safety well how to test the vehicles well and do the bold crazy innovative spirit of Silicon Valley which you know a musk in basically everywhere represents and that I think that will define the future of these of actually AI in general I mean interacting with AI systems just even outside the automotive sector it requires these questions of safety of AI safety of how we supervise a system how we manage them from misbehaving and so on we're also there's a concern about those systems being vulnerable to third party attacks yeah so hacking yeah this that's a that's a fascinating question I think there is a whole discipline called adversarial machine learning in AI which basically any kind of system you can think of how we can feed it examples how we can add a little bit of noise to the system to fool it completely so there's been demonstrations on Alexa for example where you can take you can take you can feed noise into the system that's imperceptible to us humans and make it believe you said anything so fool the system into thinking the ordering extra toilet paper I don't know in the same for cars you can feed noise into the cameras to make it believe that there is or there isn't a pedestrian and then there is or there isn't lane markings so someone could do this in theory at least in in theory that's the big difference is in theory is doable you can do demonstrations in practices really difficult to do in the real world so in the lab you can do it you can construct a situation where a pedestrian can wear certain types of clothing or put up a certain kind of sign where they disappear from the system I have to ask you this to know just remember this you'd be the perfect person to talk about this I'm not sure if you remember this case but there was a guy named michael hastings michael hastings with a journalist and he was i believe in iraq or afghanistan him somewhere overseas and he was stuck there because of this volcano that erupted and I believe Iceland and he was over there for the Rolling Stone magazine and doing doing an article about a general well he stayed there for a long time because they were stranded because of the volcano and they got real comfortable around him and he reported a lot of the stuff that they said and did that maybe they thought that he probably wouldn't have reported on including them saying disparaging things about President Obama at the time anyway comes back the general was forced to resign he was a beloved general and michael hastings was in fearing for his life because he thought that they were going to come and get him because these people were very very angry at him he wound up driving his car into a tree going 120 miles an hour and the car exploded and the engine went flying and people that were the conspiracy theorists were saying they believed that that car had been rigged to work autonomously or that someone for some third party bad person decided to or good person depending on your perspective decided to drive that guy's car into a fucking tree at 120 miles an hour do you think that that and this is 2011 michael hastings death 12 maybe 2012 let's see what it says 2013 do you think that in 2013 that would have been possible it's entirely possible no I just wanted to say that haha shout-out to the Joe Rogan subreddit okay check that one off the list Jeannie pull that up check that off I whether it's possible it's an interesting question whether it's likely is another question III think it's very unlikely and but the other most important question is that's something we should worry at scale about our future it's cars being used to assassinate essentially people I'm Russian so I've heard of those things being done by our friend Putin over mm-hmm I think I think it's very unlikely that this kind of thing would happen in scale that people would use this I think there would be more effective ways to achieve this kind of end for sure and I just think it's a very difficult technical challenge that if hacking happens it would be at a different level than hacking the AI systems it will be just hacking software right and the hacking software is the kind of the kind of thing that can happen with anything an elevator saw elevator software or any kind of software that operates any aspect of our lives could be hacked that same kind of right my question though was in 2013 was that technology available where they could take over someone's car do you know what car it was Mercedes I think it was an S Class C 250 C c-class it's but yes yes yes but I I don't think oh boy this is like no listen this has been widely speculated I know I'm just asking you because you're actually an expert I mean it's very rare that you get an expert in autonomous vehicles and you get to run a conspiracy theory by them to see if they can just put a stamp on it being possible or not let me just say that Alex Jones is officially not allowed to say MIT scientists says that's exactly what you're going to try to do know I first of all let me back off and say I am NOT a security expert which is very important difference that is important yeah so then autonomous vehicle I build autonomous vehicle systems I don't know how to make them extremely robust as security to hacking attacks and have a lot of really good friends which are some of the coolest people I know who are basically hackers converted to security experts I would say though loosely speaking I think the technology was there yes for with physical access to the car to be able to control it but I don't I think it's extremely unlikely that's what happened I see where you're coming from I'm not asking you whether or not it's likely that it happened I'm sure you don't even have much information on the case because I had explained it to you right that's right the guy also had some serious amphetamines in his system they compared it to crystal meth but the reality is he was a journalist and most journalists I want to say most a lot or on adderall and adderall is essentially you spend fat amines I mean that's what it is it's real it's like it's like next-door neighbors to crystal meth really is he is it well you said it's possible they could actually get it to turn the wheel yes I have to look at the exact system like it's that drive-by-wire things and I mentioned some systems are not it's not so easy to turn the wheel actually right but it could get him to just accelerate out of control he's going like 120 something miles now and he slammed into a tree it's entirely possible ah you can't do it twice the the system's back then though were far more primitive correct yeah yeah but it's it's really again the the attack vectors here the so the the way you hack these systems I have more to do with the software low lava software that can be primitive than the high-level AI stuff right but my issue with it was there's no cameras on the outside of the vehicle like there is on Tesla of today which has autonomous driving as an option absolutely so okay I see your point now so wouldn't be hacking the system that perceives the world and a price in the world it would literally be malfunction that forces her to not be able to break controllable right which is a you know it's a more basic kind of attack and then control then making the car steer auto lane yes yes that's a different that that's what people worry about with the Thomas vehicles once more and more you're talking about potentially ten twenty million lines of source code all this code and so obviously becomes amenable susceptible to bugs that can be exploited to hack the code and so people are worried legitimately so that these security attacks would would lead to these kind of well at the worst case assassinations but generally sort of just basic basic attacks basic hacking attacks on I think it's I think that's something that people in the automotive industry and certainly Tesla is really working hard on and making sure that that everything is secure there's going to be of course vulnerabilities always but I think they're really serious about preventing them but in the demonstration space you'll be able to demonstrate some interesting ways to trick the system in terms of computer vision the this all boils down to that these systems that actually that are ones that a camera based are not as robust as our human eyes are to the world so like I said if you add a little bit of noise you can convince it to see anything to us humans will look like the same Road like the same three pedestrians cars you draw like a little person on the camera lens cameras right you could get down there with Sharpie that's that's a one attack vector that is draw stuff but you jokingly say that but that's the Sun plays tricks on Cadillacs supercruise next-generation system will address camera problem oh well as long as the next generation addresses that you fucking assholes the Sun plays tricks on it so next-gen system is something you're gonna have to bring that Cadillac into the dealership and they're gonna have to update the song update it yeah whereas tests will just handle that shit over the area yeah I got an update the other day I was like all right and the question was so that that's an exciting powerful capability but then the bowing the flipside is you know it can significantly change to be here the system and there there could be a glitch there could be a glitch there could be a bug the bowing ones terrifying especially with a lot of I mean that number whatever it's like 300 combined 300 plus people dead maybe even 400 I mean yes I I don't even know how to think think about that number yeah all from a software glitch the guy who coded it or the girl code it must feel fucking terrible yeah and you kind of look man it's it's uh it's a lot of burden and it's one of the reasons it's one of the most exciting things to work on actually is the code we write has the capability to save human life but the terrifying thing is also has the capability to take human life and that's a that's a weird place to be as an engineer or directly a little piece of code you know I'll write thousands of them a day you know basically notes you're taking could eventually lead to somebody dying now zero I don't know anything about coding but do you have like a is there a spell check for coding yeah so it's kind of called debugging it's trying to find bugs and it's a software that's doing this yeah software so there's depending on the programming language and everybody should if you if you haven't tried programming you should try it it's it's cool it's the future you should learn to program okay that's my plug you suppose they learn to code that one scared of it it's a problematic term I don't actually know why it's the dumbest fucking problematic code of all time because someone ridiculously was suggesting that coal miners could maybe learn how to code computer code and like get a different job they could be trained and so as someone with the way people were looking at it like that that was a like a frivolous suggestion and that it was ridiculous to try to get someone who was 50 years old it doesn't have any education in computers at all to change their job from being a coal miner to learning how to code so they started saying it to politicians and people mocking it but then what Twitter alleged was that what was going on was it was being connected to white supremacy and anti-semitism and a bunch of different things like people were saying learn to code and they were putting in a bunch of these other phrases and my suggestion would people that's a different fucking thing like now you have like you look you have a problem with Nazis and white supremacists but that's the problems with Nazis and white supremacist what someone is just saying learn to code mocking this ridiculous idea that you're going to teach you know that's a that's a legitimate criticism of someone's perspective that you're gonna get a coal miner to learn how to fucking and do computer coding it's crazy it's a it's so people getting banned for that rightly so people were furious the way Google described it to me and Tim Poole and we were discussing it was that at Google I mean excuse me Twitter the way Twitter described it was that essentially they were dealing with something where they were trying to censor things at scale there was there was so many people and there's so much going on that it's very difficult to get it right and that they've made mistakes I think that's the fast one of the most fascinating applications of AI actually is filtering trying to manage puter learning also using machine learning to manage this huge conversation you talking about 500 I believe it's 500 million tweets a day something like that and Jaime makes at least 331 I was i with this conversation I saw this recently I don't know who did the data on this but there's a statement someone put on Twitter that said that of let me see if I can word it correctly it was 22 percent of adult Americans are on Twitter well alright so that's like that's like a fact one of that 10% make up 80% of the tweets created by adult Americans 2% of the people on Twitter make up 80% of the tweets yeah that make sense yeah a lot of people are arguing aggressively and the question how to manage that and you can't manage that but just a manual review of your three yeah you'd have to have so many employees yeah that's I think more likely I don't think jack is lying but nor is Vidya but I do think that they have a clear bias against conservatives and that's being shown so that's an interesting question I have your friend my friend and mentor Eric Weinstein yes talk to me I disagreed with him a little bit on this I think he basically believes so there's a bias it boils down to the conversation that Jack is having at the at the top level inside Twitter mm-hmm what what is that conversation like I think I tend to believe again this might be my naive nature is that they have they don't have bias and they have just they're trying to manage this in huge flood of of tweets and what they're trying to do is not buy is not to remove sort of conservative as a liberal as and so on they're trying to remove people that lead to others leaving the conversation so they want more people to be in the conversation I think that's true as well but I think they definitely are biased against conservative people there's an Alexander Alexandra a OC Octavia has an AOC is good Cortez is the last one is it Octavia Ocasio that's right okay I'm sorry Alexander AOC sorry I just I'm thinking I wasn't planning on talking about her but there was a parody account and someone was running this parody account which was very mild just a humorous parody account they were banned permanently for running it and then their own account was banned as well whereas you know there's some of people or liberal people that post all sorts of crazy shit and they don't they don't get banned at the same rate it's really clear that someone in the company whether it's up for manual review whether it's at the discretion of the people that are employees when you're thinking about a company that's a Silicon Valley company you are in without doubt you're dealing with people that are leaning left there's so many that lean left in Silicon Valley the idea that that company was secretly run by Republicans is ridiculous they're almost all run by Democrats or progressive people so that the leadership level there's there's a narrow mindedness that that that permeates all Silicon Valley is saying well the question I think there's a leaning left that permeates Silicon Valley I think that's undeniable I think it's undeniable I mean I think if you had a poll the people that work in Silicon Valley where their political leanings are I think it would be by far left I think would be the vast majority does that mean that affects their decisions well what's the evidence well it's kind of shows as it does you know it's they're they're not treating it with a hundred percent clarity and and you know across the board accuracy or fairness rather I think that there's absolutely people that work there that lean and there's been videos where they've captured people that were Twitter employees talking about it talking about how you do that how you make their you know fight you find someone who's using Trump talk or you know saying sad at the end of things and someone who's talking he's gonna you know that certain characteristics they look for he's been video so what is that project Veritas well that guy got his employees got undercover footage of Twitter employees talking about that kind of stuff question is how much power do those individuals have how many of individuals are there like that I are that are those people exaggerating their ability and what they do at work or they are they talking about something that used to go on but doesn't go on anymore I don't know I don't work there I think it boils down to I I'm one of those people that believes it's it boils down to little leadership some people at the top set the culture and the culture has to be it cannot be this kind of Silicon Valley narrow-minded sort of left-leaning thinking even if you believe even if you're hardcore liberal you cannot when you operate the come when you drive and manage a conversation in the entire world you have to think about middle America you have to think about you have to have fundamental respect for human beings who voted for Trump it is a concerning thing for me to see just a narrow mindedness of in all forms one of the reasons I enjoy listening to this podcast is you're pretty open-minded that open-mindedness is essential for leaders of Facebook and Twitter people who are managing conversations I think so too I think it's I think it's a sort of it the thought of being open-minded and in acting in that ethic is probably one of the most important things that we could go forward with right now because things are getting so greasy it's so slippery on both sides and we are at this weird position that I don't recall ever in my life there being such a divide between the right and the left in this country I don't it's more more vicious more angry more hateful it's different than at any other time in my life and I think a lot of our ideas are based on these narratives that may or may not even be accurate and then we support them and we reinforce them on either side we reinforced them on the Left we reinforced them on the right where if you're looking at reality itself and you don't have these clear parameters and these clear ideologies I think we're way most of us are way more in the middle than we think we are most of us are we just don't want racists running the country we don't want socialists giving all our money away we don't want to pay too much in taxes to a shitty government we don't want schools getting underfunded we all you know and then we decide what what does my team like the team that I the shit that I like is that this team well not everything but they got a lot of things so I'll go with them maybe I'm not a religious nut but I'm fiscally conservative and I don't like with Democrats like to spend money I'm gonna go with the Republicans you know maybe you know maybe I'm you know more I'm more concerned with the state of the economy and the way we trade with the world than I am with certain social issues that the Democrats embrace so I'll lean that way even though I do support gay rights and I do support this I do support all these other progressive ideas there's way more of us in that boat there's way more of us that are in this middle of the whole thing for sure but there it goes up and down so all of us I'm oh I hope I am open-minded most of the time but you have different moods hope for sure yeah and the question is this is where the role of AI comes in does the AI that recommends what tweets I should see what Facebook messages I should see is that encouraging the darker parts of me or the the Steven Pinker better angels of our nature like is it what stuff is it showing me because if it shows me stuff that like if the AI trains purely unclicks it mates start to learn when I'm in a bad mood and point me to things that might be upsetting to me yeah and so escalating that division and escalating this vile thing that can be solved most likely with people training a little more jujitsu or something this Facebook algorithm that encourages people to be outraged because accidentally not even on purpose but this is what engages people with this is what gets clicks so they find out oh well he clicks on things when he finds other people are anti-vaccination or he clicks on things when he finds out you know but would it fill in the blank with whatever the subject is and then you get these motherfuckers you know this is a reason why measles are spreading and you start getting an angry I mean the anti-vaxxers on Facebook I don't know if you ever dip into those waters for a few minutes yeah and watch people fight back and forth and in fury and anger you know it's it's another one of those things that becomes a extremely lucrative subject for any social media empire if you're if you're all about getting people to engage and that's where the money isn't advertising yeah getting people to click on the page and the ads are on those page you get those clicks get that money if that's how the system is set and I'm not exactly sure how it is cuz I don't really use Facebook but that's what it benefits I mean that's what that's what it gravitates towards gravitates towards controversy so and and when we think about concern for AI systems we talk about sort of terminator I'm sure we'll touch out it but I think of Twitter as a whole as one organism mmm that is the thing that worries me the most is the artificial intelligence that is very kind of dumb and simple simple algorithms that are driving the behavior of millions of people right and and together the kind of chaos that we can achieve I mean that algorithm has incredible influence in all society Twitter our current president is on Twitter so much yeah all day all night the the I mean it's scary to think about we talked about autonomous vehicles leading to a fate to have one fatality to fatality it's scary to think about what the difference being that in the Twitter algorithm I mean I could start wars it really could and that if you think about the long term if you think about is one AI organism that is a super intelligent organism that would have no control over mm-hmm and I think it all boils down honestly to the leadership to Jack to and other folks like him making sure that he's open-minded it goes hunting that he goes does some jujitsu that he eats a meat and sometimes goes vegan right you know he did just a 10-day talk less retreat we don't talk it all for 10 days he also eats one like he does I follow some of the data that him eats once a day mm-hmm I've done that and fasts all through the weekend which I don't I don't I've never done that but I've done so I've done quite a few 24-hour you know where I eat at 7:00 p.m. I'm done eating I don't touch food until 7:00 p.m. the next day it's just water or coffee why do you do it by the way yeah I do it to shock my system I think it's good for your system you know there's been a lot of research on fasting and the effect it has on telomeres dr. Rhonda Patrick spoke pretty recently there's been quite a few things that she's written about in terms of fasting the benefits of fasting intermittent fasting is great for weight loss but just fasting itself even for several days most people seem to get some pretty decent benefits out of it so I dabble in it I also like the way it makes me feel to be a little hungry I think my brain is sharper like I refused to go on stage full eye when I wanted to stand up and I actually learned this from a Katt Williams interview he was talking about it and he's crazy as fuck but he's hilarious and he's one of the greats in my opinion and he was in the back of a limo and he was talking about how he prepares for a show that he has his music that he listens to pre-show music is like a music list and then he have a drink no food won't eat because it slows you down I was like the slow you down but sometimes you don't even think of it it's not like a rule so you just man I'm hungry I'll just eat I would way around there cuz I can go through a couple of shows I used to think I used to have this fault the idea that if I didn't eat I would be exhausted to do things but then I workout fasted every morning every morning when I when I get my morning workout in and whatever the fuck it is it's usually hard I'm always fasted you could do a lot it's you're not it's not at your best like if I was gonna do jujitsu I don't do jujitsu fasted I would I would eat some fruit that's an interesting one because that was the transformational thing for me I used to do powerlifting you see like five times a day six times day whatever more like Ct Fletcher style yeah see how big he was yeah back on the grill he's only maybe like my height or half inch taller so I said he was 320 pounds nobody said 315 fuck he was so big yeah you're saying it like had trouble the thing is when you get that big and I wasn't that big but it's like hard to move oh yeah it's like not healthy if you see the image of him from yesterday I didn't see the image the way he when he Jamie put up a photograph of him at 315 pounds next to him at like two ish 200 dishes like it's it's incredible how big he was I mean everything with his like his arms were my legs and they were just coming out of his shoulders so that was a big moment for me areas there's the pictures how big he was when he was a world champion I mean just insanely huge Wow yeah so when you started training in jiu-jitsu you look up in the blonde on the right dude he's 50 look at that huh all natural - all natural at 50 crazy some fucking genetics son that's some good words oh yeah obsessive not just hard work I mean you have a fucking maniac but the fact that his body holds up like that at 50 is incredible yeah he's an inspiration well I got for me switching from that to jujitsu I thought there's no way cuz I trained hard I train twice a day jiu-jitsu for a while and are you doing two rolls a day were you doing like technique and drills one at one time I was I said I'm Russian I'll just drill so hard I'm upset no no no no Russian drilling let me explain to you something no chemical okay what do you want explain to me I'm trying to explain to you the difference in Russian and American America is in wrestling and a lot of in a lot of combat sports is like heart and guts and hard work mm-hmm / and Russian is certainly in wrestling his technique is drilling they put a lot more hours than Americans do at less than 100 percent effort so like really drilling they're really getting that right like I love that in fact one of the problems is I haven't been able to really ever found I was always the last one to get bored really oh you gotta find a good drilling partner like an obsessed one yeah a shout out to Sarah block a Juke judo lady as a black belt in jujitsu as well that was willing to put up with like hundreds or thousands of throws that we each did hmmm so like that that obsessive - yeah I love that kind of stuff because I think that's where you get better yeah that's where I so not everybody believes that people some people believe especially gg it's like you can't really get timing from drilling I believe you can get everything from drilling oh the timing the the because is long the other part it's not just a Mohs drilling it's your mind is in it your brain should be exhausted by the end of it too because you're visualizing the whole thing you're like going through you're imagining how your opponent would it's really strengthening your imagination while you're also doing that Charlie I couldn't agree more yeah III firmly believe you can get better way better drilling and when I went from I think blue belt to purple I did like the most drilling that I ever did ever and that's when I grew the most that's when my technique got way better that was also when I became friends with Eddie Bravo and Eddie Bravo is a huge driller huge ocean rills man they drill like crazy and they do a lot of live drills and they do a lot of pathway drills where they'll do like a whole series of movements and then escape and then the reversal and they're like these are long pathways so that when you're actually in a scrap and you're rowing you you recognize it like okay here it is I'm passing the guard I move it to here and now he's countering me but I'm setting up this and these pathway drills there's it's so critical because it comes up over and over and over again when you're actually live rolling you know you feel it you feel like oh I've been here before I know this is I'd be curious actually to hear I don't think I've ever heard you talk about how your game is my game changed significantly from white belt to Bluebell to proto vault it started to solidify but I'd be curious to hear like what how did you game change since you met Eddie it gave me in jujitsu but my most of my game came from Eddie like 99 point something percent of it almost all of it in John Jacques those two so it's like I was a blue belt before I was friends with anybody I was terrible like what guard do you prefer for example well I do rubber guard I'm very flexible so rubber guard is no issue with me and I think it's incredibly effective I think if you're good at it and you know you get stuck under a guy like what is it named Jeremiah Vance is uh Eddie's one of Eddie's black belts who's a murderer from his back his rubber guard is insane it's insane Eddie's rubber guards insane I mean he you know obviously tapped oily Gracie has a ridiculous guard caught him in a triangle but but there's a lot of people that understand now a lot of people that know how to do it it's um it's a real art form and the thing about it versus other guards is when you're in a position like Mission Control and you claim you know Vinny Magalhaes is phenomenal at it I mean he what's that video yeah watch it this is Jeremiah Jeremiah Vance is one of Eddie's best we'll get this from the bottom BAM he does that all the time triangle from the bottom off from upper guard that guy's wrapped up that's what that's out cold he does this all the time he's one of Eddie's best rubber guard assassins and if you watch his technique in his fucking sensational he also has great leg locks too but the thing is that you know when he'll attack from his legs and he'll tap people with a leg lock but if they escape sometimes they'll escape and this distance in deep shit right here but now he's gonna take his back but if they escape oftentimes he's on the bottom and when you're on top em it's one of the worst places in the world to be his guard is fucking incredible and it's because of that see that grip see how he's holding the rubber guard in position that's a control mission confirm mission control mission control from a guy like Jeremiah is fucking ruthless because he has his arm and his legs that's controlling your neck in your posture it's just and then he's going to a go-go here and he's phenomenal with this - he's gonna get him in a gogoplata or normal Plata I was gonna flip him over and now he's attacking the leg like it's just constant and he ever ends this kind of system well he invented the initial stage of like setting up mission control and don't this guy he's getting fucked up oh my god that's horrible but Eddy invented a series of pathways from Mission Control to set up various techniques arm bars triangles all these different things but there had been people that had toyed with doing hi garlic Nino Schembri he did a lot of like like rubber guard ask stuff there was a lot of things that people did but Eddy has his own pathway in his own system and then there's a lot of guys that branched off from that system like Jeremiah like Vinny Magalhaes that have their own way that they prefer to set various techniques up to but it's really good about that if you have the flexibility is that your when you're on the bottom it's not only is it not a bad place to be but you could put some in some real trouble when you have your ability you're holding on to your ankle and using your leg which is the strongest fucking limb in your body right pulling down on someone with your leg clamping down with your arm and then you get your other leg involved good luck yet know that good luck it fucking sucks man you have control but you're also able to move at the same time exactly really does anybody ever puts you in Mission Control before no I haven't competed or against many but even in like someone in class like show it to lower ranks have yeah once you feel it you go oh shit I remember it being you know when somebody does a nice move on you especially like a lower rank your first reaction is like oh this would never legs you're annoyed yes it's it's the natural process of the ego course getting rid of you know you see something new and you're like yeah this is stupid if I next time it won't work but then you start to understand a little more I remember it being really powerful controlling position it's powerful and if you have a good offensive attack from there it's powerful as well so there's their transitions especially a guy like Jeremiah who's really flexible you know he can pull off go-go plotters and all sorts of other things local Plata's it's another one that they do is one that you push with your other foot on the heel it's so nasty you're holding the back of the foot across the back of the neck and so your shin is underneath someone's throat and then you're pushing that shin with your other heel while you're squeezing with your arm it's ruthless yeah is ruthless you know and they do a gable grip around the head when they do this as well sometimes too so it's just a fucking awful place to be so it's not as good as being on top right if you have a crushing top game that's the best if you can get to that position but you can't always get to that position so there's guys like Jeremiah that even from the bottom their horrific dangers are yes dangerous is from the top for most people I do you find just when you trained back in the day and you still train do you spend more time on bottom or top you always should start I feel like you should always start on the bottom earn the top position this is something that Eddie always brought up too because you know if you like to like it's fun to be on top so a lot of times it's like this mad scramble to see who could force who onto their back right because when you're on top you can control them you can pressure them you know you play that strongman jiu-jitsu but the problem is the strongman is reduced so I'm only 200 pounds I'm not a big guy like so if you go to the real big guy like I'm rolling with a 240 pound guy I'm not gonna get to that spot yeah like I better have a good guard otherwise I can't do anything right when someone's bigger than you and stronger than you you mean that's what hoist crazy basically proved to the world like as long as you have technique it doesn't matter where you are but if you only have top game which a lot of people do a lot of people only have top game you know you're kind of fucked if you wind up on your back we see that a lot with wrestlers in MMA as wrestlers they can get on top of you and they'll fuck you up they'll strangle you there take your back they'll beat you up from the mount but they don't have nearly the same game when they're on their back and then this guy's like Luke Rockhold it's like an expert at keeping you on your back he's when he's one of those guys when he gets on top of you you're fucked he's got a horrible top game I mean horrible I'm sense of if you're his opponent he's gonna beat the fuck out of you before he strangles you his top game is insane yeah I hate the feeling some people make you just feel the weight no make you suffer for everything you do on bottom yo so people that are able to do that truly humbling yeah wrestlers in particular wrestlers are so good you see that Jordan burrows Ben Askren match last night fuck incredible how good is that guy Jordan Baz sure as one I mean do that to a guy like Ben Askren I mean it shows you Ben isn't competed I think in nine years room but Ben is one of the greatest I mean I'm a huge fan of his wrestling it's not interesting I think that is like the worst matchup for an Oscar and I think because you're taking one of the most creative wrestlers ever in Ben Askren I don't want to over over overstate it but he as incredibly creative one of the great pinning wrestlers so he pins people he like confuses them and pins them incredibly well and you you put him against basically a freak blast double like the greatest double leg takedown maybe of all time there's like somebody put a clip up that said is this it so when you put a clip oh shit he went off the fucking mat into the crowd that's pretty that was like best part is that he defended a takedown that was the best part but that's crazy man that they they have such a drop-off with these guys like you shouldn't really have a platform like that where a guy can fall off into the crowd that seems so stupid it rarely happens what the fuck are you talking about it just happened rarely happens they rarely have these it sure this is argument that's a terrible thing have that shit flat on the ground that is so dumb I can't even believe they did I think this whole match should be contested doesn't count well I don't I don't you know I think look that's stupid that's not smart to have a guy who's a fucking powerhouse of a blast double hitting you and sending you flying it that's crazy that is crazy that they didn't have anything in place to stop that that's the reason why wrestling takes place on the ground you fucking assholes yeah why are you having people wrestle on a platform that's a show so the show you can have a show where thumbs of words on the ground it's called basketball yeah yeah it's on the ground you know it was worrying because Vanessa has an MMA fighter and yeah right there right there it could have torn his Lee up Nia part easily well the silver lining is that he's okay yeah the silver lining and and we got to see that you know it's interesting Jordan Burroughs had on his Instagram there's levels to this you know they're raising his hand up and looks like that's what we got to see cuz Ben is a phenomenal wrestler but you're right he hasn't competed in a long time he's not necessarily at the level that he was back then even though he's incredible for MMA standards it's good to see like it's good it's good to see without with boxing it's good to see that with anything like when Floyd Mayweather fought Conor I think was good to see that that there are really levels to this and the interesting thing about journey are ours I he's so good that he's probably gonna stay out of MMA that's so crazy but there are here's some here's some clips of it oh yeah we can't show it to to you people but uh who put this on flow wrestling flow wrestling put this on I wonder if people are pirating it online or if they they put it online if they're allowing you know they well people are pirating it yeah okay yeah good luck stopping that right well I think people should support flow wrestling know that they do have like a I'm a member are you oh look at this look at this God he's good yeah man so we're watching this ladies and gentlemen who were just listening it's probably boring as fuck for you but Jordan burrows is one of the best wrestlers really American champion three-time world champion yeah tragically not try it lost in the previous Olympics and he's back at it again I wonder if he's ever considered him a man no you know there was some talk about but I wonder if we ever really I think at this point he's he is basically a no but there are a few terrifying people especially in the Russian side that I that I think the heavyweight division and I'm and UFC should let you should be really worried I don't know if you heard about the the Russian tank the 22 year old from Dagestan no who's this guy as a wrestler the wrestler he's gonna fight MMA no he's a he will after 2020 is what his expectation is for now he's probably going to be the greatest wrestler of all time really him against Kyle Snyder those two heavyweights as American as American another guy right here 20 the tank of dagestan how do you say his name it says dude alive so alive Abdul Rashid settle I of 22 years old was she sohow Schneider you could do Karl Schneider versus what a great name Abdul Rashid sat alive for the life that was Russian Schneider is 23 years old and he's another incredible person who'll do MMA and that competition between Schneider I mean this is look at the look look at the look at the thickness these guys are monsters and they're not just how much these guys were I ninety seven kilograms what is that to 220 yes yeah to 2300 to 215 but they cut for it right runs just under heavy weight do you think they would compete at 205 if they're gonna fight in MMA these are heavy weights because there might be in the way these are still boys Oh 22 right right they still haven't gotten the full like yeah I wonder that about UFC fighters that are thickening up as they get older I wonder how many of them are damaging their body by cutting weight yeah that's a thick fella so right now we're just seeing mostly stalemate and that's from the American guy and yeah is it a highlight reel of his or something that we yeah there is but he is pretty young he's uh I think he's a he's an Olympic champion and he goes from the whole line of the sight ear brothers and the the all the Dagestani wrestlers there are so many good fighters that are coming out of Dagestan right now and all technicians yeah it's incredible it's it's incredible what ever is it styles to like Xabi likes a beat style very very different then a wrestling heavy style look at this guy Matt Jesus Christ oh my god what a scramble so this is Abdul rush I eat Rasheed Abdul Rashid Khan said alive that's no don't tell me how to say it I'll figure it out I don't know Dora she'd do her she'd said alive so alive and you know what the beauty there's a poetic because yeah there's a poetic nature to the two these guys I mean they're just that could be really I mean there are simple good people mm-hmm right there they're pretty religious and they just kind of they don't even believe in Fame they just believe in excellence well you know that was sort of evident and the the mindset behind them was sort of evident at the end of that fight with Conor where they went crazy and he jumped into the crowd it's like he's not playing games if he's not he's not doing this for Instagram likes or for you know this is really he takes trash-talking all that stuff very seriously this is all about honor for him I think that was kind of upsetting because true but but don't do that yeah and do that and also respect I'd hate to say but I think there's a certain ethic and honor to the way Conor McGregor carries himself to all that trash talk if you look at the end of the fights he's very kind he's very kind and respectful in defeat and when they guess it's a different culture you compare the Dagestani versus Irish culture is just a different culture and you have to respect that I think khabib to be honest disrespected Conor's culture as much as kind of disrespect if he be he I get were you saying but I mean when he was done with the fight he didn't keep attacking Conor it was people in the audience who were talking shit there were training partners and motion for that's and he would he had heard that for weeks and he was he was done for months he was done he was like fuck you I beat his ass I'm gonna beat your ass and he just said I'm not playing games and he jumped into the fucking crowd I think security could have been handled far better and will be in the future to prevent things like that from happening where people just jumped into the cage and you know I but I I hate seeing that shit but I but I appreciate where he's coming from I mean that's who the fuck that guy is man that's one of the reasons why he's so good is he does have that mindset it's one of the reasons meant and one of the reasons why he's so relentless like he's not playing games yeah he is who he is what you see is what you get and what you get is a killer and he's there to smash I would have loved to see Conor McGregor vs. could be could be before the mayweather fight like before Conor mmm gotten I think the money makes you less hungry oh for sure and dude I ain't hungry at all it's got a hundred million dollars but I think he still loves to compete but there's no hunger anymore again no hunger I mean he might be hungry for success but he's there's no desperation yeah I don't know if that's I know what you're saying like he has a lot to lose now - it's a different thing he enters into a fight with a hundred million dollars in the bank it's a very different experience and entering into the fight and with 1 million and hoping that you could make 3 more tonight and you know like many I'm sure fights that he's had in the past it's a different world but once whatever he wants forever I mean once a fighter though I was a fighter I mean that there is an element there that he still wants glory I believe still only 30 yeah right you still do it yeah I mean he's I think how old's Conor it the most he's like 32 or some shit 30 yeah he's young man to be set for the rest of your life at 30 is kind of fucking bananas and I don't think he's at its peak as a fighter so if he just decides who gives a fuck about the money I'm just I'm here to leave a legacy and I'm gonna I'm gonna just train like a fucking demon and he kicks aside all of the bad influences and all the distractions in his life and just focuses on training me he's a motherfucker man I mean you saw what he did to Aldo saw what he did to Chad Mendes saw what he did to Dustin Poirier I mean he is a bad motherfucker period I know you're gonna shut this down as most fans do but I if he drops everything and goes to like Siberia to Train I would love to see him and could be - well there's nothing but that's my friend Holland's mollenkamp and Connor sparring just fucking around powerful on it logo in the background so I could goddamn on it yeah I mean he's always gonna have a problem with kabhi kabhi be wrestling is so high level it's so different he smothers you in a way that you think you have good takedown defense until you run into that motherfucker and he just gets a hold of everyone he does it to everyone was it with your Michael Johnson or Edson Barboza no matter how good your takedown defense looked in the past and the Barbossa fight it was just basically just weighted towards him weighted through the fucking the fury of leg kicks and punches and just clamp drag smash and that's what he does to everybody man yeah the real thing about a guy like him would be seeing a guy like him against a guy like Jordan burrows like could he do that too guy who was a spectacular wrestler as well then it becomes mean his striking which has gotten very high-level he's very dangerous striking so he dropped Connor I mean he can he can fuck people up he stopped there was some he's he stopped a few people strikes he's dangerous he's dangerous enough on the feet that you would have to know how much how many really high level grapplers also have like striking that can stand with them because if he decided to keep it up he'd have an advantage there until they you know got good at it him versus Ben Askren would be very interesting well he would have an advantage in striking in in wrestling I don't know no they're very defensive big fella two are the same way no oh he's 55 Oscar in 70 okay okay so I asked him could probably make 55 if you tortured him he's got a dad bod though and he's pretty rude no he's proud dad he's proud of his body I think he was that way in college - he was never he's never like Brock Lesnar no and he was super technical any strong as hell though Kourtney to everybody everybody that rolls of them says he's fucking ridiculously strong you are sometimes say artificial life instead of artificial intelligence yeah because I think that it's a life form it's a stupid way to look at it as curious to think about like how do you think about artificial like what do you picture I picture human beings being like electronic caterpillars that are building a cocoon that they have no real knowledge of our understanding and through this and new life forms gonna emerge a life form that doesn't need cells and mating with x and y chromosomes doesn't need any of that shit it exists purely in software and in hardware and in ones and zeros and that this is a new form of life and this is when the inevitable rise of a sentient being the inevitable I mean I think if we don't get hit with an asteroid within a thousand years or whatever the number the time frame is someone is going to figure out how to thing that just walks around and does whatever it wants and lives like a person that's not outside the realm of possibility and I think that if that does happen that's artificial life and this is the new life and it's probably gonna be better than what we are I mean well we are as basically if you go back and look about you know three hundred thousand four hundred thousand years ago when we were some Australia Pittacus type creature how many of them would ever look at the future and go just I hope I never get a Tesla the last thing I want is a fucking phone last thing I want it's air conditioning and television the last thing I want is to be able to talk in a language that other people can understand and to be able to call people on the phone fuck all that man I like living out here running from Jaguars and shit and constantly getting jacked by bears no no I wouldn't think that way and I think if something comes out of us and makes us obsolete and but it's it's missing all the things that suck about people I mean it won't be good it wasn't personal you know our and our things suck about people hate war violence thievery people stealing things from people people robbing people the thing that those dark parts of human nature I think are the suffering injustice I think all of that is necessary for us to discover the better angels I don't think you can certainly we can talk let's talk about Saints and creating artificial life but I think even those life-forms even those systems need to have the darker parts but why is that is that because of our own biological limitations in the fact that we exist in this world of animals where animals are eating other animals and running there's always you always have to prepare for evil you have to prepare for intruders you have to prepare for you know predators and this is essentially like this mechanism is there to ensure that things don't get sloppy things continue to look if the Jaguars keep eating the people and the people don't figure out how to make a fucking house they get eaten and that's it or you figure out the house then you make weapons you fight off the fucking Jaguar okay great you made it you're in a city now see you had to have that Jaguar there in order to inspire you to make enough safety so that your kids can grow old enough that they can get information from all the people that did survive as well and they can accumulate all that information and create air conditioning and automobiles and guns and keep those fuckin Jaguars from eating your kids right this is this is what had to take place as a biological entity but once you surpass that and once you become this thing that doesn't need emotion doesn't need you know doesn't need conflict it doesn't need to be inspired it never gets lazy it doesn't have these things that we have built into us as a biological system like if you looked at us as wet we're operating software it's it's not good software right it's software designed for cave people and we're you know we're just trying to force it into cars and force it into cubicles but part of the problem with people and their unhappiness is that all of these human reward systems that have been set up through evolution and natural selection to have these instincts to stay alive they're no longer relevant in today's society so they become become road rage they become you know extracurricular violence it became they become depression they become all these different things that people suffer from so that's one perspective yes that basically our software through this evolutionary process was necessary to arrive at where we are but it's outdated at this point well it's necessary for us to succeed to succeed in a purely almost a Darwinist way in the sense that survived evolution especially since we're so weak I mean it's really we became this week because we got so good at protecting ourselves from all the bad things okay the other perspective is that we're actually incredibly strong and this is the best that the universe can create actually we're at the height this is where the height of creation there's there's a beauty in this tension in this dance between good and evil between like happiness and depression life and death and that through that struggle that's not just a useful tool to get us from Jaguars to cities but that is the beautiful thing that that that is like what the universe was built for her mmm that that that is the height like our current the the the evolution and the creation that results from it is the height of creation and is is the end the way things operate is not something that's far from optimal it's something that's not something that sucks but it is a very is very good very optimal and hard to beat in the sense that that like for example mortality right I is death important for creation for for is that important for us human beings for life for us as a society it's important for us to die like if you could live forever would you live forever well I think miss out on the possibility that there is something well I had this conversation with Ct Fletcher yesterday because you know he survived a heart transplant a year ago you're in two days ago I think it's what do you think I think I think mortality is essential for everything but I think the end we need the end to be there right but do you think that we need the end to be there for the overall health of the human race or the world of the all the organisms on earth or do you think we needed to be there because there's something else do you think there's something else that happens to you when your body stops existing do you think your consciousness transcends this this dimension I think I think I'm not smart enough to even think about that that's a great answer so I think everybody on earth has the exact same answer they're being honest so you talk about atheism and so I used to think a theism means what I just said no so right but it's more we know so little so the only thing I know is that the finiteness of life is the broad wedge is a school that train it has this poster that at the opening which is a hunter s Thompson quote which is a about skidding into death sideways noting one's a good one now for all moments of beauty many souls must be trampled like that that's a fucking great quote god I love that guy yeah so basically more beauty you have to have suffering I I do not disagree with you I do not disagree with any of the things you said and I think there's always a possibility that human beings are the most advanced life-form that's ever existed in the cosmos there's always that that has to be an option if we are here right if we can't see any others out there and even though you know there's the Fermi paradox and there's all this contemplation that if they do exist like maybe they can't physically get to us or maybe they're on a similar timeline to us and they're also it's also possible as crazy as it might sound that this is as good as it's ever gotten anywhere in the world or anywhere in the universe rather that human beings right now in 2019 are as good as the whole universe has ever produced we're just some freak luck accident and everybody else is throwing shit at each other right there's 15 armed caterpillar people that live on some other fucking planet they just toss their own shit at each other and they never get any they never get any work done but we might be that but even if that's true even if this beauty that we perceive even if that this beauty requires evil to battle and requires seemingly insurmountable obstacles you have to overcome and then through this you see achieve duty that beauty is in the eye of the beholder for sure objectively the universe doesn't give a fuck if rocky beats Apollo Creed in the second movie it doesn't give a fuck it's nonsense everything's nonsense to even you look at the giant ass picture what what beauty is it if the sun's gonna burn out in five billion years what beauty is that if there could be a hypernova next door that just cooks us oh so I let's like the book sapiens yeah that basically we've all one of the things we've created here is we've imagined ideas that we all share the ideas of beauty ideas of truth ideas of fairness we've all created together and there's it doesn't exist outside of us as a society and no it only exists to us yeah to us it does exist and this is where I think the beauty of being a person truly lies it lies in us our appreciation of us we appreciate people in a profound way look we were talking about Hendrix I don't know how many hours of Hendrix have ever listened to or Richard Pryor how many hours of Richard Pryor I watched and how much that affected me as a kid watching live in the Sunset Strip that's what got me to do in stand-up comedy we affect each other a CT Fletcher he was on the podcast yesterday who's just incredibly inspirational guy he watches videos you want to lift the fucking world and throw it into space you know I mean he's he's so powerful we appreciate each other we appreciate people so all those things you're saying a real like for us they're real for us my concern is not that my concern is that we are outdated my concern is not that there's not beauty in what we are i'm a i-i-i-i have a big appreciator of this life I appreciate human beings in this life and human beings they're their contributions and as I get older like particularly like over the last few years I start doing a lot of international travel I fucking appreciate the shit of all these people that are living in this different way with weird language and shit and weird smelling foods and I like to think like what would it be like if I grew up here like these are just people but they're in this weird sort of mode you know I think we're insanely lucky that we have this enthusiasm for each other that we have this into like for your work man I have this deep enthusiasm for what you do I'm fascinated by it I love being able to talk to you and pick your mind about like you're out there coding these fucking vehicles that are driving themselves artificial life on wheels I don't think any other animal appreciates each other the way people do I mean I might be wrong people do right yeah I might be wrong about dolphins and whales maybe they love each other just as much as we do just in a different way but what where does AI fit into that so you're worried I'm worried that we are Australia Pittacus and AI is gonna come along and make us look stupid the only reason why straight to pick Australia Pittacus would be cool today is if we found a gang of them on an island somewhere really holy shit they survived they never evolved during this island just cracking coconuts and just eatin fish whatever they can catch that would be amazing but every undocumented or undiscovered uncontacted tribe throughout homo sapiens all of them so it's like you know so what do you picture like as we have to look at Boston Dynamics robots because you said walking around yeah I'd like to get to a sense of how you think about and maybe I can talk about to where the technology is of what that artificial intelligence looks like in 20 years in 30 years that will surprise you so you have a sense that it has a human-like form no I have a sense that it's going to take on the form the same way the automobile has if you go back and look at like CT has a CT Fletcher has a beautiful old patinaed pickup truck what he said was from like 58 or some shit 60 anyway old ass cool heavy metal you know those sweeping round curves those old-school pickup trucks head now look at that and look at the Tesla Roadster why in the fuck happened when the fuck happened I'll tell you what happened they got better and better and better at it they figured out the most effective shape if you want a motherfucker to move that that that little car have you seen that video where they have the Tesla Roadster in a drag race or in a race against a Nissan GTR it's a simulated video but it's based on the actual horsepower of each car I don't know if you ever driven a Nissan GTR but it is a fucking insane car it's insane this is a CGI version of what it would look like if these two cars raced against each other so the car on the the Nissan GTR do it from the beginning there goes look how fast this thing pulls away the Nissan GTR is fucking insanely fast man insanely fast but this Tesla is so on another level it's so in the future that it's sending me close as the video gets further and further you see how ridiculous it is it's essentially lapping that car it's gonna go looking far away this bye see ya so that you're saying the human races will be the Nissan here exactly and we're not gonna be the Nissan we're gonna be CT Fletcher's pickup truck this this is the future there's not gonna be any limitations in terms of bipedal form or wings or not having wings if you can walk on I mean there's not gonna be any of that shit there's the M and we might have a propulsion system or it might it's not gonna be us and they might they might design some sort of organic propulsion system like the way squid have and shit who the fuck knows so you could also operate in the space of language and ideas so for example I don't know if you're familiar with you know open AI it's a company they they created a system called GPT - which does language modeling this is something in machine learning where you basically unsupervised let the system just read a bunch of text and it learns to generate new text and they've created the system called GPT - that is able to generate very realistic text very realistic sounding text not sounding but when you read it it makes it seems like a person he seems like a person and the question there is it raised a really interesting question so talking about AI existing in our world it paints a picture of a world in five ten years plus where most of the text on the internet is generated by AI and it's very difficult to know who's real and who's not yeah and one of the interesting things I'd be curious from your perspective to get what your thoughts are what opening I did is they didn't release the code for the full system they only released a much weaker version of it publicly so they only demonstrated it and so they felt that it was their responsibility to hold back mmm prior to that date everybody in the community including them had open sourced everything but they felt that now at this point part of it was for publicity they wanted to raise the question is when do we hold back on these systems when they're so strong when they're so good at generating text for example in this case or at deep fakes at generating fake Joe Rogan faces Jamie just did one they're like Donald Trump's head yeah it's crazy and this is something that Jamie can do he's not even a video editor yeah we were talking about it before the show we could go crazy with it if you want it it is one of those things where you go where is this going to be in five years because five years ago we didn't have anything like this five years ago was a joke right exactly and then now it's still in the gray area between joke and something that could be at scale transform the way we communicate do you ever go to Kyle Dunnigan Instagram page of course one of the best-looking that's me it's killing me this is a knife it looks so much like I'm really talking and it looks like what I would look like if I was fat and it could have you know of course that's really good and it could be improved significantly and yes make you say anything so there's a lot of variants of this yeah we can take like for example a full disclosure I downloaded your fate the entire like we have a data side of your face I'm sure all their hackers do is how dare you yeah so for this exact purpose I mean if I'm thinking like this and I'm very busy then then there's other people doing exactly so sure because you happen your podcast happens to be one of the biggest data sets in the world of people talking in really high quality audio with high quality 1080p for most for a few hundred episodes of people's faces the lighting can be better for making it and the mic gets in a blocks part of your face that's right so the best guests are the ones where they keep the mic alone the deep fake stuff I've been using removes microphone within about a thousand iterations it does it instantly it gets the route gets rid of it paints over the face Wow yeah yeah so so you could basically make Joerg and say anything yeah I think this is just one step before they finagle us into having a nuclear war against each other so they could take over the earth what they're gonna do is they're gonna design artificial intelligence that survives off of nuclear waste and so then they encourage these stupid assholes to go into a war with North Korea and Russia and we blow each other up but we leave behind all this precious radioactive material that they use to then fashion their new world and we come a thousand years from now and it's just fucking beautiful and pristine with the artificial life everywhere no more no more biological it was too messy are you saying the current president is artificial life don't say that okay what you thought with that is you're saying war no I don't think so he's there's imagine if they did do that they would have to started with him in the 70s I mean he's been around for a long time and talked about being president for a long time maybe electronics have been playing the long game and they got him to the position I use all this scale of time it's not really long game 70s would you know about that internet research agency right you know about that that's the russian company that they're responsible for all these different facebook pages where they would make people fight against each other it was really it's really kind of interesting sam harris had a podcast on it with renee how do i serenader esta reneedar esta and then she came on our podcast and talked about it as well and they were they were pitting these people against each other like they would have a Pro Texas secession rally and directly across the street from a pro Muslim rally and they would do it on purpose yeah and they would have these people meet there and get angry at each other and they would they would pretend to be a black lives matter page it would pretend to be a white southern pride page and they were just trying to make people angry at people now that's human driven manipulation yeah now imagine this is my biggest worry of a is what jack is working on is the algorithm driven manipulation of people unintentional yes trying to do good but like those people Jack needs to do some jujitsu today City it needs to be some open-minded you know like really understand society transparency to where they can talk to us is to the people in general how they're thinking about managing these conversations because you talked about these groups very small number of Russians are able to control very large amounts of people's opinions and the arguments yeah an algorithm can do that 10x I mean oh yeah more and more of us will go on Twitter and Facebook and yes for sure yeah for sure I think it's coming I think once people figure out how to anit that effectively and really create like an army of fake bots that will assume stances on a variety of different issues and just argue into infinity we're not gonna know we're not gonna know who's real and who's not well it'll change the nature of our communication online I think it might it might have effects this is this is the problem the future it's hard to predict the future it might have affects where we'll stop taking in anything online seriously yeah and we might get retract back to communicating in person more I mean there there could be effects that we're not anticipating totally there might be some some ways in virtual reality we can authenticate our identity better mm-hmm so it'll change the nature of communication I think with the more the more you can generate fake text then the more they will distrust the information online and the way that change the society is totally an open question we we don't know but your what are your thoughts about the open AI do you think they should release or hold back on it because this is we're talking about AI so artificial life there's stuff you're concerned about some company will create it mmm the question is what does the responsibility of that short video what it looks like when this type of small paragraph in here hit a button it says how open AI writes what was it say what'd it say Jamie commencing news stories okay so this already cost the UK economy at least eighty billion since and then many industry so they just it just fills in those things yeah so basically you give it you start a text oh we can say Joe Rogan experience is the greatest podcast ever and then let it finish the rest you know start explaining stuff about why it's the greatest podcast is it accurate oh wow look at this it says a move that threatens to push many of our most talented young brains out of the country not to campuses in the developing world this is a particularly costly blow research by Oxford University warns that the UK would have to spend nearly 11 1 trillion on post brexit infrastructure that's crazy that that's all done by an AI yeah that's like spelling this out in this very convincing argument the thing is the a the way actually works algorithmic is fascinating because the generate is generating it one character at a time it has as far you know you don't want to discriminate against AI but as far as we understand it doesn't have any understanding of well still of what it's doing there any ideas it's expressing it's simply stealing idea it's like the largest-scale plagiarize er of all time right it's basically just pulling out ideas from elsewhere in an automated way and the question is you could argue us humans are exactly that we're just really good plagiarize errs of what our parents taught us of what our previous so on yeah we aren't for sure yeah so the question is whether you hold that back their decision was to say let's hold it let's not release it that scares me do not release it yeah yeah you know why it scares me it scares me that they would think that that's like this mindset that they they sense the inevitable the inevitable meaning that someone's going to come along with a version of this it's going to be used for evil that it bothers them that much that seems so it seems almost irresponsible for the technology to prevail for the technology to to continue to be more and more powerful yeah they're scared of it there's getting out right yeah that scares the shit out of me like if they're scared of it they're the people that make it and they're they are called open AI me this is the idea behind the group where everybody kind of agrees that you're going to use the brightest minds and have this open source everybody can understand it and everybody work at it and you don't miss out on any genius contributions and they're like no no no no more and they're obviously their system currently it's not that dangerous there's nothing dangerous well not yes not that dangerous but that if you just saw that that it can do that but if you think through like what that would actually create I mean it's possible it'll be dangerous but it's not the point is they're doing it they try to do it early run to raise the question what do we do here because yeah what do we do because they're directly going to be able to improve this now like if they're if we can generate basically ten times more content of your face saying a bunch of stuff what is that what do we do with that if a Jamie all of a sudden on the side develops a much better generator and has your face doesn't offshoot podcast essentially fake Joe Rogan experience hmm and what do we do to see release that you know does he because now we can have basically generate content and a much larger scale that will just be completely fake well I think what they're worried about is not just generating content that's fake they're worried about manipulation of opinion right right if they have all these people are like that that little sentence that led to that enormous paragraph in that video was just a sentence that showed a certain amount of outrage and then it led in Phil let the AI fill in the blanks you could do that with fucking anything like you could just set those things loose if they're that good and that convincing and they're that logical man this is this is not real I'll just mention Pierrot all creates AI creates fake ben shapiro touch in sports hello there this is a fake ben shapiro with this technology they can make me say anything such as for example I love socialism health care is a right not just a privilege it ending guns will solve crime facts care about your feelings I support Bernie Sanders okay yeah yeah it's crude but it's crude but it's on the way yeah it's on the way it's all in the way and we have to this is the time to talk about it think about it one of the funny things about Kyle Dunnigan Instagram is that it's obviously fake that's one of the funny things about it it's like South Park's animation it's like the animation sucks that's half the reason why it's so funny because they're just like these circles you know these weird-looking creature things the movement when the canadians when their heads pile off at the top and and my hope is this kind of technology will ultimately just be used for memes almost something that's gonna get Wars Putin's gonna be he's gonna be banging mother Teresa on the White House desk in the video and we're gonna be outraged we're gonna go to war over this shit you had a Andrew yang heard like a million people asked me to talk about ubi mmm-hmm so I are you still supporter of uvea I think we're probably going to have to do something if I the only argument against you VI in my eyes is human nature the idea that we could possibly take all these people that have no idea what the next meals coming from and eliminate that and always have a place to stay and then from there on you're on your own but that's what universal basic income essentially covers covers food enough for food alright you're not gonna starve to death you're not gonna be rich it's not like you could just live high on the hog but you gotta wonder what the fuck the world looks like when we lose millions and millions and millions of jobs almost instantly due to automation yeah it's a it's a really interesting question especially with Andrew Ang's position so there's a lot of economics questions on ubi I think the spirit of it just like I agree with you we have to do something yeah the economics seem kind of questionable right yeah it's $1,000 a month is that what it is I thought for him it's $1,000 $1,000 a month for 300 million people it's difficult to talk to everybody know cuz the way I heard him explain it everybody routine if you're already getting some sort of welfare you wouldn't get that thousand you to get like the difference of the thousand so if you're ready taking money in some way you just got like an extra two hundred bucks okay something like that so that thousand gets factored in so if you are wealthy you get it too though and you can opt out alright that was the idea yeah so it's it's like like everything else it's super messy so what is the right what is the right amount and how do we pay for it and ultimately the problem is helping people giving them financial grounding to find meaningful employment or just meaning in their life and you know the main thing of a job isn't just the money it's finding meaning right and purpose and the right derive your identity from work I mean that's maybe that's one of the downsides of us human that the biology is we kind of crave that meaning mmm-hmm and the question I he has a lot of other ideas around besides just the EBI but ubi by itself does not simply provide that meaning and and that's a really difficult question of what do we do next what kind of retraining what kind how do we help people educate themselves over their life right that's the real question yeah that's the and and the any other balances I mean underlying all of this so that one of the things that disagree with it and Andrew yang on is the the fear-mongering which I think in this culture we have you have to do as a presidential candidate that might be part of the game but the the fear-mongering of saying that we should really be afraid of automation that automation is going to take a lot of jobs and from my understanding the technology from everything I see that is not going to be as drastic or as fast as as he says and but then how much do you think he's exaggerating by in your estimation well he doesn't I mean not even exaggerating what would how how much do you differ on his prognosis I think I think he doesn't really provide significant like this specific prognosis because nobody knows it's a there's a lot of uncertainty more about the spirit of the the language used I think a I will it technology AI and automation will do a lot of good the question is it's it's a much deeper question about our society of that balances capitalism versus socialism and nobody I don't think if you're honest it capitalism is not bad socialism is not bad you have to grab ideas from each you have to there you have to both reward the crazy broke entrepreneur who dreams of creating the next billion dollar startup that improves the world in some fundamental way the Elon Musk has been broke many times creating that startup and you also have to empower the people who just lost their job because there were data entry there data entry job some basic data manipulation data management that was just replaced by a piece of software so that's that's a social net that's needed and the question is how do we balance that that doesn't have to do that's not new that's not new to AI and when the the word automation is used it's really not cooked correctly attributing where the biggest changes will happen it's not AI it's simply technology of all kinds of software it's pretty digitalization of information so data entry becoming much more much more automated some basic repetitive tasks I think I think the questions there aren't about so that the enemy isn't their first all there's no enemy but it certainly isn't AI or automation because I think AI and automation will help make a help make a better world and sound like a spokesperson for AI on automations I am I am I am Anna for you bi i think i think we have to given people financial freedom to learn like lifelong learning and flexibility to find meaningful employment but like AI isn't the enemy hmm I say we're saying but what do you think ever could be done to give people meaning this this meaning thing I agree with you giving people just money enough to survive doesn't make them happy and if you look at any dystopian movie about the future Mad Max instead it's like what is it society's gone haywire and the people are like ragamuffins running through the streets and everyone's dirty and they're shooting each other and shit right and that's what we're really worried about what we're really worried about some crazy future where the rich people live and he's like protected sky Rises with helicopter circling over them and down in the bottom it's desert chaos yeah right that's what we're worried about so certainly EBI is a part of that some providing some back and some well any kind of welfare program is a part of that but also much more seriously looking at our broken education system throughout yes I mean it's just like not blaming AI or technology which are all inevitable developments which I think will make a better world but saying we need to do lifelong learning education make it a lifestyle invest in it not stupid rote learning memorization that we do it's a sort of the way mathematics and engineering and chemistry biology the sciences and even art is approached in high school and so on but looking at education is a lifelong thing finding passion and like that should be the big focus the the big investment is its investing in the knowledge and development of knowledge of young people and everybody so it's not learn to code it's just learned hmm I couldn't agree more and I also think you're always gonna have a problem with people just not doing a really good job of raising children and you know screwing them up and you know making kids there's a lot of people out there that have terrible traumatic childhoods there's just to fix that with universal basic income just to say I'm gonna give you $1,000 a month I hope you gonna be happy that's not going to fix that you know we have to figure out how to fix the whole human race you know and I think there's very little effort that's put into thinking about how to prevent so much shitty parenting and how to prevent so many kids growing up in bad neighborhoods and poverty and crime and violence and that's where a of all of our the momentum of this chaos that a lot of people carry with them into adulthood comes from it comes from things beyond their control when they're young and that is the struggle at the core of our society the country that's that's bigger than raising humans yeah raising and educating humans making and you know making a better world where people get along with each other better where it's pleasing for all of us like we were talking about earlier the thing that most of us agree on at least to a certain extent so we enjoy people we might not enjoy all of them but they're the ones we enjoy we enjoy and you really don't enjoy being alone unless you're one of them Ted Kaczynski type characters all those people that are like I'm alone are like fuck you you are fuck you you are you might like to spend some time alone you don't want to be in solitary man you don't to be alone in the forest with no one like Tom Hanks in castaway you'll go fucking crazy it's not good for you it's just not yeah people get annoying fuck yeah I'm annoyed with me right now listen to me for three hours I'm annoyed with me yeah people get annoying but we like each other we really do and the more we can figure out how to make it a better place for these people that got a shitty roll of the dice they grew up in poverty they grew up in crime they grew up with abusive parents the more we could figure out how to help them I don't know what that answer is you know I suspect if we put enough resources to it we could probably put a dent in it at least if we really start thinking about at least it would put the conversation out there like you can't pretend that this is just capitalism in this country when so many people were born like way far behind the game like way way fucked I mean if you're growing up right now and you're in West Virginia in a fucking coal coal town and everyone's on pills and it's just chaos and then crime and face tattoos and fucking get your teeth knocked out what are you going to do I don't want to hear any of that pull yourself up by your bootstraps bullshit man because if you're growing up in an environment like that you you you're so far behind and everyone around you is fucked up and there's a lot of folks out there listening to this that can relate to that if we don't do something about that if we don't do something about the the crime and the poverty and the chaos that so many people have to go through every day just to survive until we we shouldn't be looking at anything else where it was all this traveling to other countries to fuck things up and metal here and metal there we should be fixing this first yeah we're like a person who yells at someone for having a shitty lawn when our house is an array full chaos plants growing everywhere it's it's goofy we're goofy wee wee wee almost like are waking up in the middle of something that's already been in motion for hundreds of years and we're like what do we do is this the right direction we go we okay we're flying in this spaceship this spaceship earth and in the middle of our lives we're just realizing that we are now the adults and that all the adults that are running everything on this planet are not that much different than you and I not that much I mean like Elon Musk is way smarter than me but he's still human you know I mean so he's probably fucked up too so everybody's fucked up the whole world is filled these fucked up apes that are piloting the spaceship and you're waking up in the middle of thousands of years of history and no one knows if we've been doing it right along we just know that got us to this point so do we continue these same stupid fucking patterns or do we just take a step back no hey hey how should we really do this how should we do this because we yeah what do you got like 50 years left 60 years left we're just kind of like hang on to our rubles into the end we're gonna clutch our bag of gold and our bucket of diamonds is that we're gonna do we're gonna live in our mansions and fly around in our planes and I think through the decades now we've been developing a sense of empathy that allows us to understand that Elon Musk Joe Rogan and somebody in Texas somebody in Russia somebody in India all suffer the same kind of things all get lonely all get desperate all need each other and all need each other and I think technology has a role to help they're not hurt but we need to force them to first really acknowledge that we're all we're all in this together and we need to solve the basic problems of humankind as opposed to investing in sort of keeping immigrants out or the blah blah these kinds of divisive kind of ideas as opposed to just investing in education investing in infrastructure investing in the people ubi is part of that there could be other totally different solutions and I believe okay of course I'm biased but technology AI can help that could help the lonely people that's actually the passion of my life like that movie she or her that is what I so I'm really think that that would be a viable option someone have to robot that hangs out with you and talks to you all the time so just so I've been in this podcast twice and I'm I'm uh I don't deserve it but I'm deeply grateful for it okay you do deserve it you're great okay I hope to be back one day as a person who created her oh boy and we'll have that's that's been my life goal my love life dream not hard the movie right right right but I really believe in creating I dream of creating a companion a friend know and somebody you can love but does that freak you out what shouldn't you have to get a real one I don't want I don't think such a companion should replace a real one what if a robot rejects you because if you really are are cont to the robot the robots gonna go hey asshole then you shouldn't be bullshit today robot the c-word interesting yeah no I mean that this goes does the robot get to decide if he's gay yes does he yes the robot gets to decide this is what I'm saying like say if you want a companion you want a gay lover and the robots that came in I'm not gay and they like women let me turn around you are now I mean that's abuse it is that abuse no I what the fuck man I bought a robot those are kind of fun ideas but they actually get to the core of the the point that we don't want a servant in our systems we want a companion companion means the tension the mystery the the entire dance of human interaction and that means yes the robot may leave you any robots are gonna leave people left and right that's gonna be the rise that's gonna be like that's how it all ends they're gonna realize like fuck people man they're annoying maybe they'll be the end of douchebag humans that humans will start to as opposed to being rude mm-hmm will become kinder yeah well I think that's certainly possible I think that's beautiful and that's very homo centric like homo sapien centric but I think if I'm really worried about the future I'm worried about the indifference of technological innovation and the indifference to what we hold dear what we appreciate that it always seems to be moving in a more and more complex direction always like if you if you just had a look at it if you just look at look at technology just as a swarm of things that's happening it just has numbers it seems you're never gonna slow that thing down it's always gonna move in a more and more complex way and so the question is where does that go well it goes to a life form and if it does become a life form it's gonna be infinitely more intelligent than us and it won't have any use for us like all your amol you cry and you'll like be alone like god you guys are so useless it's such a shitty design you like chimps that kill each other you know like when you see chimps killing each other in the forest like oh that's terrible these chimps are so mean to each other this is like fucking people we do that too if the AI comes along goes you guys are never gonna stop war if I asked you today if I asked you today bet the history that I will let the human race survive if you can get this right if you're honest with me do you think there'll ever be a time we're human beings as you know them don't experience war you would have to say no you say okay I'll let I'll spare you let me but if you if you lie to me and say you do think that one is gonna be no war get the fuck out of here that's not true you we we know we're so crazy that we're always gonna kill each other we know that right that's just that's a part of being a person yeah today the yeah well but let me quote it araguaia who said everything is great about war except all the killing I think what that means is all the great things about society have been created if you look at the post war through war the suffering the the beauty has been created through that that Yang and yang may be essential well it is essential in biological form but why would it be essential in something that gets created and something that can innovate at a ten thousand what is it like what is the what is a rate that they think once a TA I can be sentient I can get ten thousand years of work done in a very short amount of time that's random words as Sam Harris has come up with and I'm going to talk to him about is that him is that only him what's it one night you can come up with any kind of raise yes that was Kurzweil okay as well also similar ideas but the sort of Sam Harris doesn't like a thought experiment say if a system can improve that you know in a matter of seconds then just as a thought experiment you can think about it can improve exponentially you can prove mmm you become 10,000 times more intelligent in in a matter of a day right so what does that look like the problem is we don't yet know it's like thinking about what happens after death we don't yet know how to do that and we don't yet know what better way to do what we've done here on earth you're right and he's also right right like both this again this is a very human problem right yes where you're right I mean I look I'm all in favor of technology I'm happy I think it's amazing it's a beautiful time like as a person to be able to experience all his technology it's wonderful but I also agree with him like the the indifference of the universe the indifference they're just black holes are swallowing stars no big deal just eaten up stars it doesn't give a fuck and so if you're dumb enough to turn that thing on and all of a sudden this artificial life-form that's infinitely smarter than any person that's ever lived and that's to deal with these little dumb monkey doesn't want to pull the plug pull the plug mother fucker honey plugs anymore you idiots can never figured out how to operate on air you're so stupid with your burning fossil fuels and choking up your own environment because you're all completely financially dependent upon these countries that provide you with this oil and this is how your whole system works it's all intertwined and interconnected and no one wants to move from it because you make enormous sums of money from it so nobody wants abandon it but you're choking the sky with fumes and you could have fixed that you could have fixed that they could have fixed that if everybody just abandoned fossil fuels a long time ago we probably have we were all with a Tesla doubt by now it's a flawed system but humans are way more than flawed we're fucking crazy Churchill quote about democracy yeah it's messed up but it's the best thing you know yeah I know I love it I'm not I'm agreeing with you and I'm also saying the technology doesn't give a fuck the tech not what I'm worried about is not everything that you and I agree on about I don't I'm not a dystopian person in terms of like today I'm not cynical really not I think I like people I like what I see out there in the world today I think things are changing for the better what I'm worried that technology doesn't give a fuck this way it was live is just gonna just decide it's here for its own advancement and in order to complete its protocol of constant completion of this and it's gonna become a god it's just gonna become something insanely powerful that doesn't need to worry about radiation cooking it or worry about running out of food or worry about sexual abuse when they're a child doesn't have to worry about anything so it's definitely unstoppable yeah this wave of Technology all we can do is innovators and creators engineers scientists is steer that way hopefully then estrogen while we certainly can steer we don't know we're right and that's the best we can do and those are the that's that's really the best we can do is as good people you know steer it and that's why the leadership is important that's why the the people the Jack Ilan Larry Page everybody at the Mark Zuckerberg they are defining where this wave is going yeah and I am hoping to be one of the people that does as well that's beautiful Joe of okay can I finish by reading something sure I've recently witnessed because of this Tesla work because of just the passion I've put out there about particularly automation that there has been a few people brilliant men and women engineers and leaders including Elon Musk who been sort of attacked almost personally attacked by really people critics from the sidelines so I just wanted to if I may close by reading the famous excerpt from Teddy Roosevelt yeah okay just for them it was make me feel good okay if you want to do that it's not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of Deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who airs who comes short again and again because there's no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who what the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat Joe thank you for having me on sounds like you know what the haters get to you a little bit there what was the answer love is the answer yes it is thank you for being here man I really appreciate it and thank you I'm I'm really happy you're out there thanks brother thanks we'll do this again soon yeah all right thanks man all right bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
