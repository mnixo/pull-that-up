and we're live ladies and gentlemen it's the end of the world as we know it Montana's been on fire for a month Florida has three hurricanes headed towards it and Houston is still half under water Houston sad have you been no I've just you know lie to my ex sit there and she's sending me photos and videos like her whole neighborhoods gone her and like people have to put everything outside for the insurance collectors to look at it you know so there's just everyone's house has a pile in front of it know all their stuff and this is like no looting please you know I saw that on TV yeah fuck dude it's like there's nothing stopping that from happening for months like this is the thing about like her key and Irma like they have Harvey hits Houston and then hurricane Irma they correct me if I'm wrong but I think they said that this is very unusual because hurricane Irma picked up speed in the ocean which is a really bad sign they usually pick up speed in the Gulf and the idea is that the Gulf has water that's warmer and that's what causes a I don't know shit about hurricanes I'm totally talking on my ass right I really don't understand that but I'm pretty sure that's what they're saying is that this is a very unusual storm because it actually picked up speed and picked up size and power in the ocean which means the oceans warmer so this could be a consequence of having a warmer ocean is that these fucking hurricanes could get bigger and bigger in the ocean oh and it's usually it's really unusual because you know you have like a such a big storm like the one I hate Houston that's usually once a year once every couple of years it's not twice in like a month yeah and then there's like what Jose's right behind it yeah that's craziness I think they said there's two behind it the other one formed in the Gulf next like off Mexico east of Mexico so it's just another one in a different place sitting there right now and there could be another one forming off of the Cape in Africa where they all usually form but we don't we don't get hurricanes because it's cold water is that logic behind it yeah I think that's the move you want to live in near coldwater just suck it up like a man and deal with that cold water that water is fucking coal to when you get in the water and the Pacific Ocean like hey what is this like this is weird it's crazy cold even in the middle of August it could be a hundred degrees in Malibu you're getting that water you're like holy shit this is fucking cold I've only been in it twice since I've lived right 13 years the first I remember the first week I moved out here I was like I'm going to the ocean I've run in the ocean freezing never hit it again what is all you this you're showing us Jenny please don't say that's hurricanes these are normal hurricanes these are the tropical cyclones of the 2017 Pacific hurricane season so these are cyclones that I guess have already happened this year I will assuming when I was pulling it up they were in the past like long time ago yeah I don't know these are this many had already come here you know when you look at this picture like if you look at this picture of the United States it gives you such a way better sense of what it really is because that picture like because all the Browns and the greens and because I'm not seeing cities and because it's like a perfect scale like pull back a little bit so you see it in scale with the ocean again like when you're looking at that you realize oh that shit kid shift left and right a bunch of times easy like there's way more water than there is ground like that is a fucking problem that's a giant problem we're next to an enormous chunk of blue it's so big dude I'll tell you man when I was living in that house in Malibu for a couple months on the water I rented a spot on the water that's when you realize you go oh that's a monster that's like you're living on the edge of a world that can just reach in and swallow you know freak out did you fuck yeah you know when it freaks you out is at night at night it like reveals its true self cause like in the day it looks beautiful the Sun hits it it seems so peaceful the birds are squawk Wow you see you see a CEO or maybe dolphin or a whale sometimes you see a whale people see whales out there like wow this is crazy but then at night time when the skies dark and the sea is black then you get to see what it really is like oh this is a this is a whole nother world a world of water and it's we can touch it we can go in between worlds and that world is far bigger than our world and then I start freaking out about all the shit that we're pulling out of that world like how gross are we humans where we're like just netting everything in that world and scooping it up just chop it up and stuffing it in the cans and feed it to our pets and eating it like left and right raw sushi whom yummy like the neverending supply fucked our the world of the ocean it is a real trip if you stop and think about what it really is because if it was in the sky above your head you'd be freaked out all the time you know if like you reached up to touch it you'd be freaked out you wouldn't wanna be right next to that thing like Jesus it's too ailing I can't I can't get away from it but because it's right there and it's blue and we're on the ground we feel like we're in control we're cocky because most of the time nothing happens like no big deal it's right there I love the beach like over the beach get some Sun catch some breeze it's like we like flirting with death standing the edge of this impossible to control life force filled with creatures filled with the biggest creatures in the world right aren't whales the biggest things on earth I think they're you know what they are they're the biggest living thing on earth next to this there's like a group of mushrooms in the Pacific Northwest that are all connected and all considered to be one enormous life-form yeah I gotta get this guy Paul Stamets I think that's his name I believe that's how you say his name rather he's a guy who studies mushrooms some mushroom scientists fascinating studies fascinating articles and stuff online in the Blue Mountains in Oregon yeah there it is horseshit more precisely a specific honey fungus measuring 2.4 miles across in the Blue Mountains it's known as the largest living organism on earth several species of fungi belong to the try that word our Millah Rhea a malaria genis genus or genis I say that that's a read one that's when I read I never say you know I never use it in a conversation pretentious I might have to be like really high to be that pretentious I'm a Maria I'm a malaria a malaria our malaria our malaria genis which is probably properly rather popularly known as honey fungus 2.4 miles across I like how they give it to us in kilometres like if you don't want to be stupid 3.8 kilometers if you want to be like the rest of the world do everything intends you fucking idiots sticking a miles and inches why do we do that because we're gross there's parts of America that are gross like now we got it and I like that well we have we found a much better system it makes more sense it's all in tens a whole world use it yeah good luck good luck with that fucking stupid system I'll take inches bro yards inches it feels good to when you're in like other countries and you're like why are you going 120 miles an hour oh it's so they're like 62 is like I want to say it's a hundred kilometers an hour but I think it's actually more than that I was just always thinking it's half but that's probably wrong well yeah I don't know I honestly don't know it's 60 to 100 miles an hour hundred 100 kilometers rather 62 miles an hour 100 sounds cooler you know kilometres are just they're better we're using some old King shit inches it'd be weird to change now though like we had to be born with that like it's well dude mouths I mean I don't know when you were in high school but when I was in high school they were trying there was a real push to get people to use the metric systems I don't think exists anymore I don't know but I mean maybe it was just as schools that I was in I would like to talk to other people that are like my age that could remember like the 1980s because in the 1980s I think that they were trying to push the metric system I think I kind of caught on the tail end I don't remember it at all from hi United States is now the only industrialized country in the world that does not use the metric system and its predominant system of measurement most Americans linked think that our involvement with metric measures measurement is relatively new but it's it's not right they what year did they try to do it 1975 see the metric conversion act of 1975 yeah that's what I remember dude Ford yeah they were trying that cuz me maybe it wasn't maybe I wasn't in high school maybe it was before high school I think it was I was looking something up the other day I think it was when you asked are the presidents allowed to change the White House or something and uh huh I think it was Ford that added solar panels to the White House I was looking up and then the next president which might have been Nixon took him out mmm and they didn't have him reinstalled and think until Obama was there like whatever right so it was like 25 years of no solar panels when they already had them we're already headed that way that is weird you see the new Apple campus that they're gonna show I guess next week next Tuesday when they have I haven't seen much of it but I know that it's supposed to be some insanely impossible huge crazy place it looks like a spaceship it's now finished they have like drone footage that you can like just go around it looks just like a round donut spaceship and the whole roof has solar collectors look at that that power is itself look at that thing I think that is Wow who cares back in on that computer image that's insane that's them it must be so cool to have the kind of money or you could just build something like we guys want to do let's make a fucking giant apple spaceship she would make it the shape of an apple they could they could have easily made that thing an apple but then they would have never been able to sell it yeah what yeah it's like a tire company yeah no one wants to buy your stupid Apple you don't like the touch bar in your MacBook I've not even seen one in person yes um this is what I think I don't think it's necessary I think it's kind of cute but it does a lot of different stuff that I never use and maybe it's me but also there's like a Siri button that I accidentally press all the time while I'm typing cuz my I suck at typing I'm okay you know I'm not very good at it I really should practice and get better at it I just have every time I get a chance to write I just write you can turn it off right the the touch bar though you can I think you could you do stuff with it but I mean I don't know if you could totally turn it off because then you turn off the volume control that's where the volume control is oh fuck really the brightness the volume control everything the real problem is that fucking Siri button it's right above the Delete key with my fat stupid fingers I touched that thing at least once a day you can turn off she's off okay you're off bitch yeah I don't want Siri on my goddamn laptop but it's uh it's just an accidental touch thing it's and it's not the best keyboard it's a very shallow touch you know and some people like that it's very precise I'll give it that but I like the IBM or the those thinkpads those who's making those Lenovo right yeah they have a way better feel to their keyboard mechanical yeah the wind Apple's operating system to me is just way better alright you shouldn't say way better cuz Windows 10 is really good it's just more familiar I should say at this point it was way better for a long time for sure but there's more options if you want to buy a Windows computer look you can get so many different kinds of computers you can get big ones small ones you get ones with interesting keyboards you get ones with keyboards they feel like you know like that like a MacBook or you get other ones like a think that it feels almost like a mechanical keyboard it's got a lot more touch to it I know it seems stupid but to me that like tactile feel is a very important part of writing it helps me it helps like I like to to get in a good groove with where my fingers are growing and when I have actual physical keys that stick up a little bit more and they have a little push to them my fingers find their way better it's hard when you're on this like very thin keyboard just me yeah I always up I always upgrade my keyboards like I like razer keyboards are really nice they make a good one I have a mechanical Razer keyboard my computer at all I love Razer the shit yeah my I got one those razor laptops that I decided to switch over to PC for VC you know vr gaming and all that stuff and the keyboard is a mechanical one you would love it it's like almost like a typewriter no yeah the Razer Blade pro those are slick looking devices too man they are like literally like the claw like it's a Windows version of a macbook like as far as like the build quality and everything yeah it's got that most powerful graphics card in it desktop graphics card there's very slick very slick they make a lot of cool shit they make the best gaming license - they made that thing I told you about at CES that three screen laptop I don't think it's out for sale yet it was stolen I stole that does crazy you know deep you're going when you get three screens popped open we're all on porn yeah three different movies going at the same time plus you're playing a game in the background do you worry about like our device is constantly listening to us at all time like Alexa's in series and they definitely are oh they are really yeah they how they work like hey Siri feel like this is all inevitable I feel like this is where it's all going you know um I think that you could fight it off if you want and you could probably stay out of it for a really long time but ultimately we are so much less private today than we were a decade ago and I don't think people really really feel it yet because a lot of the people that are like 25 today you guys grew up with the internet being like this free thing like Brian and I when we were kids there was nothing and then all of a sudden it came about when we were in adulthood and you're like whoa this is nuts like this is all connected like ha'la'tha and it's like the whole world is learning a whole new style of being a person because this connection means changing everything and kids are born into that like they've had it since they were born now for sure they're completely different people dude I went down a rabbit hole the other day I went down a rabbit hole of vegan bloggers who are mean to other vegan bloggers and claim that they're not even vegan it was it was crazy I was like total wrong rabbit hole the people are accusing people of not being vegan and people are suing people Mike holy shit like this is vegan lawsuits yeah defamatory lawsuits people talking shit lawsuits like oh man you can go down a rabbit hole right you know that's that's never been a cake the case before before you can get into a good book you know you go this book I can't put it down it's a page-turner but you could never like just go from subject to subject instantaneously your stupid little brain just suck it up all the fucking motorcycle accidents and coyote attacks and just that's there's never been a person like us in terms of like the person that with that kind of access to information we're the first generation ever like there's never been anyone before us we're all figuring out as we go along it's like we're at the library non-stop buy at the card catalog like looking up stuff doing research papers you know non-stop stat on everything non-stop on everything yeah you know and then you got all your factions you know we put group up they grew up ie white supremacist factions you got flat earth factions you got I mean you gotta join groups of people who chunk up together and they all like share memes and they make fun of everybody else yes I saw one online it was a flat earth guy calling all people who believe the earth is round globe heads and it was like there's like and I was like what is this and there's a whole series of them there's like hundreds of them dude where people are mocking the idea that the earth is round you can fucking find anything online man anything any any weird group you can find them have you seen it I typed it in Google and there's just like the first three things or videos like another globe head Theory debunk Eddie Bravo pissed off I fucking love those people now I used to get upset at them now I love them my parents were globe heads not anymore to burn the house down because the parents think the world is round this is the meme it's a child standing in front with a smile standing in front of a burning house says my parents were globe heads not anymore like so this is my point is it's the same thing they're all it's all the same kind of mental illness that drags you into this group hook line sinker if the group doesn't make any sense if it's you know vegan bloggers trying to take out other vegan bloggers or whether it's this idea that the world is round and that the people think the world is round should have their houses burnt down little kid should be smiling even though it's their parents like Platts this is so crazy what's like I'd haven't talked to him too many flat-earthers but like but but my you know Kevin Pereira he attached a GoPro camera to a weather balloon one time or a few times and when it goes up to a certain point it's a round earth that's look at the cameras showing him Pereira is a globalist shill you don't know shit man Eddie Eddie eight DES believe in that right like he says he doesn't well he doesn't say does he doesn't know he doesn't know about that one he keeps no up in mind with everything that's yeah I don't think he's actually saying maybe is maybe he's not saying it to me but I think it's fun for people too I think there's that it's fun to think that they're right it's fun that the ends really it's fun to say you own and you're right I don't know there's a lot I don't know that's the reality I mean that's one thing that like if you're talking to flat earth people and you say why are you so confident that the world is round like you got a good point I'm I'm not doing any experiments I've never really looked at the data I've looked at all those satellite images though and I would assume that all those people who are making maps and flying transcontinental flights pilots people make satellites people have actually been to space I would assume they're not all in cahoots I mean but I don't know might be the biggest hoax who hostesses did you imagine if we're really living in so I'm like what was that Jim Carrey movie Truman Show yes if we're really living in some bizarre simulation and we are in a dome and we've been just tricked with some fake numbers science and images I continue to think that more and more to the point where that's my religion where people that's my Flat Earth to the it's getting so weird the older you get how much I believe in that kind of shit like a simulation simulation stuff I think there's probably I think we probably have a deeper connection that we can't measure and that's one of the reasons why it seems like things could be faked I think we have a connection that's changing too I think our connection with our reality not just because of information and technology that allows you to call each other and stuff like that I think the information that we're getting those is allowing us to like almost like go through the world in a different way and things are syncing up more and more with a lot of people I hear that all the time it sounds like total horseshit though but I wonder I mean like what is the placebo effect right what is that tricking your brain and to something that's not there right yeah well you trick your body into thinking that it took medicine and your body heals itself right what the fuck is that so there's some tricks some tricks you eat doesn't even happen other with like medicine it music and wearing certain forms I get you pumped up flow towards and she's all like musics a perfect example right there's songs that there's songs that I hear when I'm working out and I fucking work out harder like they give me like a more fucking more pep or energy and then there's a lot of fucking movies that do that too right like I saw rocky when I was a little kid I ran around the block I drank raw eggs I did the whole thing because I was just like we're so pumped up that movie literally gives you energy I think every kid ate raw eggs when that movie came out I remember doing it with my friend fuck haha and then there's glitches in the simulation like you know like deja vu and then like or when you're walking down a sidewalk and you know how you just walk people walking next to you like no big thing but then there's that one guy where you try to go left he's going left you're going right and you're just like why why did we just sink up here like what the fuck happened there yeah it's rather randomness of it all man I just made me think of it I just saw this article recently came out there's a study about why music gives you goosebumps scientists studied 10 people that claim that they get chills when they hear certain songs or certain things happening whatnot what does it say the dead brain scans on them and what they found out is that their auditory cortex which is or if they have fibers in their auditory cortex that are stronger I guess whatever it does stronger is then people who don't feel that which leads to stronger emotion reactions so they think that it can be used to treat people with depression to get them to bring up feelings that they might not be able to access otherwise it's obviously just a new study and it's it's lots of theory and whatnot but what's interesting you know like what is it here's another interesting way to look at it what is it about a song that gets you like that that gives you that energy and part of it is like the novelty of hearing this song not meaning that you don't want to know what the song is about but you can't hear it too many times or it loses its impact you know like after a while song becomes like flat if you hear it too many times in a row I've tried to notice when it happens to be in it more often not as from a live performance and I think I've I'm feeling the emotion the person singing and has a little bit and I like I've noticed it's more often like a real-live or there that person's first time on TV yeah one of those kinds of things that happens more than just like listen to the radio or it could probably get annoying too if you heard it over and over and over again radio kills music do you remember back in the day when you'd hear a song over and over again on the radio and you'd be like what the fuck this song again it would actually get annoyed if you go to any any any local radio station turn on a rocks channel you know you're gonna hear like one of three songs in an hour at least like one Metallica song the inner Sandman's going to come on once has to come on yeah no shit right boy that's a fucking tough gig because those guys like no the DJ's never got like the freedom anymore to go loose there just to roll up with a bunch of Records to start playing some shit that they like that's what they used to do right correct me if I'm wrong yeah that they always had program managers right so the program manager would influence what they would put on a little bit for sure do you not remember when they would play a record you could hear the record skip sometimes like sometimes sometimes it would skip though and they would have to like go back and like we're sorry about that ladies and gentlemen like some fucking dude is not paying attention and he's off in the restroom or something like that or getting a cup of coffee while the song is playing and he doesn't realize that it's been skipping that happened all the time back in the day there's a local DJ here in Los Angeles that does that he plays records and he's like a real DJ he's like one of the last guys I think I mean it's been like a year since I've listened to the radio but he used to be really cool and he could hear the static of the record and it was cool I don't know what I don't remember what channel that was do you remember that Christian Slater movie or Christian Slater was a lot the volume he had like a pirate radio station they were trying to get him the government was chasing them it was very almost like Smokey and the Bandit ask it was so stupid the way to chase it I'm like they're trying to get him because he's broadcasting and you can't do that like you know it's like he's wild and he's good-looking and you know he's rebellious wasn't he's supposed to be in high school too yeah something like that my favorite movies growing up I don't know you're talking about that was a girl dude at the time it was a great movie for sure well I'm just saying like how weird was it like back then if you had like a pirate radio station you're a rebel and people would be out there in the woods listening he's like hey if you hear me out there you're still alive and if you're still alive you could still kick some ass given these fucking corny pom-pom up speeches to all the young kids they'd be like yeah we gotta we gotta rise against like all the old people were retarded although none of the old people made any sense was the young people that knew that everything was wrong in the system man it's a pre-internet man that uh yeah dude he had a cordless phone though that's cool I like Christian Slater big fan yeah that was pre-internet man it was pre fucking Internet I forget that movie I watched the other day and there was no internet and there was no cell phones in it you forgot there's like a part of you forgets that because there's like so many scenes where the guys like I need to contact Mary I need to find her right and then you're like why don't just plot yourself an asshole oh wait there is no self once here yeah when you need to find someone you gotta go look for them yeah they're like run around and yell people yell a lot Bobby call places dude Italians I remember very clearly when I was a kid especially like in like the real Italian neighborhoods in the East Coast people would scream out for people in the street they would just scream hey hey they'll just be yelling at the top of their lungs it was so crazy I just people always did that and then people got answering machines that was a big one remember answer much yeah I still have one of mine I would love to hear the messages on that you always had to have like the best like outgoing message so like you pretend music behind it or you pick like Fair Saturday Night Live skit in the back or yeah or like you feel real creative yeah like Tony Montana mine was the Cheech and Chong period at one time the one that's like hello hello or whatever that yeah there was always a lot of people trying real hard to be creative that was like your first social media profile that turned into like the instant messenger away message which is yeah and then it was the the grossest thing ever invented ringback tones remember the Verizon ring back yeah you used to be call people up sometimes you still call people up gonna play a song yeah I guess they still have it probably why would you right you still have king of rock and call okay my favorites when you had to move you have Run DMC you had for a year I am beautiful we would just be like a normal conversation with like adults and then tell you that thing which is Blair I like some sometimes I'd like things and I don't like that I feel pressure or not like them you know I'm like why how come I can't like that song it's a beautiful song it's is it is it too girly so what it is oh what's going on a lot of prejudice that's how I feel with Taylor Swift I was blaring her some new song the other day and I was at a red light house like God deals gonna roll up a window you go boys it's weird you gotta be scared to sing things out I was playing that one to see a song in hearing after you left one day and you came back in like yeah man this I like a lot of shit that I probably shouldn't like what's your biggest latest guiltiest pleasure ish um I like Taylor Swift yeah I like her music I like I like so your team Taylor I like Justin Bieber I like his voice it's got beautiful voice couple of his songs are all right I'm a kid could sing his fucking ass off I heard some people curated that kind of music they're upset right now cuz Justin Timberlake is rumored or he's gonna be doing vocals on the new Foo Fighters album but he's just doing like some background you won't even know it's him but his name made it out in a blog post or something this is that guy's not gonna do if this is Timberlake yeah he's smart guy he's not gonna do anything stupid if he does do that he's gonna smash it he wouldn't do it if he didn't think he'd smash it worse yeah he'll just smash it yeah he's great I don't know why people shit on him he's like one of the best most talented P - handsome too tall too pretty it's too rich he dances around it's too good at dancing don't like it do not like it yeah guys don't like some handsome fellow dances real good and sings his ass off fuck that so people are hating he just gets all the poison Hey who dances fucking dancer can't like dancing too much if you're a dude but it's that same thing the same reason why you're not supposed to like that I am beautiful song it's goddamn beautiful song but you know people prefer you to be like you know Enter Sandman which is great to get its balance in this life right you want a little Ozzy Osbourne every now and then you want a little shell crow I like a little Sheryl Crow yeah I'm hauling notes all day I can't get enough of haul notes I can't go for that I can't go for that no no can do hollow notes old school son oh yeah

as an indie I don't I don't think you should deny what he's accomplished when it comes to mr. Yeezy I just don't enjoy what they look like I don't like a stilted stage I just don't like what they look like I bet they are maybe not if it is half what it's about yeah I think half of is about to have easy well oh you mean the easy yeah 95 95 okay there's more comfortable shoes out there for sure yeah it's about it's also like a Rolex why would you get a Rolex when you could have a movement watch you know I mean it's totally other watch yeah a $5,000 watch or right a 200 dollar watch exactly yeah it's some sort of arm candy you know it's like a candy bracelet yeah yeah it's jewelry it's just it's watch jewelry like um like those watches that Floyd Mayweather has those crazy watches and that half-a-million-dollar watch that he had that's what armed jewelry that's not really watch like you're not telling just watch cross like 150 bucks that's a cool watch what kind of eye you know every time I wear a watch prints what sorry I was sure I was pulling this up I just so what is it this is the new guy that's gonna play print Freddie Mercury in the biopic this is the guy from mr. robot oh wow show me Malick oh my god it is him it looks amazing yeah it's great it's just like that song dragon attack the Queen song dragon attack you know this one that's my free song that's my song when I go into freeze I just listen to dragon attack have you've made yourself to the mat gotten to your max like you're not allowed to go any height longer in the freeze thing is that how it says don't really like you going in more than three minutes right three minutes is pretty much the max so I go in three minutes then I wait out for ten minutes and then I go in for another two animal dude feels good like when you pee does it come out like a slushy is it little eyes here no they do anything right now it does is it makes your body produce a lot of anti-inflammatories like cold shock proteins they called cytokines your body produces and when it freaks the fuck out thinks it's gonna die hmm it's so cold oh just if you feel amazing it free it really feels amazing when you come out of there like you feel like dr. Rhonda Patrick explained it scientifically when she did a podcast about it and she was talking about the increased anti inflammatory markers in the blood I think it was and the other thing was that your norepinephrine I think that's how you say it brain chemicals spike and it's a lot of it is just dealing with the fact that your body's been thrust into this insane environment like I guess I guess there's wet I mean it's like you know we're talking about the placebo effect right if there's a way through thinking about something you can get your mind to operate in a way where it fixes your body right and that there's sort of some of something similar to in in this respect that like your your your brain and your thoughts for something like a placebo effect or something like really trying to really trying to figure out how you interface with stuff I think I think I really do think that there's more to like how we go like this idea that like there's a simulation theory that you keep bringing up a lot of people keep bringing up I think we interface with reality different than we ever did before just slightly different just slightly I think that like all the different ways you can hack your system whether it's through like cold shock proteins from doing that or heat shock proteins from doing a sauna or even placebo effects like it might be good to get tricked it might be like that's like probably like half of the reason why religion does a lot of people do it because if you fucking believe if you really believe that Jesus is real and you read all the the tenets of the Bible and you go wow this is fucking what a great way to live your life like whoa you get almost like a bit of a placebo effect and you could say look it works it's real and it's like the same way you could say sugar pills are real right if you give a guy a placebo sugar pill it does nothing really but all of a sudden it fixes whatever a.m. on the ad it's all connected man we can do shit with our brains and we can do shit with our bodies and that wim HOF guys living proof of that you ever pay attention to him now dude I've had him on a couple of times you got a check out a shitty this guy does marathons in his underwear he does he runs to the top of Everest in a pair of shorts with ice like flip-flops on his like sandals on I'm not bullshitting them it's Everest he says it's easy Wow yeah he does like he runs barefoot in the snow he does marathons and all just by controlling his breathing and controlling his mind it's a real freak man fascinating cat was like a yoga teacher most of his life went through a bunch of hardships and really started realizing that by jumping in cold water and controlling his breathing like he really sort of changed his reality and he does it all time this guy goes into glacial waters so wait isn't like frostbite and like like physical things real like yeah I think it is but I think your body first of all develops tolerances for stuff and I noticed that just from doing a cryo chamber like if I don't do it for a few looking about they're doing yoga barefoot in the snow on the top of the fucking mountain is there a more badass photo ever taken look at that crease wait that's amazing like a what about hyperthermia and all that crazy body I think your body adapts because when you do um if you do let cryotherapy and you've never done it before the first time you do it you like holy shit like first time they do it they won't let you do more than a minute and a half they want you to go oh my god like what is this and if you take some time off and you get back in there like if you haven't gone in a few months then you go back in there and you do feel way cold but if I go like three days in a row I can just get right in there and stand there and it doesn't even freak me out it doesn't I just I'm just used to it I know what it is my body's adapted to it my bodies are accustomed to it now imagine like how people live that are living in like North East Alaska or uh you know like living in places where they hunt seals and shit they - Inuits they don't even get frostbite man like their hands gonna be out and exposed and ridiculous cold they just don't they don't get the same sort of issues with it that we do like their their bodies have adapted far I think your mind can make your body do a lot of shit it doesn't want to do and your mind can do it by forcing yourself into extreme physical conditions like like a cryo chamber or like a sauna sauna is amazing for you apparently what that Rada Patrick lady was saying that run - Patrick lady dr. Rhonda Patrick was saying was that there is a 40% decrease in mortality across all causes from everything that gets like heart attacks strokes cancer 40% decrease in mortality across everything just from doing sauna like four times a week apparently it's just fucking phenomenal for your body just sit there and just heat up and it just fires your system up you know all those heat shock proteins they just act as an anti-inflammatory if your body your joints feel better things move better so you get out of there too and you cool off and you feel way better it's just I think there's a bunch of resources like that that we don't take advantage of enough I think everybody should be signing all the time I'm just traumatized from being a child and going with my dad and seeing all those dicks and balls are you know I think there's a lot of negative connotation towards sauna in MMA because a lot of people think of a sauna is like a place where people go to cut weight like a real painful process to cut weight so they can make a weight class which is true they do use it for that but that's not the only use for the sauna like you shouldn't just be using the sauna for that you should be using the sauna for health we should use it all the time I think I think it's a gigantic important step in like like body maintenance it's like a bunch of shit you have to do for body maintenance I think that's one has there been any news updates on the John John situation and like I've heard nothing it's so disappointing so makes me sad I read banned insights on this one yeah that's right you called the dick pills I would just like to say for the record Brian read been completely called the dick belt thing you if I paraphrase you were like let me say he parties he does coke he you know he probably took some dick pills and I was like what Jesus Christ it made so much sense it was like how it was there right along the whole time I just remember the fda.gov had like you know breakdowns of certain like Rhino dick pills at gas stations and a lot him had steroid type things in them yeah and hence fuck he's so crazy he was taking that stuff is still taking him well now I bet he would I mean now that I was like fuck I'll just take everything you could get addicted to him I was addicted to him for awhile I don't know why I don't think he's addicted to it the new thing that he tested positive for has nothing to do with that they said the new thing that he tested positive for is a steroid that the only test for in urine and according to Chael Sonnen it's like a very it's not a very common steroid it's actually kind of old-school it's like something needs to do a long time ago so he it's his thought was that if somebody is getting him to do that that if that's not a tainted supplement if someone's getting him to do that that person knows their shit like that's that some sneaky steroids yeah and he said it's usually combined with other things since someone fortunately I don't know if it's true he could have got sabotaged what's he saying is he's saying no one's saying anything there's no official statement I don't think like because there's I think they're trying to test other stamp other samples they tested a blood sample and then they released the results of the blood sample they always do a blood in a urine the blood sample was negative but the blood sample didn't test for that stuff so I don't you know you could speculate all day long I'm sure as the facts come in we'll get a better understanding of it but it would be the most disappointing ever if someone spiked his shit it'd almost be less disappointing if he took something in got caught than it would be if somebody tainted him that's why I'm saying it like he knows his past it just seems ridiculous to think that he would even try even if it's old school or stuff they barely rested it seems like why would he even risk that because he already went already right but being a cage fighter is a ridiculous way to make a living and people who are cage fighters especially like elite level like a guy like John Jones he's that guy has like probably a belief in himself that you and I will never understand and completely impulsive and like what he decides he's why he's a wild motherfucker that's why so good cuz he's smart and he's wild like he'll tease like legitimately wild he's wild chances like I always talk about like when he fought Shogun for the tile when he's fought Rogan for the title he opened up the fight with a flying knee that was the first thing he did fighting a legend finding a UFC light heavyweight champion I mean he was crazy town and still is right he's only 30 but he's a wild man and wild men sometimes do shit that they don't even know why they're why they're doing it they're just doing it you know and if you're a guy that's that powerful as the guy like John Jones like try controlling him good luck good luck telling them you can't go out good luck telling them what he's got to do you know it's one of the things about him in the past that he hasn't trained hard for fights and they were way harder fights and they should have been probably because he really wasn't in shape and everyone around him kind of knew it but it was he was that good that he could fight world class title challengers and beat them in five round fights without really training like that's how goddamn could that guy a so you and I we don't know how his brain even works so who knows the fuck happened I hope he didn't do something but then again that means that one of two things happened either he took a st. attainted supplement which is after a while almost comes becomes a joke like to keep people keep saying that he stopped taking supplements or even worse if someone spiked him yeah the spiking thing because it seemed like I that would be crazy yeah that would be crazy you could do that to somebody though for sure I mean if somebody is around someone with nefarious intentions or someone's around someone who's resentful and you're in some sort of pro fight camp and someone just decides fuck this guy and just dump some stuff on your chicken steroid cream in your hand cream I think there's things they could do to get into your system you probably wouldn't even know what a the test that came up in a positive I guess is the one that happened right there it was after the way and yes it's a urine wasn't tested at anytime before that I'm sure he was there they were tested multiple times in camp probably not necessarily just because it's really like well if you know I don't know like what kind of time period they tested them in and I don't know what kind of half-life this stuff has because apparently Chael Sonnen was telling Brendan Schaub that it gets out of your system quite quick and that's one of the things that guys liked about it apparently that you could do it and gets out of your system really quick you would have to find out like how much time do they usually have in between visits by you sada and what are the odds they're gonna get busted like how much how many times during camp are they willing to roll the dice say if they have a 24 or 48 hour acting steroid how many times can you roll the dice you saw two visited you three times you gotta roll the dice this week roll it come on I wanna have a hard workout Thursday fuck it let's roll the dice you roll the dice 27 hours no you saw out of 28 you wake up in the night sweating 30 hours no you so you know if they come you know if they come your fucking career is over and they take away millions of dollars 40 hours you're peeing ah no you sauna the next day you saw it oh you start thinking 52 hours how many hours is that commands have been for the a for a 90 50 51 52 3 hours paid you 3 hours that's got to be gone right it's got to all be gone and you give them that piss just wondering whether it's and I'm sure there's stuff that you can take that supposedly washes it out faster like any kind of drug tests you know like weed test I remember you I think it was like cranberry juice or something you just constantly drink there's certain diuretics for sure certain diuretics can mask steroids it's one of the reasons why they're illegal article that came out about an hour ago looks bloody elbow it that's not like any update of news or anything really that's a PD expert who's known in the track-and-field world as known for supplying performance-enhancing drugs to them his name is angel Hernandez also known as memo not that that matters a whole lot but if anybody knows him with Angel Heredia Heredia Hernandez but angel Heredia is that the same guy that used to train Manny Pacquiao or no or is it the fuck did there was a guy that was like a really popular goddamnit I know I got his name wrong strength and conditioning coach he's saying that the test that they do Tex tests for six different particular metabolites right one of those can last up to seven weeks and Dennis skip Donahue says that one of those metabolites can look like the same structure as the Torana ball mm any or may not it doesn't mean that it's not random or whatever but it could it be from a bad supplement that he took during a training period that lasted in a system and ended up looking like it ooh interesting listen to this quote listen to this quote if he would have been using weight before then he eventually would have been positive on the 21-day testing before the fight but he was negative then he came out positive frankly the testing itself it lacks of credibility for a lot of reasons we could go on and on but and I could be very specific in terms of chemistry but I don't want to mislead the people that listen it's just the fact that they're detecting six different metabolites and one of them stays there longer than seven weeks but the most intriguing part is that some of those metabolites are not really confirmed that they are actually coming from that how do you say that - Rinna bowl - Rinna ball - Rinna ball structure all right but you sada who's doing this they know what the fuck they're doing and they're not they're not going to come out with a result unless they're super super sure that that's what they're tested positive for I don't know if this guy's right sort of speculating I would imagine out know if he wasn't there either but I tell you I talked to Jeff Novitzky off stage and off mic on mic I talked him around the arena he's he's about as honest as it comes when it comes to like handling these situations with these athletes they're catching people and the people they're catching we're using theirs you know the way they're doing it is very thorough the way they're handling it is very thorough and there hasn't been anybody with a credible story that came forth that didn't have something in their system that they weren't that was supposed to have in their system we haven't had a case of that yet as far as I know I think almost all cases have been either tainted supplements or someone getting caught whether it's taking a diuretic or someone getting caught taking a steroid there's a lot going on like that and he's got you know they have a team of people that are just constantly checking people that might be cheating I guess you have to also say it's where they're smokers fire how many fighters never have a steroid you know in them you know there's a few you know like BJ Penn I'm sure there's you know I used to think it would be John Fitch within John Fitch tested positive he was but he was getting older and he was fighting and world series of fighting wasn't in the UFC anymore and you know and he might have been dealing with some serious injuries need to pay his bills through fighting like I don't begrudge anybody especially when they're not even in the UFC and the testing that they do in a lot of these organizations it's like there's a lot of there's a lot of organizations that have guys that are pretty much openly using and what they do is they have these guys to fight on like Indian reservations or fighting weird States have an Athletic Commission that doesn't really adhere to the rules or doesn't have two and doesn't it's not very strict but what especially the Indian Reservation thing Native American reservations they do whatever the fuck they want man their country inside our country but you sada they look up your ass man they look up your ass they come get you they come get you and they wake you up hey man hey how you doing hey we're going to look at your dick and I'm gonna watch piss come out of your dick it's gonna go in this cup and then you can go back to sleep mm-hmm it's uh it's no joke and to see a guy like John was just spectacular just spectacular comeback fight you know I mean like a phoenix he rises from the ashes he gave this really classy post-fight speech he won by just overwhelming devastation I mean it was a beautiful combination with the left high kick then a series of shots Daniel goes down he just beats him unconscious in a spectacular performance and then to find out that it's tainted by some fucking gross steroid they were still were sneaking in he said either that or again the other one which is almost equally gross that somebody gave it to him like somebody gave him some hey man hey champ have some have this Gatorade champ you know hey champ I got you a Gatorade champ crack you know and they're very accessible these fighters you know they're you know honey they're just going to the gyms like you go to a lot time then if you're not fighting John he's a great guy yeah he's great guy great guy people love him um I think that uh we don't know you know just makes me sad it makes me sad but one day you know when Dale they'll have it eradicated but by then I think there's gonna be some new methods I think they're gonna have genetic methods that's the next one they're pretty cool not pretty close but they're they're pretty close to being able to alter embryos and to be able to change like genes in people maybe she even shut off dangerous genes like genes for Alzheimer's and different different diseases that people have they might be able to literally create create that the tools to edit that in the embryonic stage this is something called CRISPR and that's one of the things that they're using to to alter genes it's like start C RI SPR I think it is you see the video of someone used it to make like neon green beer no something like that they use CRISPR to make neon green beer would they use like so they did something to the the wheat oh they made a new color chocolate the first time in like a hundred years they made a new chocolate oh we're fuckin around with yeah that's why hurricane Irma was gonna eat Florida they also recently took the West Nile virus and pumped it into rats and it killed the cancer which is crazy so you're taking one crazy thing and killing another crazy thing but West Nile virus cures cancer yeah in my sir whatever but yeah that's that's the things like there's a lot of shit the weed that animals can't even touch or they die this biohacker what is it ii wants to spur a genetic engineering revolution with glowing beer how that seems healthy like I'm worried about aspartame yeast imagine how bad your pee smells like think about how bad your pee smells when you drink it or you eat asparagus cutting-edge genetic engineering technique CRISPR yeah Wow that's how they did it that's insane that's the same sells the kits too apparently but that is so crazy you can buy a kit to genetically engineer through CRISPR your wheat to glow it's pretty badass that's insane it's got to be bad for its time for good waiting for one of these fucking problems that we have to turn us into superheroes because that was what we always saw in the comic books right every time there was a nuclear spill dude came out of it with x-ray vision right the government also immediately found the guy and took him and hit him into tesam so the public wouldn't be scared tried to bro tried to most the time they were free it's already happening autism now they're like some of the best like Navy coders and well there's there's without a doubt some super genius people with awesome autism and then there's people that are on that spectrum you know autism and also Asperger's and a lot of different disorders that allows them to like focus on stuff with laser-like precision they just their brains work different mm-hmm there's a lot of thought to that that's like the next style of person that like we're so connected to our devices and to the Internet and to to this like we're gonna like lose our interaction with each other and lose our emotions and then it might manifest itself through a series of like weird errors like a disease or a disorder and that disorder becomes favorable and that favorable disorder of just not really getting attached to things just focus on your work like a drone like some sort of crazy robot number-crunching robot like there's it's a hundred percent possible that if you we know there are some people like that right so if there are some people that are just super genius coders they're just zone out and can code like crazy and they're kind of on the spectrum if there's one of those that could be a thousand if there's a thousand that could be a million if there's a million they could start breeding and making a bunch of other ones like that and maybe it's something you pass on your genes may be we pass on more than our genes and we know next thing you know you got robot people like we slowly but surely integrate with our chips and fucking different you know Qualcomm chips in your brain your phone is now a part of your body robot people with abilities to call each other and connect online and like what if that's like if nature is trying to engineer our humaneness out of us slowly morph it change it make it more compatible to staying in front of computer screens constantly crunching numbers people's hands start growing different because of everyone's holding cell phones their whole life their eyes get farther apart like chance the rapper you know what fascinates me when people of autistic kids then the kids show massive improvement from a change of diet or from cannabis cannabis oil for a lot of kids is a massive improvement stop their seizures makes them start interacting with other kids better wonder if that is what I mean you don't think they know like a specific cause for autism or any of the spectrum disorders right no I mean I always just blame cell phones on Wi-Fi I've also heard there could be right ahead I've also heard gut bacteria be blamed for a bunch of them Wow yeah they were saying that a lack of probiotics in the diet poor gut bacteria could be blamed for certain issues and disorders that some people have found neurons in the gut right mm-hmm I mean that's two things are true that makes it well if your gut bacteria is essentially like a like a community right you have like a community of flora inside your stomach and the more bad stuff you put in there and then it also like other people would be way more susceptible than some you know like just like today there's people that can eat things and maybe have mild allergies and then there's someone like you or I that we can eat the exact same thing and have no issue with it whatsoever that's got to be the same with gut flora it's got to be the same with the I mean we're so biologically variable but if just imagine if that's just a step in a long process of peopie mean like you look at like super genius autistic people we as far as we know I mean they might have existed hundreds of years ago but we don't know of them right we're just guessing this is a fairly recent thing what if it becomes something even different in a hundred years from now what if it's these people that know how to read each other's minds and only they can do it they can all read each other's minds they can probably read our minds but we can never read theirs and they just read just talking to each other and we're like hey what are you talking about what are you guys talking about like we're gonna be left behind like our stupid genes we're gonna be left behind and these people without what if like war just stops because autistic people just have just no desire to go to war like no just rather still around here in code yeah you know or whatever the next stage is like if autism or Asperger's or any of these things are a new thing I don't know if they are but if they are a new thing just imagine what another new thing could be that takes it to another place and a next level people that don't keep their vr helmets on all the time like you're living the real world what's wrong with you well you got to think man if evolution is true and I'm assuming it is we used to be super primitive right we used to be some sort of primitive primate thing and then there was a bunch of different versions of us and we branched out and we were the most successful and we made it to today so that means we changed so why would we assume we're done that's crazy we're getting more input now than ever before and we're assuming we're done we're not even the same people from the 1950s we're not we're totally different I wonder if our brains are gonna start using more because we are well less or less but I mean we're pretty much like you know we're using our brains way more than we were 20 years ago 20 years ago we instead of like researching and reading and like reading pretty much we were just probably sitting there looking at colors you know - it would have been way easier back then to be a con man okay nobody could do any research on you yeah well I was right on the town and all that raising a Buddhist monster Eddie had the greatest fucking story about that Eddie Bravo was taking karate or kung fu' from this dude that said he had to go to China to learn from you know some kung fu masters Eddie was like so proud he's like wow my instructor is like one of the greatest instructors in the world is gonna go to China learn from some kung fu master and then he saw him at like a supermarket or some shit the dudes car was like parked in front he's like that can't be him he got in the car he drove I was like what the fuck I thought that dude was in China he just totally lied not only did he lie but he was so stupid he stayed around the neighborhood he just lied to his students and was pretending he's off gathering knowledge from the Masters there was a lot of those guys man that had like fake karate classes they like fake martial arts schools they were teaching like nonsense and they would have this crazy background on the wall you know seven-time undefeated Marine Corps and bare-knuckle no-holds-barred champion they would make up a bunch of shit there's a lot of those dudes man my favorite YouTube videos so many of them there's so many of them it's like the religious people like like you know people falling on the ground or getting thrown by the room by the PAP you know the pastor and stuff it's the same kind of shit yeah in a lot of ways but that's like the other side of the placebo effect right it's like there's other the other side like those people when that guy does that thing and they go flying through the air and they start their body starts shaking do you think they feel something like what do you think is going on are they just totally faking it I think this guy I think it's all dumb people I think it's low watt brains that just fake they're easy to trick into believe into anything I mean look at them look at half the world yeah for sure that's the possibility but I want to know like are they doing it are they conscious of what they're doing like are they willfully giving in to this because they want the guy to like him and like he comes up to you like are they really feeling it I mean are they convincing them is it a placebo effect are they convincing themselves I think so you think so yeah I think I think like dumb people can really do a lot that we can see we're saying if you really believe that there is you know make up but it doesn't even have to be Jesus or our gods I don't want to offend anybody but if you really if somebody really believed that Odin had carved his path in eternity and that his his destiny was chosen for and by the gods and he would go forth with that kind of confidence like if you really believe that Odin has carved a path for you to destiny and you really believe that like that's got to be a powerful weapon it's just having that that belief there's something to that whether it's real or not it might become real because you think it's real like the placebo effect is just one little one little sliver of this weird puzzle of managing the mind and managing the way you interface with reality with people with with life itself with you know different choices that you make I don't think we understand it 100% I don't I think we just assume that like physical acts are like all that's going on you know like he picked up that box he moved it over there like physical acts or all that's going on I don't think so man I think they're just like there's some some weird connection that we're all sharing that's getting closer and closer it's getting weirder and weirder people are getting shittier and nicer at the same time it's happening there's a boiling point I think people are way nicer than they ever were before you know what we used as an example the bro-hug people didn't bro-hug back in the day they shook hands we were talking about that new stand-up show on Showtime I'm dying up here and one of the things Bill burr said he goes he goes they got the handshake wrong he was talking about it last night he's like he goes they hugged he goes nobody nobody hug back then because they would do like a low five or something like that and he's like I was like you're right you're right they didn't hug like that they still like they did like like the knuckle thing back then though maybe having arrives for sure I still like a high five I think high five is silly it's fun I like high five I always miss people's high fives and I feel like an idiot like I'm always like high five to me he's like fun like high five is fun like a handshake you could just be just cordial and friendly but this has got some fun to it time you did a low five what's that man I can't remember cuz you got to get a low five back it's problem with low five high five is egalitarian everyone's equal it's just high five low five we have to decide well who's hitting who you hit me am i hitting you you gonna hit me first and then I'm gonna hit you back how's this work okay you go first ready go flap flap nobody does that anymore slap yeah I haven't done that No so because people figured out we don't have to do this we can just do this it's better what's up like I feel happy when I give people high-fives I'm a knuckle guy man just too much too much crank guy too much steam yeah you gotta wash your phone man I was reading this thing about cell phones they were saying they're dirtier than half the toilets of the world oh yeah because you never wash your phone you touch everything you like God wash your hands we're just touching your ass meanwhile you pick up your phone you're checking your Twitter you're smudging all kinds of weird fucking biomes all of your screen I saw you you know like there's butt wipes where they had like the little container where you like pull them up wipes out like those things like you reuse them like but if you think about that oh yeah around the where you're grabbing it like I need another one I need another one I got some on my finger oh yeah for sure that happens if you mess up yeah I just use the packs I don't even use the Box anymore and you gotta be careful with those things too because you don't want to get antibacterial butt wipes like you don't want to use antibacterial stuff on your body unless it's like natural stuff like that um I said do Jiu Jitsu with this dude who got ringworm and after he got ringworm he started putting antibacterial soap all over his body but that killed all of his his natural skin flora and then he got it everywhere it was crazy how much did he use I mean because I used that antibacterial soap that like a hardcore not the shoe tree stuff you know this it looks amber you say this stuff they extract the insects DNA and Jurassic Park that stuff like it stinks again cemented cameras on it yeah it's hand antibacterial soap and a lot of people like that would get like ringworm or something like that they would use that on their whole body but the problem of that stuff is it kills everything it kills all the stuff that's fighting off the ringworm - kills everything snoops the territory yeah I use tea tree for all that crap trees - shit is the shit you say the smell eucalyptus and you live to soil there's a company called defense oh yeah about a long time let me not a sponsor guys awesome and his stuff is amazing for that like keeping healthy skin floor we just have to think of our bodies whether it's your gut floor your skin floor all that stuff you gotta think of your body as the ecosystem you know mm-hmm defense ups are really great I use that all the time but I do you ever use it like for like a jujitsu is that what it's made for it's made for well he made it for grappling but it's great for just skin just like it's just good for your skin it's enough chemically cuz I use it like as my soap for you it's all bad for you all it's good for your skin that's the thing about it it's like it's not damaging the healthy stuff there's no poisons it's not like antibacterial soaps or a lot of times it's like really heavy chemicals they're just stripping away everything you know a bacteria lives our skin and a lot of it is good apparently that's like staffs all over you all the time like when people get an infection and it's a staph infection what it is you get an open sore and then your body through whatever for whatever reason can't fight off that staff that's already there there's now getting into your bloodstream and you get infected that swells up and gets nasty and then there's that immersive staff that staff that they get at hospitals because people been taking antibiotics for so long they have medication resistant staph and it scares the fuck out of people you have to be unlike IV drugs for weeks sometimes people are just rekt rekt by it happens to a lot of fighters man it's like the silent killer of fight careers is mersa now with that whole Kevin Randleman off yeah you don't know if that was MRSA or just untreated staff I don't know if it was mersa or just regular staff work guy yeah Kevin had he had a bad I've seen a lot of guys have it bad I've seen guys with holes looks like somebody stabbed them in a leg and it was as though their body was I think it's called a necrophile or something like that yeah when you're yeah necrophile that's not the word what is the word no yeah but it's there's a word that when your skin starts becoming dead in in certain areas because of a lot of it's like Widow bites will do that brown recluse bites will do that staph infection will do that - yeah there's a lot of witness yeah term but it's something necro it does something to your skin just there's a lot of those fucking creepy little bugs it'll do that - man never seen someone like what it looks like when someone gets bitten by a brown recluse no fuck dude if you get beaten if you don't take care of it like really quickly it can go super bad like those things eat through your body we sleep in so many hotels and shit have you ever had bedbugs because that said like I thought I haven't but you could definitely get it I feel like I get bug bites every time there's holes that's all from a brown recluse bite yeah there's in LA or California no yeah they have some of them in California but I think they're more in the Midwest but they definitely have them here yeah look at that yeah mostly around there so it's mostly looks like some Texas and a lot of this outfit fucking scary ass bug man wow that's a scary 10 sharks found in the homes basement pool what some guy in New York had 10 sharks that were in a 15-foot above-ground pool in his basement three of them were dead when they found them fucking mind Wow well he might have okay they were two feet two four feet long those are little sharks he might have been trying to do some sort of a deal to put a fish tank in somebody's house and he acquired these sharks for it or he's a nutty dude and he wanted to keep sharks and fish sharks but here's the thing like I knew people that had sharks in their fish tanks like everyone's all gung-ho to save the sharks now that was not the case like 10-15 years ago when people had swimming pools or nut swimming pools fish tanks like crazy fish tanks sometimes people would have like little sharks you stop crazy fish yeah just have piranhas allegedly this may or may not be true I might have found some in my friends house in Bowling Green one time yeah they're boring it's boring until it's go time and then you're like whoa I want to get it like a lie guys are not octopus what's this look like things that glow and not like the black lights jellyfish I want to get like a jellyfish aquarium like you can I got to get that with the light so it just looks like you have a ghost in your corner of your hat they died easy though unfortunately yeah I was talking to a scientist about it and she was explaining that they have like Mandalay Bay has this you've seen the thing that where they have the jelly get to the tank of jellyfish so you could buy a little tiny jellyfish yeah no quotas but you can buy one so yeah but she was explaining that they they have to constantly like shuffle them in they like take out the dead ones put in the new ones and they breed them there Wow do you ever see the one they have at Mandalay Bay dude it's the shit yeah it's like a circular one it lights up different colors dude is beautiful look at these guys they look too much like twins to be boyfriend's right right is so creepy their boyfriends and there were that close to each other that's that's a weird thing to have laying around what do they eat I think just algae oh so is this like a GoFundMe or some shit the one they had at Mandalay Bay was badass because it was this big like acrylic cylinder and they're all swimming around and they changed the colors you like yeah I think that'd be cool to have now they're alive man I mean it's they're alive but is that it yeah I think I remember them having wow that's the one Ian Mandalay Bay I'm probably conflating it with one from one of the aquariums that I've been to but fuck that's beautiful see how pretty they are can you imagine doing mushrooms and just looking at that shit they're so pretty but it seems kind of fucked to have them trapped in a tube and they're just swimming around they can't go anywhere like isn't part of the magic of being a jellyfish is the fact that you're a jellyfish in the ocean and you just start constantly moving through the ocean or have we decided that the jellyfish is too primitive for it to truly experience the majesty of the ocean and fuck him get in the tube and gambler's just gonna stare at you I mean that's essentially what we decided feed baby shrimp they feed at least once a day so I was insane baby brine shrimp so like sea monkeys ate sea monsters god they're so weird-looking you know what's interesting if we found oh you have to like a separate tank for all that stuff let's say you have two tanks what is that that's the baby brine shrimp yeah Oh weird that's a beef jerky how bizarre Oh them in this little sheet strange you have to put it in a baster and squeeze it in there or something whoa the size and number of jellies would determine how much to feed oh you have to be like really specific it's over feet and get some fat jellyfish dude or are they gonna get out into our toilets and then I look how their feet am man that's crazy he's cool they just squirted it out there I wonder if they came back in goes out now I'm back in I'll figure it out I'll just I'll do the right thing all right I'll measure it and I'm sure a dead jellyfish looks just the same you know it's just floats not they're not moving enough though you want and look look who's pouring it in there look at him out he didn't that's crazy they're actually reacting here's the thing like they're so primitive we probably don't feel that bad when they die like if a goldfish dies like poor little dude his eyeballs yeah that's they had eyeballs their face is right yeah like people I've heard people say don't eat anything with a face but they usually don't eat oysters those people you know like gotta eat oysters ma'am I love oysters until you have bad oysters had some bad oysters the other day I definitely have before that's the worst yeah I mean there's a possibility right you're eating something wrong yeah did you know there's so many different kinds of oysters like I never knew that it was like like tons of different kinds of oysters yeah I don't know a lot about them but uh I do you know if you go to a place they give you a variety you get like a dozen you get three of each like whoa these kumamotos and there's a lot in the Pacific Northwest I know people like around the Seattle area they actually let you go out and get them and get clams and stuff like that there's a certain kind that you're not supposed to eat anymore because of some kind of pollution levels or something like that oh really yeah they go clamming in the Pacific Northwest it's pretty they get big-ass clams too man they go digging them right on the shore they just like bring a bucket and just dig into the sand pop those fuckers out that's pretty badass you'll find some clams Santa Barbara has the biggest oyster farm like interrupt for a while like it's huge and it's usually like go out and have these underground cages and they lift them up and wow they just pick them and eat them and that's good enough hmm wonder how much they're affected by pollution I think it's a lot what's up aren't they not like fully used for pollution but don't they clean they like shit out of the ground yeah like to clean the water I thought that's what they're kind of like the ocean filters hmm well that's what lobsters are right lobsters and crabs they eat all the dead shit that's a isn't it interesting they're so goddamn delicious and all they eat is rotten shit all the time spirit lobsters are so delicious like sometimes you forget sometimes you forget then you get up I'm like a Maine lobster when you dip them in butter and like good god this is fucking delicious time-lapse of oysters filtering water whoa super dirty water here and then Wow couple hours go by holy shit yeah did they just like poop him out though to make an oysters bitch just throw a bunch of sand in that water see what the fuck goes down yeah it seems like they're filter in the waters that's crazy they're incensed look nature has a plan for all its little weird things and I bet they have all sorts of I mean you think about that we need plants for oxygen right plants actually create oxygen and we create carbon dioxide and plants live off carbon dioxide it's weird how there's all these like little relationships that all these different beings have like back and forth all over all over nature so many of them in so many weird parasites and symbiotic relationships that animals have with each other it's a dome bro it's flat it's a dome it's all simulation I'm blown away I just got a dehumidifier the other day yesterday and how much water you can pull out of your air like I've already it's a 70 gallon drum or tank and I've already emptied it three times 70 70 pint so many pints are you doing your house man pretty huge bucket of water in just like four hours that just pulled out of my house that's crazy yeah no it's just like from your body no it's from in the air I see I've been we've been using our air conditioning so much lately that mine started like leaking everywhere that goddammit sitting and it's making the house wet yeah you know it's making my floors fucked so yes I'm trying to suck all the water out of it everything so it just pulls it from the air in you know humidity and stuff that's weird because la is pretty dry yeah but not lately it's been pretty shit yeah this wall it's not shitty we need water man you know if we we we barely got away with what we got last winter you know they're kind of brought everything back to pretty normal but like like Lake to hone to hone ranch still half full of water that's what my from like my personal experience what I can say about how weird the drought was there was a lake that we used to drop people out of helicopters into it fear factor and it went away like the lake didn't exist anymore there was no lake all the fish died all of them it was there were huge fish in that Lake like big largemouth bass they were all over the place man people would go from miles around to go fish they're dead still dead today there's nothing there Wow it's a little bit of water now a little bit of water like maybe like last time I was there I'd have to go see it again to get a good read on it but uh the last time I talked to somebody was there was like half full you know would be interesting it means it's really shallow if it gets a rain if we and it comes back to life if how long it would take for the first fish to find its way there do two probably a million years or a seagull just accidentally drops one in it's the thing about these what is that no that's like just a ik so how Lake a stake in 2008 seventeen looks pretty good it's back that's nice yeah that's another place we used to have drop people out of helicopters that was talking about - hoan lake though I type that in I thought and this is what came up instead well that's pretty close it's it's on the way but uh yeah that that place has giant striped bass I saw on the stuntmen on fear factor they would go fishing look in between stunts they held like a lunch break and these guys caught these like in like 20 minutes caught these giant a striped bass that place is awesome that was half gone you know so we got to see it with our own eyes like places like drying up and just because it caught it and it turned around because the weather changed doesn't mean it can't happen instead of three four years five six years how about thirty years thirty years of no rain go fuck yourself now that's that can happen yeah I think it's gonna be the opposite I think just how bad of rain that we had last year and I think this winter I think we're just gonna get pounded I think it and like all the Burbank mountains that with all the fires I think we're gonna get flooded now from all the mudslides that that's gonna cause because I I think that's into the road ships just continuing to go on see I don't think it really is the end of the world and it's not even the end of us it's just that what we thought was permanent was very fragile and that fucks with our head but you just got to go and do it knowing that you can't think that those hills are gonna stay up I think it's right those houses are gonna slide you know just like there's some fucking people that built their houses like this like hanging off the side of a cliff with like spikes into the side of the hill you've seen those houses there's a lot of those right like on Laurel you look at that house you go where's that one gonna go that's gonna slide down here remember they shut down Laurel Canyon like a few months back because one of the porches back porch like 9,000 fucking pounds slid down the hill all concrete and shit and you know that's gonna happen it a comedy store at one point like every time it ran behind it every time it rains I'm scared to fuck to be that house that movie eat like that house is preposterous stupid oh they hate to live that was that Robert De Niro movie he what a crazy view they must have though there's a lot of those houses man look at that that is you have to be such an optimist right like look at that fucking house look at that thing up on giant ass metal poles seems like a such a pattern every night you hear some crazy homeless man sawing at your place oh man try to sleep that's all nah man no no no saw check out this ad form from 1965 none of those are safest buildings as far as land sides in earth tremors are oh my god so Larry none of those are exist anymore oh this the cliff dwellings amongst the safest of all buildings as far as landslides and earth tremors are concerned are supported by steel girders planted deep in the ground anchored to heavy iron bells far below the surface actually that gets me kind of excited I like that the engineer the shit out of it like that that's actually I like when someone solves like what seems like a alright I'm on board now I want a stilt house with metal bells so it's like your house is supported by kettlebells motherfucker yeah until the I don't know they probably didn't have like a 5.0 earthquake they were probably like at least look good for like a the strongest earthquakes at 3.40 good for all earth quakes you don't know shit bro but none of these houses exist anymore in the upper right hand corner there's like one of my favorite pictures to scroll up past the station a spaceship house I love that that house is the shit that is the fucking coolest house of all time I think it's just sold it recently I would never want to live there that seems like the perfect house for you though it's too freaky I would go deep I need to stay calm like if I lived in a spaceship I don't trust myself I was just I just got good ear on White's house recently it's a nice house yeah you know Ron's story what happened yeah who went out of town came back and he there was a leak on the first floor and it flooded well on the top floor the third floor rather and it flooded down to the second the first floor filling all of them up with water yeah it's at 7:40 and he just had it finished no fuck yeah hey it's called here's like a Greek recording studio in there and I got a bar it's like a pimp house sure it is Ron White's that shit badass I love that guy he was just an Austin doing a benefit show with Aliza and Chris D'Elia and they raised like 250,000 dollars in just one show yeah that's awesome man sweet that's awesome I heard about that yeah now Ron White's fucking fantastic I love that man he's beautiful he's an animal you ever hear of a app called next door or next door next door it's one of the greatest things ever it's uh it's like reddit for your neighborhood No so it's pretty much you login and you have to live in this neighborhood or you can't get in pretty much kind of and it's like it's cool because there's little things like hey I got this you know dresser if anyone wants it or you know things like that but it's also like hey I saw a black guy the other day in the neighborhood which one the mass text bit oh yeah don't say anymore yeah but it's the most addicting thing ever and it's very helpful like if you have a lost pet or a cat and or if but it's one of my favorite things to read now I just go home I'm giddy about it like oh what's gone but we do have an interface that allows you to communicate with people like straight to your head how how quickly do you think you'd adopt it how quickly do you think you try it I guess if you could turn it off I would try it pretty clear right why do you trust the government man yeah I'm worried about my car right now being hacked you know it's a little too much I got even have a emergency break anymore I have a button on that's like no I want to pull it and get emergency I don't want to push it yeah I like old cars for that yeah like I like a car that hasn't a fucking ebrake baby Yeah right right those are the ones you want to with the button on the top you don't want to stomp ebrake that's for assholes because you can't even control it you got to like stomp it and pull it back up and like you don't have like you can you can actually like control to e brake with the lever a little bit you can get yourself to go sideways with that thing my car has a bug yeah they probably don't have a thing my car is a bug though if like you plug in your iPhone before like too early and you don't hit the button that says you know agree do like the maps or whatever it's like hit okay if that goes away and then like if you have your air conditioning on and other things you can't turn them off so like the other day my stereo is like on full blast my air conditioning was like on full blast and I was trying to turn it all off while driving and it couldn't this is your yeah yeah it's it's got its a Apple home or air or car yes car place but if you disconnected your phone would it stop that's how I did it but at first I couldn't figure out what was going on yeah it's gonna happen yeah that's a dope car though I like it man it's it's cool it's it's a technological tour de force I could hook up Androids or it has like Android play on it also lets know most of them didn't have it which is kind of fucked I couldn't believe that they were getting away with going with apple carplay only because there's a lot of people that would buy like Chevy's and GM cars like Cadillacs in particular they have that apple carplay Porsches have that apple carplay I like it though the texting definitely I never text while driving anymore because now I just tell Siri - hey text Joe hey what's up yeah well you could do that with both hands on the wheel it's awesome yeah yeah I like it I'm a fan I'm a fan of those uh some of the new Japanese cars too man that some of that technology that they're coming over with whoo mm-hmm they got some incredible shit they just put out this new Lexus the Lexus LC 500 CV you'd find Lexus LC 500 in atomic silver they're like making future cars like you know remember when you were your kid and you thought about cars in the future like what they would look like this car looks like a future car do you see the first flying car yes I saw it yesterday on the news I don't know if it was I think was real yeah I don't know if it was real quick it looks like I'm sure there would be something look at that thing look at that car beautiful that's a spaceship look at that thing I mean that looks like some Sylvester Stallone movie from 1998 you know there year 2060 yeah especially an atomic silver there's something about that silver color that looks that's all that's a rendering but that's a ridiculous looking car cars are so sexy nowadays I really like them well they can do so much now they brake for you they recognize objects on the side they give you warnings yeah mine has that Lane Departure so like if I'm texting and not paying attention and I go out of my lane it pushes you back in yeah or if somebody stops it's in front of you it's on the brace holy shit yeah which that kind of freaks me out because what if there isn't something there and it just malfunctions and slam on my brakes you know well it probably can happen I mean anything that's automated can't fuck up just like a person fuck's up is this a flying car it's called the what the lilium jet William jet we believe in a world everyone can fly anywhere anytime oh Jesus anywhere like what about Hawaii bitch without your old joke that you're gonna fly across the country and that's I don't trust that guy he looks a little wacky and so he's on adderall can I sell me a dream the vision becomes reality no this is like the beginning of a science fiction movie and fuck you doing are you bringing in organism from space isn't so this is real is it real this is the first test flight it says it's probably slowest fuck up a little just floats through the air 300 kilometers an hour so what do we decide that is somewhere around 150 150 that guy takes too much ecstasy I don't trust him he's got that look in his eyes you know that look when a guy's done a lot of ecstasy party he doesn't look real as shadows Jamie look in the comments look in the comments they're not a man dreams you sons of bitches but does it squeeze I was reading an article about what they were calling a Russian troll farm that they have a like troll farm like make it I'm a business out of trolling I met someone recently that his he worked at a meme factory what and I didn't really ask a lot of more questions about that cuz I just assumed it was like someone working for that fuck Jerry account where's I four or five guys that all work together to just about memes all day but he literally was literally working downtown somewhere and Job Description was whatever I mean factor that's kind of hilarious yeah cool Java you know like by the way mad props to some people that actually use the internet like when the guy that writes for Wendy's Twitter I don't know if you've been following this is some of the funniest shit ever think whoever it Bravo you are the king of Twitter but like people like talking shit on Wendy's he'll come back with like some of the best comic timing ever Wendy's owned a Twitter troll so hard they deactivated their account so that's the first one our beef is right your beef is frozen we all know it you all know we laugh at your slogan fresh never frozen right like you're really a joke Wendy says sorry to hear you think that but you're wrong we've only ever used fresh beef since we were founded in 1969 the other guy says so you deliver it raw on a hot truck he says where do you store cold things that aren't frozen Wow Donald's got you guys beat with the dope ass breakfast and then he said Wendy says you don't have to bring them in to us just because you forgot refrigerators existed great like that's kind of funny oh and they handled that really well Wendy's has been doing this for about a year now just non-stop listen I don't like to get burgers on the road I don't like to get fast food but if I do that's the one I go to Indies all day les there's an in and out nearby and I've got extra time you'll get have extra time Wendy's will give it to you in a shockingly quick amount of time fast like how is that even possible it's actually hot like what are you just anticipating selling a certain amount of double cheeseburgers whitney's Burbank is also that when in the future stores they're testing where you walk in and you order off this huge iPad like wall and and then your food comes and it's like you don't have to even talk to anybody anymore yeah there's a lot of those now right yeah the other thing Wendy's does is they let you be a total fucking slob and order a three a triple cheeseburger they have it like right there on the menu it doesn't even look crazy like when I go to in-and-out I order a three by three I feel like an asshole elbow with Wendy's it's like it's right there in and out I'm asking for some shit that doesn't even exist on their menu supposedly that looks good look at that Dave's hot and oozy 3/4 triple you motherfucker whenever I eat one of those I'm like this is such a preposterous sandwich a fat burger they have all the pictures on the wall of everyone that's finished the giant fucking trip right or that's so great it's such a big thing it's as big as people's heads it's giant yeah it's like slightly was speaking of giant did you see that fucking guy that had a bladder stone that was the size of an ostrich egg and he get it he had to get it removed from his body that wasn't dude that's the craziest thing I've seen in my life like this guy had a rock inside of his body that his own body made look at the size of that thing look at the guy having it in his hand so what does that made out all right what is in you know who the question that's a good question I think that's what it is but you taste you know hey guess what do you think we taste like salt it salt yeah why is that any weirder than licking salt that came out of the ground right take that you grind it up and put it on your steak nobody cares I'd lick my own stone like somebody else's find out CT scans of the man's abdomen also revealed another much smaller stone the man's left your reader which is the tube that carries the urine from the kidneys to the bladder according to the report which is published today blah blah blah the doctors who treated the man noted that he had invasive bladder cancer more than a decade before he developed this the stones well wonder how long it took him to make these stones oh man if they just keep making them have to make up fucking they have to build a door into his body where they could reach in once a month and pull out an oxygen exercise Rock yeah like how often is it one of those things cook up inside your body Scotty years huh that's an issue with not that in particular with kidney stones or an issue with fighters sometimes I cut a lot of weight comes a unwanted side effect real bad too mad kidney stones are brutal a lot of guys have cancelled fights because the kidney stones matter I don't actually know I've never had him Matt Mitrione actually had him before his fate or fighting they had to cancel the first time they were supposed to meet cuz kidney stones super cotton but Matt's a heavyweight which is even weirder cuz heavyweights don't have to dry themselves out but somehow some people just like genetically are predisposed to getting them and if somebody gets him that's when you pee out right yeah you pick it up she gets it like maybe every six months she has that's horrible yeah fuck man wonder if it's like a diet thing I think that's a little bit of that I think it's also just some people just or you know get them all the time yeah it's also like the diet thing just so not fair some people just scarf no they just chow down pizza and check they do it right in front of everybody and they look like teeb yeah oh yeah well dude eats pizza every day he works out a lot though scoff does work out a lot look good man good amounts of good taking something else like I know I'm not I go to the gym three times a week Tony Oh how many times do you think Tony's going to gym he's worked out with me before what I think I think he's just worked on the same areas no thing on the treadmill versus did some weights lifted some weights one he's pretty ripped think he lifts weights he does a little bit lifting he's shockingly ripped out think we finally have a contest she's not on Jamie I think Jamie works out way more than Tony Tony Tony it might be like I'll take you up on your contest another one yeah we still have to figure out what we're gonna do with this other one because Ari went back to New York we got nowhere with that fucking visit yeah we barely did they wanted to wrap it up well we're gonna versus what is it well we came to one idea which was a contest Jean Segura Bert Ari and me that for the for 30 days of October no booze and yeah to do 15 yoga classes we all agreed on that one 15 hot yoga classes 90-minute classes with no breaks right or something no breaks Ari wants to take breaks like a bitch I was gonna lose anyway I feel like that's one of the reasons why we say well what I'm gonna do break photos took a break to go to pee I need to pee I'm a Jew Jews need to pee never he said that that didn't make sense he peed twice during the show he pulls his dick out and pisses into a kombucha jar what he's why he's doing that shit a lot - wow man jungle for months he lived with you know AG natives and shit yeah he's out there in the forest he's crazy but so he's basically backing out he's like I can't do it the kids staring living out of a suitcase I'm like bitch you were in Asia for four months living out of a backpack sleeping in hostels now I'll sudden you're back you gotta taste the good life didn't he also was that already walking around naked why is he walking around naked oh they went to the desert last night oh they do mushrooms yeah so ours just wandering around Jesus Christ that makes sense there's a place next to me has a new kind of yoga used to try out I want to try it out it's outdoors it's baby goat yoga and it's pretty much you do all this yoga and then there's just baby goats that will climb on you while you're doing it and run around and stuff like that oh it's most like the baby goats like feel good yeah shit your face well yeah they down there they don't do that so these people are doing their yoga and while they're doing yoga they have to do it around these goats the guys probably like I don't know why I decided up for this girls have fucking incredible balance man like from the box like right out of snatch they can climb a tree now you should have baby goats I think why not well I had a friend who had goats I had a friend of got goats cuz he has a big piece of land in Topanga and the goats ate everything they don't stop eating man they don't just eat the hay either they're like fuck your head and they just start wandering through you look at that goat climb a tree man how does that happen don't climb the fucking palm tree they just can do that's the crazy how's it getting get down they calm down dude yes I am so amazed by baby goats I want one so bad yeah these things are crazy did it fall videos of eagles coming in swooping knees yeah but that's different they grab muffled they definitely fall they have fallen in the past they definitely fall and animals sometimes like bears in particular if you see a bear eating a mountain goat a lot of times it's because the mountain goat fell you know like bears most the time are not catching mountain goats that's one of the reasons why they're live adapted to live in these crazy environments is because predators can't get to them they're like this is what they've done they figured out a way to exist yeah like keep that thing there man hold on Jesus Christ I want to see what the fuck happens but look at what it's doing like trying to figure out how to turn around I mean he's on the side of a cliff and also it knows not to do anything stupid and he's not freaking out amazing it's almost like their brains don't have the ability at all my god oh my god I'm freaking out like the way those things can catch themselves yeah and the way it can walk on the side oh oh my god and they're not scared of heights at all at all like they don't have that in them - that one looks young you know I think that what you saw like that slip right there that could definitely slip to its death it definitely could um it must happen every now and then somebody attached a like a GoPro to an eagle recently and they live stream that on periscope and it was one of the most fascinating things just seeing an eagle fly around and look like well like look to the right and see like a little dot move and so they don't get closer and and it was a cool camera view so I don't know if it's on YouTube now but it's very interesting to watch that is crazy that you can do that now right yeah I put a camera on an eagle and see things from his perspective mm-hmm did you ever see that photo series of photos where a mountain lion tried to kill a goat and they both fell to their death yeah a mountain a mountain goat was the mountain goat or was it a she made a mountain sheep I think was a bighorn sheep yeah it was like yeah it was like a mountain lion and a bighorn sheep and they're both splattered on the fucking highway it's a it's amazing though it's an amazing series of images like I mean I'm not a cruel person this is not me being cruel but I think there's something beautiful about that and this is what I think it's beautiful about that gay go to like full screen with that thing just go fullscreen to that one picture that you had up that's all right go full layout look at that I mean they're both gone they're both next to a cliff the only way this happens right it's you see the the horn off to the left that's his other horn hey check it off now it blew off I mean they probably fell a long way go to the series now that's a it's that what's crazy about it's like it represents how hard that life is like look it's just blood pouring out of its head that's nuts that is nuts man we're they or the horn blew off holy shit god damn dude look at that mountain lion tweet - - - tweet - it's got a mouthful of fur bro never let go that is so powerful that is so powerful it probably had it in its mouth as they went down they both went down together dude this is a daddy is a goddamn powerful series of images look at that back up and see the height of that cliff holy fuck stick blank surprised he didn't land on his feet he probably held on that goat the entire way down that fucking murderer fell from somewhere Jesus how high that is found on a closed Road near Glacier National Park dude we got to get those images for the studio see if those they're for sale find out those are for sale I have a poster printer you just send them to me I'll print out for you I think you're supposed to apply all right those are like there's something powerful bye that's not like just a picture of a kid with a balloon right you know something about that like somebody had to be there to get that picture this did she get some money printers are pretty amazing that is I got this poster printer for like two hundred three hundred dollars and it it prints like pretty decent-sized posters and so like you can just go go hey you know I've always wanted a you know werewolf poster and you just print it out it's like going to the store boom you have it for how big I probably say like maybe 31 by 20 or something I don't know I've been seeing a lot of stuff that special effects guys like Rick Baker are doing with 3d printing now they're making all these like masks and heads and shit with 3d printing imagine if you could just like make something in a computer and then go over to the 3d printer and print that bitch out for some things that's perfect like I just lost like a little battery cover to one of my remotes the other day and I bet if I had a 3d printer I could find the model of the battery cover and just print it out or make it fuck yeah that's amazing right yeah when you really think I mean that how much of that is going to be like the future of objects you know the future of things like how much less shit would you have to sell people if you could just sell them oh whoa I would print that out does that Rick Baker's Popeye whoa MakerBot 3d printer I believe oh yeah oh that's amazing starts and then he paints it wow that's crazy look at that one right above it that's so cool Wow go back to that other one that you just had with that hold of the whole series of them there's the Benicio del Toro werewolf yeah sort of pretty close to in the middle god damn that's amazing that'd be fun to pay Yeah right once it's 3d printed out right these guys have so many tools at their disposal now but I wonder how much of that is gonna be lost like all the special effects makeup stuff in the transition to CGI because it seems like it's just inevitable that CGI keeps getting better and better and better arguments for having a mix of this and using practical effects and like I saw the clip of that American werewolf actually moving in the back room while they were testing it out it looks obviously fake as shit but you can't we know what to look for now on that fake stuff and it really is catching us off guard all the time just like when we saw the video right away we're like a fake fake fake right and even when it looks good ten years later you look back at something and you're like god that looks horrible why dude I played King Kong the original King Kong for my kids a couple years back and they were laughing they were so scared at first and I was telling no I'm not showing anything scary I'm like this is gonna be really funny it's so silly it's it doesn't seem real at all and they were like no that's the monster oh yeah that's the monster and you know because they're little kids they overlap like I fell down and they're being so silly it was really funny I really wish that nuke that King Kong Island was better I hated that movie small man how many times you can tell a stupid story and it's a racist story anyway King Kong surrounded by black chicks never cares one white chick shows up he loses his fucking mind he's climbing buildings bring her to the top he breaks out of chains it's so stupid look how big he is at that big they changed him a bunch of times yeah different versions they have a graph that shows all the sizes from all the past movies to him and Godzilla well the Japanese movie was a big one they made him like 500 feet tall or something crazy so I think he was supposed to be like 50 feet tall and the first one is that over there King Kong escapes 1967 that's the 118-foot 12 foot tall at 1933 1 Wow that's it yeah that's what I'm saying he looks as small compared to like wow and then he was 12 feet tall the son of Kong oh that's the little one yeah King Kong lives that was my Ferris all that in a theatre see he was pretty goddamn big he was a thousand feet tall yeah Godzilla's gonna fuck him up yeah period how much bigger is how is that he not even close the new Godzilla super fuck him up the new Godzilla's goddamn terrifying seems to be thinking you can't make a good one of these that was which year's all Island 1s the newer one the newer one you mean you can only make so many of these goddamn things you know after why it's like let me guess you know the girls gonna make it she's gonna be fine gonna have a few close calls we're gonna be real excited well she told me okay this is the girl that blonde lady gonna be okay meanwhile he's stomping on black chicks left and right stop it his way through the village step it on black dudes just that white girl he's just so enthralled by her it's the most racist movie of all time really like the first time King Kong sees a white chick he loses his shit I went down a rabbit hole the other day watching that one gorilla that you know Robin Williams used to hang out with all the time what's that gorilla Coco have you ever watched it okay I love that it's pretty amazing they're very smart man very smart yeah I mean they're not like people smart but they're like you you understand that they're not it's that you this is not like a gopher or a groundhog or something like they're on a completely different level yeah than most other mammals besides us Coco recently got some new kittens and it's watch it's amazing watching him play with the kittens I think it's a girl right yeah her sorry notice gendered Coco bro that's just one of those animals you just think it's a guy you know you look at it's like it's like how I look at dogs I consider them guys and cats girls for some reason yeah because she could smash your fucking head in any time she wants to you almost wrong thing must be you know it yet she's so gentle they're vegetarians too they're sweeties gorillas are big sweeties for the most part what's really kind of nuts man is chimpanzees how smart they are she's twerking she's twerking hey can I get on that strong torques by the way love it she has been working on her host skills she's not just this is not like her first time doing that she's developed those fast twitch butt muscles you know we could really torque girls who twerk and you go whoa you really do know how to do this you know you're feeling a little kid try to do a yo-yo they don't quite get it yeah Yoga doesn't come back all the way like shit you try to teach them how you gonna like go down and then go up and they never get it that's the same thing was like a amateur twerker like a girl doesn't really know how to twerk they don't have that kind of pop and bounce that that girl did that girl has done a lot of things she probably regrets she's probably been hammered more than once doing that she's probably gone but to but with other girls I love but - but yeah but - but yeah it's been one love to become such an ass man in the last couple years way better why I can't even imagine I was a tit guy for so long like asses have really well you can enjoy the whole woman by the way yeah that's like the the male feminist approach asshole maybe just treat him there's a whole woman not think of it as like a tit guy or an ass guy mm see that many girls are like I'm not a dick girl you know I like the mouth I like to eat my box and shut their mouth naina dicks I saw that I looked up I had to find the blac chyna naked photos boobs are back oh they're back new house amazing boobs are back when the fuck did boobs go away see this is just like people run our shit to talk about that's what it is it's like half of things that we discuss in this podcast like what what are they doing well which shooting the shit folks congrats for printing it congratulations on that that that New York Times retraction that you pretty much cause that was pretty beautiful watching that cook I mean it is a guy who wrote it and it was printed in the New York Times right you know I mean it was in the New York Times but it's an individual's choice maybe an editor's choice to embellish the reality of what happened they said that connor's it was about the boxing match they said that his face was covered in blood completely covered in blood and that he was rescued before he fell through the ropes neither one of those things are true it's just not true his face wasn't bloody at all I mean he a little bit of a swelling under his left eye he was definitely getting punched in the face and I definitely agree with the stoppage of the fight he was exhausted and he was falling all over the place but it was more that Floyd was just teeing off on him and he wasn't firing back there was no blood and he didn't he wasn't gonna fall through the ropes he might have went down might have went down at one point in the fight I mean if if Floyd kept punched him that might be actually a smart move for him catch ten seconds you know do a standing eight count get up at the counter or you know and do it go down to a knee rather get up at the count of eight you know they they brush your gloves off you get a second or two there then you go back in maybe that'd be enough for him to get through the round you know because he was for sure having a real hard time recovering but what the New York Times wrote was just not true like what it was was just as juicy what it was is 40-year old boxer comes out of retirement in schools the you know number one most popular MMA fighter in the world in a boxing match proving what a lot of experts already knew that a specialist someone is the greatest specialist of all time when it comes to boxing I mean it's pretty arguable Floyd's in like the there's like two or three people you could argue like the greatest of all time in my opinion Floyd is the number one but he beat Conor McGregor in a way that you would expect a real specialist to beat someone who's just pretty good at it he was masterful it's fuckin awesome to watch and what Conor said afterwards hilarious too I turned him into a Mexican he fought like a Mexican because that's what people love about Mexican fighters that mexican fighters are no for coming straight at you like Mexican fighters aren't dancers they're not dancing around and you know doing the Ollie shuffle they're like Julio Cesar Chavez there's moving forward you know they're like Marco Antonio Barrera they're moving forward Mexican boxers are like some of the proudest most rugged warriors ever that's how Floyd fought fought really did fight like a super technical aggressive brawling styling tired Conor out that beat his ass it's beautiful man beautiful for boxing beautiful for for the overall art of fighting because it we need to see these things I think this thing that we're all participating in it fans of MMA practitioners of MMA this thing that we're all participating in is trying to figure out what style is the very best style for fighting period and then we found along the way that it varies it varies on the individual styles make fights and then sometimes one guy can beat another guy but that guy can beat someone could beat him and it gets real weird like MMA math is like one of the squirrely is fucking predictors of like who's gonna win a fight ever but we're finding out like what what's fucking real like when you've got all the belief in yourself in the world when you've got knockout power when you really believe you could beat the greatest boxer of all time what happens oh you get fucked up okay that's good it's good to learn it's good to learn it's good to learn that even though he lands that if he lands a few shots makes it a real interesting contest good to learn that the best specialist of all time is that for a reason this isn't bullshit this is a Floyd Mayweather he's 49 and now now he's 50 you know I mean that's that's good for combat sport it's good for everybody that's what's so stupid about this whole boxing versus MMA feud it's so dumb it gets everybody excited about fights and this inter competition thing between an MMA fighter coming over to boxing that's even more fun because then it gets like everything excited on both sides and I think it's gotten a lot of people super excited about Canelo Alvarez and triple G which is next weekend people are super pumped up about that fight particularly because we just passed this Conor Floyd Mayweather fight Floyd a weather has his way with Connor just puts on a display and now we're gonna get to see instead of the master versus a guy who really wasn't on his level now we're gonna get to say two guys in their prime at the top of the food chain two of the top three top four powerful power fighters in the world and they're gonna go out it so it's good for everybody they just don't these guys are so old-school they understand social media in a sense they know they can use it to promote fights they don't know that it's changed the whole community and that instead of like having some stupid rivalry with this other like sport MMA instead of having that just accept each other accept each other and and talk highly of the best examples in both sports and everybody will be fine I mean that's how you're seen with this Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather fight that's we're gonna see with the triple G Canelo Alvarez fight you don't have to be one or the other and the boxing people don't have to not like MMA I love boxing and I work in MMA I love boxing I watch all the big fights I'm always gonna it's fascinating it's awesome it's nice to know who the real specialists are you know when it comes to that I love kickboxing big fan of that too I like to know I love jiu-jitsu I wanna know wanna know what how good are the best guys what would happen the best guy in the UFC fought the best guy in jiu-jitsu in a straight-up jiu-jitsu match I want to see you know those are those things are interesting I want to see a boxer go to the UFC and see how you know I mean we had James Toney of course but James was way past his prime and it didn't even look like he trained for that fight I think James just took a payday if I had a guess you know and Randy just hit him with a low ankle pick took him down he maybe hit a low single I forget what it was but he went way low but either way there's not a chance in hell that James Toney was ever gonna stop Randy Couture from taking him down it's just not gonna happen he would have to catch him absolutely perfect coming in for the very first punch and if he didn't Randy was gonna just molest him see I was away with them excited about GSP yeah I mean I'm interested to see what happens quite honestly I wanted to see him at 170 I want to say I think him versus Woodley is the fight like Woodley's had two fights in a row where people like we're booing him I'm three really because he had two fights with wonderboy that were like chess matches and then one fight with Demian Maia which was also like just not the most exciting fight but I think him versus the GSP would be a very exciting fight I think that's the real fight cuz that's GSP real weight class too you know I'm interested in that but I'm interested in the Bisping fight too because I think it's a tough fight it's a tough fight for GSP Bisping is a handful he's a big fella too fought at 205 in the Ultimate Fighter fights in 185 in the UFC he's way bigger than George and he's gotten fucking tough man he's real good legitimately real good and George has been out for a long time you know what's he been doing any boys been training he's definitely stayed in shape he did a lot of gymnastics did a lot of exercise you know he made a shit ton of money when he was fighting you know he had contracts with Nike and he had some he had was it Nike or was it um I think he had something we had something we Gatorade but I want to say George had some wood maybe it's Under Armour he's got something with Under Armour yeah so he's got a bunch of big endorsements and he's a a giant hero in Canada I mean just giant right so I think for you know a while he's just recovering you know all those Wars all those years of getting in brawls then finally got to a point where his body started feeling real good again he's like fuck it let's get back in there I mean if the aliens are still around the alien they come to me I think red light I refused to drink she Gatorade anymore I used to drink a Gatorade every single day for the last like 20 years and then the other day busted one open drank it and it was something that felt like a raw egg went into my mouth and I spit it back in and it was just this low lob swing on it it's apparently a thing like just the Gatorade globs yeah it's actually I'm not the only one there's like kombucha see that that was in my mouth mmm top 119 complaints and reviews about Gatorade and in sumer affairs so you got one of these burns yeah in my mouth and I saved it up until about a week ago because I was going to just call them and but then I got who cares about this hub what are they saying it is well it's a load someone shot a load in there it was the grossest thing ever and it seriously I have like flashbacks and I can't I can I will never ever drink a Gatorade for the rest of my life and look at this crap this is wow that's just mold oh yes that's mold thick mouldy sugar or something right but who knows how long that's been sitting yeah that's one thing whenever you go to a gas station or stuff always look at the bottom of your container like if you're buying like a plastic bottle like apple juice right because I've noticed ever since then I'm so paranoid about anything and I tell you half the times I'm looking at the bottom like that does not look right like this looks like it's been mold or something things that are going around like McDonald's or the the dude was worried about Wendy's with the hot trucks there are things that are travel around in hot trucks you know like for real and I wonder if like what temperature Gatorade has to get to before shit starts growing in it and that's it I mean I did buy I bought my Gatorade from Amazon you know so Oh probably sitting in some hot warehouse yeah we're just cooking you know the one it's sealed I wonder like what does that mean when they seal it right like obviously airs not getting to it right now but there's some air in there what happens of that air right how's that air effect is shit growing in that air no I think there's chemicals in there to make sure that nothing happens like they found some 6,000 year old bottle of wine recently you see that yeah I think absolutely what they found was a 6,000 year old vessel that contained residue of wine I don't think they found like 6,000 year old bottle that you could just get fucked up on Imagine traces of 6,000 year old wine discovered in sicillian cave that's my people there they make it a fucking nice sauce they got a nice wine this guy's been growing wine for 16,000 fucking years uh-huh you gotta get this wine in you give this wine in yes where's the gravy 10,000 years his fucking family's been over here they used to have thumbs they used to pick the grape with their feet that's how long ago they did this these motherfuckers Wow those those pots that they found that is crazy these are 6,000 year old pots they used to hold wine yeah yeah some kid found a sit don't change that yet though I want to look at this for a second that just trips me out that those big vessels are 6,000 years old that is so weird man that is so fucking long ago to try to pretend what life was like 2,000 years before Christ that's essentially what you're looking at there right or fourth that yeah four thousand years before Christ six now so six thousand years ago no Christ was zero right so it's 2017 so it's 2,000 years past Christ they say current era BCE be enough fooling everybody we know what it is before Jesus you fuck why what you have it oh just a coincidence that before current ever era just happens to land exactly on when Jesus came back shut up assholes with their BCE before current era what does that even mean why can't we just start it we can't can we go back and agree what zero is and rewrite history I mean we decided that this was a you know the BC 2500 BC they made the pyramids like what the fuck does that even mean you're going backwards so 6000 BC is actually earlier than 2500 BC you guys are retarded what a stupid way of measuring shit how about you go all the way back you make that zero you start from scratch because like the earth doesn't know what year we're in the earth has no idea what year were deciding it in to make some arbitrary number and that I have everything before that start with a low number and build high like you have a like a flat line between reality and some new dimension or like water and air I'll give a hot number when was the software created zero ones mmm a Christian monk yeah I looked up the other day where alphabetical order came from and who got to decide why it was that and what made a before be or whatever there was some scholars back that you know when people couldn't write they were the only ones that could write and read so they made it up you know what the craziest trip is man when people were writing an ancient Hebrew they wrote with letters that also meant numbers like a word also had a numerical value like there was no numbers they didn't have like numbers they had a and a is awful also one BB is also too I just thought of that time period and no one also knew how to read so if you got a letter or whatever let's say if you got one is that true though you have no one does not agree no not no one but I would say most people probably didn't you might think you're racist to read for you you have to trust their translation there you're racing right they were making pyramids they could all read amazing yeah you might be right right but that was the whole Martin Luther thing right Luther ISM the he had figured out how to make the Bible and translate it into a I think it was German into a phonetic language that people could understand because before they had to like trust the priests or learn Latin I guess I know what I'm missing are you really yeah those are the super people they figured it out man you who are the ones that are Pentecostals those are my favorite because they fuck with snakes and shit that's my favorite I like those that's hot weather or southern people man that's what that shit is that's all people that live in a place where your brain is getting boiled by the heat and you just decide to start dancing with snakes and you know fucking talking in tongues I'm allowed a ding-dong they're sweating they're always sweating it's Pentecostal guys they're always yelling and screaming yeah man that's uh if big conventions or something where they meet every year Pentecostals do the meat swap snakes I like last night and almost last week every now and then one of them gets got by a snake that's important to man all those people in the and their group have to go oh okay look at that how much how much flowered Gaylord Opryland Resort shut your mouth how much buttfucking is going on just buttfucking in that room so go go to that overhead view how much prey the gay away is happening in that room at least thirty percent right thirty percent of those people are just trying to fight off the gay hard there was a lawsuit that was just I was just reading about were these this some sort of Christian cult they kidnapped this guy and beat the shit out of them because he was gay they're trying to beat the gay away oh [Laughter] my god there's so much of that going on so much that prey the gay away what is this mother accused of having son beat the gay away could face hate crime charges yeah is that the woman oh my god what is she gonna talk about we should probably hear her talk do you think we yanked yeah let's hear what she has to say about beating the shit of her son in some way that he yes I think that you was but like I said I reported the water PD another was nothing nothing was doing and does it bother you if he does come out to be getting up out of you it bother me because he's is a young age he's not all deal he do not know right from so yes he do you see whoa is that her mugshot right below it the one that looks like Katt Williams it's like James Brown around what is that oh it's from Whiteville she lives in Whiteville this is simulation theory shit I smell the earth Carolina she's currently being charged with a misdemeanor child abuse that's all you get for beating the gay away yet misdemeanor child abuse he's 15 man Jesus Christ god damn it man that's her whore that's even crazier what hurricane Irma holds about twice the destructive energy of all bombs used in the Second World War seven trillion watts of power in it right now so why can't we get like some kind of a windmill up there he can collect it you'd have to have a big one and then it will become the biggest weapon ever I know we designed that instead of the Galaxy Note 8 that no one wants to buy I got you how about you buy a giant win windmill thing and put it up there and make all the power plus I have some friends that are in Florida right now and the unforeseen problem that being out here not knowing what's why and what people are doing there I also have an uncle in Orlando who's telling me he's not leaving right now because the roads are gridlocked and that way there's nowhere to go oh my friends who left Tampa yesterday got up at like 9:00 in the morning packed all their shit up and we're like all right let's go where we gonna go they were like let's take side roads because it's probably gonna be busy everywhere so they did for a while 3-4 hours and side roads and then eventually you're gonna run out of gas you got to go get gas first place they stopped no gas they're all out oh no so they continue on the next one waiting the gigantic line to fill up but now it's again like hopefully we can live off of this tank of gas that we get where we're going and everybody has to leave right now because the whole state could be potentially under 10 feet of water the whole stage yeah the whole second 10 foot storm surge is coming the whole state no it won't make it all the way to the middle probably but it might walk in gigantic we don't know obviously the only positive if there's any positive thing compared to the last hurricane is that it's not going to stall over Florida it's going to keep on going and losing energy the higher gets but Orlando should be might get really fucked you know that's Disney Road is zero might be gone this weekend right and it's really yeah they just rebuild it all all this new stuff too so whoa yeah there's like that 90% of this island Barbuda is gone is gone you don't have it a bowl shiny habitable honey they don't even know this shit - because they can't see it it was all happening last night they can't get over to find out what's going to get reports of it even so they don't know if the people are dead they don't know shit right I mean those islands are so small I mean what is this the size of like Texas or Ohio or something like that it's yeah it's the size of Ohio the storm in story miles across how wide is Florida Florida's not 400 miles across all right I don't know exactly but it's probably out gravy so it's gonna be like a giant eraser that just rolls up Florida and they're still not sure I could turn you know these things can always turn could go back turn left and go to Texas you don't worry that grossest people that have ever lived just beautiful word the people that go I miss they stay and they survive and the storm miraculously turns no I got fuckin knew it no you didn't stupid you didn't know it you're no better than the people that got killed by it you got lucky you know that's a lot of people in Houston that's how they feel they make it a party they like they have hurricane parties and this one really caught him off-guard did you know that that cut it catch them off-guard they saw it coming from days away well they I think they in their heads think oh no I later fine we've been fine for years you know we're drunk that's the problem yep they're fucking partying they're listening to Kid Rock they're on top of the room for making out like we don't care we'll stay up here we got a boat we're gonna be fine we'll catch fish there's an episode I was there's an episode I was on I don't know if it was the last time I was on or whatever but we were talking about floods in Houston and I showed you that that that that concrete or not concrete pavement that sucks up water I wonder if that would have been any help if that they had implemented that like all all over the place maybe come on but I think the amount of water they were dealing with so unprecedented they showed the difference between Hurricane Katrina and hurricane Harvey like the sheer amount of volume of water it's insane like this was such a big big hurricane that's just I wish there was a definitive answer as to if all this is a direct result of like human behavior industry car exhaust I wish there was a definitive result we could see it like yeah here's the number that you can show we show me you're that concrete oh the water drinking concrete weird so how does that do that it's mad crazy type absorb runoff from fast floods if you're watching it folks the people that are just listening it doesn't even seem real it's like they have this giant water truck and it's fucking pouring water all over the concrete and it's just dissipating almost instantaneously into the concrete it's super weird I wonder if it has like a basement and what it does is it goats through like kind of like a concrete filter it and goes underneath so the actual water is just like underneath in the basement um what the fuck it does it doesn't even seem real it seems like a scene in a Terminator movie okay you know yeah well either way like what they dealt with in Houston is so much water I just doubt that I mean maybe that would have helped a little but I think that they're dealing with just some insane amount of water yeah that it shows what it is Jamie it's like some sort of filtration system yeah yes so it allows the water to get through it it can take that chorus it was probably too much water yeah that Harvey was a monster hurricane the crazy thing is how much bigger irma is like I think we're numb do it I think we look at it what it doesn't make sense to us you know 185 miles sustained winds for over a day and caught sinners just gonna start rolling like a katamari but here's the thing right is this the strongest they can get no thinking it's stronger than yeah the categories they tracked this was the highest they've gone and now this one is the new bar to be basically a Delta airline accidentally flew through it yesterday by mistake in a god out at the last minute I forgot I read that this morning when I woke up got out yeah I guess it accidentally was flew into it it was and somehow it got out of the hurricane here's the pilot piloted his way yeah yeah yeah I thought you meant it got out the pilot Oh Delta pilot who threw one of those powerful hurricanes record in all huntin 75 hatcheries are safe why would they do that oh they had to they had to fly through it did they did they fuckin judge it wrong yeah they went through 185 thousand my health our winds he imagined that turbulence well it's not that fast it's 187 miles an hour right right fuck that thing is giant man when you see it on the ground or you know in one of those overhead maps and you realize how big it is look how big that is so crazy so they flew through part of it yeah does it show oh it's like yeah it's going right now 25 mile an hour winds gusting board 40 whoa huh so they were they were following stuck in the actual hurricane yeah flew through the hurricane oh my god that is insane oh wait they landed on 52 minutes on the ground in San Juan they've landed and turned around oh they tried to make it back I'm out of standing this is the airport has to climb out of sju and they're doing so between the outer band of irma and the core of the storm they went in between the bands oh my god so he went in between the bands and in do wow that's the most incredible thing about weather satellites they can literally navigate this guy through those bands and tell them like where the storm is ahead yeah they have portable dopplers here now in Los Angeles to the where it's so accurate now that you can just see your street level of like if there's a cloud and above you look at this while it looks terrifying Delta maintains that their pilots had everything under control our meteorology team is the best in the business Erik Snell vice president for Delta operations and customer center told The Washington Post DL 302 departed San Juan with a hundred and seventy three passengers on board according to downtown Jesus Christ at PR for them jeez yeah of course being on an airplane probably the worst flight you'll ever have here they take a hard look at the weather data and the track of the storm and work with the flight crew and dispatcher to agree it was safe to operate the flight if you're about to get on that plane and they're telling you what they're gonna do probably say I'll stay at the airport I didn't risk it this man I'm gonna sleep I'm going I'm gonna take my backpack I'm sleeping on the ground I assume that you guys turned this thing into some sort of a hurricane shelter I've you been to the airport in Puerto Rico no I haven't been to the San Juan one but I was at us one on the other side of the island may the cardboard not want us it's like a run-down Burbank Airport but they got away with it Puerto Rico didn't get totally hit they only got like a little piece of it yeah well that's the thing about these kind of storms so you just get unlucky it just runs right over your spot or you can be right next to that and go Lord was looking out for us like okay you sure are you sure you just didn't get lucky like we're dealing with impossible forces like a hurricane the size of Ohio is an impossible force like that I don't think we really understand what the fuck that means I think that's one of those things over someone says a trillion billion dollars like yeah that's luck but you don't really think about it you know you don't really really understand what that means because too much the size of the universe too much the power that that thing has it's just too much doesn't make sense you'd have to see it you'd have to be there do you see the video I don't know if it's real either but the video of uh I don't know if it was today's hurricane this guy's trying to hold his truck like he had like a pickup truck trying to hold it so it doesn't tip over and that winds were so strong he just gets squished by it's hard to see because it was raining so hard but guys gotta be crazy why would he do that yeah a truck is about to flip and you think you're gonna stop it with your hands he watched too many movies motherfucker you can pick up a truck can you pick up a truck No then get the fuck out of it put this on YouTube but we can watch it what is it oh this is the guy oh Jesus oh dude that's a wrap yeah yeah he's crazy hey that guy's crazy look at that thing fucking in the breeze he should have got out of there man he just sandwiched yeah he got crushed you didn't handle it well now I wouldn't see shake it out from under that's too much weight you're dead fuck it says fast ones that get me like that guy I probably just was like oh well my trucks in about that oh you're dead well the thing the thing about these kind of hurricanes are how many of them can you get in a row because if they're saying there's two more in a row behind irma it 2005 I think it was they got hit for like four Florida got hit like four times in a row and like every week Bobby's he's those were like twos and threes these are fives and you know Jose's you know Jose's going right for Washington DC you know Jose's gonna be the big one do you think so kind of I won't even hit United States I'm worried about a mall man I'm worried about earthquakes I'm worried about asteroids I'm worried about super volcanoes I we're dealing with it's a small amount of history that's what's going on I mean that especially when it comes to weather our history of the weather is like what couple hundred years old like what's what's our recorded history of the weather but if you had a guess what's our recorded history of the weather 1878 that sounds good I'm saying something like that I'm saying somewhere like 200 years they started figuring out that make sense yeah eat the right stuff down around sometimes were they I said 300 years an eight-six 1816 I wonder when they can measure though like when they knew they knew when they were cold like fuck it's cold out one day when they knew what that meant though look if there was a number I guess we needed tools also to track that's wrapped right now see in a year it makes way more sense what I just found so the invention of the thermometer when was that right I'm a guess 1755 that's good one I'd say 1812 1812 you're probably right it's probably more more recent than we think occasion of work here on the Fahrenheit scale 17:24 but the first recorded temperature it says here was 1880 Oh 1880s Wow 1870 a it was two years off that's amazing she probably had to have something touch it back then touch the mercury oh yeah how they figured out what I mean look we can't even agree on the metric system versus inches what's interesting there then if that was the first time they could ever actually like calculate the degrees did they have measurement four degrees before that did they have like temperature measurements before that like what did they use like when they were talking about like how hot is a fire like what did they use they have no idea oh that ice is cold like did they have any idea like did they even describe it in measurement and they the clinical thermometer wasn't invented until 1880 1866 it was probably some dude with a regular mom he just stuck it up his ass somebody caught him and he was like oh brother she's making sure that this thing works on people took five minutes instead of 20 because it was up his ass he did it up that's a 99 they started in 1999 is when the forehead thermometer came out and that 1999 yeah Jesus Christ I like this first temporal artery thermometer 1999 that's the one you put on your forehead right nuts that just happened the crazy thing is the idea that before the thermometer they didn't really have a number well talking about things being cold or hot like did they when did they invent units of measurement for temperature when was that invented cuz obviously there's more than one right there's Celsius and there's Fahrenheit the Celsius is the one that's based on the metric system that's used by almost everybody except for us we're fucking assholes you know they'll say something like a host 35 degrees out like what are you talking about it's not hot and you know your Celsius is what is that like 80 and 135 degrees is hot as fuck right that'd be cool if we all had the same like currency also they just cost more in different places I would why don't we just you to make everything easier on everything because everybody's corrupt and if we were all together someone would fuck us up and we would lose all the money someone would siphon all the money up they would they would weasel their way through the whole batch of it if we have a bunch of different factions a bunch of different languages everybody sort of keeps peace hey and no like super wizard you know Despicable Me character comes along and hijacks the entire system the earliest recorded system of weights and measurements what does it say about temperature I don't know if I mean temperature would take a while yeah but history of measurement is not what I'm asking because I know that they've had scales for a long time but like what about when was a unit of measurement for temperature invented doesn't say temperature well somebody had to like not have it and then they had it there must be a date right we probably and it probably would have started like that you this is the temperature for a dead Raven or something like that and this is a snake in 1659 Wow Wow what the fuck did they used to measure it if they didn't have thermometers right I mean imagine not having a thermometer and trying to measure the heat it sounds like your inner dialogue of you at night at 3:00 in the morning it is I got a fucking problem dude especially if I smoke a joint it's crazy on normal life can seem and then you smoke a joint you like life seems so normal and so like you know hey what's up neighbor how's everybody doing and then you smoke a joint and just watch a little bit of news about Emma about any of these things are my freak me out the other night man I may be when I'm two o'clock in the morning Instagram posts I was just going online and looking at storm footage so I was like what if these just keep hitting ya over and over and over and over and over yeah I watched a documentary about how are coral and our oceans dying recently another buck out and it's like all based on like two degrees of temperature that it's doing with the oceans are two degrees hotter yeah that was like wait there's like eight billion people can we just all throw ice into the ocean at the same time I would probably think they thought that through I said that you know we could do though for real is apparently wearing sunscreen and the water is fucking terrible for coral and and people don't give us that's like an oil I never thought about that chemical yeah I mean sunscreen whatever that stuff is is it's weird it's like the face beach scrubs that can't destroy right there's a little yeah those things like get stuck in your drain yeah but that stuff that they use for sunscreen how good is that for your skin to spray that chemical on there I never use sunscreen I have to use it because of my vitiligo because of the different colors in my hand like if otherwise it it's like it's like if you're a white guy vitiligo is not nearly as obvious as if you're a black guy right black people have it it's like it's crazy contrast and if I don't do it all so like I worry that some pigment in those areas so if I don't have pigment like where my fingers are like in that shit gets cancer yeah like you have anything that's blocking skin cancer so we're like backwards dice gloves about to Michael Jackson glove the conclusion from the media is sunscreen is killing the world Koral that's laughable it says right here that 10% of the global reefs are at least only 10% and many of them are remote and without tourists that even get near them and that study was done with artificial seawater so that studies bullshit maybe Mashable sells I don't know man I read stuff like that and Eddie Bravo Alex Jones comes out me and I'm like who the fuck is paying for that article it Johnson it's a fucking sunscreen industry bro how much money is in sunscreen bro my fucking mom who loves their kids put sunscreen on their baby bro that's how people start thinking maybe they're right it's hard to know who's fucking telling the truth there's too much fake that guy's crazy she says don't know why son ran into the to his death in the Burning Man fire I'm going to guess drugs definitely acid they had security around it too as what I was reading yeah once firemen who knows man that's sad though it's fucking sad it's a sad way to die anything shipped he did yeah like like he was so fucked up maybe he didn't see but he tripped him into the fire oh no the next picture shows him like I don't want to see this dude poor dude he looks like every dude at Burning Man he's got that you know like new New Age hippie look that's a sad way to die man that's sad fucking story and you would hope that he didn't have like a mental issue and then took a drug and then had that episode you know people that are like we're reality's already slippery for them like really strong psychedelics not recommended yeah but he could have just been that fucked up and you have a big Burning Man in front of you like I've been that fuck where I could have thought that I was running into ice cream or something yeah sure right that's a problem with psychedelics yeah and it's also the problem with look everybody's reactions to these things gotta be like at least slightly different right and some people just aren't designed for them for maybe one style of psychedelics it's like some people aren't for alcohol now some people did just didn't drink doesn't work with them who knows what happened but that's fucked man imagine being there and watch that kid run into the fire and just be thinking like is this real is it really running into the fire you're all fucked up anyway not sober you're not even if you were sober you'd probably feel like you were on drugs you around all these people that are tripping balls you're watching this thing burst into fire and then you watch a guy run into the fire you're probably like what is this is this a movie like what the fuck is happening here whenever there's like an extraordinary event like that you always feel like it's not real like what what what's happening I don't expect this guy to run into fire see someone running the fire did he run in the fire like your brain is scrambling so hard to process it that's why they say that people there when they see like something fucked up happened their eyewitness accounts are so bad because so many people like they don't even remember what the hell happened they're just so shattered by it all like what ya saw story about a kid I think he's in the like the juvenile penal system in New York or something but he's been used by the system to convict like 35 people or something that didn't do anything wrong and like the article was about this shit he's dealing with he's being used how he's done something in like probably they're using him to get his sentence reduced oh so he sets other people up oh Jesus Christ that's the weird one that they're allowed to have fake crime and then arrest you for it like the FBI is done that with people like talk someone into making a bomb and then they give them the parts and then they give them the bomb and then they like tell them to go somewhere and blow it up and they do it and they arrest them yeah you're not allowed to do that right that's the power you like to fish people they are they're allowed to ban that's like the old hooker thing like yep there yeah yeah it is yeah they talk it you into it yeah it's uh but they're allowed to do that now it's not like it used to be what is that term that I'm looking for the old hooker thing seduction right no that's not even it no no entrapment entrapment rap me yeah yeah but they're allowed to do that now there's a I mean the the the slippery slope is definitely going in the wrong direction like they're allowed to like you could take a really impressionable guy there was this one guy they did it to in Texas that was supposed to be he was very mentally challenged it wasn't a very smart guy and this is the guy that they talked into trying to detonate this fake bomb that they'd given him and then they arrested oh wow it's really fun dude it was like super troubled and they just need it or remind fuck dumber you know they mean you can mind fuck someone in the name of religion you can mind fuck someone he's a lot of different ways if you are especially you got to think like the FBI it's like super powerful organization of people that have had decades of experience in the field know how to handle people know how to deal with weird shit that Manson chicks about to get released I wonder about I know and she's not gonna know any of this technology imagine the whole thing yeah she killed a pregnant lady right isn't she one of the ones that was the tate-labianca killings yeah wasn't she she was the youngest she was the cheerleader how old was she I want to say she's 17 Jesus I don't remember it was like late 60s now like imagine that life going from being a young teenager to your entire life you're in a cage and then all sudden is you're an old lady they go go ahead get out for a little bit like wow like that's a crazy documentary waiting to happen I hope someone's studying her I hope there's like a good documentary person it's on that yeah that's a crazy documentary I mean who does she live with like maybe Russian filmmakers like hey you can stay my van nuys one-bedroom apartment if I can record everything of some sort of a pay site right that Manson house she turns into a cam whore yeah Manson house you think you logged you became more after get out of jail from her horse and here she's gonna have the tightest pussy known to man I don't know about all that I just probably been sticking hammers in their last 20 years I mean she's been locked up for a long time yeah who knows what's going their fists probably for sure definitely a few a few different fists over the last 35 plus years like when with the Manson killings was probably like 45 50 years ago right wasn't it this is the seventies 70s was it now I don't think it was a 70s it was maybe tate-labianca murders Manson 69 69 69 a lot of shit huh Woodstock wasn't that one Hendrix died did he die in 69 that picture wasn't sick or that that thinks is 69 on it may 3rd mm-hmm want to say he died in 69 or 70 but I don't remember people really do remember the only gets super mad if you don't know bro July 27th 1968 don't ever fuck that up again it's Jimmy and Joyce it's like John Goodman's character in The Big Lebowski good is that serious by talking when he died get out Siri when did Jimmy Hendrix died Jimmy Hendrix died September 18th 1970 not recently there's a there's a building it's still there on Franklin in Hollywood where Charles Manson used to live and run his words out of which I didn't know he was doing he was a pimp yeah a pimp and girls two people were staying at the Roosevelt Color Me badd right [Laughter] those are great make a nice mug yep painted a dolphin last time I was there all right we should wrap this up I gotta get the fuck out of here I got a bunch of shit to do boys it's been a lot of fun Brian getting shows coming up I know you do yeah November 8th I'll be at Morty's in Indianapolis with Chloe Quigley and then the following day November 9th I'll be at the funny bone in Columbus Ohio and then maybe New York dude I like that you're going out on the road like just you and one other person Kate that's a smart move it's a great way to build your act - right yeah - fine get nice and we're doing like I just got back from the Mall of America in Edmonton did seven shows in five days that was the what a workout that's like yeah you get tightened up you know Brendan Schaub saying that to me after he got back from Dublin he was like dude you just all those reps I'm like that's what it's all about you get those four or five set a weekend you know weekends and you're like wow it's so great and every every you know sometimes if two nights are 2,000 it--and then you just hey I want to fix this in my act looks like instant gratification ya know it's the shit alright um that's it death squad TV for all your podcast needs and memorabilia and powerful stamps calm still using them oh hell yeah stamps.com I'm wearing me undies right now all right folks we'll see you next week bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
