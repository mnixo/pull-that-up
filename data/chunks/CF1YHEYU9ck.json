haha hello freak bitches this is what I want to see I want to see Nick Diaz vs Conor McGregor that's what I want to say I want to see that more than I want to see anything in life I was a head so I want to see it more than I want to see the aurora borealis more than I want to go to the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and revisit the Milky Way more than I want to see any of those things I want to see Nick Diaz vs Conor McGregor no Nick Diaz Conor McGregor had a cool his little walk around the ring as he got in it was awesome and he was off he was around that ball so much that with the way he walked around it would he got in the ring I didn't think he's gonna get punched in the face as much as he did we still won but that was a cocky interest like oh he bought the first round knockout this motherfucker the way he just came in here well I mean what he's trying to do is just like shake it off put an air out there but the end yeah he's fighting Nate Diaz no one's getting no first-round knockout it's getting a crazy war he knew it and then he had to be conservative in that fight the energy was so crazy and I was the same it was so it was I was like nothing ever right it was so I'm so glad I would to see a lot oh man so he me too so Emma as I said I'm a casual fan so he's a couple times where Conor knocked him to the ground mm-hmm Connor doesn't want to do ground game with him right cuz he would he was not good to the ground right and he was he was he was telling to come up but I would think normally for my lack not that much you know MMA knowledge I would think once you knock somebody to the ground you try to go in with those hammer fists you could you did however if you do that with a guy like Nate Diaz you might not be heard at all right especially when you consider the fact that uh he Conor through a bunch of like really powerful left leg kicks mhm and he had fucked up Nate's right leg because because the fact that both southpaw what happens is like that back leg becomes the front leg so the right leg is in front right he's just getting chewed up with this left power leg kick yeah right from the beginning like over and over and over and over again when when you get hit with a bunch of like really powerful leg kicks like that it makes it super difficult for you to move right you know and then I just fought a smooth smart game plan you know he he engaged from the outside where his speed was an advantage and did some damage but didn't unload himself like he did in the first fight and the first fight he did that too they have any unloaded himself innate survived and when he survived Connors gas tank was empty right this time Connor was way more conservative now see were run away a look nobody will run away no you could you could say it he got away he ran away but when he was on a case Oh can I get close to the county or run it and make it more into the sensor man it's okay you know people are mad that he ran away hook you do win when you move away because sometimes you take a break yeah I'm times you take a break he knows the three moments in the round he's got he knows her I mean I don't know when it was there was there was a couple moments in time where he totally turned away from him but then he engaged yeah he did it wasn't like he was running the hole he was just when he found himself in a compromising position he would get out of it it's interesting it's an interesting thing to do you guys trying to kick your ass like I'm gonna go over here for a minute yeah it's something funny about it you know seemed like a good move it's the right move when you don't feel like you can fight right now what do you want to do standing there like oh man and take it on the chin pose yeah come on person get in there if you don't feel like you can breathe maybe you should move away and breathe otherwise some dude could punch you in the body and you can go down it's like it's not a smart move you know to stand in there if you feel tired
