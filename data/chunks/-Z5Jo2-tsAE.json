the gyro can experience it's amazing that you're like you're so entrenched in them yeah you seem like pretty pretty together dude I think so I mean I kids changed me I mean I got I got too young I got a two year old and a five month old and my wife changed me I mean I never thought I'd get married I mean I was living when I got on hoarders I was living on a buddy's couch I was cleaning up shit for 12 bucks an hour literally shoveling shit for 12 years now anybody would hire me look at dog like people's dogs no people's houses I'd go into a hoarder house and clean up their shit with the show even yeah I was I've been cleaning houses for four years I hid when I hit rock bottom I mean I literally lost everything I was living on a buddy's couch for 200 bucks a month and I couldn't come up with 200 bucks the third month he was like dude you know you're worth 30 men like you got a you got it to something man I remember I'll never talk to my old podcast I my 30th birthday I call I was engaged to another girl and I realized her like my life is a fucking joke like I can't pull her into this and I got no business being married and so I called off the wedding like a month before I was getting married Wow and it was that was a hard decision and I was living on my buddy's couch and I was my 30th birthday which you know was a milestone in your head and I said and my mom's like well what do you want it's been a hell of a year I was like I need a pair of running shoes and I couldn't afford I was trying to run a marathon that year and I couldn't affair board a pair of shoes to him I didn't have money owed like a hundred grand in credit cards and I mean it was scary so I started cleaning up old ladies houses how'd you get that job I my dad died that the biggest thing important thing in my life for me was my dad dying when I was 24 and that changed my life I mean my dad I was a fucking asshole I was just a piece of shit all I cared about was drinking gambling and nailing women all three great things don't get me wrong I mean my twenties were really fun why do you stop at a blast I really when you're talking to a guy who spent a good deal of my youth in pool halls yeah so you mean a muscle I was hustling gambling in attics yeah on a regular basis let's see if it's you very very common yeah I mean for me I didn't I hadn't honed my hustle in the right place I'm still a hustler I'm just doing it on the buggy in a positive way I never changed my him I'm just able I've learned I'm able to make more money in a positive way than I in a negative way honey we don't talk like I talk they don't say the things I say and I've learned just being on brutally honest is the best hustle there is well how did you get into this environment were you around like gamblers and how did all this happen well man I just I love at first time I went to casino I fell in love with it man how old are you college this guy George so that's when he became a gambling addict yeah yeah this guy George Rome and he had Tourette's really cool dude he was a very confident guy he had Tourette's but he didn't give a shit it's like your problem that he had Tourette's not his wow that's awesome very confident guy and so I was like very attracted was like man this is a cool fucking guy right like he put it on you he did not care that he had Tourette's and he would get the hottest chicks at school he's a really awesome confident guy and I my dad always told me he's like you're never gonna be the best-looking guy you'll never be the hardest-working guy you got to be the most confident because I think that's your only end like you got no other value that I think broke you off no he just was honest he said he's like you know yeah you're not gonna be rich you're not gonna be back here's a rule is what it is and my dad got mad mad women I mean he got and he was so ugly but he just didn't he knew how to be honest he talked honest and he treated them like he treated with respect and as a women and so I learned a lot from him but when my dad died I went to this little place called comfort zone camp it's a camp for kids that have lost their dads and so I was in LA we helped to build the LA camp and my wife and I did my but I met her there and but we helped build these camps with these kids and all their dads at Biden died at drive-bys so you meet all these 12 year old kids that are going in you know they're getting recruited by gangs already because their dad's a party they're 23 year old dads that you know have been killed 25 dead so we learn I mean I just grief was a huge part early on and so for me like when I got out of my really rock bottom and I realize it's time to get going where I figured that out the the doing good versus doing bad was at this camp I would I got addicted to that camp I volunteered every single weekend and I would just made a go away for three nights and hang out these kids and that's when I got my new addiction was then Wow it changed my life that place changed mine I met my wife there I came up a new business my business clutter cleaner I came up with it they're helping the kids I met a lot of great women and met my wife there so I mean I wouldn't have what I have how did you pull yourself out of the gambling spiral your city from your saw ran like a fucking chicken man I mean I got my ass kicked by a bookie right and all night I owed 40 grand the night before I had $10 left to my name I knew I owed this bookie was I mean it was 40 grand and it was a lot I knew I only had $10 in my pocket my girlfriend was waiting for me I was in Lake Tahoe she was waiting for me at the top of the hill up at heavenly and I was gambling all night I can't hide Tendai what $5 in my mind I thought I had $5 at the end of the night and I was like I better put this down got to get a cab ride home so I was giving up at five dollars to my name and I owed 40 to the bookie from 2000 yeah which for a 24-year old kid make it not making that is a lot of money and so I put the chip down Lost came out I had no my lost my last dollar came out I had nothing and it was like I got a fucking problem and so I was looking at the cabbie and again he's like the guy that drove me back every night and he was like he looked at me I was like I got no money man so I started walking uphill five miles uphill to the ski resort Tahoe is a very awesome isolating place so it was a five mile its incline road as we went up and I'm walking up this thing and he came and pick me up and he's like dude you gotta you gotta get your life together man you gotta quit gambling and everyone is and I at that point I was still judging people and I was like looking at this I was like this poor stupid cab driver no God knows what happened to him but I was totally judging him right yet he's saving me he's picking me up and so I'm still treating this guy like in my mind like a piece of shit and he picks me up he dropped me off and I'm like can I give you anything can I he's like to just stop gambling he looked at me like just fucking stop and that's what we did you stop well and I called my mom the next morning and she's like you're on your own so then I went I called the bookie and I was like I don't know my do man I don't have money and I'm this was like a movie he's like no worries man everything's gonna be fine we'll work it out what do you have I think I might be able to scrounge up a thousand dollars he goes no worries come on down I'll meet you down this afternoon so I was like this isn't like movies at all this is great this we're gonna work it out and I went down he took the thousand bucks and he beat the shit out of me broke my nose I totally was just clueless and he just broke my nose and beat shit out of me that was my rock bottom and I was like what the fuck am I gonna do so I called around I called an old boss and I told him what it and my mom had already said you're on your own find a legal way out and that was the night where I put a lot of dumb shit on the board and I was like I'll just be a prostitute or I'll do whatever like I was like oh you know I was like I can be mentally strong I can figure this out and I was lying to myself saying I can figure this out Wow and so ended up an old boss got me a job in Chicago and he goes when can you get this was a Tuesday night and he goes when can you get there and

battling it every day all right you know I don't sort of well you have a handle on it yeah I mean I gamble in eight years I don't really eight years yeah I'm not kid I mean I kids are just wearing me out now I'd only have the effort for that kind of stuff anymore does it still draw everyone somewhere I guess at it yeah everyone smile get that I got headed this year I had a really bad itch and I had a flight to Vegas to do a hoarders episode and it wasn't even in Vegas I just had a 3-hour layover and I was like fuck yeah I'm going downtown and I got excited and I hadn't had that itch in a long time like I can drink I can smoke I can do whatever because I can walk away mm-hmm I can't walk away from the table that's my way I don't know how to walk away if I have a dollar or 10 grand sometimes I can blow your special brain chemistry whatever it is in your mind me that's my that's hambling comes up you just being that's my ultimate way of shoving it to the man and like I'm better than you I can do this yeah it's a self-worth thing I was looking for self-worth so again but how do you get so fourths out of began for me that's where it went man that I mean for you you might get me where do you get your self-worth I get it try to think about it yeah my new thing now is like I really know that I'm making a difference on these podcasts so I dig that I'm starting to get it that's where I'm what is my rock call the five decisions away five decisions away and what is essentially what is it well it's about it just recounts all my mistakes over the last 15 years I was doing a hoarders we're in New York City where this guy had a mask he two-acre in Brooklyn a massive property in Brooklyn this guy had inherited from his dad it was at about six feet of bicycles all the way through the yard so an acre at 6 feet high think of a metal the value of that metal was probably under grand in metal and he had a bum living in his yard so inside the hoard there was a bum living there and that was one of the things we had to clean up way to get rid of the bum so I was literally I mean this is two years ago I'm sitting here in a in Brooklyn hanging out with this bum his name was Gregory I'll never forget him and I was I and this is the cool thing about hoarders I get to meet all these dudes right and I was like all right Gregor head you end up here man because he had I mean he had a bunch of like 40 ounces he had a bunch of in a bunch of these Magnum condoms and so I was like fuck yeah this guy's getting more ass than I am and he lives in a shack you know speakers that he was huffing I didn't realize it was hot he was just huffing gasoline huffing gasoline yeah condoms yeah they would fill up the condoms and then with the fumes and nuts you want to talk about a job that must keep you grounded in the possibilities of reality not necessarily your reality but the willies every Ennis that's that's what we hang with five decisions away because back to we didn't finished it that bum sitting in the yard I asked him how he got there and he goes oh I was a stockbroker I was like get out of here whoa and I'm like he's there he's full of shit or this is real so I went with it you know and I was like what do you mean you were starting he goes I was a stockbroker and a girl broke my heart and I go you're telling me you're living in this guy's yard because a girl broke your heart he was well I got addicted to crack too but the girl broke my heart and I was like yeah the crack might have something to do with it yeah but he lived in a fucking shack and I looked at the camera and I go I guess we are all really five decisions away from shit in the bucket yeah Wow and and that just stuck and when I said that it people ran with it and I'm clearly five had many five decisions away from shitting in a bucket and I mean couple things different happened and my life could've been totally yeah 95 to be one it's bad
