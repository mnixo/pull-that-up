and three two one no yes okay it's a lot okay it's been fucking up a little bit lately hey girlie how are you man yeah thanks for having me my pleasure my pleasure yeah you brought me a nice conspiracy book I want you back alright I want you yeah I get yeah I know I just had a lunch with Erich von d√§niken oh yeah and he's the author of Chariots of the Gods the last two hours we've been talking ancient aliens I was deep when I was like in my late teens I was deep in zecharia sitchin yeah anunnaki nathie liam i'm pronouncing it wrong there Liam I think Nephilim planet x nibiru I'm all over ya that's a lot of the conversation we had today at lunch is very interesting the problem with someone I mean it's not not he's not a dishonest person I'm not saying that but the problem with anybody that is involved with like a book like this is that you're so all in you're so committed to this idea like I asked him the first thing I asked it was like what is the most compelling piece of evidence and he said the the tablet in Palenque I don't know if you were aware that was the one of the the Aztec guy I guess Aztec or Mayan I guess the mind guy it's mine he's laying back it looks like in some sort of a throne with fire below him and he's manipulating these knobs and yet and that means that aliens landed and seeded them with technology yeah yeah they always make a little bit of a jump it's a big one a little bit of a jump between that bird is really a symbol of a flying saucer I've heard that too ever though they've been like that bird and I'm like well let me ask you a question why didn't they at your flying saucer right into the cave yeah and they're like well that you don't know how things work the more interesting ones in the other art depictions there's some really ancient depictions of people that look like they're in these flying saucer type things like they're flying through the air and they're in some sort of like you know some some painting yeah those are those are really interesting because like what were they trying to say like what were they what were they depicting and those things yeah I mean it's all very interesting but I think you've had Graham Hancock oh yeah so to me when I heard him I was like that makes more sense that we were just a civilization that had reached an apex yeah and it got wiped out by some cataclysmic event yeah and then we had to rebuild but is does he think that we got all of our technology from otherworldly sources or no not Ram doesn't doesn't Graham is much more in line with this this theory that dr. Robert Schoch has been putting forth he he was one of the weirder ones that I've had on the podcast first of all because he's a rock-solid geologist right professor at Boston University like really well established his credentials are you know they're they're as good as it gets and he was saying that he thinks that there was a mass coronal ejection somewhere around 12,000 years ago and it was literally raining lightning all over the world and we've decimated the population of land mammals and people is this what got the dinosaurs no no no this is way late this is like my bad this is they think in the neighborhood of 12,000 years ago they think this is this is recent yeah yeah this is what Graham Hancock's work indicates as well see Graham Hancock and him were together on the Sphinx because Robert Schoch was the geologist they brought in to examine the erosion marks on the temple that Sphinx yeah and his conclusion was that this is the result of thousands of years of rainfall right the problem with that was the last time there was significant rainfall in the Nile Valley was 9000 BC so you'd have to have thousands of years before that to create these deep water-based fissures or water created fissures so they're saying the Sphinx was there a lot longer than we imagined yeah so that coincides with a lot of these the the people that want to push back the dates of civilization what they think is it all points to something big happening at the end of the Ice Age yeah so something big happening between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago why don't mainstream scientists go now I'm sure there's reason for this I think there's a reason that mainstream thought leaders in any area don't allow the fringe in know why what's the big thing here with keeping these guy is it that they would just have to go back and relook at every history book well in the beginning there was nothing right so these guys were proposing this there was very little evidence but now the evidence is stacking up and there's all these ancient structures that they're finding like gobekli tepe and yeah yeah that if once they found that one and they realized that it was intentionally covered up 12,000 years ago so this is like this is undeniable everyone agrees on it yeah and so then they have to say okay well then hunter-gatherers must have made this because 12,000 years ago that's all we had was hunter-gatherers but it's really sophisticated construction and it's very difficult to do and they're enormous and they have three-dimensional animals that are starved into them yeah which means they actually had to carve away the outside to create the animal instead of carving the animal into the stone they actually carved the stone out around the animal so these animals are like climbing on the outside of these stone columns it's really weird stuff yeah but who the fuck knows I'm I lean more towards cataclysmic disaster because there's so many of them that we know for sure have happened right between those 165 million years ago in the Yucatan that they killed the dinosaurs just reading about the arc storm that's gonna hit LA which will just be 60 days of rain once that happens every two hundred years I mean you know this is an article I read every 200 years LA and the area gets 60 90 days of rain and everybody has to move and things this is supposedly what somebody's saying comedians who are all thinking about they're worried about the arc storm now it's fun to think about stupid it's the best it's thinking about like conspiracies and Bigfoot UFOs and shelley thought it teaches you how to think a little like when I was a teenager I was smoking weed with my buddies like we would you'd have to research these things you'd have to cross-reference information you couldn't just swallow the narrative you had to literally go with and then you have to use critical thinking to go does this make sense right would have happened right could maybe could Lee Harvey Oswald at what about you know would he have acted alone you know you have to think about all these things my I mean I I do think since Trump got elected conspiracy theorist had been demonized and no cause Hawks about right there's a little bit well I was always going on it was even before that they were being demonized but yeah for sure everybody's worried about the other groups which is fair yeah I get that yeah there's the people in the cage is no good I'm not for any of that people in the cage there were the kids in the cages it's not good you know I mean the family separation the border all the quarters real stop but I think that people think that conspiracy theories got Trump elected so now it's like cool to hate conspiracy theorists or people that are like let's take another look at this there's so many factors that got you elected right it's a perfect storm of people getting fed up with political correctness yeah someone coming along that's not a politician yeah you know the system is so rigged that after a while you just like Jesus Christ how many more of these fake puppets we're gonna put in office there's I say this to comics I'm like everybody's done a show where everybody goes out of bombs you know their material and then one guy gets up and just goes fuck this and screams and yells and destroys because that's what the room wanted the whole night they wanted somebody to come up and just realize how fucked everything was and how nobody was having a good time and that's kind of what Trump was this one was the guy that came out and just rift yeah he went out there with no material he just went out there and rift and he went and I when I heard and I'm sure you've seen this speech where he talks about Ben Carson going after his mother with a hammer and trying to stab his friend this was one of the funniest things he was speaking and he was giving his stump speech I don't know where it was I think it was wasn't in Iowa but he was referencing Iowa and he's talking about Ben Carson's book and that Ben Carson had admitted to going after his mother with a hammer and trying to stab his friend with an I mean these are these are in and Trump is talking about it me and my friend were driving out of New York City we were laughing so hard I said this guy's I said he's gonna win I said I'll tell you why he's gonna win I can stop watching yes I can't I am so fixated by the idea that there's a guy like this on the national stage and he's saying whatever he wants there was something intoxicating about that a lot of things he was saying were horrible you know he was saying them and then on the other side you had Hillary Clinton who was just a scripted or careful person and I'm like it's just boring yeah so to me I'm like sometimes the entertaining person wins because you can't take your eyes off them well in this case for sure I mean in that it was a perfect you know polar opposite between him and her yeah you know no experience versus vast amounts of experience right no real experience in the real world versus vast amount experiences yeah I mean there's a lot going on between the two of them it was it was it's it's a bad way to choose world runs yes really it's very bad to look at candidates and go who's the most entertaining yeah well it's also a bad idea to have one person right it's a bad idea to have this this same system that was in place back when there was fucking you know a thousand people here but I think we really dealt like we have one person that seems like we have one figurehead but we have kind of this permanent political class of people yeah a nexus of powerful institutions where you have career politicians career diplomats career military service people that kind of don't leave so I think that's one of the reasons that we haven't changed the system is because one person can't ever do that much even though Trump is wild and crazy and he's done a lot of bad things I don't think he would be allowed to deviate from many of the policies like that his predecessors had kind of established I think they're like the American government and that's why this to term like the deep state which a lot of people ridicule it's an undeniably true thing I mean our policies are not just one guy gets in office and it goes here's how it is right I mean it's the result of a lot you know private corporations lobbying forming all kinds in forming an agenda in a non democratic way you know they're not accountable and a lot of these you know people that work at the CIA or the FBI the NSA a lot of them are appointed they're not elected right we have no oversight we have I think it's 22 intelligence agencies now easily that money I mean it's something absurd how many could you name the FBI CIA NSA probably DEA DEA intelligence I wouldn't say it's an intelligence probably enforcement intelligence capabilities I would imagine FBI CIA NSA yeah the DIA Directorate of intelligence Oh Pentagon I mean I don't know if that's an entire agency but I think it I mean I think you has a capabilities but we have all of these different I don't know it's 22 but it's a lot and they're all competing with each other they're all competing because they all want money they all want to budget they all want and that's the thing if people talk about the deep state it's like look at them all yeah look at these guys here they are Jesus here all the people that are you know what we listen excited yeah the fucking space troops now we have space force that's gonna be good and why not why not a spaceport well eventually right eventually you're gonna have to have it oh yeah so why not have it now we have I don't know what the national geospatial-intelligence thing does they can't be any more relevant than space force click on that one National geospatial intelligence agents it can't be any less important than the space force that's who the fuck how many people were gonna employ 16,000 16,000 look at that look at their motto scroll down a little bit scroll down no earth show the way understand the world what that's founded in 96 Clinton probably did it's probably where he keeps his chicks I mean this right this is what I mean like what the hell are these people doing now what is it 16,000 employees with their motto know the earth show the way understand the world that sounds like a yacht like on a yoga studios you know I mean it's absurd but they get billions of dollars to do whatever listen put that back up there with the description look at it well good it says there it's uh it's under the United States Department of Defense and Intel agency of the United States intelligence community with the primary mission of collecting analyzing and distributing geospatial intelligence in support of national security which is why what does it mean what the hell is geospatial intelligence I mean this is what I mean this is insane and if the question if you go what are these guys do people yell at you yeah and they don't know you're a conspiracy theorist and you don't know this I just want to know what geospatial intelligence is right it's probably something simple and now I'm gonna look like an idiot it says it's intelligence about the human activity on earth derived from the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes assesses and visually depicts physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth I mean this is well there's probably a satellite agency to uncovered a pretend agency that nobody that there's a guy right now panic in the geospatial 16-thousand the other employees going shit we've been studying shipping docks from space yeah we just got outed yeah what actress hundred percent that's an actress but this is what I mean if you if you look into this stuff it starts to get crazy mm-hmm the amount of people that are doing things we have no idea what they're doing in ten I just did a private gig at the Bethesda Country Club in Maryland okay it's you know I'm still doing the private gig sadly but you gotta you know it is guys do it together how to do what you got to do I go to the Bethesda Country Club Maryland um it's the entire ten counties around Washington DC are the wealthiest counties in the world I mean in our country they and it's not because they're selling crab cakes you know what I mean right it's all defense industry Raytheon you know DynCorp things you've never heard of and they're all and they were it was a good gig they were funny I got up and I was like what are we we are carving up Venezuela they all after all there anyway you know they liked it some people get my was like right I said last week I did a fundraiser for human trafficking victims this week I'm with the traffickers you guys are a lot more fun and they're clapping their clap they love it they're leading in to being that's good definitely and they're they're you know they're morally compromised well they're also hired a comedian to fuck with them yes that's a good point I mean they expected it's not yeah came out of nowhere well you know I mean it's like so that's the thing it's a trump bad but I don't know what the geospatial people are to I don't have to thought I want to throw my hat in with geospatial intelligence yeah I don't know what that means I mean maybe we need it with you know but listen again to stand-up comedians talk about what the world needs yeah it's not great it's fucking terrifying I mean I've been but trying to stress this more than ever because the fact that I have a microphone right and people are listening don't fucking pay attention to me okay I am NOT right well the best thing is listen you know you don't know you might be might be right but I'm definitely not an expert the best thing is if you go on Twitter and a comedian will tweet something really you know it's like we're living in fascism and then you had 400,000 likes and then the next tweet have you ever seen this to go and while you guys are here check out my web series and you go are we are we living in fact if we're living in fascism you can have a web series you can have a web series and do I have the time to look jure eight in your web series or should I start arming myself the throw the government what should i what should I look at my phone I'm like which way should I go yeah but that's all they do they go by the way while you're here I have a patreon we're doing a project I'd like you to throw a few bucks there but we're living in fascism and you know well the signal-to-noise ratio in terms of what people tweeting it's almost mostly noise it's noise there's a few people that are great you could follow a few people that are really posting about real news and yes four there's some journalists 17 of them I think journalists are maybe the best people to follow on Twitter right now it seems like but the problem is who's a journalist there's very few yeah real journalism takes a long time yeah it's expensive like real investigative journalism but I've had some of these guys on my podcast they come on they go they've ruined their life they spent five years looking into something nobody cares about they figured out it was true and nobody wants to talk to them right they will have white hair their families hate them they live in little apartment in New York City that's a journalist well sometimes people do journalism right and they they do spend a long time working on the project and it's in something like the New York Times and no one cares no one cares like the thing about Trump like the report on Trump this scathing report they thought was gonna bring him down literally it was in and out of the news cycle on the day or two yeah that guy just pops an extra adderall and doesn't give he doesn't care it doesn't give a fuck he is the only guy that should ever write a motivational HealthSouth ha ha the secret right never the secret is he's got it I think it's speed you think it's speed you think he's really yeah yeah I do yeah I think it's speed I think he's on something I mean I think this is the only way that it makes sense to me that a 70 plus year-old man has that much energy does an exercise eats fast food and he's fucking bouncing off the walls and he can campaign for days and days just slam KFC double downs and Flay of fishes and let me ask you this yeah how often you think he gets his dick sucked good question who's doing great question and not asked enough right probably not that much I don't think a guy like that is driven by sex I don't get that maybe he may be but milania seems to be not into it as much seems a little upset with him she seems a bit cold but there she's Slovenian or something something like that they're cold that's well just summer generalization they're white so I can generally say what I want about them Joe okay let me see what the hell I want Eastern Europeans okay thank you she's cold well she I think she's a little annoyed with him you know I mean it should be very humiliating for her they had the best life yeah up until he ran for president he I mean imagine telling his kids he's like I know you got World billionaires yeah your party everyday you do coke with impunity it's some New York City nightclub when you're bored of that you go to Europe do it on a boat when you bored of that you go to some orgy Athens that's all done right but we're going to Canton Ohio and I'm given a speech and you can stand there because and every camera and every news reporter is gonna watch every move you make for the rest of your life we're gonna crawl up your ass with a microscope - and everyone hates you yeah and some of them might be going to jail I mean we don't we really don't know what's going on with this Mueller investigation I think a lot I mean I think it's gonna be disappointing everybody's preparing us for disappointment everybody has prepared us for disappointment yeah CNN is actually saying that that don't expect much it's like when you get a report card and you tell your parents you like no I've changed but I'm still me I'm still the guy who gets high before he goes into school hmm and was caught smoking by the priests like I used to get caught smoking weed by the priest who was driving into my Catholic school and he would drive me to the school so I would be like yeah I've made some changes but I'm still very much that person that you guys raced so that I think is what the Moller report is gonna be like trumpet the thing about Trump is he's corrupt he's a conman you know he said he'd this whole wolf that there is no wall well this is not coming little links the wolf that is some wall there's no wall this is the signs that they finished a wall but this part this part of a wall is more for there's more of a wall around houses in Bellaire right then there is at the border well you know it's a smaller area billar it's yeah and there's probably more of a reason to have a wall you know and the people that run Bel Air are probably more serious yeah yeah there's definitely something that you know I I don't know about this whole wall thing I really feel like it was one of those campaign slogans that he got stuck with you know build that wall and then once he got in he's I got Christ I really got to build this fucking thing it's a slogan someone whispered into his ear you think Ann Coulter probably said get out there it's a build the wall and he goes that's good I mean he just went out there build that wall I love the one of the speeches he doesn't really build things he let Glenn's his name to be franchised yeah it's not a bit like this idea that he's like a bit the things he's bill are disgusting if you go to Atlantic city what can any building he is bill it is to Chris Hedges wrote a book he's a interesting guy he wrote a book called America the farewell tour and he goes he went he went to Trump Tower Atlantic City goes there's junkies in the bathrooms there's like rats running around he's falling apart and he's like that's kind of what you know America will be but no anything he's built is not nice did you watch it there was a documentary by an architect called Costas Carey honest and he and a lot of the documentary is about him convincing Trump to not make his building gold in New York City and it's like is it gold in New York City or no but it's gold in Vegas it's gold a lot of places but later he was gonna ruin the the downtown of Manhattan with a gold building well if why is that ruining it though a gold building why not you spent too much time on the west coast but why is that bad why is it bad to for it to be one car is it better if it's all black or it's all white so here's a look it has a feel you can't come in with a gold building it's not Vegas it's not Atlantic City this is not Reno like Mandalay Bay what goes on in a gold building I've never looked at a gold building and said I bet what goes on there is honest like good and decent gold building should be for doing coke and losing money right that's what it's about you'll screw up gold building you get a check up that's good point yeah yeah that's a very good point that's gaudy yeah it's disgusting yeah yeah gaudy is a weird thing right like who's that who's that good for like when you go to a place and it's got opulent chandeliers yeah gilded you know it's a structure or sociopaths who sacrifice human beings mmm that's the way they want to live they want to live in a palatial opulent environment and then just you know I think Matt Taibbi said this yeah he said that Trump is a poor person's idea of a rich person absolutely that's what it when a rich person yeah when a poor person thinks about a rich person they think oh he's got his name on his jet and he's got his name on his building the guys I grew up with in Long Island if somebody went to them and said hey you could own the Miss Universe pageant you could have a building with your name on it you could be in the WWE that would be amazing you'd be a winner they would be a winner where I grew up in Long Island that would be that is the highest you can go so I think that's kind of what it is it's a very what's we see what's appealing that's also what's appealing about him what's appealing about him is there is no veneer right you don't get the idea that you're being played you get the idea you know you're kind of being played but you're being played on a level that you accept it's like when you go buy a car and you know the salesman you know I used to be in sales so like when I'll go to buy something sometimes I know the salesman needs the sale cuz I used to so like sometimes we'll be like you're whatever it is what it is you know I just I'll do it that's kind of with Trump you know you're being sold but you're okay with it right you let it happen what do you think's gonna come after him seems like he's thrown a giant monkey wrench into the gears Twitter is any indication a prolonged civil conflict where there will be where some will emerge as a few different nation-states will barter with each other I don't know maybe Joe Biden and then nothing he's got no chance he's hoody who's coming war alive she's got no chance Bernie they hate now yeah I know a lot of people hate Bernie what happened I don't know existed some guy and his staff was accused of sexual assault oh and now they hate Bernie he's a racist that's you know that's what happens Bernie's he's a white straight male he doesn't get it uh he doesn't get it plus he has like two houses you know he's worth like $300,000 you know that offends people does yeah how'd you get that money off the backs of poor people yeah in a country by the way where people make that in an hour on YouTube you know some people logan paul and all those guys those guys you know yeah you see people in LA I see a kid in LA on a skateboard I'm like he's a millionaire he owns three houses because he's a YouTube livestream er yeah he's probably playing video games on Twitch yeah everything my parents told me to do go to school that implies impoverished my generation everything they told us not to do which is play video games watch TV get high is making people billionaires it's amazing yeah they were wrong they were definitely wrong boomers were wrong about everything well they didn't see this coming Nancy this crazy come see anything coming you know what concerns me is this the rise of people that think that everyone owes them something sure you know that's the story that's the weird one like we were talking about aoc who you know sudden she seems like a nice girl good-looking woman she's young she's got energy she's one do good things she wants to do some good ones but I saw the one thing that said give money to people who were unable or unwilling to work yeah that's not so that not gonna work well it's not in they pulled that out they pulled that part out the unwilling park in unable to work makes total sense you know we as a community we should take care of the people most of the people are now in common you're unable to work most of us most of us yes this is the only thing we can do but her thing was a weird one because that that thing unwilling to work it's like hey you just you just crossed over into crazy town like this is a but that means that crazy town was always in the back you always had that yeah when you put that on paper yeah that means this is something that's been discussed like part of the appeal and she just I don't know how influential she wasn't getting Amazon to drop out of New York but I live in Queens so everyone is paranoid Amazon was coming I was in bagel I no carbs no good I was in a bagel shop I gave up dairy two weeks ago turning it around trying to get around I was in a bagel tray it was paranoid about Amazon Amazon is gonna come we're all gonna get priced out of our little shoebox is if we live in or some of the people that owned those shoe boxes were like I'm a millionaire now because Amazon is coming and but here's the thing it's hard to have a rational discussion about a quality quality right now because in a place like New York City it's so expensive to live and the reason for that is that it's a destination for like foreign capital so essentially a lot of the buildings in New York City foreign people buy apartments they don't live in them they use it to like launder money and they buy them not even under their real name they buy them under the name of a shell Corp like an LLC and then they have like these investments and it really makes everything insanely expensive that's what's making everything guys what's making a lot of real estate in New York City expensive what do you like what if you gotta guess what percentage of like expensive apartments are owned but I'll tell you between 2008 and 2014 I think percent of apartments going into contract were because I do a shell buy used to be a double-decker tour guide New York City and so I do a show like a funny comedy show where I take I sell tickets I put people on a tour bus and then we'd go around these buildings just scream at these buildings it's fun it should be illegal but it's fun and and no one cares cuz they're not home because they're somewhere I mean if Hillary if you look at who owns these buildings it's a guy who like is maybe a guy who owns a mining company and he poisoned a river in Zambia a lot of these guys are doing things they shouldn't be doing and they want to stash their money in real estate London is insane more expensive than New York Rose London is all essentially shell corporations you know these phantom buyers buying up real estate in London in New York so you have people in New York that know the system is fucked they know the markets being artificially manipulated Bloomberg thought it was great Bloomberg goes we want all the billionaires he said it that was his quote we want all the big it's like some of those billionaires have done things that would make you would keep you up at night they've you know numbers like bring a man they eat shrimp and steak they'll go to Peter lubbers a businessman right that's the thing so people get fed up with this and dude when I was at my tour bus people would get on from regular places like Pennsylvania now just point and go 10 million 20 million 30 million people just shift uncomfortably in their seats like what the hell's going on right here this is the you know I saw Trump getting elected during those tours because I'm like a hundred million dollars and they're like sitting there like what I can't afford a knee operation well the idea that Trump's not a part of that is if he listened in his bit his building was a huge destination Russians loved his building yeah they loved it they loved a brand name they loved the plaza they loved his building and a lot of interesting characters lived in Trump Tower didn't they take the Trump Tower name off of it in New York yeah I don't want to sound there was one of the buildings where the the people that owned the coop decided to take the name off of it I made me there's a lot of shitty like trunk nursing homes to drive into New York oh yes nursing homes you know those elderly people getting beaten it's hard so you know they're getting fleeced the beaten you go by you see like Trump pavilion it's like a soviet-era Architecture horrible like old-age home that's been there since the 70s and I'm like man I feel for the people in there the screams New York condo votes to remove Trump from name yeah New York City condominium on Thursday we removed president Trump's name from the building's facade the second time at four months his name's been removed from a condo in the city 55% of Trump plays condo owners at 120 Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan voted in favor removing the large sign above the front door the buildings hit me that crazy who cares these are self-important people well one cares they're worried about their secure estimate oh that's a good point yeah I think if you try to sell it in its Trump place and you know you're gonna eliminate 50% of your buyers the dictators that are buying those apartments I think it's great big brothers I maybe they don't maybe they're like you know he's probably will probably go down the street to this no-name building we'll be better off but a lot of his condos were sold to you know Mafia and you know Russian business guys I mean he's always had bad you know he did Theo's it was his firm located in Trump Tower called Bay Rock financial which was a it was headed by this guy Felix aider felix aider was a guy who the FBI convicted in like a russian pump-and-dump stock scam and he worked in Trump Tower with Trump like he worked very closely with Trump and Felix had like informed I think on the Russian mob for the feds and the feds kind of let him earn and let so Trump has had this labyrinth of shady connections forever Wow and I don't know if that means that he's Ness I don't think he's an asset or of Putin or anything like that I don't believe that I think that's kind of just you know I think it's a lot of people would like to believe that but he's a shady guy so if you have all these people poring over his business deals for the last you know 50 years it can't be good there could be an amazing movie about him oh there will be yeah and who would play him good question hopefully not a white man Christian Bale I let him get fat just like he did with Dick Cheney when you played dick if he could play Dick Cheney's romp he could play Trump was a great Chaney I heard I haven't seen them yet I heard it amazing I you know the movie with like a lot of people the movie was good it was not you know it's I love like the big short to me was amazing I don't think it was as good as that but Christian Bale is phenomenal he's a phenomenal actor would you I mean to gain that much weight to become another person that's all thing with Jesse Smollett it's like they're all all these actors are sociopaths yeah their world sociopaths watch his Good Morning America interview and try not to laugh well now it's it's crazy what he said he's the gay Tupac like back and great those guys like oh my god crisis PR firm is telling him to do that the gay to POC no one's tell him to do that this is also this is Bridgette fantasy said it best she's hilarious yeah she said this is what happens when you let actors write the script let's try to see the plot twist coming a mile away I was in LA and afterwards at the table and he was talking and I'm like I don't know who this guy is but he's not even the person he is at this table right right he's trying out a person right now yeah have you ever been in that situation I don't know who he is but he's not this guy he doesn't know who he is either he's no clue it's just good-looking guy that's vapid he's full of nothing he wants to get famous yeah ASAP and they say things oh yeah other people are saying here's one good to see you yes when they meet you they say good to see you yes they might have met you and they don't want to forget 100% I've said that before nice to me like actually we met before I'm like fuck and they'll ask in a very strange way they'll be like what's going on yeah like what's up what's going on like you wanna do one right you want they want to you they want to be said yeah they want to be sent information yeah it's like what's going on and I'm like well you know a lot of projects it bro guest spotted flappers a lot of things happening and because you're always trying to move that's the thing about LA New Yorkers just pound yourself into the ground until you get funny that's kind of what the you are seen the New York scene is like do 57 shows a day give up on your life don't speak to your family they're losers are holding you back go hard la is like make a friend have lunch see what happens I talked to some of the people out here and I'm like what's the plan I get nervous for them I'm like they're getting high it's midday I'm like okay it's Wednesday - they're like we just had a meeting I'm like what you do they go we're talking about starting a podcast I'm like that's not a meeting you're just friends with someone else yeah you're talking about stuff that's not meeting but here's the thing it does work here and there are people that I know who've made the right friend and then their life changes yeah there's a little of that but those people are super transparent yet if you don't have any talent that's never gonna ever know it'll never work and then everybody resents you there's a few of those people that really don't have any talent but they made the right friends and they cling on to folks and everybody gets real uncomfortable well that was the thing I think the first time we spoke is I've written I think about Louie and after Louise and the whole news but Louie have you you all that love that piece but thank you it was so cute and honest yeah it was on Facebook which where I did a lot of my best playing what you were saying well it didn't read it after Louie a lot of people were rightly you know criticizing conduct and you know how to thing that that's all valid ensure 100% needs to happen but then there were people that were like you know Louie was never funny yeah or Louie was just you know of course he got all these things he was a white guy or and I'm like wait what and then Willie said this word I don't like well look at this joke and I'm like guys a week ago he was a comic genius we all agreed on that that was a widely held belief now out of nowhere he's not that funny and and these people are tweeting this from parking lots where they're performing some of these shows in LA or in like someone's driveway you know yeah and and which is fine I do them I have no problem with that you know but they're getting on Twitter and and and knocking Louie from the back of a parking lot where they're doing a show but what you the reason you gave why well because these there's in any industry people are gonna get ahead by being agreeable by having the right opinions by crowd sourcing their opinions by taking the temperature of the room and going how does everyone feel and those people are you know they're careerist they're very good at office politics they're very good at having the right friends but their contributions are never really important or long-lasting because they never get great because they don't take any risk because I think greatness is something you have to risk constantly to get to that level yeah so a lot of these people do very well they make money they're they're successful but they are careerist and they're looking for comfort and so when it was comfortable and safe to attack Louie and to bring Louie down and to elevate themselves they did it but they didn't do it when it could have hurt their career a week earlier you know yeah so to me it was very disingenuous and the fact that more people weren't calling it out and and I and I made that point where I said the same thing on the other side of people who styled themselves like I'm a free-speech warrior I'm this anti PC and their whole entire persona is is that the need to say the n-word right they're like I can't do a joke if the punch line isn't fact like they're like we have to yeah so those to me are kind of the same people and they're they're the people that are just trying to arrange the world in a way that allows them to succeed those are the types of people also like you were talking about the actor in the you know that you mean they're they're putting on a facade yeah they've adopted a predetermined pattern of behavior hundred percent that predetermined pattern would be of behavior might be I'm a guy I drink every night we go hard I'm an artist I smoke cigarettes right I don't give a fuck right now I'm not trying to get on TV yeah so to me it was like incredibly disingenuous you had all these people and a lot of them are angry and they're doing fine yeah like some of them are talent like some of these people have their own shows and they're getting angry at Louie and the hungry and I'm like there's a there's a real because here's the thing Ari Shaffir told me something made a lot of sense once he goes it's we can really be a waste to get into this type of business and end up in an office writing for show you don't care about in a job you hate punching a clock and that's stuck with me and always like it might be harder to go the other way and to build a fanbase and to do what you want but it's gonna be it's gonna be better in the end and you're not gonna be angry you're not gonna be resentful and I think a lot of the people that were were again shooting on his comedy not so much his behavior but his comedy are people that are would want more in this than they have and they're resentful that guys like Louie because it's not fair how talented he is well it's not just how talented he is his work ethic there's a lot of factors the risks that he does take I mean he says controversial things he always has whether you agree or not like one of things about the parkland thing you know when he got in trouble about uh you know saying that all you did was push some fat kid out of the way yeah that is so consistent with his material yeah the idea that anybody's saying like oh my god he's punching down like you need to go yeah Hugh his material right because he said a lot of risky shit because it was funny and he had really good points about it ya know is that something that I would joke about probably not right but he did you wouldn't talk about fat people yes I would but I don't think I would joke about kids getting shot it's a tough take yeah to make money but that's why yeah but I think he could I think honestly we were you're dealing with first of all the embryo of a bit I mean he's really only been doing stand-up again for a couple of months and back then it was even less and I think ultimately his idea that bet is that bit rather is that kids today like they want to be ave and of them they have 78 different genders and why am i lit why are you interesting you're interesting because you didn't get shot right that is his take on it and he probably with overall reaction and anticipation of reaction probably would have eliminated that part of the bit sure and you know what I'm saying like you know how it works absolutely I think part of it is - I was attracted to comedy because of guys like Bill Hicks are patrician people that couldn't like the things that those guys said you could only say on a stage if you were really funny right that's what I love about comedy me too that does it mean that everyone has to love that there's people that love it for a million different reasons sure but I love when Bill Hicks got up he said I was for the war but against the troops yeah that's still to me one of the most amazing jokes I've ever heard when he goes we had a war in the States I was in the unenviable position of being for the war but against the trick yeah he's like all those men living together yes I just don't like young people or whatever you fight it's just great I'm like oh you couldn't say that in a human-resources me you couldn't say that in office right you couldn't say that if you were out to lunch with a bunch of people probably you couldn't get away with that unless you were really funny yeah but these guys have gotten so funny and they've you know perfected their craft to the point where they can get away with these things that the goal is to elicit laughter it's not really you're not gonna change your mind but the goal is to make you laugh about something that's dark and horrible that's what I love about comedy yeah it's some of my favorite material some of my favorite material is fucked up it's wrong you probably shouldn't have said everybody make me howl out have you seen Holtzman no you never seen Brian Holtzman no oh my god at lights tour yeah yeah I should check him out how long you in town for I'm a TEFL ooh I'd leave early March for wedding oh right my back like a week a month now well he'll be here I'm sure he's here either Friday or Saturday he doesn't really do the road okay he mostly just does the store yeah I don't even think he does other clubs I think I just does the storms just an when I started in 94 he was coming up he was there at the store in 94 Wow and he was already there when I got there right and I was like whoa this guy is gonna be huge and for whatever reason he never left he does the store but he's a legend it's the best room I mean I just did a few guest spots there and I'm like oh this is the best room in the cut like I wouldn't leave I'm like this is amazing yeah you gotta leave like I'm doing the Improv tonight where I did the improv the other night I'm doing the Improv tomorrow night I mix it up yeah and I did the ice house last night right I mix it up you got I think you have to but it's the best room nor is he one of those guys who does his stuff for you like I can't believe I'm laughing when Susan Smith drowned her kids remember that he got aged that night is like ladies and gentlemen I heard those were bad kids I heard they sat that closer to TV they never put away their blocks that constantly spilt their fucking milk those kids would not be missed and like Jesus Christ Mitzi sure would not let him go on stage after 9/11 she would not let like you're on the bench in how long oh my god she's like don't let him on that bench after 9/11 by Mitzie sure that's great bye Missy she won't let you get away with fucking anything that's a wild leg now now and this is pre social media - it wasn't worried about a tweet storm no no that she's like you can't you can't let him up I love pre-twitter to not let someone up it has to be so egregious he's a fucking animal man awesome this is so funny he's so far these are the things you laughed the heart you know when you're I was looking at his like when I was going through a Taco Bell drive-thru in 11th grade and we were all stoned the things you would make jokes no get in the car would ever go that's too much if they did get rid of them they're done do you know the lines that no we would see each other's families my mother's just too phrenic we would make fun of my mother you know and it was great yeah I still do yeah if you're someone you feel he's mentally ill you're not making fun of them you're it's your problem the difference is between East Coast and West Coast comedy is a West Coast comedy they hold that carrot of a sitcom yeah or you know hosting the Tonight Show or something like that above your head we have health insurance always there East Coast comedy is just be funny be funny until you die be funny and and mean there's a lot of meanness and there's a lot of hold in the winter it's cold and mean and definitely you know it's but you know what I like about West Coast comedy - it's a lot of performing because the rooms are big yeah that music Big East Coast rooms a little smaller she have a lot of like writers right I love the Performing style so I kind of like seeing people in the store with big acts yeah there's not a lot of room to move like if you're at the stand or the celery's on you're a little small yeah they're tight little rooms there are some great performers in those rooms that rock out in this roller in vibe but like when I was in the store I was like oh the human and that's awesome especially at the main room the main room is amazing giant stage yeah it is interesting I like those really small and to mint rooms in New York they lend themselves a lot to talking to the crowd and being sharp and having really sharp bits yes hit mm-hmm and then I think and that's where I gotta go everywhere because you need when you go on the road you want to you want a little bit of everything yeah you want to be able to perform and you want to have sharp jokes but you gotta be able to do crowd work you gotta you know yeah I started out in Boston and Boston was always no one has a long attention span everybody wants to do the jokes quick and if you start bombing you're not gonna recover really nobody recovers in Boston it's tough out there once you start eating shit they're done with you Bobby Kelly would tell me stories about like the rooms he came up doing they are rough rooms yeah we came up together yeah I mean I did a lot of road gigs yeah yeah yeah yeah and which to lose that like what area boss is that like outside of Boston yeah we did a lot of the dick Doherty comedy Hut's okay out in the middle of fucking no sounds great Wooster oh they were great they were aku-aku yeah which is like a Polynesian restaurant yeah and they would have comedy hut I went I did it I did one of the 15 minutes Netflix specials I went the next day too two days later I went to a room in Massachusetts got side of Boston and I bombed so bad it was amazing I was like well this is why the funniest people in the world come from this state where was it before your eye where was I I forget it was a um I don't want to say the actual field it who did book it this guy book that he knows exactly he'll probably tweet me or something but it was in God it was out so it was like 20 minutes outside it was in it was in not Hingham it was it was somewhere and it was not good it was just a bar it was a circular bar and I got up and in nobody was like and what in the middle of my set a woman the drunk woman started yelling me and then I yelled back in her and then it was okay because we yelled at each other for 20 minutes what did she yell I think it was something if that funny if fat fucks up like something that was justified at that moment in the set I went back at her I was like listen to me fucking animal and then it was great and then they they perked right up right and then the material worked after that it was exciting when something like that happens like finally that was it was the Trump moment this moment where people are like sat up in their chair so like okay week you know when I was living in Boston you could make a living and not leave oh wow you could stay in Boston and you could go 20 minutes here 30 minutes there you go to Andover you go to Hingham you go to Framingham you go to all these different places and you got gigs and I mean you wouldn't get rich but you could pay your bills and never leave town and so there was so much comedy there were so many rooms like Barry Katz had a bunch of rooms and the comedy connection had a bunch of rooms and Mike Clark had a bunch of rooms and it was summer that's what like really got you really strong yeah because you're mostly doing these hell gigs during these hell gigs everywhere and so when I came to New York what got me was that everything was like small there were small crowds small stages and you would do a short amount of time yeah and I was like whoo I don't like this that much there's a showcase at like 15 10 15 minutes yeah because I was doing like middle sets I'd do a half hour yeah and then I was headliner and I do 45 minutes also come out to Long Island we have kind of in summation yeah you know of Boston they're wild folks so I did a lot of gigs and online yeah a lot of gigs in Long they'll tell you the benefit of the doubt is non-existent yeah when I got out there East Side commie Club was there oh wow I was back in the day when Jenny was still around I remember I tell the story all the time but it's so crazy like people forgot how goddamn good Richard Jeni was he was there one night he did four different hours on Friday and Saturday so he did two shows Friday to show Saturday four completely different hours and the the the opening act and the this uh the fuck was it the fuck was the emcee was a friend of mine Peter goddamnit Peter Boyle baby appeal forgive fails Peter bails yeah yeah yeah I know a good dude yeah older guy yes who's younger back then this isn't back of the dizzay but he was just like shaking his head like what the fuck man the guy did four different hours yeah and I remember you know I was just barely starting out I was sitting back on what the fuck yeah how does a man do four different hours he was he didn't repeat a premise he didn't repeat a punchline he did any crushed and this is one weekend one weekend two shows Friday to show Saturday he was a genius man he was responsible for so many people's acts to they would tighten up people he worked a lot with rock you know work with a lot with Chris on the road yeah and and worked on helped him with his specials was he from Boston Jenny or no he was in New York guy okay yeah yeah I think he was from Brooklyn he was fucking amazing that but that was a East Side comedy club back in the day yeah yeah no it's good those rooms like governor's are brokers I like their homes because you go out there and if you're funny you're funny you'll care up yeah and if you're if you're like lacking or I feel like a bits half done they'll let you know they'll let you know let you know yeah they paid the money yeah to let you know yeah you'll hear it audibly yeah but that's good you need that ass like Halle Quinn builds his shows there and if they're amazing yeah because and they're you know his new shows great red state blue state but like did he healed it out there I don't know if he did this one be built a lot of his shows out there because like he goes out there and he says if it's good they're really gonna let you know right so it's we're a lot of comics will go in tests similar to those rooms in Boston mmm you really test you get coddled a little bit in New York City in LA yeah you get coddled so you've got to go out there to somebody who doesn't give a shit that's you know the people who were like listen I'm either those people out there don't choose to laugh right they laugh or they don't right you could Echo Park they choose yeah they sit there when they go or they're going to go no like in their face you'll see it they'll be no out in those areas like LeMond it's an instinctual guttural laugh yeah it's not it's it's it's not that yeah the thing about like laughter when you're choosing to laugh right he in here and there it's so pretty pretentious it's not fun yeah it goes back to that example of like growing up you're making people laugh who the hell's choosing to laugh hmm-what psychopath is sitting there going ah also they're mostly in the business like a lot of the audiences in the business the whole thing is that's weird entire thing is agents who are like 22 years old yep they're like embryos just so young the agents and agents and managers for the most part excluding mine who I love but agents and managers they're rich kids who can't do tech or finance let's be a lot of them there's a quite a few let's be honest these are rich kids whose parents go hey can you do something because I don't wanna look at you anymore and they're not gonna get a job at Jollibee right so they're gonna go get a desk at UTA or CIA or WMA and most I mean everyone needs one too that's the other thing you're not gonna negotiate on your own you're gonna do a terrible job if you can negotiate your own gigs I will take any amount of money to do anything I mean III mean I'm horrible at negotiation I was bad in sales sales didn't work and now I'm here you know apparently Bill Murray doesn't have an agent or a manager he has an answering machine really if people call him up and they make him offers to do things and he'll like listen to those messages and go I'll do that one he just goes and does it well if you're like a legend like that yeah I guess you can do that if you do whatever he wants what an interesting system no I need an agent like blackmail people the CIA level blackmail to get me into rooms well the thing it's it's not just that like you need someone to actually do the talking for you to like get gigs oh yeah or you know to negotiate your money or to do your air travel it's call me and she'll be like they wanted 85 shows over the weekend I got have done a sick you know yeah come look at new work comics so if they want 9 7 show I do it y'all do it do you get when five shows on Saturday I'll do it shows on Saturday night yeah three at the same club sometimes yeah those are weird the third show you don't know what the fuck it's not even comedy anymore no what is counting I don't know what's happening at that point but um it can be really fun the third show a lot of times is people the audiences people who've been asked to leave other venues right so they're drunk and walking by the club nigga and that you just their friend brings him in this is literally I've heard I've literally spoke to somebody I'm like why are they here and they were going we're asked to leave and they saw it and they just saw the lights and they like lights so we brought them in and now you're talking about you know frozen yogurt or would have in there you know it's nuts what sideshows crazy what's the latest set you can get in New York City these days oh you can go I think it's like a 245 or some you can get some Crees 45 maybe it's 230 maybe it's two you can get something really late Wow people are up who the fuck is there - 45 there's people really yeah what's it like it ain't I mean I think it I think it's pretty good depending on the night like a Saturday night - 45 probably great water it gets yeah I think the sellers the latest I think you can get but as it gets louder I mean as it gets later people get drunker I used to do Dangerfield's that's it yeah yeah and we should do prom shows yeah do you ever do the prom show thing I'm not a prom show act this is what they do if a bunch of kids are sitting here and I walk out on stage it's a bad prom well it's always a bad problem the prom shows are terrible yeah so what they do is they they don't you back in the day at least they didn't change the crowd so you would you would go out like say if there's like four comics on the lineup there's an emcee and three other comics and then there's a next show it starts all over again I am see the same three comics the audience is there so they want you to do the exact same act so that the kids will leave because they have no account of the kids so the glasses pull up and they're just stuffing these kids in there and they're hoping that if you do the same bits the kids will get bored and they got mad at me because I'm like look I'm not doing the same material I see the same faces it's boring yeah I'm only doing a 15 minutes set I go I have more material I'm gonna bring other other bits yeah yeah like you got to do the same jokes or try to get these people out of here Mike how about just guess just grab him just get him out of here yeah just light a fire but we would do him till 5 o'clock in the morning danger for the last time I was in danger feels it was four people in a room two couples the waiters about in his mid-80s it's dark and I'm performing in front of a piano it's one of those nights where you go you know this was a choice I made to get into this business but there's something haunting about that room and it was actually fun I'm just entertaining two couples yeah it's crazy I did one couple once at Dangerfield yeah there was no one there was no show I had a 9 o'clock spot wasn't it is I had a nine o'clock spot yeah I got there at 8:45 the comics are sitting around the bar I go what's going on like there's no one here I go there's no one here yeah and then right when I said that this couple walked up and Bobby who was the the doorman there's this yeah fucking Scottish powerlifter guy he was like 5 foot 10 and 5 foot 10 wide Johnny I saw him grab a kid by his neck at one of these prom shows and pick him up by his neck and carry him out of there jeez anyway he was this tank of a man he was always fucking hilarious and ruthless on the comedian yeah yeah yeah you gotta try that bag of shite you call a fucking act and and anyway these people walk in he's like ladies gentlemen welcome to danger fields come on right in and he brings him in and these people walk into his empty room and sit down and they're like what the fuck that's crazy and then all of a sudden the lights come on and then the emcee comes out and they sat through all of us Wow that's where I was like you know fourth on the lineup or something like that like i did my fucking 15 minutes in front of these two people and they were into it they were great yeah they were great but it was weird you know it's those shows what's good about those shows he'll do well they may they let you know what's bullshit in your act yeah embarrassing it that's a great point yeah you feel it feels clunky coming out of your mouth right especially to three people well there's always things are always clunky right right like what went in when it's a small crowd they're really clunky like when you're working on material every time I have a premise or even if I'm fucking telling a story a lot of times like as I'm starting to tell the story like the beginning part is a little fucking clunky and maybe I'm saying something the wrong way and it doesn't make total sense and then eventually it catches on if you do that in front of two people they're like what are you doing yeah the best story about Teja fields was there was a guy who walked in once I was sitting in the bar area he had a Rodney Dangerfield doll and he walked in he goes listen I've had a business for two you know for 10 years up the block and we found this doll I'm moving you know wherever he was gone when he's like we're closing up shop here you go I thought you might like it and then the guy took it he said to the owner he said he just was know speaking right he just showed him the stall and then the owner just pointed and then the guy carried this Rodney Dangerfield doll down the stairs and just put it in like storage and it was a darkest moment which is such a dark moment to sit there silent just the owner went and pointed and the guy just took this Dangerfield doll and he walked it down into God only another phantom of the opera' whatever the hell goes down under that club but yeah that's a real that's like the oldest club in the country how's it still open aye that is a great question that the FBI would probably want to look into I don't know cuz everybody's get the same story people got 25 years ago it was no one there I mean that fucking show that I'm telling you about that was 25 years ago there's never been anyone there I don't know it's money off those prom shows though they were packed it's like a great joke about like Nanette that my buddy Nick Mullen is an amazingly funny comedian said he's like an and that's no one's seen it's just a trailer like no one's seen than that it's just a trailer and everyone's like it's brave it's amazing it's my number one it's just a trailer it literally doesn't accept so maybe I don't know but it is it's one of those rooms in New York that's kind of haunting yeah it's a strange place did you ever listen to the day the laughter died no Dice clays double album that he filmed there oh wow with no audience no one knew he was coming he had no material zero that's amazing just started talking about shit and ad-libbing things yeah and he was as big as a fucking comedian could be at the time and he called the day the laughter died Reuben produced it that's a minnow I've heard of it but I didn't know it was fucking brilliant and amazing haribol at the same time really some guy gets up in the middle of the set he goes you're about as funny as a glass of milk oh what a polite Apple what an old-fashioned heckle I've never heard that you're about as funny as a glass of mass lovely yeah some guy from Connecticut or something like that you know and he got mad you got mad at dice and and you know a dice is just shitting on him and shit on everything ice probably just destroyed well was it was destroying him but I'm telling you he wasn't even trying right it was it was like he was at some crazy place in his career where he just decided to do a set or he's bombing do you ever think of doing something like that Gracie you ever think of just going crazy and do it something completely new yeah I'm just trying to do first of all I I would feel bad I can't do something bad on purpose because then people if I do something bad like if you ladies and gentlemen if you hear it and it sucks I fucked up that's it I've made a mistake I didn't do it good right I didn't didn't put it together right it's trial and error sometimes it's an error yeah I'm not gonna do anything bad on purpose yeah but he was so big and no one had been that big before where I have to realize no one had done arenas before him right he was a first arena come first yeah the first yeah and a fucking hundred of them he would do them all over the country yeah and he just had had enough for whatever reason yeah fucking everybody loving him yeah it's like fuck you you just went out and just had fucking double CD it's great double CD it's like a Broadway show like a live album recording of a Broadway show hours of no material just rambling talking about stuff punchlines that don't make sense you just have to do it walking great to this day it's one of my favorite comedy albums of all time I listen to it every now and then for like 15 minutes my car just go what the f√°tima is it all at Dangerfield yes oh all that Dangerfield's no one knew he was coming yeah and when they saw him they like holy shit it's Dice Clay it's probably 20 people in the crowd you were so excited they probably did it on a Tuesday or something right he's an animal that's amazing though yeah that's a make that to me that type of stuff I like I like that type of stuff because to me it's like it's the raw essence of what this is I found out about it from another comedian named Mike Donovan a hilarious guy from Boston yeah and he was crying laughing describing it and describing this bit the dice was doing about Nixon eating ass and he was doing this whatever it was so ridiculous but if you have a reason Mike Donovan was tears were coming out of us he couldn't breathe he was describing it I was like god I gotta listen to this fucking that nice is one of those guys and you're watching me like this guy can just talk yeah and it's funny well he's gonna interesting he's been around for so long yeah and you know to me he's always represented to me my childhood yeah because when I was like 19 was the first time I listened to his cassette in my car with my girlfriend and I could we just cry and laugh and I couldn't believe how funny was is that what made you was he one of the guys where you were like I want to start dealing stand-up yeah for sure he was definitely one of them him and Kinison him and Kinnison prior but prior was see like I remember watching those guys in than watching prior and like God Pryor was so smooth he was so so what he was so personable and vulnerable he was something different because he was vulnerable you know he would talk about like his life and his problems and all these different things about being addicted to drugs and all these different ending it was so intelligent but vulnerable and honest and and the timing was so good he was such a master remember we were watching doesn't mean my roommates at the time we watched the Kinison special and then we watched Richard Pryor and my friend it was never a comedian never even thought he goes that fucking guy's the best yes he's just the best and it was just we were both in agreement like yeah he's just better it's just the way he did it you know and this is you know Bob we're talking like 1988 chore so it was still fairly fresh and Pryor was still alive and it was just different you know he was he was like the first I mean obviously Lenny Bruce was the first really honest comedian like or one of the first honest social commentators and then the I know Karlin but Pryor took it to a weird personal place we like we're rooting for him you know the most personal of all those guys because the Hixson Karlin were famously like not personal yes and Pryor was personal yes yes at personal and and you know he would like emphasize humanity yeah like you would emphasize like loving each other and being kind to each other that was a thing yeah absolutely yeah absolutely but uh you know my parents took me to see live at the Sunset Strip and I was a little kid oh you saw it the actual no no no I saw them in the movie threat movie theater and that was probably the big seed that was the impact yeah because I couldn't believe how funny this guy was just talking yeah I remember looking around the theater and these people were like falling out of their chairs we'll have fun on the mic I can't believe this guy is just talking and it's amazing yeah because all these movies that I'd seem that were really funny it was a bunch of things happen and explosions and fucking stripes yeah but this was not that yeah I saw I saw Eddie Pepitone taped his special a few days ago at dynasty typewriter and he's one of those guys who's so funny and so electric yeah that you have a roomful of you know the type of people were kind of talking about you're more button-up you know more of that kind of alternative crowd they were barking and howling and how funny he was and some of the things he said the first thing he does he grabbed the microphone he's like I'm on Molly just exploded he's one of those dudes I watch and I'm like man intensity he's just wrong an hour yeah he's now such a nice guy he's a great tip yeah I know him yeah I'm root for him oh yeah sweetheart yeah yeah and an odd guy look I don't know any other Eddie Pepitone no that's what makes him so great yeah this he's like this is an experience and the beat to me the best comedy I think is a comedy where you go oh I'm having an experience now I can't have again right right right I can't have this again right especially a live show yeah I can't go down the block and see this yeah it's not a steak house it's the same in every city right this is a fucking unique human individual that's having this experience at this moment and I'm lucky to be here with yeah yeah yeah live shows man this there's something about it that it's so hard to translate when you when you did your Netflix but you dip on the 15-minute ones yes how many is it they're doing a lot of those which i think is a good move they're doing four to five thousand Joe it's a great look it's a great move to have everyone have a special I think my mother is doing one it's very exciting you don't even have to do comedy I'm especially no you can just sit in a car and talk that's my next mission tape will be me speaking in in a car going through an in-and-out um bill burrs videos of him driving around his fucking funnier than just talking about there's the funniest thing about most specials um the Netflix she was a lot of fun but here's a reality I watch it back and I'm like it was funner in the room hmm you know it's just one of those things I bet bring the pain was better in the room even though it's amazing right right you watch that and you're like this is the highest heights of anything yeah that's why when someone breaks you laugh really hard on a special God imagine what have been like being there oh yeah I mean there's no comedies in act I have one of my friends always says comedy should be seen live in and and listen there's something different about a smaller venue like when people go see you at the store there's something different that's seeing you in a theater yeah the level of intimacy yeah you know seeing you work stuff out seeing you on in on the you know in the moment there's something different about that 100% yeah yeah I like a 150 to 300 seat room that's all like but I also like 11,000 seats to it yeah crazy it's fun in the weird way that's amazing and if you can make those people like feel like it's intimate it's like you can you can treat 11,000 people the same way you treat the main room it's like a hundred seat room that's filled with about 80 people that's good too this is low expectation what I like I like a big room full of a very small amount of people and they could sit back and get really drunk and not wear acts send all the waitstaff home shut off most of the lights yeah there's something there's something going on when you're doing a live performance that no one's ever really quantified it's some kind of mass hypnosis or some energy transfer yeah because I was an actor for when I was a kid I was six years old to 12 I was an actor whoa you can your parents idea oh it was my idea Cho and like real six-year-olds are six yeah it was great I was I knew with great license yeah I was on Sesame Street twice wait really yeah oh legit was it really your idea yeah well I pointed at the TV and said well I must my parents of lying cuz I don't remember and they are liars so they needed money also they said I pointed to the TV and said I want to be on that and I just and I and I made them you know take me on auditions now maybe they were looking over their bills and I was a good-looking little kid and they said he needs to start pulling his weight and you know we gotta start taking him out B I was on Sesame Street I was in a bunch of plays and stuff that live performance is different it's still energy yeah but there's nothing quite like being alone on a stage doing comedy well there's also a little much later it's all your shit you're writing it you're figuring out say it yeah you're crafting and putting it together yeah and that's how the rejection is the deepest how do you write I go on stage with an idea and I started doing these little videos on Instagram where I actually kind of rant about an issue and if people kind of respond positively to them sometimes I'll take that to the stage and I'll just try to rant about an issue and like find a few lines that are keepers that are funny and that's and then I'll sit down and rewrite it and relook at the bit and read but a lot of what I do has to be like how does it sound what'swhat's the inflection was the pacing so like being on stage helps a lot yeah there are things that I add what's hard for me or what I have to get better about is writing about things I don't care about somehow so like if like if you said give me 50 jokes about the Kardashians I would not want to do that but why would you need to well I'm not saying I do but I mean that's a skill some people have there's great monologue writers and stuff but if I see something that's ridiculous that I'm like perplexed by or I think it's funny I can devote attention and energy into making that funny yeah I say just concentrate on that fuck all those I mean that's that's but I do I am in awe of certain people week ago oh yeah there's a topic give me 50 jokes and they'll have them and they're good but you notice that those guys usually wind up working as writers and they always feel kind of shitty that's a lot of them too that's not a good when you're a great comic yeah you're working as a writer and sitcom that's a that's a bad and you were talking about it earlier yeah I know a few guys like Owen Smith you know once man I don't know now I've heard the name one of the best fucking stand-ups in the country yeah he's so good right he has this bit I don't want to tell you much about it cuz it's about adopting a white son it is one of the funniest bits I've ever seen in my fucking life it's so good that you like holy shit yes oh it's so fucking twisted yeah and so it's so like you can't believe what he's saying while he's saying right but this is a guy that is I mean skill wise one of the best stand-up comics in the country yeah but he's not known for it as mozzies got a real career as a writer ya know he's trying to branch out and move away from that but god damn that guy murders when he's in the Comi store we sit in the back of the room and watch yeah well a lot of people I guess with families and kids gonna make decision exactly that already things stuck with me when it's like do you want to be doing something you don't care about yes so to me I have to write about things that I'm interested in like I think people the people's careers that I want or the people that I envy their career seem to be led by their interests yeah things that interest them yeah well that's a better life yeah you know i I've done both I've done like when I was doing Fear Factor I wasn't remotely interested in it other than the paycheck right it was a good gig I'm not like I'm not shitting on it was a great gig I love that I had that job I loved being financially stable you know at the time I was like good not enough to worry about paying my bills it's a nice thing and it was a great group of people that I work with producers and everybody network everybody's great but there's such a difference between doing that and then doing a podcast oh yeah there's a giant difference well that's the way and the way that I've kind of done my podcast is like what do I care about yeah what do I want to know about who can i feasibly get on to talk about it those are the things that are interesting to me yeah not so much like let's just pick a topic that's in the news right that everyone will have a take on but I mean even even that if that's what you're interested in yeah I think that's course if you're interested in that yeah but as a comic to have no boss yeah that's something nice uh-huh that's the move yeah I see these comics Arquette they get pigeonholed and stuck into these gigs yeah well they don't want to fuck up the gig so they don't want to say anything controversial so their material gets bland and some of them take these big moral stands and it's like well you're making a crazy amount of money like some of them like I won't work here and I'm working if that person is on a lineup I won't do it I'm like yeah but you're making a lot of money that that drives me crazy it's crazy that I'm not gonna work with unless someone's stealing right stop unless someone's stealing or they're punching people or they're being a rapist or something and this is something so egregious they should probably in jail like what well you got creative differences right you fucking baby yeah get over here just get up there yeah I've worked with a lot of people I don't enjoy yeah and I don't have the luxury of flying you know I'm gonna I won't work this venue because this person weren't there it's like that's in that's good you know well I still don't I mean at the store that this I'm there all the time with people I don't even hardly know right you know I mean you're gonna line up with 1415 people yeah that but that's good too that's true the half of those people could be rapists don't use the actual rape right words well that's where we come in that's where it's very confusing right because we as comics especially comics like you and I that say fucked up shit yeah you can get away with things that are really not supposed to be in society anymore so sometimes people will get up and leave like it's fine believe like hey I'm joking sure don't you get that I'm joking aren't you drunk oh yeah you know isn't it 11:30 at night or your if you perform earlier but with me I'm like isn't it 4:00 a.m. yeah what's the problem right if you can't take this opinion now what are you gonna take yeah and sometimes it's not good yeah sometimes the material is parkland kids had never worked where I said I don't want anyone to get shot but the kid these kids are annoying these five annoying I said I don't want anyone to get shot I don't want any so I said let's ban guns but first we have to shoot these kids we have to kill the Parkland kids these five we have to shoot the phones out of their hands and they're gonna be the last and we could explain to them we're gonna go we're banning guns you'll be last five people to ever die and it didn't work and people's people were not exactly thrilled with it but it's like you should be able to try you should be able to try you gotta try should be able sometimes like you know you were saying you go on stage with a premise and then in the middle of doing that premise you'll find the beats sometimes you don't find the beats yes and it's just you think maybe the song there I've had a few bits where I was sure there was something there I've never been offended by a joke that's me personally like I've never have you ever been offended by a joke no I've never been offended but I've been like that one wasn't good yeah but that's normal sure yeah yeah it's some the the finding the beats on stage in front of a live crowd - there's something about that high wire that makes your brain go to these weird places that comes up with punchlines you have to fucking find a punchline you have to find something funny you have to these people paid money it's like it's like waving a steak in front of our junkyard dog and you keep tossing a little bit and then eventually like you have to throw a mistake and sometimes there's no punch line that's it that's just part of the fucking gig a trump rally yeah just screaming if he doesn't get elected do you think he goes and starts a podcast TV network he totally could yeah he totally could probably better for him honestly that's what he thought he was gonna do I think before he got elected I think he was having two high-level meetings with people in the media space to start something like that well once NBC fired him NBC fired him while he was running because the stuff that he said about Mexico and the throw of rapists yeah yeah someone's doing the raping hey this is so fucking crazy it's out of control for a person running for president and NBC is like that's it we're getting rid of you then they put Arnold in this place and I was a disaster yeah do you member that people forgot yeah Arnold hosted The Apprentice you're fired yeah it was that was horrible terrible yeah drop was shitting on them kids did they just scrap the show after that yeah here's a question does he go back to the apprentice well if NBC presidency I think he's too toxic now I think maybe you could come up with something like that for fog Oh Fox is in the scoop him up that's what's great about Fox they'll play ball don't play ball yeah they're not gonna leave money on the table you know what though they didn't want megyn kelly back do it yeah well she did a thing I'd used to do the show red eye on Fox News which was comics would try to be funny yeah it was there did it like 3:00 a.m. East Coast time and I saw her the week she was doing that and she was in like the dressing room and she knew she shouldn't have left she feel it she'd already made the decision but you could kind of see it in her face that I think she knew that she was gonna try to be this daytime TV queen and like let's bake cupcakes you know yeah I just spent four years on Fox News talking about Santa being white but now let's bake cupcakes because I'm I'm America's Sweetheart that's never gonna work well it's weird when you publicly change your image it's it's insane publicly changing your image shoot her shirts or skirts got longer oh yeah she covered her neck yeah you know there's no more cleavage every shell was about sexual assault she's done every single shows but I think she was trying to ingratiate herself in with the people that hated her which was like the New York media types the people that did not like her and then she was like well that's not even just about sexual assault one of them was a lady fuck Matt Lauer and she knew she was fucking him and she was talking about love she fucked him well I didn't know any better I was 25 right huh verse 25 you fucked a guy fuck what what happened it's bad here right well he shouldn't have fucked because he was married okay after that what happened what's going on Rath Angie just fucked him yes it was wet why is this a segment of a show as it's scandalous is that we did an interview with her yeah great yeah it was you know and she was saying you know I was young and I was impressionable sure of course funny to see them all put nails in each other's coffins isn't that great media's like this blood feud there's only a few families that control of this information they all hate each other that's why succession is such a great show well I think with Megan it was like that she had been sexually harassed while she was at Fox News she's going after I gotcha rails yeah yeah so she was going after and I think Bill O'Reilly too I think there was something he's 38 million so it's like what did he do I think was 32 my grandfather still has a Bill O'Reilly Patriots welcome doormat Wow you know it's a good man I mean imagine that's a giant amount of money it's the amount of money where what he did should be I mean it seems like it could be a Netflix documentary right lights gonna be hot it's like horrific like he offered her 37 million she's like no keep going Yeah right I'm gonna need more after what you did to me she's a thirty two million dollar offense yeah will do is that one recording they left on some assistance Adrian Makris yeah woman yeah touchable loofah sponge or somewhere I mean that's his that's what he was trying to do that's a creepy old guy move yeah get you with a sponge did interesting he tried to have his ex-wife he tried that his ex-wife excommunicated from the church what great did it he tried I mean know that why well cuz he wanted her to go to hell a church yeah what kind of donation you have to make to get your ex-wife sent to hell probably thirty two million he's got it but he wanted her acts communicated that's type of guy he is but the crazy thing is even after all this the guy still had a number one book in the New York Times people yeah people dig in they still those old fuckers they just give in they dig in they don't care they like him I know who he's folksy he's like my uncle he's a good man he's so what he's spent forty million dollars for some woman he tortured the tide goes in the tide goes out I'm with God I'm with God yeah well he was doing that that fuckin tide goes in the tide goes out you can't explain it one I was like wow are you at the Harvard you fucking piece of shit yeah well you can explain that one of those guys are they where religion like a fuck is fashionable to wear it I wear it they know sure no Troy doesn't he gets out and goes I'm a Christian I may not be the best Christian but I'm a Christian good enough you know and you're like not the best Christian you're a thrice-married guy who owns gambling and a in a Miss Universe pageant you're a biblical fit that's like a biblical figure that would be like a Roman king that everybody was warned about like in terms of like I mean I want him to shave his head what do you think that will do I just freedom I think would be funny if he shaved it like somebody had a cancer issue when he just shaved it with them did a good guy well it doesn't look good that's what's confusing to me like when I realized as a style when my hair wasn't looking good I mean if it was impossible to look good it was falling out to the point where like this is just a mess right then I went and buzzed it but he remember you I used to my generation always remembers you like the bald virile oh yeah yeah it's nice I've been I've been like this for a long time yeah I'm solid eight plus years yeah bald how do you want Trump to just go mmm I think you'd be better off it'd be easier like he's not good-looking like he doesn't know that he would that would complete his transformation into a super villain I guess like a Lex Luthor type towel yeah yeah yes like I just it's got to be so much work to put that hair together I think someone does it from but even then you go talk to them while they're putting it together I bet you he doesn't talk to them everything he does his tweets angry I bet you he's not concerned with the human relations with his staff no I just get that vibe I get that five I get that five the person who's in charge of the hair just does the hair I hope he retired when he retires when he's done I hope he goes right into podcasting would you have him on right now yes yeah of course you have to you have to yeah yeah yeah for sure yeah yeah why not why wouldn't he come on just three hours he's busy and I had some jokes about him he's Petty he hates comedy he does not like he doesn't like to be made on earth I'm sure Michelle wolf got him on Twitter a few times Correspondents Dinner and he went after her but she kept right back at him and I bet you'd be on my side if I killed a journalist yeah yeah Michelle's a kill shot yeah kill shot they're not gonna win yeah she's she snuffed him out which is great and she'll just forget it he just dropped off the face of the earth back out it was that she neutered one tweet neuter yeah there's some people that go after him though and it doesn't work and he doesn't respond that it looks so weird it's weird when I see my aunt tweeting at him I'm like ha ha ha what do you think this is gonna do my aunt with 43 followers did she say your disgusting representation of this country she'll tweet this right and then I have another aunt who's the other side that'll be like I believe in you keep going yeah and I just imagine him scrolling through these messages and reading this do you think he like looks at me I think he only looks at verified accounts I think he's like if you think about how many people he follows on Twitter I think he's wise he doesn't see the mentions I'll tell you right now his biggest fans are not verified I have a blue check there under 100 followers mm-hmm they have dog like to his biggest fan not just people voted from the people that are still like in love with him yeah a lot of them have dog profile pictures like a dog that recently died there's a lot of dead dogs Facebook flags no no water the banners no none of them have ever served in the military right but they all have the flag they all have the flag no one's ever served and 43 to 48 followers Magga under in the profile hashtag mega hashtag magma you know a lot of them aren't real do you know that who would are they they're Russian BOTS yeah yeah yeah it's real yeah there's a guy in Russia who's got that job it's not yeah it was Madison on Long Island there's a lot of people that have him they have various accounts they use interested there's a woman named Renee to rest at she's coming on the podcast soon she did a study of this for I forget what she did it for but she was on Sam Harris's podcast where she went in depth with it I'll send it to you after work times please it's fucking amazing but they did all kinds of crazy shit like they would have like a pro-muslim group and they would put on a demonstration right across the street from a pro Texas group and they would organize both of them they were really yeah they organs corn they would organize african-americans against Hillary Clinton anyone but Hillary we got to vote for Jill Stein we got to vote for anyway and they would like she doesn't represent us this is all Russians yeah and then they would have other people that were like Pro Bernie yeah and then Hillary fucked over Bernie and these CIA will just foment cooze and overthrow their leaders yeah you know it's nice it will just kill their people we don't fuck with their social mean I think we fuck with their social not sure we listen I'm sure we do I'm sure there's like I wrote off a lot of that Russian stuff is like people's wishful thinking but the more and more I read about it the more there is like a coordinated attempt seemingly yeah to in social media and so disco yeah yeah there's a hundred percent a real thing going on because this woman documented it and she was also really funny like she was talking about how many of the memes that they created that were really funny oh they're hilarious yeah and they came out of Russia so there's a bunch of guys in the room in Moscow creating memes yeah and it's so funny this is like they two KGB training or whatever it is now FSB and this is where they ended up I think they're people this is the frontier of the war against the United States the thing is though if they can do that and get people really upset if they really can do it that's a really effective strategy it's a great strategy you can make things happen now because it's just sowing internal discord we're gonna collapse our own system like I wonder how many of these Jesse Smollet is that his name Jesse small a is Russian the whole thing is Russian whole thing is Russian Jesse small a doesn't exist I wonder how many of the memes were created by Russians to try to get people upset I bet this bunch I bet there's more people stirring things up than just amazed Americans that are upset no I'm sure it's people that are but then there's also just a lot of Americans that hate each other does that yeah yeah there's that then you also what do you think happens with Jesse small light is Empire cuz ABC got rid of Roseanne for a tweet you gotta get rid of this guy I thought he was getting cancelled he was getting written out rather I thought I read today but I thought he was getting written out before this is one of the reasons why he did it well I support him if that's a case cuz he's a very hard business this is a very tough business it is hard it's hard to make it I love that they had to plan that out and he said to the two guys goes listen get a noose yeah go get rope and doing this a lot of these hate crimes first of all hate crimes happen and they're horrible yeah but some of these things are fake do you know he showed up at the hotel with the new still around his neck holding a Subway sandwich just that alone the people the people at the hotel should have been like what what happened that's amazing okay what happened why juice would and why are you eating its subway are you not sick to your stomach you're on Empire what the hell is wrong with you wrong subway subway it's not good it's not bad if you're hungry listen I've clearly eaten it yeah but it ain't great but if it's like two o'clock in the morning it's the only thing open why is it 2:00 a.m. that's a great point it's open cause it's a good move to be open when nothing else is open it's a good point get a nice Italian side with double meat I like tub Diab oil and vinegar so meatball with the mozzarella whatever and then you don't toast it you let the hot meatballs melt the cheese oh I agree with that yeah that's my meatball sub is always a good it's always a good mark especially after faking a hate crime after you faked a hate crime a meatball how nervous you after you do that Oh such a pussy I could never go I could never do what he did some level associate but then I saw that actor I'd dinner with the other night and I went oh he could do that yeah oh these people can do it yeah cuz they're on another level well the other thing is that people say who would want to be a victim who'd want to fake being a victim I heard that during the Cavanaugh hearing I was like that is a ridiculous thing to say there's a lot of currency in our business in our businesses a lot of conflict - yeah in the growth like people like crazed victims for selling out and they support them you get a tremendous amount of love especially if you're a legit victim something of course you know I mean there's a lot to that yeah that the idea that no one would do that is so this so against it's so contrary to human nature no everyone would do it I want to do it just would you do what kind of hate crime would you fake it's great idea I don't know if I got punched and people saw my face they go good you know what I mean like nobody would look at my face ago yeah okay good well I wrote I tweeted something today I was like a matte flapper Zhanna yeah what was it up my the 26 of flappers I was it was two guys was Hollywood with megawhatts they beat me up they poured something on me I don't know what it was I think it was come please come to farmers but I mean that's the thing listen the eye watches Good Morning America interview this morning and I laughed I sentenced my buddy I ago there's a moment in it when they go how'd she know it was the attackers and he goes like this he goes you could see the insanity you can see in his eyes oh I was like this he goes I was there and he's just doing that shitty actory shitty acting class ships that horse shit I was there and I'm like this is fucking crazy oh he was gonna inform on two guys if there were two white guys with Magga hats who got caught they'd be in jail right now because the detective said to him we have two suspects on camera do you think it's Sam he's like yeah then he found out it's his two buddies and he's like well I can't testify against them he was gonna testify against two people who they thought were guilty so he said that he thought it was them yeah he said yet there's a Good Morning America interview of him going yeah it's those two that takes it to another level yeah then Fox is like well we stand with hey he's good on the show we stand behind him that takes it to a completely different there would be people in jail right now he wouldn't care that you'll magic it's crazy could you imagine not just faking a hate crime but then putting people in jail magic being those two guys yeah we're just sitting in jail like what the fuck you're in the cover the New York Post nabbed um God I'm got up and they're sitting there like what the fuck and everybody wants to kick their ass they're an empire next season is all about Jesse smaller they fire everyone else on the show and it's just a Jesse Smollett story and two innocent people is the gay to park one raze the streets of empire that's why people in Ohio whenever Hollywood's like here's how to vote they go you know what no exactly they go you know what no thank you I see what you're doing you fucks fake and hate crimes what kind of hate crime would you fake if you're gonna do it it's a really lie to get ahead it's a great question what if what if someone gave you a license to fake a hate crime like what if there's a television show about faking a hate crime that's how they do like Punk'd you know there are fake things like that how about you fake a hate crime I'd love to do something like that truTV presents yes fake a hate crime yeah yeah it's interesting I don't I'm trying to thank conference whole deal maybe a halal guy would attack me in New York City like a halal guy would attack me because he views me as a symbol of imperialism and oppression mm-hmm there'll be good you know even though I could patronize his stand all the time he still feels the need to attack I mean I don't know I could never do that no I'm one of those people who would get and and I would get caught well they would never think I'd get away with it wanting everyone to think you're a victim when nothing really happened insanely selfish thing yeah that's an insane like faking physical crime I can't have someone punch him already hit himself yeah these Marcus Magga hat-wearing gangs and everyone's talking about in Chicago in LA in New York do not exist if you have a mag a hat on at 2:00 a.m. in New York you're getting bleached poured on you yeah Pratt's the reality well also like just he was saying that he like punched him back and like he fought back and I love how he was like first of all he was on camera for everything except one minute so they asked him a Good Morning America they go how long was this he's like it felt like several minutes but it could have been 30 seconds like he's covering the span of time in his in his lie he's going I gotta say it's less than a minute cuz I'm only off-camera for a minute whenever you hear about a guy who like kills his wife and blames a black guy yeah you know there's been a bunch of those right I've been at times and then you see the energy Samson for example did he blame someone who do you know somebody probably blamed him you think I'm kidding remember there was a recent one people were saying that his son did it yeah yeah my mother always believed that but again Safford confute conspiracy theory though right and that's where I don't really get into yeah I don't want yeah that's those are the ones that are out there I don't really get into that I don't get near the moon I don't go near I'm not an oj truther are you uh a gulf of tonkin guy or Operation Northwoods I was a little true there's nothing there's nothing those are all true Operation Northwoods is my favorite was crazy yeah they stay talked about bombing a ship yeah with people on it they were gonna blow up a drone jetliner and blame it on the Cubans yeah they're gonna they're gonna attack Guantanamo Bay armed Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay hazy yeah yeah that was not that was not that long ago I know that's why we need you back these are too fucking it's too exhausting I got exhausting cuz I would do a show and then somebody would come up to me after this show and they'd be like they'd show me a pizza menu I swear to god they go you see that and I go nine well what is it they go that's the NAMBLA symbol and I'm like I said I'm like it says garlic knots and they're like you bet [Music] though they're lucky I really look at it and I'm like alright I can't go the rest of my life with that will they look for it in everything everything's a conspiracy and then when it comes back to you and they say Oh Tim is involved in this right and then you go oh I see how this works yeah just make shit up yeah and then they believe it the CIA is now getting involved in podcasting yes you guys you're their first show but they're gonna get a few others on the deeply involved in stage starting sort of like the Russian Troy I love the idea of the CIA going and watching chat's and be like who's getting passed at the store oh oh you don't know I have a friend of mine who thinks that the CIA started Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix there's a book about that called weird scenes inside the canyon written by a guy named Dave McGowan yes I'm going to tell you right now Joe it's kind of interesting interesting there was a lot of shit going on in Laurel Canyon I'm sure probably about pussy there was a lot of weird shit going on the CIA the Rand Corp was all over there there was a lot of shit happening well I'm sure there was a lot shit happening but there is not a fucking intelligence agency in the world that can create a Jimi Hendrix course and they're not sitting there that book was like that they were managing the birds yeah the CIA was like they were like no it's mr. Tambor real is like a CIA guy gonna be like it's Tambourine Man yeah imagine being in that time in the country when everything was just falling apart left and right around us the Vietnam War Kent State just fucking Nixon's the president that's just chaos left and right no internet yeah everyone's doing drugs it must have been wild it must have been amazing yeah I mean I always think about that Hunter s Thompson quote about uh you know like we talked about the 60s and that in the 70s was almost like the wave crested and then just get scratched from Fear and Loathing in Las yeah yeah but I'm a big like I'm a Kennedy guy I think there's something really shady with that yeah for sure for sure for sure and in that book there's some amazing stuff about this book that you gave me as family a family chris is a guy russ Baker who's a legit journalist it's been praised by like dan Rather and boy Eggman trying to get you in this let me tell you right now this will get you in they get you went I don't have that kind of time George H did you know that George HW Bush called the FBI and said that he thought he knew who the killer of JFK was did you know that no no no they called the FBI they in Houston hey I said what's up it's George George Bush I'm in Tyler Texas and I think I know who the killer is and he informs on this guy James Parrott and James Parrott ended up being like one of his staffers it was this weird cover story he kind of planted and that came out in a memo and there was another memo these are declassified FBI memos Freedom of Information Act there was another memo that said after the assassination Chad drew Hoover briefed George Bush of the CIA the problem was George Bush should not have been working for the CIA at that point he should have been just a private citizen so it suggested he was working for the agency for a very long time mm-hmm and he was made the the director of the agency for one year after the family jewels came out which was this whole thing with the CIA went to Congress and they admitted that they had done all these things from you know coos and fomenting revolutions and countries and they made him the director for one year after that happened to break to make a clean break from all of the nefarious activities that the agency had been involved with but if you take that memo to mean that he had had an existing relationship with them he was actually just becoming the because no it made no sense to anyone they were like why is this guy that everyone called the lightweight becoming the head of the CIA after the CIA just admitted to all these horrible things they called him a lightweight yeah they called yeah he was like I think Kissinger in said to Nixon that kid shirts at the Nixon like he's lightweight he made him ambassador to China he was never a guy that had serious political capital and he was made the head of the CIA and then after that memo was on earth people were saying oh he had this was an extension of the cover-up he was being made the director at this very interesting time in history because he actually had worked with the agency forever and he was not at all a lightweight he was a serious operator and he was going in there to kind of clean up and transition them into a new era it's a I'm telling you I'm already out you're a nun yeah are you I can't listen to that it's good it's great though I need current shit I need something like Julian Assange I need something right I need some Edwards you know wishes are done alright you don't do the bush anymore enough I'll get an Assange book get in there oh listen to Clinton if you read up if you all dabble in the Clinton if you read a chapter of this yeah if you read a chapter yes I give me a cookie I don't have a cookie and if I do I'm taking but you will be you'll be it's very interesting and it's a well-written book as it's not reckless and sloppy I'll read the first chapter I promise thank you I will yeah listen nobody might gave me David Lifton's best evidence okay on the Kennedy assassination okay and that got me into conspiracy theorists it's like 92 and I get a sure you're at the end of the road now were you like this is a lot of people are full of shit in that world a lot of them and that's what people don't realize well then it gets deeper and deeper and deeper and more and more preposterous have you ever googled hashtag spaces fake no but that's sad it sounds amazing there is a thriving space is fake community have you ever been in space no good point could be faked come back come back to us Jeff prove it no what is big back oh it's an extension of Flat Earth it's like for people to think the flatter but in the conservative they go they go deeper it's like it's not stupid those Flat Earth cocks they want to move into space spaces think yeah you want to know what's really up space is phase space is fake yeah crazy but I mean I think there are hundreds of thousands of people that think that the earth is flat hundreds of thousands educated Western American human beings that think the earth is flat that is what it is fucking crazy it's interesting it's a lot of people that just get educated from YouTube the Guardian actually had an article about it I sent it to Eddie and you know Eddie's laughed at me see I think Eddie's kind of rational in a lot of ways because I meant his first he talks with him about what about well ya know the one that we had wasn't saying a little who's got something so firm it was attacking Malibu well he's the one that hit me trips me and Sam we're talking about they were using direct energy weapons and I was like I don't know if this attack Malibu with what I was like why would they attack mallet both over the fire but I'm like they're RIT why would they attack Malibu to rich people a fire started near my fucking house did when I started mal but they flew through the air you know I was one of the first evacuated right these fucking theories are so stupid it's dry as shit yeah a fire hits and the winds are going krey√≤l did they make the wind they made the well she always made the windows always been the CIA they've always made the wind yeah it's fucking it's just and there's no rest there's no peace I know there's no living in the moment it's a certain point you go I just don't even want to know this is horrible things going on these horrible things going on okay what do you think is like the worst shit going on right now human trafficking is very yes horrible horrible and the million dollar industry that's not Subway sandwich artists are paying for that right rich people some of them are involved in some very bad things yes and they're it's their tractor B they're covering your own tracks yeah like that Jeffrey Epstein yellow that's tough dude the Clinton visit anyone with an island and hanging out with Bill Clinton yeah if you have an island in you're hanging out with Bill Clinton there's a problem where's the montage yeah yeah it's crazy all of that stuff is very disturbing he got a sweetheart deal because he wouldn't inform on anyone that was on his plane and now they'll adjust this departments lemon in that again it'll probably be fine they'll probably just let him you know with a guy like that like what you know how much does he know how does it know that stay alive because he's not gonna say anything it's not gonna talk I wouldn't trust him if I was on that plane I think that's the other thing about see the aversion of conspiracies as you go like nobody would people would talk reality as people wouldn't talk if you were from a prominent family if it had been like a religion to stay silent if you had had CIA training if you would these people don't talk and we know that there have been lots that have gone unknown for a very long time close to in Iran sure so a guy like Jeffrey Epstein is so involved so deep he knows he'll get killed he won't say anything yeah he's not gonna say anything plus he doesn't wanna go to jail you just want to go to jail he doesn't want to say anything made all the things that he did yeah so weird that the child thing is the creepiest of all it's gross and unfortunately it's it's a it's a real thing yeah so what you know people you could talk about there's the conspiratorial eye angles the bullshit but then there's the real family Sandusky Sandusky man like Church 100% that's how the proper the people they're in love with conspiracies never care about private prisons right or the Catholic Church and like guys this is not even debatable right we're not even debating right private prisons are kids were being sold into slavery Bryan Abajo the judge in Pennsylvania crazy taking underage kids and just giving them sentences ridiculous sentences for shit that's crazy exchange for money that's not right and now he's in jail yeah it's there's some darkness in the world it's undeniable and when something like Sandusky when that Penn State thing comes out and you're like wait a minute how long was this going on for yeah how many everybody knew everyone knew how does everyone know yeah amazing turn oh just he died quick but this is what I'm of course this means emotions destroyed this is what I mean about people worse like YouTube's gonna like sense a conspiracy theory type stuff I'm like all of those things would have been called conspiracy theories at one point yes Catholic Church right and dusky yeah boo Ghraib they said it was a few apples it was a labyrinth of torture prisons it was a program designed by the Pentagon yeah it's crazy what is the YouTube gonna do they're gonna censor the Wreckers ending I think they stopped recommending conspiracy videos from what I've heard but I was reading that thing you were telling me about Jamie this whole like porn or child porn or pedophile Network you're setting what is this a pedophile YouTube what's going to a communication network they were communicating with each other in YouTube comments they responded yesterday and they said that they disabled comments on tens of millions of videos and deleted a lot of accounts that were they were communicating in the comment section of like a little kids cheerleading and whatnot now were they communicating to try to to share child porn or were they communicating to molest I don't know in the way pedophiles communicate in their network but I'd like you to do a little bit more due diligence and let's get moving we got a figure shit out yeah you gotta get a VPN are there that's like the FBI will take over child points out on tour and then run it for a year look on the dark wait what what is that what what's going on imagine what they see that's a problem it is a problem that you're causing to happen to that our Kelly case there's a video of him doing something with an underage girl and like I think some people at CNN's like we've seen it but it and that's led to him going in Psych well what did you watch and is that legal probably as legal because you're watching another the guise of joining out of it yeah ruff yeah that kind of shit is real and the fact that there's these networks of people that are trying to you know cultivate these experiences it's crazy mad but if you're a rich person you have that sick predilection you're gonna find a way to breathing at what they're doing like a for example okay they post remarks that praise the girls asked whether they were wearing underwear or simply carried a string of sexually suggestive emojis about two years ago hundreds of companies pulled money from YouTube over concerns about ads showing up next to problematic content from terror or hate groups and videos is seem to endanger exploit children I think you know we've talked about this before with YouTube with the issues that we've had with them they they have way too much content and way too few people there's no way they can watch all of it and one shit like this or people are doing things in the comments it's almost impossible to check yeah I mean it's just because their YouTube comments are one of the rare free-range sort of like unchecked message boards in the world I'll find out later don't read it bro who's this fat fuck don't he's not even a blackberry yeah why is he here who is that don't read it yeah yeah yeah umm I wonder if there's ever gonna be a time where that is impossible we're like these child pedophile rings yeah they can figure out a way to snuff all that out I'm harder now than ever before I'm imagine it's very tough and it's tough I think because so few people want to believe that it's a problem in the way that it is right because there's good people in the world that don't think these things are issues right so I think there's the political will isn't there because people don't aren't really they don't understand that it's you know and then the people that are doing these things are very wealthy powerful people and they have a lot of control and they can kind of cover their tracks if they're all wealthy poor pedophile you're not going to a ring what are you doing you snatching some kid oh I know it's bad but if you're rich pedophile it's a nicer experience it's like you go on vacation versus me going on vacation you go on vacation it's a nice experience I go on vacation you know it's fine sandals Obama's not even know she knows where you going the cabin or something the forest yeah what's crazy about all this when you're talking about like child molesters and stuff like that which crazy is the Catholic Church yeah he's still around and still they're catching people left and right when it's known for it there's no more no nothing's more synonymous with child molesting then the cancer that is the number one thing hey you were raised Catholic I was raised Catholic I was never molested I was raised Catholic got lucky huh I was lucky but my was fake I'm laughs cat we're all fit dis good Affleck is fake it's it's stuffed shells it's a nice dinner it's five fishes once a year it's but no one cares no one in the Catholic Church cares right if you turn around the guy next you go is this bullshit they'll go shut up a bit about it yeah I don't understand suicide bombers because I was raised Catholic right and no one is in the Catholic Church believes in it that much no we like nice buildings Catholic suicide bombers you go first yeah over here ready set go are you still here yeah it's our boss nice architecture it's beautiful it's great it's nice it's fun I don't know what's going on in them there's incense going around this is the mystery of faith oh good I was talking with BER about this recently about church has some good qualities and one of the things it has is it makes you feel like you know it's like a community thing you sit down and you get a chance to assess yourself in your life and sort of reaffirm your moral guidance and your moral compass and there's some there's some there's some positive things to a good church and that's how those rock and roll culty super Hollywood churches get started because people say I want a church I just don't want a traditional church I want something spiritual and funds and healing it's not like the church where I grew up I said to my dad why do we go here every Sunday anyone shut up that was the answer because it was like we just go you don't know what we do don't want your mom to get mad but people in Hollywood and people that they you know what the hipper they want to be drawn to it they want it to speak to them yeah they play rock and roll music that's cool yeah religions cool my soul is you know and it's you know it's just a lot of horseshit that's fine it makes him feel good yeah my buddy's a assistant a buddy of mine who's his assistant was going when I was Church she was a nymphomaniac yeah she's trying to stop fucking everybody so she start going what church is that the stop fucking about Church it's like just start fucking get spiritual she's like I'm gonna be celibate Mike yeah whatever yeah she was one of those gals you just have a couple of pops and then off to the races listen you live right yeah you live once she was obvious she was attractive she's having a good time yeah I don't see the problem what church did she go to us one of them Creek I don't know is this decades ago but it's one of them crazy rock and roll type churches that's so funny you know the Catholic I I think it's interesting people that join the Catholic religion now oh that's ridiculous who's joining it now yeah who's going in and going you know what I enjoy it I don't know who did it you know Glenn Beck join the Mormons as a grown man well that makes sense for T's that makes sense yeah he's a little off maybe one in nine wives yeah it's probably why it's of course it's a it's a huge benefit do you know the the whole Mitt Romney story yeah you don't know I don't know so I have to tell my cousin married a Mormon who they they excommunicated from the church when he was like 17 Mitt Romney's family all moved to Mexico that's why Mitt Romney's dad could never be president because Mitt Romney's dad was born in Mexico because when they passed the law making polygamy illegal in the United States they all packed up their shit and went to Mexico really yes because in the 1800s it didn't fucking matter if you were in Mexico or the United States it was all the same you're riding a horse who's that fuck they like that could have nine wives over here so they have these compounds vice did a whole series Wow they have compounds down there with farm workers yeah because the cartel was fucking kidnapping them and shit interesting so Mitt Romney's dad was like you can't take not yes fuck it look they still have a fucking they still have a compound down there this in the Smithsonian magazine photos on the Smithsonian calm Oh has a story on it yeah yeah brought the Romney's Mexican history yeah the whole family comes from Mexican amazing amazing that's amazing it's amazing they diverse I know they went down there because they couldn't do what they wanted to do in the United States there was no polygamy in the US anymore any no legal interest lishus hilarious yeah let happen because here's the thing you could have like nine girlfriends sure and all live together and no one could say shit but write it down lock you up and put you in jail there was a show called like sister wives or something it was about people that I think they were living in the states and then like multiple wives was it yeah it's probably bullshit okay I don't think polygamy google it maybe it's like legal in like Nebraska or some shit sorry Nebraska I like that the braska would be just a place to go you know what let live and let live and let live Rask is like we're having a hard time keeping people here so you just walk in like anyone you want marry your dog marry everything it's polygamy nationwide federally illegal yes it is illegal but I know what you're talking about where there are as TV shows or people are still doing it so mmm also have you successfully infiltrated a pedophile YouTube group yet lazy waiting for the three so lazy but it is crazy that his family is like well fuck it we'll just move to Mexico and so she made a great point it's the same thing you're on a horse back then mr. Rio Grande because I think when they made it illegal in the 1800s look at us as a polygamous community crumbles sister wives are forced from homes this is the caliber of wife this is interesting it's all you get bro if you want a nine of them you don't get nine good one you get one ten or nine ones this is a lot of you know this is you don't think of nine shitty wives no you don't think of nine horrible wives but the thing is you could have those wives you just can't have them legally like you they can't be legally your wife but you could do like a whole like roots and jump over the broom you know you could you could make your own ceremony of course you just can't register in the courthouse yeah which is hilarious to me yeah like who the fuck are you to tell someone they can't how about a woman that has five husbands can we do that yeah you go girl yeah power power for girl I'm for it I'm for polygamy me too I want to come out on this show five bucks and one woman yeah who cares I'll sit around stroking their half our dicks waiting their turn crying perfect that is a perfect representation of 2019 America who would vote that out yes they know sick people someone was a communist we need more people getting the YouTube pedophile cult out yes and putting the polygamists in yeah I need priorities I feel like if you want to marry a guy with eighteen of your friends who gives a shit yeah I guess the problem is the divorce yeah isn't that the ischial money for you sorry right I'm splitting up eighteen ways you're not gonna get a lot right anyone with 18 of anything unless you're like a sultan you probably don't have a ton anyway unless you're Jeff Bezos yeah Basel well that was a yeah he could he could marry a hundred chicks and give them all a billion that's how yes he'll have 50 left over what yeah he's doing good he's doing good but that whole thing with him that was an interesting thing the the pictures being leaked and it turns out the brother that leaked the pictures I love the brother immediately as soon as I read the article cuz I'm like this is Trump Tower not only do Trump supporter this is a guy who tried to leverage himself forever yeah and he found out his sister was fucking Jeff Bezos can you imagine the night he found that out the night he found that out where was he what was he doing he was somewhere thinking this is it yeah she's fucked a lot of people that are good now she's fucking paisa now some cash in now it's time to think of something good how do we do it this is a plotting guy yeah I wonder what The Enquirer gave him how much money you get for something like that half a mil Bezos dick Oh Lauren I want a solid mil solid mil you think the rest kind of wife he's gonna kill you you think he will if he doesn't I'll be disappointed it's a good point make it look like an accident if you're a fucking you know what he's he's like Daddy Warbucks yeah he's a guy he's the guy he's kind of he's automated automated everything and Amazon's morosely like he's an alien he looks like he's artificial intelligence he's AI yeah he has that look already he's super smart and yeah play it real slow yeah he'll enslave the world and you know what let him he's probably gonna hire somebody to fuck up that guy's life slowly I'm sure he already has yeah real slow oh yeah this is your new job yeah your new job is to slowly make that guy's law - yes everything everything flat tires every day yeah yeah yeah yeah I love the henchmen that's going at nearly flat tires yeah set up he's gonna check for cameras that's amazing yeah that made the bezos's those are the new type like because I studied a lot about like Rockefeller Carnegie guys like that yes and those guys nobody's amassed a fortune of those guys had Rockefeller had like 300 36 billion in today's dollars good lord yeah Carnegie had 372 Billy I mean these were the first how much do they have in their time positions in their time I don't know but in in it was millions well I don't think those billions but in our time it's about it's the over 300 million both of them these were the first generation of BB this was the first generation of Robert bat-like the first generation of entrepreneurs you know the country was new all these industries were just emerging and these guys took it over Bezos Tech is and somebody said this on my podcast recently Tech is the closest thing we have now to that yeah where you have these you know masters of the universe that are going to be I mean those guys were big a P Morgan was like bailing the government out yeah these guys had an insane amount of power they know three or four years to figure yeah I was just when I told you I was doing this era to the gods today with a bunch of very influential people and one of them said it's really ironic that Apple used to be think different right yeah that was the whole thing about Silicon Valley think different now it's don't think different right now its streamline everybody into one acceptable thing yeah now is literally you have to think the way everyone else is thinking we have to believe what everyone else believes even if it's ridiculous I think a lot of that is they want to just make money and sell things and they don't want any discord they just want to sell make money sort of but it's this is I don't think because they don't ban people after they do the things they banned them after there's a public outcry so to me they're not they don't have any real values their values are tangible and the values are influenced by public opinion and and where media is the values aren't like when somebody says something let's ban them right now this goes against our thing a lot of it is if you wait until there's enough dust kicked up then they will ban somebody right that's true so to me I get in arguments with friends when they're like their ideological I'm like they have an ideological bent certainly but they're profit-seeking enterprises that just want everyone to be happy I think it was up to Twitter every tweet would be some type of branded ad and on top of that now the ideology is skewing and leaning in that direction in terms of like tech and sure there's money in that there's money in holding that line and those guys are the ones that are as powerful as Rockefeller and Carnegie and JP it like all of those guys they are the next you know generation of people who will their amount of power is unmatched anywhere in society they're they're getting they're branching out more and more like Amazon is now gonna have an electric car they're investing in that new what's it called raiven riving in some new electric car company that's that uh Bezos is investing in they're investing in space travel they're investing and all these different I mean he's not gonna get poor no more and more rich no he's gonna take over everything I mean these look we haven't you can opt out you can opt out of these systems you have to be involved to live a normal life you have to be online do you see these about that now someone tried to use to go online live their life without Google Amazon good luck a few other things and Apple and they said they couldn't do it now Ari Shaffir is the only one who can do it with a flip phone he's barely doing it he's on to the iPad using his four high messages he iMessages me all the time yeah pretend ease but I think I give him that I'm impressed that he still has a flip phone well he he knows that he's an addict yeah you know he knows and yes he's an honest man right you know and he's like fuck this this is just too much of my life he's right he'd be jacked in social media constantly and and also if you were you know you're controversial like he is a lot of people are talking shit to him and that would hurt his feelings I'm saying mean things to him and social media has gotten to the point where I'm on it all day and I'm like I'm not having any fun no it's really gotten to the point where what is this experience Facebook is a nightmare it's elderly people screaming at each other this was a website where kids were trying to get laid in college this is elderly people screaming and complaining they can't afford any operations I'm just calling like this all day yeah it's it's not you don't get a lot of bang for your buck I've dropped off radically over the last six months the last six months have made a giant giant shift away from reading things and posting things and just I like look at it alike for a couple seconds and then I'll put it down okay healthy post yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm more engaged I'm too fucking busy you know and so when I'm trying to figure out ways to better optimize my time that was one of the first one stop reading comma and stop reading posts don't just it just mindlessly shift through Instagram pictures looking for something that strikes me as interesting I just stopped doing that and then it made a big difference in my productivity yeah huge difference yeah cuz you know when the when I phone real recently they started putting that thing on your phone we see how much screen time you had oh yeah that's crazy you look at you like what five hours I now it's 46 minutes just five hours of nothing yeah what did I do I get a little out of it right I'll go find news stories that I'll talk about but it's like finding I found that like finding the perfect blend seems to be letting the stories get so big that they get to you anyway right no right not the fringe Dory's do like the Jesse small age it gets so big you can't ignore about it yeah and then you hear and I love the day that the day when we all found that it was social media was great the day that we all found out he was full of shit yeah cuz they never could make jokes right but the three days before that everyone is posturing oh right but then when it came out that it was all bullshit it was like oh let's just have fun yeah and even though it's you know I'm not saying that people aren't getting attacked and things aren't bad but this particular thing right if you can't make a joke about this what can you make a joke about if you can't make it just about if you write someone shouldn't joke about this fuck you fuck you fuck you absolutely absolutely yeah yeah this is one of those things so he means fuckin shame holding the subway with the fucking news he pled not guilty in court no he did yes he did no Jamie he pled not guilty on everything right he denied all charges he denied all charges he's gonna take his own life I believe they have the check he wrote to them here on check their 500 a check now here's the other thing I could get punched in five minutes for free I could get beat up so easily why is this guy spending thirty five hundred dollars well not only that why do you write a check do you have no friends they just he didn't think this through even a little bit yeah god dammit it's disappointing it's kind of funny though it's there's nothing funnier right now well I think this is what we need you know we need to understand the outrage machine a little bit better yeah and one of the best ways to see to see manufactured outrage absolutely there you go okay this is a hustle well the Covington thing was great because people like wishing death on fifteen-year-old kids it's like the video comes out exonerates and then people are like no yeah people were doubling down yeah people like you can't deny with my eyes so I'm like are you nuts and then I was afraid because I'm like tweeting things at support of the kids but I'm like what if the next video is just the kids in Klan outfits like this and just dancing around with with torches like Charlotte's film and I'm like well then now I look like an idiot yeah you can't you don't know what to tell them you're better off being an observer yeah just let people get into the fray you just may little joke yes it back yeah it's like a gang fight you better up stand stand back and go home I want to jump in this every every day every hour another vantage point of that thing was like well no maybe they are guilty yeah you know I saw that thing it was like a why kid I thought they encircle the Native American guy who was banging a drum and I'm like fuck these kids exactly that's not good well you see the first image and you know the first image which is even crazier was put up by a troll account riot Russians I don't know all the problems Russia I think that came out of Brazil oh yeah yes a few shady social media posts fed a viral firestorm over Covington Catholic ocean why yeah these cut they're doing this on purpose they took that screenshot to try to get people angry and it worked and then they Twitter found out that it was a bullshit account they ban the account so it's very possible that account was some troll phone oh no it's a troll farm Wow yeah so that's what makes it work we're being manipulated now on a level that it's like unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable fours dude I hate to cut this short I gotta get the fuck out of here let's do it tell everybody how to get ahold of you Dylan on Instagram and Twitter di llo and Timothy Tim Dylan comedy calm we're doing a gig right we're doing a gig tomorrow that's right tomorrow probably The Improv 50 if she attacks me on the way what see he's gonna show up with a noose of the subways I hope I get in blackface Tim Dylan ladies and gentlemen [Music]
