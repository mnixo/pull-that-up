- one boom hello Abby hello Joe what's going on nothing much I saw you chillin with Oliver Stone the other day yeah it's pretty cool he's an interesting guy very interesting guy yeah he likes to support radical politics so he came out for the screening of the new film that we did yeah he's a very unusual character in that regard right cuz he's like this blockbuster movie maker guy but he's also a pretty radical guy in the way in his politics and when he supports and yeah he's kind of like the black sheep of Hollywood for a while you know doing all the radical kind of the radical outlier of Hollywood basically yeah but the do you saw the JFK movie right yeah that was a weird one right it's like I kind of like it but I've kind of like hey man that fucking general wasn't even a real person like you made up a real person like you put him in there okay I didn't exist like yeah good very very good but I get it that he kind of needed to move it along for 90 minute or two hour movie whatever II was I get it it kind of needed like this little character to like be dishing out the inside scoop that Donald Sutherland character yeah but in real life there was no guy I didn't know that yeah god damn it Oliver if you knew would you tricked again would you like hey motherfucker what you do why'd you add that guy because it's weird because like people talk about that they said hey you know in the Oliver Stone movie they detailed all these things that happen like yeah but they also added a guy like wasn't a real guy well I guess at the end of the day it's a fictional oh is it if it's a real president who was shot by someone and you're trying to explain who and your your movie and you have all these real characters but then you got this one guy who just kind of shoved in there mm-hmm yeah they felt the the professor what what was what did he call himself in the movie again remember I'm 19 years yeah because if I remember correctly it was him kind of just filling in the gaps and kind of tying the narrative together I believe so yeah yeah they used him as a tool right the right movie - yes yeah there's no another way to do that and the makeup a dude brilliant ass movie though right very good movie I don't know what do you think happened the Oliver Stone right off the bat okay I don't know I mean I think you have yes if I give you a hundred bucks you said all right Abbi come on put bet on red or bet on black did you think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or do you think that there was some sort of conspiracy involving various nefarious groups I think Oliver Stone's movie is closer to the truth than obviously what the official narrative is I think that if you look at all those high-profile assassinations in that era I think a lot of them are highly questionable I mean it doesn't just stop at JFK we're talking about RFK I shall leave that story at all Martin Luther King you know I mean Oliver sure there's really really sketchy things about all of them and if we were conducting the CI was conducting basically an assassination program around the world mm-hmm to expedite u.s. foreign policy and imperialism why would we not have been doing that here at home mm-hm you know I mean we know that Fred Hampton was killed outright that the leader of the Black Panther Party so all of these things are kind of make more sense when you look back at history and see how kind of out of control the CIA was at that time yeah I mean it only makes sense that they would want to get rid of certain characters that were causing trouble right you know I had Mike Baker on from who used to work he was a CIA operative and he looked into the JFK or excuse me the Martin Luther King assassination and he said that one more than any other one that he looked into seemed like something was really because James Earl Ray was like a loser or two like the shifty guy and then before the assassination all of a sudden he had money all of a sudden he like he was he it looked like he was being steered and he went into great detail about I don't remember all the details but he was shaking his head about he's like that one out of anyone that I looked into had the fingerprints of manipulation on it well you know about his family obviously Martin Luther King his family that had that civil trial and basically concluded that the US government had to have been involved for the circumstances to have happened the way they did and if you look at how Martin Luther King at the time was considered the most day Juris quote-unquote Negro in the country that's what the government was saying about him I mean he was hated he was loaded he was trying to basically implement like a poor people's campaign to occupy DC hmm to give poor people economic rights that was a that was really really threatening I think to the establishment at that time also you know it's hard for us when we're thinking back about that era I mean we weren't really I mean I was I was born in 67 you were born laughter that it wasn't we don't understand that era that's a hundred years after slavery just a hundred the person's like persons like that yeah kind of crazy right you know and things still hadn't been resolved and then when you look at it now I mean Juneteenth they had the congressional hearings they're talking about reparations and you see just the the the different polarized sides of how people look at it even today whether or not reparations should be given or whether or not there should be any any sort of effort to rectify the obvious if you look at the the economic strife that's in these southern cities that are primarily African American that are really from slavery I mean this is literally the remnants of slavery and it's never been fixed it's almost like any other problem that would be in our infrastructure any other problem that would be in you know anything with you know pollution or anything else that people clearly did where someone did and fucked it up there's efforts made to fix it and discussions about but this is so much resistance right tenaha see Coates I think his name is he was testifying there and he was saying that you know the argument is we had nothing to do with this because again it was more than a person ago why should we have anything to do with what slavery did and it's beyond that though as you're mentoring I mean this was an institutionalized racism that we still see the effects of very sharply within the prison community within I mean all these things and he said we were still paying out Civil War soldiers families pensions decades after that so like why why do that but not actually try to you provide some economic justice to the black community it's a weird conversation because it's not just a conversation about whether or not something wrong was done but it's also a racial conversation like I've seen some weird posts like you know Chuck Woolery the guy who's from the love connection will write back in two and two that guy has turned into this like serious hardcore right-wing pundit and I think it was him that was tweeting about reparations for Union soldiers for their families that died so he was fighting in the Civil War like it was like how about these people and then like not saying how about the fucking people who's like brought over here from Africa Shayne's and their great-grandchildren are alive today in the same communities what was the basis of our capitalist society I mean that's why were the richest country in the world because it was predicated on in you know the enslavement of Africans yeah I don't know if you can fix it by giving people money today but I do think the money should be spent to try to fix those communities and I think that can be engineered and done and I don't hear anybody talking about it other than Tulsi Gabbard talks about it and I think Bernie Sanders in May has made some indications that something should be done although I don't know if anybody has like a real definitive plan but when you talk to people that have like Michael Wood who was a Baltimore police officer there I've told the story before but it's a crazy story he when he was a cop in Baltimore they found these papers that showed that the exact it was papers from the 1970s the exact same crimes in the exact same areas and the exact same problem areas they were dealing with in the 70s they were dealing with the 2000s and he was like what the fuck like Wow imagine that feeling like here you are your police officer right you're putting your life on the line literally and you're out there dealing with the same problems that existed in the same exact areas and no one's ever done anything to fix it we're just arresting people yeah yeah I mean Tulsa and Bernie are the only candidates were giving a shit about I thought dude that fucking townhall sunk this is how many candidates are there now I feel like two other ones just jumped in the race now we have like 20 I don't fucking know their names he's too close to beta it's too close does look like he would be called that but his dad actually just openly said in an interview he's like yeah I called him bado cuz I wanted him to get the Mexican vote because I knew he would eventually run for office what his real names like Robert Oh Robert oh Christ that sounds like people I mean these people are like a hundred shades of Hillary I mean every single one of them other than Tulsi and Bernie just seem like they're just like Hillary Clinton light well they've also done this weird thing where they're like no straight white men like okay like there's like straight white men we're not voting for straight white men look that's just as bad as saying you're never voting for a woman it's just as bad as saying you're never voting for a black person you mean I get it there's been a lot of straight white man they've been president I get it right you're right but to say no straight like to disqualify someone based on something they have no control over whatsoever is a form of discrimination I know you don't think it's a form of discrimination because so many of these people have already had that job I get it it seems unfair you're right but you can't say that because that's a shitty way of thinking it's it's piss-poor logic and thinking it's discriminatory identity politics yes it reigned supreme and I saw there was like a combatting supporters from Kamala Harris and Bernie at some rally or something and they just kept shouting we need a woman president it's like that that's like the only reason why you like Kamala Harris you know I mean Kamala Harris I've saw this one speech that she was giving when she was talking about forcing children to attend school by holding their parents accountable where she instituted a policy where if the kids miss school the parents could be arrested do you know about that now it was soup that is their brain it was super disturbing and she was talking about how effective it was and that you know they had cops show up at the door of the woman's house who was a single mom who had these children the kids weren't going to school like hey no she was a cop I mean it's a top cop exactly but that authoritative authoritarian nonsense like that way of thinking you know why you do that cuz no one's ever done that to you right something even knocked on your fuckin door and said hey we're gonna lock you up in jail because your 16 year old boy when you have three kids right and if you're a single mom anyone who's a single mom who has a boy knows and that fucking boy hits puberty if they run with the wrong crowd good fucking luck trying to control them good luck it hard yeah real hard and if she's got a job or two jobs maybe cuz she's trying to put food on the table and keep the fucking lights on and you're gonna arrest her cuz her kid doesn't show up at school holy shit can you imagine looking at all the problems in our country and being like you know what we need to arrest parents if their kids are truant yeah it's it's insane I mean make sure I'm 99% sure correct about they're talking about her like regret about this policy and you wonder why she's running for fucking president you should regret something want to hear another insane policy going back to Robert or roar it is the human cost of c'mon I got more on truancy the progressive prosecutor wanted to transform how California responded the students missing school parents like I'm her surname Cherie Cherie people's wound up paying the price so she this lady I read that I remember reading this one up going to jail yeah so yeah and there was a good reason her kid was sick or something she so beto no let's not call him Beto anymore his name is Robert Robert yeah um Robert actually has a really great idea Joe he wants to tax non military families to pay for veteran's health care would pay for veterans yeah is that nice so punish the people who don't want to join the military what very smart Robert watch the fucking people who make the weapons wants the politician tax the defense contractor find out what the military industrial complex is really made of find out how much money really making and saying hey look at you guys you made X amount of billions of dollars and look at all these guys that you know we have to fund we have to rely on charities and we have to rely on things like the Wounded Warrior Project and all these foundations that are taking care of these veterans when you're the ones are profiting and yeah I mean that that's where the money should come from mm-hmm yeah I guess more and since these are fucking insanely rich organizations the other stocks have like tripled in the last four years they're they're doing real well when we had that situation where Dick Cheney who was the CEO of Halliburton was giving Halliburton no-bid contracts to go over and fix places that we bombed that's like what yeah that that is like a doctor breaking people's legs so he can fix them it's so crazy and then drive around at Porsche and it's fucking crazy yeah well Trump was sitting down at some table with all the head defense contractors a couple months ago and it was after the Khashoggi you know dismemberment in the embassy and he was openly talking about how we cannot stop that hundred and ten billion dollar weapons deal and and you should see just the Glee on these people's faces I mean it was just it's just unbelievable how transparent it is standard Trump that was a weird conversation world who was he being interviewed by Oh Steve Steve Hilton my friend I know Steve Hilton yeah oh my god forever we're actually family friends our families have gone on vacations together and shit it's a good guy is that the Fox News in error no no it's Paris bad Oh No he's British but he was interviewing Trump and they were talking about the militant Trump was openly discussing how these people want to go to war the military industrial complex wants to go to war I mean Trump saying that you know he didn't want everything to do with this but that they want to go to war and it's like I get it Trump is a weird guy cuz he's such a loose cannon that he says shit like that that you don't know that Obama would keep his cards you know Obama would hide his cards but Trump hate him or love him he it gives you glimpses that you're not gonna get as far as like what kind of influence does the military and US complex really have on policy change in decision-making and whether or not they take action and he was openly discussing it he removes the mask you know yeah it's it's interesting because he I think that he's talking out of both sides of his mouth because on one hand he says that kind of stuff but then on the other hand I mean he hired all the most rabid war generals no in his cabinet and also just John Bolton I mean come on this is like I'm the Michael neoconservative who's must have trained for war with Iran since the day he was born so it's like if you don't want war with Iran I mean he campaigned on it so we know that he hates Iran he campaigned on abolishing the nuclear deal with Iran but he picks john bolton to lead all of these efforts i mean it's like it's like starting a fire and then getting applauded and congratulated when you stopped the fire at the last minute before it erupts and takes over the whole planet and that's what would happen if we actually did bomb iran i think that people don't understand how precarious the situation is that trump and these cronies have laid out not just is but came so close to being a reality just a week ago you mean you don't think we should go to war after for bombing oil tankers and saudi oil tankers you don't think we should go to war overnight shooting down a robot yeah that's it I would die for Saudi oil tankers I'd be the first one I put my body on the line there was a lot of people that were saying this seems like the Gulf of Tonkin to like I don't I'm not buying this at all there were so many people that were like really kind of credible people who were openly saying this stinks like it just seems staged it's it seems like some some bit like why would they do that total false flag shit going on over and over and over again they're just trying so hard because they want to provoke Iran to the point where Iran will be forced to respond and this is after suffocating X fixating sanctions that have that are causing people's lives I mean what is it what for the folks on that arm haven't been paying attention to this what is it that makes them want to go to war with Iran so we have to just look at what Iran is I mean Iran just won its independence less than a hundred years ago in a you know an era of and a wave of anti colonial struggles and we immediately the mi6 as well as the CIA CIA instigated a coup so we always talk about how we want Iran to have democracy they had democracy they had a revolution a People's Revolution that was overthrown we overthrew Mohammad Mossadegh and instated a absolute monarchy for decades and at the time it had the highest human rights abuses documented in the world it was pretty unique in that sense and you know you can only imagine why Iran is the way it is today and there was such a suppression of the left and of the Communist Party in Iran that the Islamic Revolutionary Revolution happened and the Ayatollah was the leader of that political movement and that's why Iran has the political system it has today but it's about the oil man it's always about the oil and it's always about the foreign domination of the region they hate that Iran is an independent country and doesn't bow down to us and parallelism in the u.s. capitalism and Iran also is allies with a lot of states that Israel in the US and Saudi Arabia do not want it to be allies with you know Hezbollah Hamas and so that's that's a big problem for the US and it's getting in the way of a lot of kind of goals in the region but it's really fascinating when you look at what actually happened because you know the nuclear deal was amazing it was huge I mean Trump keeps belaboring the fact that Iran should not have nuclear weapons they didn't have nuclear weapons they never did and they were agreeing to never have them that was the whole Iran nuclear deal but Trump just immediately rescinded that slaped insane sanctions on Iran and now you know sanctions every month just continuing to constrict their economy and even basically sanctions on threatening sanctions on China and India and other countries that actually do deals with Iran now - which is totally insane so once you do that and then you say well you know you're hitting yourself you're hitting yourself why are you doing this it's like no you're doing this too then and on top of that john bolton keeps saying you know there's all these unique threats coming from iran we need to surround them with all these warships and they keep sending thousands of more troops thousands more troops so you're getting to a position now and now the drone right we're flying a drone into iranian airspace and expecting that they're not gonna shoot that down why the fuck are we flying a drone and iran the fuck would we do if you fluid drowning here right I mean it's just unbelievable the chauvinism and arrogance of the u.s. to be doing all this shit and then be like okay now you guys are a belligerent threat we have to do something it's like no you guys are the ones encircling them and in closing all of their you know basically just encapsulating their entire territory and threatening them over and over and over again basically hoping for something to happen and if you look back at the Gulf of Tonkin there was a guy who was actually on the USS Maddox the ship that was eventually attacked there and got us into the war with Vietnam and he even said my dad was on the ship and he said we didn't had no idea why we were there and one of the generals or captains on the ship just said they want us to be hit they want us to be attacks that they can get into a war that they want to get into and that's exactly what's going on and what's sad is whoever's in the Navy circling Iran they're gonna be the ones who fuckin die when Iran does launch back they're sacrificing themselves for these generals and defense contractors profits now there's some reason to believe that Iran is not being honest about its nuclear program right I mean that was one of the reasons why wasn't that what was the virus that the United States Stuxnet yeah Stuxnet virus that they put on the Iranian nuclear program to kill it while they were in the middle of doing whatever they do to uranium right the centrifuges for the enriching uranium I mean yeah that that was that was also crazy cyber attacks right right but the cyber attacks weren't they effective though in stopping the nuclear program there was like a secret nuclear program that they were doing I don't know what exactly they I don't think that there ever was a nuclear program but I know that that was another crazy thing that the u.s. did was basically in fact their thing and destroy all of this technology but I mean basically all we need to know is that they agreed to not develop nukes and it was all agreed from the international community and then Trump gets in there and just unravels it all and it's so dangerous because Iran would make you rock look like child's play yeah it's not a joke and I mean it's literally so precarious at this point that anything can happen and here upped into a full-blown war and then when Trump says oh I pulled back the air strike because I wanted to save 150 lives no dude you're starting fires all over the world and then you get applauded and you want to congratulate yourself because somehow he's still kind of appealing to this like non-interventionist line which is just fake to me because you don't appoint the most rabid war hungry people to surround you and to carry out these policies if you don't want that to a certain extent also created this really weird ideological rift where people were complaining that he didn't do anything mm-hmm people were upset that he was going to take action he didn't they were receiving about third round yeah well that he will about the drone and about the attacking of the oil tankers and that he was ready to launch then he didn't and what wasn't one of the Fox guys it was talking about the consequences of taking no actions like Brian Kilmeade or one of those guys media is insane but he has been attacking him and the Democrats too and the media and the Democrats always attack this administration from the right whenever there's some sort of military involvement they always want him to bomb and go to war it's pretty shocking I mean I guess not too shocking when you realize the corporate media is literally subsidized by like oil companies and banks and defense contractors no I know you didn't spray Z you didn't have to deal with that at RT but what do you think happens when someone is a pundit and they're on a television show and they're talking about something that has these global implications do you think they get talking points do you think they're allowed to express their own personal opinions or are they informed that they're supposed to toe a certain line like I think there's varying levels I think that it would be naive to say okay these people are paid to lie I think that the masked majority of people working in corporate media are lackeys for the Empire they really truly believe that you know they believe that America is the greatest country in the world they believe that were the world's policemen they actually believe that these countries are evil and they need to be taken out to in-state kind of global hegemony I've truly believed that they cater to the line of American exceptionalism and that's pretty sad but also pretty dangerous because they're the perfect mouthpieces for u.s. foreign policy I mean they essentially are stenographers for whatever the government is laying out which is really disturbing because the premise of journalism is to actually challenge power and challenge the US government especially when you are working in America you're an American citizen and there's all this destruction going on from on behalf of your government and you're not challenging that especially when it's war claims especially when you have assholes like John Bolton claiming you know all these things are happening in these channels and and bodies of water and people are just like okay I mean god damn you should see when fucking Mike Pompeo was talking about how Hezbollah was in Venezuela and these people would just just printed it they're like well hezbollah is in venezuela now it's like what are you talking about you're literally just printing what the Trump administration is saying without even questioning these claims mmm it's disturbing do you think that the people that are talking about it on TV are just saying it because they really don't understand what they're talking about and this just seems to be a way to cover the subject in sort of a way that is acceptable to the network and acceptable to the party and acceptable to this sort of idea whether it's left or right with it whatever ideology they're they're participating in yes and that there there is definitely that as well where they know kind of the line that they can't cross so even if you individually believe you know you think that climate change is an existential threat you think that the warned Yemen is a serious thing that you should address I think that you definitely get kind of knocked down in the editorial meeting you know before and you're just like okay no I can't do that but what I can do is just you know talk about whatever that's it's so weird the advertisers will agree with in this day and age there's not like a really respected independent source of news right that you've got you some the online stuff which is my do some online stuff is very good but some online stuff is so entangled with insults and and and bullshit and emotions and distorted perceptions and ego that it's like it sort of discredits whatever they're trying to promote whatever whatever ideas are trying to get across there's no Walter Cronkite there's no there's no one person who or no one organization who you emphatically trust with their perspective on the news everything is either left or right everything is like flavored by an ideology right sorry I don't place that I go to that I know I can get clear unbiased emotion free objective analysis of any international issue right it doesn't exist I don't mean unless you can tell me of one do you what do you get I mean I go to real news I go to Democracy Now and the only mine is now super left-wing right left-wing leaning but you think love leaning I mean I go to places that are not this is the problem like with capitalism and trying to have an independent media is that you need funding and you need funding from like donors and grassroots sources because once you get funded by these right-wing billionaires and corporations and states and governments then it becomes very ideologically driven and then you're kind of just catering toward what those interests want you to present and I that's why the Empire files does what it does it's we're basically based on donations now because Trump sanctions on Venezuela shut down the show a year ago so we did a big donation drive and that's an open atrium patreon we're on go fund me and just PayPal but we're just trying to survive on a very minimal budget because I don't want to take you know I don't want to like Lobby to corporations or States or or go that route because I don't want to I don't want to answer to anyone other than myself but then you just come with a whole host of problems you're not getting your message out there I mean that's why it's incredible for you to have me on but that's why the fake news mantra resonated so much with the Trump campaign because people are extremely disillusioned with the corporate media you know New York Times Washington Post these so-called Beltway publications that pretend to be like the arbitrator's of a are objective reality they they are the premier advocates of fake news when it comes to US foreign policy you know American exceptionalism and corporations and like the corporate line they're always the ones towing the things that basically the system and so I think people you know became really really just attracted to that whole fake news mantra that Trump was saying because people have an extreme distrust in the corporate media because of the Iraq war because of all these things that have happened but as you know and as you've talked about extensively Joe this wave of censorship that has happened in the last two years since Trump got elected because of Russian propaganda and fake news hysteria yeah and it just propped up these same institutions and it's really just gone after a lot of alternative and independent media that have gone by the wayside yeah and you know people who have been propped up by right-wing billionaires and billionaires in general are not going to be affected at the end of the day but all the people who've been caught up in this censorship with the algorithms with the deep platforming it's really scary it's really really scary what happened it is scary to me because the Internet in my eyes is this unique place where people can get information and distribute information and then on top of that you have this almost parasitic entity that is allowing you to distribute information and gather information through it but also controlling the flow of information and then controlling the flow in its own ideological Bend like what sort of match its own ideas of what should and shouldn't happen I think they feel justified by having a guy like Trump in office having a guy like Trump come into office then go we have to do something about that so what we're gonna do is we're gonna silence conservative voices we're gonna silence conservative pundits we're gonna silence what we call people all right and just change our algorithms to make it much more difficult for them to get propagated for them to propagate their ideas I just find that really distressing because I think that in the marketplace of ideas you you're supposed to be able to combat a bad idea with a better idea and this is how we this is how ideas evolved this is how people get to communicate you get to look at what someone saying look at someone how someone's dissecting what someone's saying and then for yourself figure out what you believe and what you don't believe and there should be a free exchange of information so that you can figure that out and when you show when someone's shown to be a bad actor or a liar or show have deceptive news fake news whatever you want to call it though okay now we know and this is a clear example of that so now take it with a grain of salt whenever they say anything about anything else but when you deep platform them and shove them aside they say see they're trying to silence us because they don't believe us or they they don't they don't want us to be in power because they're trying to prop up whatever left-wing socialist economy that their dictator that they want to put into place and it's this weird sort of situation where you've got people dictating and almost engineering our culture right curating our reality you know what's going on in Toronto well with alphabet the parent company of Google no it's a very disturbing thing to a lot of people where they're essentially setting up blocks and they're putting cameras in these places and they're gathering data and information and they're trying to engineer a utopian city yeah I was reading about it yesterday and I was like no like this is a terrible idea like wooden terrifying what if these people don't want to be filmed what if these people don't want information gathered about them like they're doing it under the guise of here it is alphabets plan for Toronto depends on huge amounts of data yeah we need more data collection data mining their idea is that they're going to make it easier for people to get around and smoother but how facial-recognition I love how they always say oh people are being sex trafficked and this will help it's like no dude this is like point zero zero zero one percent of all the people that you're you know data mining says sidewalk slabs release more detailed plans for Toronto the site of Google's sister company's first attempt to bring its teka fide digital forward sensibility to a full-scale development project the sidewalk slab sidewalk labs projects dates to 2017 when the Canadian city welcomed the company to an undeveloped section of its waterfront after 18 months of speculation work no I am these motherfuckers especially he work in backlash from local advocates the company has a 1500 24 page master plan for the 12 12 acre lot called quayside first why he what is quasi four-volume plan highlights ambitious and sometimes flashy innovations from sidewalk labs which has played pledged to spend 1.3 billion on the project if it goes forward the company hopes to construct all the buildings with timber which it says is better for the environment it also catches fire and build an underground pneumatic pneumatic tube system for garbage removal it wants residents to lean on public transit walking and biking rather than personal vehicles good luck it's fucking zero degrees in Toronto you assholes and plans to build streets with autonomous vehicles perhaps from a sister company way mo listen Wayne every robots would you know what way mo is no no underneath delivery robots might trundle down it's wide sidewalks it should strategic use of large very large umbrella like coverings might make outdoor spaces comfortable all year round no small feat in lakeshore canada sidewalks sidewalk wants to designate 20% of its of the apartments to as affordable and another 20% as middle-income so there there engineering there yeah City yeah right this is by people who are really just openly social justice warriors I mean these are the people that censored that James d'amour guy and fired him for having this memo well that really kind of disgust women intact based on evolutionary biology based on studies and they said that he was highlighting harmful gender stereotypes which it's not true it's not accurate if you look at what he actually said when he actually wrote even at a page and a half dedicated in that memo trying to come up with strategic ways to encourage women to get into technology the study that or the the paper that James did more rope has no relation to the way he's been framed in the way people talk about him this is a direct result of Google and grails social justice warrior sort of ethos like the way they operate as a company well Google pretends to be you know don't be evil this is this seems algorithmic Shay but they don't be evil it took that why the fuck would you ever take that they're like okay we're evil now but this this just seems like it they like plugged in some shit and algorithm and they're like alright this is our city now like we're they're creating sins oh I mean Google I agree with David pac-man is kind of depiction on Google I think that they're a giant corporation they have billions offshore and tax havens and they are not liberal they appear to be liberal because that's capitalism you're trying to basically adapt to where society is at and you want to pretend like you are socially conscious but when you look at their actual policies they're conservative as fuck I mean they actually fund a lot of crazy like coke brother Alec they fund a lot of right-wing organizations the Federalist Society they've given huge grants to so I think that they're kind of playing both sides deregulation to lobby for kind of the deregulation of their industry so I think that all of the perception and the mantra of Google and YouTube and you know catering to like the social consciousness and and you know what you're talking about I think is honestly just to make more money so I'm sure they're gonna make more money in the process of doing this but the idea that they're gonna engineer a city to me is terrifying that's insane I just don't I don't like it you know there was a great podcast that Sam Harris did with the guy who was explaining what Google is essentially done and what they've done with data the data is essentially a commodity that we didn't know was a commodity and we all gave up our rights to this commodity and this commodity turns out is worth billions and billions of dollars and no one had any idea and they just took it and now they have it and they have it hmm and what are they giving you this right they let you search things like what am i giving you for this so let you use their email like it's it's kind of crazy they search your email for certain keywords and all sudden you know you looking for a patio chair you know like I'm gonna buy a patio chair and also in your fucking Google matches are filled with patio chairs cuz you sent an email really really creepy or just talk about something and it just yeah yep yeah my guest yesterday my friend Wil Harris he was talking about trading in his car and he got a fucking text message a text message that said hey I hear you're looking to trade in your car so you know here here's a here's a link as to what you could get for it he goes I'm not clicking that fucking link like a text message with a link showed up on his phone because of something he was talking about he wasn't even talking on the phone that's crazy really really scary it's fucking insane yeah no that's terrifying how that happens right like if you and I were talking right now and you said I need a new laptop and you started getting laptop ads in your Google feed what is happening is your phone listening to you say that yeah yep was that like a no I mean it combs through everything I mean that's what's so fucking scary and that Apple is the best at it in terms of like not giving up your data it's one of the reasons why I still use an iPhone and support Apple Apple goes out of their way to not share your data when you use Maps that's why Apple maps suck it's one of the reasons why it's not good it was a fucking great article that was written about it uh they called Apple Maps the Bing of of navigation tools it's like you know Bing that the search engine who the fuck uses that all right I use a Windows laptop being the fuck out here with yeah yeah Google's better right so you just go automatically use it but Google is just come on Google's fucking up no and all the going back to this whole like tech censorship thing they preemptively changed the algorithm that's what's so scary to me is that there wasn't even a law you know like China we are we all know that China censors the Internet we've done the same thing here but people just think that we still have you know readeth information that we can all access all these things no I mean Google YouTube I mean because YouTube is owned by Google now but they preemptively change the algorithms they back paged all of this progressive media independent media so it wasn't just about what they're saying it's about I mean this this was targeted to basically all extreme views everything that they felt like was too radical I mean going back to the DNI report which is where this all started from this kind of conclusive report that they said these 17 intelligence agencies you know here's here's all the evidence of how Russia colluded and cost the election for Hillary they cited my show on breaking on breaking the set do you did it yeah they said I was part of the conspiracy of Russian meddling did you Russian man I'm sorry take that as a snippet but in in the in the report it said she fomented radical discontent and when you look at what all this is sowing discord all of these you know the black box algorithm from Hamilton 68 dashboard like this US government funded Twitter crawler that just like determines what's Russian propaganda what's fake news and then you have you know Facebook working with the Atlantic Council which is an organization stacked with literal spooks cops CIA heads and defense contractors UAE US government that's who's like curating our reality now and it's all about expunging the most radical views on the Internet to prop up essentially the system in the establishment and and that's why I know it's not a liberal or conservative thing it's literally just extremist thought and radical thought that challenges the the status quo because sowing discord just means disagreement that's what they said this was about these websites so discord Joan I mean that's I thought that was a fundamental thing about American democracy is that you talk about what we disagree on and when you look at what the report says of what breaking the set covered DMT I mean if that wasn't in the report you were on there talking about DMT but I talked about aliens but because I talked about things like inequality and an Occupy Wall Street in Hillary Clinton that was all part of this grand conspiracy to sow discord on behalf of the Russian government so it becomes very comical once you you know kind of poke at the underlying narrative driving this way but are you aware of renamed to rest his work did you ever pay attention no she was on my podcast and she detailed what the IRA did the internet research right in Russia and it was really fascinating they had set up like a fake black lives matter account and and then they would talk about how as black Americans we can't vote for Hillary Clinton because of this and they started they develop these communities these write really large online pages whether it was on Facebook or Instagram or whatever it was where they spoke as like a southern separatist or as a Muslim yummy that dozens of them and they developed these communities and they developed these communities and they would set up these organizations and then they would have events where they had one where they had a Texas secession event directly across the street from a Muslim pride event and they did it on purpose so that they would fight they put him across the street from each other they organized these Facebook pages in these events and these people show up these people that are Texas is said we should leave the Union you know we can Texas is a republic and then they have these other people on line they want like Muslim rights and they want the Sharia law and they put them right next to each other yeah they're there they're literally engineering argument and their engineering fighting and the idea was that someone wanted this to this idea of promoting discord right they wanted arguments they wanted to fuck with our democracy and then they could shift it just a little bit by doing this by having these arguments by pretending that they're there for lbgtq rights but they're really not but they're really just some Russians are just you know talking shit and that this is what we need to do we need to radicalize they had an T for groups and all right I mean Israel and Saudi Arabia do the same thing except right now it's fascinating that we just focusing on Russia when my god this is happening on every front I mean look at going back to Pete Buddha jej you say his name but he has like hundreds of sock puppet accounts that are all like propping each other up on there oh my god I just saw it's like blacks for Pete Buddha judge gays for Buddha it's like all these he's his I mean I guess he thought that that was I don't know injected with corporate money that he's just like all right make a hundred sock puppet accounts it's like everyone does this shit but when we focus in on just Russia and then of course you have the removal of you know Syrian accounts you have the removal of Pro Maduro accounts on Twitter why is it only that we're talking about our so-called enemies that these are the people who are sowing discord in fomenting radical discontent what about all the other countries that you know we do it all over the world what about all the other countries that are doing the same thing so if he really does have these sockpuppet accounts that are doing this that are pretending that these are just fans you know that's that's some sleazy shit yeah it's these guys that I mean that's as sleazy as it gets in my opinion that's a dirty shit you're pretending you're a person who's just an independent person who's supporting you and really just is an employee who's their first stop again right since and especially like the identity politics thing like all of the different groups you know marginalized groups support you yeah it's all fake well the crazy no sir you saw that Town Hall after the shooting economist guy and there everyone saying how the fuck are you gonna run for president can't even run it City right yeah does he have a job this I'm confused you don't like have jobs right you're running for president giant who's who's running the city what's going on yeah imagine right if I just said hey during this I can do this podcast anymore I'm gonna go get a Brian Cowen he's gonna be media now on experiencing I think what people like Bill DeBlasio it's like you have a fucking City to run yeah why are you running for president how can you the fucking Metro is falling apart there's time do you spend actually being married as shit yeah money back dude they just want the book deals they want to go on the view they want have a reason to be relevant for you it's disgusting it's pretty gross it should be illegal Meghan McCain it really should be if you can really shit you should quit your fucking job whatever you have and dedicate 100% of your time to doing that yeah if you think that you could have that but first of all everyone knows what a grueling thing it is to run for president it is a fucking time consuming right massive commitment to your energy yeah how can you do that and also be the mayor of South Bend yeah yeah you just have to be on the phone begging for donations when you're not you know jumping on tables like Robert O'Rourke is all over the country it's a lot of work yeah there's no way you run in that City right and I'm fucking crazy of these people's egos I mean they say that Trump is this existential threat that he's the next Hitler he's mentally incapacitated yet they all jump in the race because they think they're the smartest people in the world so it's like Blasio it's like really yeah they're pulling so low drop out dude this is all to try to prevent Bernie from winning does it really is who makes sense to use Bernie makes sense Bernie is my guy Bernie's my guy through and through and I'll tell you why because a we need Medicare for all we need to abolish student debt and that shit you just tax Wall Street gambling done Medicare for all cut the military budget done I don't want to live in a country where people are rationing insulin I don't want to live in a country where half of the GoFundMe campaigns are because people are gonna die if they don't get donations for health care what is wrong with this country but back to Bernie I mean you look at the last 30 years of political advocacy this is a guy who's been saying the same thing for 30 straight years no matter if it's veterans rights about Gulf War Syndrome about just a political revolution as needed I mean he's been talking about that since he won the Senate seat initially and you can't really say the same thing about any other candidate and I do like what tulsi gabbard is saying and I do like some of the things Elizabeth Warren's saying but it seems like she's just making it up on the fly and adopting kind of Bernie light policies and I think this is all a strategy to siphon all the delegates away from Bernie because we already know this Third Way corporate Wall Street funded organization that's like corporate Democrats have said they want anyone but Bernie Bernie is the biggest threat to the establishment by far did you see when Charlemagne called Elizabeth Warren the original Rachel Dolezal oh my god she's not she does have a chance no she doesn't have a chance with the Trump's shit no also says Pocahontas over and over again it was hilarious to me as I say Pocahontas is racist um it's a fucking Disney movie how could Pocahontas be racist I wasn't really shot she really really screwed up that's a big fuck up religious guan up getting the DNA test I am 200 times more African than she is Native American I'm 1.6 it's like she's just so upset that Trump yeah I mean I so nuts that she went and got jobs saying she was Native American I mean yeah it's one thing to say I have Native American blood it's another thing and I don't know how much you know ancestry Native American ancestry she has but I do know that she was you know that was on like her Harvard yeah bio and all this stuff and it's just like what is going on well John James talked about it he thought he was a lot of people thought he was my wife thought she was my wife thought she was more Native American so she got her DNA done so uh-huh fucking bunch of fucking liars you know what it warns more Native American down wife that was the thing I think my wife's still more Native American she's a little bit but that was the thing where people were like they wanted to be spiritual they would say they were part Native American they wanted to be extra cool well I have Native American blood oh I smell when wolves are coming you know like you put your ear to the ground you know what I trained more connect nature it's like some weird thing I remember in high school like when kids wanted to be cool they would say they were part Native American like wow well the Native American community came out after she got the DNA test and they said this is not this does not make you native Native is much more than like whatever percentage of your blood I mean Native is a you know it's a way of life right it's a culture today and it was really kind of gross that whole thing was just bizarre what was grossest even after the testing she was trying to use that as proof that she was correct and then people who analyze the data like are you fucking great you know small this percentages this is an insanely small percentage but she was saying that Trump need to give her a million dollars yeah because of the fact that she did take the test like it was insulting to the Native community it was embarrassing all around and it was also just weird that she even did it at the behest of Trump like why did you do that I gotcha he got you but he had she had to do it because he kept saying it over and over no right I feel like she's a politician you know I say that in the most unflattering of terms I feel like she's one of those people that just says what needs to be said in order to give exactly that's exactly where I don't get that impression from Tulsi at all I don't I don't feel like that's who she is I feel like she's a veteran who did two tours in the Middle East and who's a congresswoman from Hawaii who really wants to do good I mean I really do think that what she said she doesn't take any corporate money none hmm she wants this she wants this job because she thinks she can do a better job than what has been done before and the other people that are running for it I really believe hmm she's she makes sense to me what do you think about Bernie I like a lot of things Bernie says mm-hmm you know what I think is interesting now that people are mad at him he's rich right let he made a lot of money off his book you go write your own book I mean and there's a lot of you know criticisms of people lobby against him what I like about him socially is that what he is standing for is the downtrodden he's standing for the people that are dead don't catch a good break when he starts talking about things like income inequality I say I'm like okay I understand what you're doing and why you're saying it but what is the cause of income inequality like what that's what we need to find out we need to find out what's the cause like why why are these poor communities the way they are and what that needs to be helped that needs to be fixed there's so much that can be done that's not being done and right at least he seems to be he seems to be calling out to the people that are there ignored that you know my aren't aren't being served by Wall Street right I mean a big problem is when automation happened wages stopped going up with inflation and then credit subsidized all of the wages and that's why people are just indebted credit cooker companies were you know up to our ears in debt and that and he does talk about that and he talks about the solutions to that but you're totally right I mean what other candidate of these twenty five people are discussing things that are gonna reach like a populist you know have a populist message that are reaching Andrew yang is like what Andrew yang saying and I he again like Tulsi does not seem like a politician I believe him he's an entrepreneur and a business man and he's warning everyone he's he's like the fucking Paul Revere of automation he's like you know look artificial intelligence is coming and you're gonna be out of jobs right the fucking half the country is gonna be out of jobs and we can actually figure out a way to get through this and there's a bridge that we can make and through this Universal income universal basic income you can develop a bridge where you can give people their basic needs food water shelter give them food like make sure that no one's starving that we even though people are out of jobs make sure that their needs are met so then they can go and find a way through this mess and then figure out a way to contribute and make an income and make a little make a living and adjust but to have nothing to have nothing like what what is that like right you can't just have people out of work because of automation and people go back to the Industrial Age well hey that happened during this and that and yeah okay did it didn't but it didn't work out well for all those fucking people that lost those jobs back then and we shouldn't have to go through that massive chaotic situation again if there's a way to engineer a better way through it I don't know if universal basic income works you know I've talked to a lot of people that think like navara he was on my podcast recently mm-hmm and his perspective is it doesn't give people meaning and it's not a good idea because you need a life if you want people to be happy they want to be able to do something they need to have meaning in their time and what they do just to give people money it's not gonna make people happy I think it's a band-aid yeah I think it's a band-aid I agree with the concept that yang proposes about ubi but yeah I think that if we give people like healthcare and and have their basic needs met then that it's going to give them the ability in them like to maneuver to find their passion and yes be able to have that space where they can fulfill their lives yes and I I think there's a way to do both there's a way to find meaning and have your knee kept I mean the idea is that you know it's I don't think that people should get free money to the point where they could live a full rich life and go on vacations and and have a nice car and a nice house and never have to work again it doesn't make any sense you should you should contribute right everyone should contribute but if you're in a job that's gonna be completely annihilated by automation and artificial intelligence it makes sense that as a community as a culture we should figure out a way to give people money so that they have a place to live and food and then try to come up with and sort of engineer some sort of a program to help people find new ways of income new ways of making a living I don't know what that would be you know and when I talked to Tulsi about that she didn't know what that would be either no this idea of trying to promote new jobs people say that we're gonna we're gonna create new jobs okay I hate that expression like what does that mean if there's not a job how you gonna create a look at our infrastructure I mean god damned I mean good god we've been giving an an F like every year by the Army Corps of Engineers saying shits fallen apart dude I mean look at the New Deal look at how what FDR did and that's what Bernie keeps saying he's like I am literally in stating an economic Bill of Rights that FDR did a hundred years ago why am I considered radit of radical extremists when I'm just trying to give people basic economic rights and trying to propose jobs to rebuild this country you know what happened to that promise that Trump levied during the campaign we want it you know he talked about our infrastructure crumbling what the hell has been done on that front nothing and also the that was that the big one is the economy like the the debt rather like how much we're in debt we're in debt more oh my god yeah crippling 1.6 trillion for student debt alone that's insane what do you think about the people that are calling out to try to eliminate student debt I am a hundred percent on board because it's possible absolutely and you just tax Wall Street gambling literally that can do it alone you do not have household we mean by wall street jamming and Bernie laid it all out he'd just read this morning on the way here so I don't know the full proposal but Wall Street just makes you know billions of dollars I don't know how often but just like betting on these trading and shit like Wall Street just make so much money and if we just taxed Wall Street or you know like you're talking about taxing these defense contractors or actually trying to change the laws to not have these corporations hide billions of dollars offshore in tax havens it solves all of these problems pretty quickly and manat a matter of how can we do it it's a matter that we have to do it because students are totally crippled there's no opportunities in this country any qualities the highest that it's been since the Great Depression and that's a huge problem we're not going to be able to get people opportunities at all or a better life it's also so crazy that you do that to people that are 17 years old right they don't have any idea what it's gonna be like to be 35 and be quarter-million dollars your parents have student debt yeah they did yeah my stuff my stepfather was in it was in debt when he when he graduated from school it just seems like it's getting so exponential but not less yeah I mean he handled it mm-hmm but it's what you have today if you don't have any if you don't have any grants and you just try to go to school based on you know on loans Greg Fitzsimmons was here what was he saying his kids were it was 60 plus thousand dollars a year for each one of those kids 2000 I think a year yeah and then there's each one of his kids there's no jobs once you go and you know right out of school right I mean especially if you have anything technologically related the idea that at the end of four years the technology is gonna be relevant it's it's great right exactly and then here's the crazy thing like we all know that kids and human beings their frontal cortex doesn't even fully developed by the time they're 25 until they're 25 Wow I saw way too much I always smoke weed like maybe six times before I was 30 I get super late yeah yeah when I was 30 I became a STONER I was not a pothead oh I thought it was for losers I thought yeah because and a lot of people that don't smoke pot think that they think it just makes you lazy and stupid but being lazy and stupid it turns out makes you lazy and stupid right yeah I tell everybody just don't do it when you're a kid or if you do do it it often right I mean if you I don't think is you know like if you're fucking 18 years old you smoke weed once in a while yeah and zone thing you're gonna get fucked up but but like everyday stoners it's terrible for you it's just you're you're in a fog you need to be able to deal with reality but what in it like I always say it's a tool use it use it correctly right don't you know don't try to do everything with a fucking hammer sometimes you need a screwdriver sometimes you need a saw John just batter your fucking life with weed right but occasionally you smoke a weed a smoke a joint rather and you know you have a meal with a friend you feel like more close to them the communications phone you're warm and friendly it's like it's a great I don't want call the drug cuz I don't like that expression this bright blanket that we roll over and feta means and sedatives and all these different things and you throw marijuana in there it's it's a sacrament and I think it should be used in the most general and lightest use of that term as a sacrament I like to use it I like to use it for certain things but it's definitely not something you should use all the time it's definitely not something you should use as a kid you know and I see a lot of kids that are smoking every day yeah I mean it's used as a crutch more and more because I think you're just running numb out what's sure and on but paté better that than pills right you know better that than oh my god dude I just read something about how death by suicides is going up in the US and it's going down in almost every other country in the world it's like what is a really fucked up problem everything man I mean it's the same reason why so many people are it's the same reason why people are dying on you know odine on prescription pills it's like America is uniquely fucked and so many reasons and I think it's it can be the lack of health care it's it's that we're you know the center of global capitalism I mean there's a lot of reasons why the empty materialistic yeah yeah it's an empty pursuit right and when you get there it doesn't doesn't feel good you just like you just keep trying to chase in more and gather more thing yes just like that study that shows like there's a cap on happiness it's like what it doesn't make you happier when you have more money a certain point right yeah I hunted percent and I'm in agreement with that doing something you love is what makes you happy having good friends and having family and people that you love that makes you happy doing things that you find rewarding you know and helping people that's the weird one like helping people makes people happy and that's it's so correct like people are gonna look out for yourself take care isn't it right turns out no yeah no no for other people it's like super rewarding like it's a selfish thing to be generous and kind selfish in light ways because it really helps yourself well that's the whole mantra of growing up in America is you need to help yourself and you're a loser if you don't get rich and all this shit it's all these impossible you know goals that we can't do without actually help from each other you know the biggest losers rich people who are sad right god damn right you're rich and you're still depressed you're super successful and yet you're still depressed like wow you you built a shitty house like your foundation sucks you know I mean cause like your foundation yeah who you are as a person like the way you treat people the way you view the world the way you love your friends and your family like that's your foundation and if you become successful and you have that foundation I feel like you can still be happy but if you become successful and you just shit that foundation away because you just wanted to make it I'm just gonna make it fuck all that stuff I don't need that I don't need love I don't need any of that and then you make it and you're just sitting there alone yes this I got to fuckin tomb that's why I think that's why a lot of people like Trump because they think of him like I've actually heard this term like a blue-collar billionaire and it's like what he was given a million if everyone's given a million dollars from their Pappy there's a couple million yeah a couple few couple million from their daddy yeah you'd probably have it a lot better off small loan of a couple months lievable dared to him that is a small loan now that's what's really bizarre yeah he's someone I think Matt Taibbi described him best he's like what a stupid poor person thinks of as a rich person oh my god yeah and his idea is just to throw money at everything like the Palestine is real thing did you see Jared Kushner's hold layout of like this is the new peace plan no oh my god it's literally just let's give them jobs meaning let's have corporations like basically profit off the occupation what's interesting to me is that even right-wing Trump supporters in particular says that right-wing Trump supporters do not seem to like them do not seem to like Jared Kushner or Ivanka they don't like the fact that his daughter is working in the White House and that the son-in-law is there running things like they're very disturbed by that they don't like that yeah nepotism I mean well what's weird is they just blow with the fucking wind man I saw Fahrenheit 11 nine totally recommend it to everyone what is listening Michael Moore's newest documentary oh my god it's amazing but the first 20 minutes just shows like how Hilary lost and it shows that Jared Kushner actually lobbied to have sicko in theatres all across the I mean he was for socialized medicine and he was like working hand in glove with Michael Moore to roll this out it just shows you how fickle they are and like how they just have no actual value yeah I just try to make money this is a great idea you know his voice is really high yeah it's super weird I will see the two of them together it makes it's very tough so you can't believe they have sex I think they do no I think you jerks off in a cup a stir and she squirts it in there and she kicks him shows just how bizarre and inappropriate Trump is with Ivanka but there's this one talk show where the host is just like Ivanka she's like what what do you have most in common with your dad and she's like real estate and golf and she's like Trump what do you have most in common the bunkin he's like well I would say sex whoa yeah that's like what father says that well like what do you have most in common with your baby sex comment your income that's it just in common just in common wise that's super just Freudian like I want to fuck her but I can't because she's my daughter he just says so many crazy things I just I think that guy is just always talking you know and that when you're always talking to ever get a chance to really contemplate what you're saying he's just talking and then once you talk like so many times during the campaign trail it just seems like you would say things and then you would just have to like justify what he said you know I've done that when I was younger I would say something stupid and then I would have to try to figure out and make that stupid thing make sense right Trump's just constantly goes 20 you have in common with your father either real estate or golf Donald with your daughter well I was going to say sex but I can't relate that [Applause] that's the crazy thing is he thought about it and decided he wasn't gonna say yeah I was going to say he's on Wendy Williams and he wanted people to scream yeah just a good opportunity to say sex there's a whole montage of creepy shit that he said like he would date her you know he when she was a baby he was like she's gonna grow up and hopefully have big tits or whatever like he said really hates Tiffany because she's not attractive oh that's the the one yeah with Marla maples is that the other daughter a good good point I don't actually know who Tiffany's I mean I think he had her with Marlo who's very attractive so it's weird that that is weird yeah something happened some sort of a across inbred lighting but he just pretends like she doesn't exist it's kind of sad well I'm gonna do he's look I don't know how the fuck you can pay attention to anything I don't understand how a president is still a job I mean it was a job when Lincoln was running things you know and probably extremely chaotic but with today's economy when you're dealing with all these different threats the environment cyber threats the the economy all the shit they have to deal with the idea that one person is supposed to be the general manager of the country it's absurd absurd it's completely absurd and the pardoning power usually that's supposed to be like sympathy pardons for people like Chelsea Manning you know not for war criminals who have killed a bunch of civilians yeah that's basically saying has he done that yet is he is he's he's talking about it as the seal yeah this is like more than just the seal I mean he's contemplating actually pardoning the Nasser Square massacre Blackwater employees it's like what the fuck is going on here but that's to me that's like sending a message to soldiers like act like Isis and you'll be fine all pardon you hmm meanwhile look at what he's doing at Julian Assange yeah this is like going beyond the John's thing is weird cuz I thought that he would be a guy that would want Julian Assange out talking out of both sides of his mouth he said how many times during the campaign trail WikiLeaks I love WikiLeaks yeah but then you look back before the campaign he said Julian Assange to get the death penalty on Fox and Friends back in the day but again I think he probably thought about that a microsecond before he said it and then have justify it right I mean he's just like he's just talking crazy probably 80 cups of coffee for Red Bulls to diet pills he just went out there and so scary though I mean Assange that it's beyond the pale because now you're not just prosecuting whistleblowers with the Espionage Act you're actually prosecuting publishers that's like a whole level of direct assault on the first on journalism Pratt yeah he's a journalist yeah in that regard right what he's doing is he's distributing information the people that is literally gonna change the way people view the way the government and the military my god works it's I mean it's incomprehensible how much the world has changed and what we are aware of because of WikiLeaks revolutions in the past 10 years I mean even just the film that I just made Gaza fights for freedom I wake leaks cable about how Israel wanted Hamas to win in Gaza and they said that they were strategizing for that to happen so then they can regard Gaza as a hostile territory and then just relentlessly bomb them that was because of WikiLeaks no I found that out because of them I mean I can't believe what is going on because people I didn't I don't think that that people really knew that Trump would take these powers and become so authoritarian with them well what's disturbing to me is what WikiLeaks used to be something that people on the Left would cite as evidence that the military was out of control or there's a military industrial complex down control then because they feel like somehow or another WikiLeaks was involved in helping Trump they became a Russian mouthpiece and and a traitor I mean like the left over the last few years in particular since the since 2016 WikiLeaks has been sort of read sort of redefined they're conflating Julian Assange as personal politics and I don't know what those are I know that he had those private dams with the Trump jr. which looked bad but what did he say to try a few he was talking to him about you know we need your tax returns then people don't think of us as like a biased organization and it would look good and kind of like you know a little too buddy-buddy with Trump jr. but that does not take away from the importance and you know validity of what WikiLeaks is as an organization it's Oscars area Kaushal to another person giving their opinion which makes sense people just really don't like join Assange as a person and it doesn't matter how much you hate Julian Assange this is completely beyond the pale what's going on to him and it's it's he needs to be defended his rights need to be defended and very few people are defending him right so you Orange what's crazy is these charges that just got unveiled with the Trump administration they're trying to extradite him to the u.s. of course and he'll just be sitting in a cell for the rest of his life if he doesn't face the death penalty but the charges have nothing to do with the 2016 election at all whatever they all have to do with the the massacre the collateral collateral murder video that's what it has to do with it has to do with the same thing that Chelsea Manning was in jail for releasing to him and so they've just trumped up all these charges based on publishing war crimes and that's really what this is its publishing war crimes and embarrassing the US Empire and what is the what are they saying what are they calling it like what is the the actual they're saying that he helped Chelsea Manning hack into I forget it's like some sort of charge that it's basically concocted they're saying that he helped Chelsea Manning basically released the information to him and that's how he's part of the conspiracy it's total bullshit completely concocted he he's a political prisoner and he needs to be freed and it's absolutely astounding that the Trump administration is doing this and that people are going along with it I see people applauding this it's sick it's weird it's weird it's weird the shift in how people used to defend him and now no longer do and nothing really has changed in terms of what he's actually done it was a traumatic election and people's reptile brains got activated hardcore yes and they think everything is Russia and they think Julian Assange is Russia and they think anyone who's talking about what US foreign policy is towing the Russian line towing the Kremlin line it's not about the people who control this government it's the dark evil forces behind your friends and family and the people who are talking about you know sowing discord and gin and that's it's a disturbing time because it's hard to relate and actually have these discussions with people yeah I think you nailed it when you said the 2016 elections have sort of or they've awakened this reptile brain because that's what it seems like you're seeing he's seeing so many people to think that there's a war going on like a war in this country right instead of discussing things they don't want any discussion they want to shut things down and that's part of I think some of the motivation behind this justification for deep platforming people and wiping them out like remove them get them out you know we're at war right now we have to fix this we have to get a woman president we have to write a man you know it's like this kind of shit that you see like they feel like they're in an ideological war that's why identity politics is so fascinating because it's just been adopted by the establishment by the liberal wing of the establishment to try to like trick people that were somehow a progressive society that it's all just like corporatism with you know under the flag in the banner of like social politics and identity politics and it's completely absurd I mean with Obama we thought that we were in a post-racial society because we had a black president right and we know that that's absolutely a falsehood so I just think that we're just going down the wrong path here and neoliberalism has really done a number on this country in the world and we're gonna see kind of more authoritarian fascist policies take root because people are really down and out with with how capitalism has morphed and has strangled basically the economy it's really disturbing because you know you're looking at like left identity politics but it's under the banner of capitalism so really it's just about privatization neoliberalism is just about privatization so it's not about like leftist you know socialist politics and even you look at someone like Bernie Sanders he's not a socialist he's a Democratic Socialist which means that he just wants social democracy he's not talking about abolishing private industry he's not talking about nationalizing anything he's just talking about having workers have a seat at the table and getting the fair share so we're just kind of we've gone off the wayside of like rhetoric and we just have no idea how to talk about these things in like a fair way because things are so heated and ideological and people are just blinded I think and and don't really understand these issues well enough and it's really disturbing because we're at a point in our country where we need to have conversations we don't just want sound bites but going back to the the censorship stuff and the consolidation of corporate media people don't have the platform they don't have the voice to get these ideas out there which is why your show is so important I mean having people like me like Tulsi I mean bringing out these concepts and and shifting the consciousness is very very important well I think that when people are hearing the same thing over and over and over again from one side and then an opposite view over and over again from another side it's it's very difficult to have an understanding of what the fuck is going on it's it's very confusing to most people and I think they tend to either just give up or they tend to just find whatever side seems to get them the most social credit or the most most reasonable perspective in their terms like whether it's left-wing or right-wing and then just support that just doesn't give in to that and then just have this pattern that they adopt this this conglomeration of opinions they adopt and then they're so busy with their jobs they're so busy with their family they're so busy with life and then all this other shit when you're seeing you know deregulation all this other shit you're seeing when the stuff that caused the banking crisis the stuff all this stuff is going on and it's going on without their knowledge it's all happening underneath the surface and then something erupts like the economic collapse of 2007-2008 and they're like what the fuck is happening how this happened I didn't see this coming and now the economy crashes and then we have to buy out all these fucking banks and then then it rebuilds back up and people are still doing the same goddamn thing they're still working and trying to get ahead and trying it and then all this is happening behind the scenes and it's so incredibly difficult to pay attention to all of it really develop a nuanced perspective of what the problems are how to fix them and then who is actually going to support a real tangible solution versus who's just saying some elizabeth warren type shit to get elected well that's why we need a real mobilization in the streets because there's no person who's gonna change this there's no top down you know implementation that's really gonna revolutionize society and get people living wage and get people health care even Bernie said I'm not gonna be able to do this I need you to come out to get my back right um but yeah I mean there's nowhere in the country that you can live if you're living on minimum wage and actually afford a two-bedroom apartment I mean that's the reality here but when we bailed out the banks in 2008 no one had a threaded about how we're gonna pay for that I mean it was just it was just kind of understood okay we're gonna pay and give the bank's the bailout what about fucking us don't we deserve a bailout what about the people yeah thanks too big to fail the banks failed and the people fail a bull man and all this shit that were spent I mean the Venezuela's shit all these sanctions it is the Venezuela coup I mean were you following that that was insane well I was following it as much as you were sort of putting on as much you were putting a very alternative view as opposed to like what we're saying in either left or right wing combinations you were and then you faced a lot of resistance because of that right right but you were there yes yes I was there and that's why I knew with my own I mean I saw with my own eye is the reality on the ground and what do you think is happening over there so what is happening over there I mean if you poll Venezuelans themselves they will say that their quality of life has lessened because of US sanctions so back in 2015 Obama declared Venezuela a national security threat very random there was no threat obviously posed to the US but it was just to kind of start the sanctions on them but was drawn ocation who knows who knows pressure I mean it there's always been pressure because of course the US has always hated Maduro and hated Hugo Chavez and the u.s. Empire doesn't forget and it doesn't forgive and you know going back to 2002 Bush tried to engineer a coup against hukou shabbos that didn't work and so what we've done with these civil society organizations is try to foment radical discontent on the ground in Venezuela to try to you know get some sort of uprising the guy Juan Y doe was just some guy plucked from obscurity who was just well-known in Georgetown in Washington DC much more well-known there than he wasn't even in Venezuela so you know this was completely engineered it was totally concocted no Venezuelans really knew who he was I think like 80% of Venezuelans had no idea who Juan Y doe was but you know the economy went into a spiral because oil prices dropped and they would have been able to pick back up their economy but unfortunately the sanctions were so debilitating that it went into complete freefall Venezuela's not a socialist country that's actually the vast majority is private industry and a lot of those private CEOs are very anti-government long story short is that the coup was initiated you know during the Trump administration after he slapped like 70 sanctions on Venezuela and we're talking about medicine food all the things that they're saying that they need right that they're trying to stage these fake aid caravan deliveries that was all bullshit what they're doing is actually preventing the delivery from food and medicine from getting to Venezuelans and this coup was a failure because the resilience of the Venezuelan people they believe that they have a democracy they do have a democracy it's actually more free than our democracy there's not a dictatorship there Maduro won a presidential election last year he won a presidential election the u.s. lobbied the opposition candidates to not run against him so then they can say it was illegitimate that it was a dictatorship and so he won he won the popular vote and they tried to implement all these things and they've been blocked and you know the opposition keeps crying to the US that they need help that they need to be invaded it's pretty disturbing when you have opposition candidates saying slap sanctions on us invade our country help us Trump help us I mean it's absolutely ridiculous but when I was on the ground I saw flourishing democracy I saw dozens of people hundreds of people who said that they loved the process there that they believed in the Bolivarian movement and that their Chavez mo til death and we don't understand because those people's voices are totally censored from corporate media the only Venezuelans that we hear from in corporate media are rich opposition either you know expats or people who just have fled and what do we hear from corporate media what is what is the corporate take so this is even Elizabeth Warren even Bernie Sanders has been terrible on this I mean it's it's really bad I mean their take on a corporate media if you're looking at like Fox News they'll say we need to overthrow Maduro and and you know everyone's starving and it's a failed state they never mentioned the sanctions they never mentioned the fact that US sanctions just from 2017 alone has killed 40,000 Venezuelans this was just a study out by steeper 40,000 Venezuelans have died from Trump's sanctions from insulin shipments not getting there primarily a lot of other things medicine wise that people have not been getting and they are dying so that is absurd you know we like to think of sanctions as kind of like this soft power that just targets elites of the country no it's an act of war and that's exactly what's happening to Iran and Trump's implemented sanctions all over the world in a really devastating way but but the corporate media will say we need to overthrow them they're a failed state they're you know they're a dictatorship and reality no they're not they're democracy and they we don't like their politics that's really what it is we don't like the fact that their politics their politics are that they nationalized the oil and that's really where it comes from this fake ambassador that was trying to get into the embassy here Carlos Vecchio he's an ex Exxon lawyer and you see all of these people who were involved in Exxon Mobil and all of the oil industries that were flourishing in Venezuela before Chavez got a got elected and they just want their profits back they want their money back they don't like the fact that Chavez took the profits from the oil companies that's what that's what the crux of the problem is Joe and it's amazing it's amazing how transparent it is so ever since these failed coup attempts over the last decade the US has been fomenting regime change through the civil society organizations USAID offshoots in the country and and basically trying to foment violent unrest a violent unrest to the extent that they burned down streets there's lynch mobs i mean when i was there during the height of the violence in 2017 like 200 people died and the news just kept saying but like insinuating that Maduro was going out there with police forces and actually gunning down people in the streets it couldn't be farther from the truth we looked at all the deaths we broke them all down we looked at death records and we found out that the opposition lynch mobs were actually responsible for the overwhelming majority of deaths in the streets so that's happening people get lynched for being black they get lynched for being Chavez mode these people are targeting maternity clinics hospitals basically any enclave of government services because that's what this is really about it's about a kind of a fascistic bent of the opposition wanting to take back the power from the poor the poor people got power and they didn't like it and that's what the crux of the problem is but when you're looking at the corporate media it's an absurdly cartoonish brush that's being painted and then if you look at the liberal media with Maddow and all these other people they either don't talk or they say Maduro needs to let the Adan you even saw Bernie and Elizabeth Warren saying Maduro needs to let the aide in let the aid in Maduro the aid was the coup the aid was was a trick they're getting aid everyday from countries that are not trying to actively overthrow them but we staged this big stunt on the border of Colombia and by the way Colombia is actually suffering more than Venezuela Colombia is in dire poverty there's people getting assassinated every week who are labor leaders and teachers I went there and I talked to a teacher who's living in exile because he's scared for his fucking life but we don't hear about that right because they're allies with the u.s. so it's it's a cynical stunt to try to get this humanitarian international outcry to say oh my god people are dying people are hungry it's not a matter of that there's no food it's that food is very expensive because there's an actual economic war being waged by massive corporations in the country and just external entities whether it be the Trump administration or US multinationals that are X fixating preventing aid and food from coming in and the aid that they're they're claiming that they need to accept is basically a hoax it's a stunt to try to get regime change to happen we just saw Richard Branson stage some ridiculous big concert on the border of Colombia and they had like what they said were aid trucks on this big bridge and you had CNN on the ground being like alright they need to let the aid in and why don't they let the aid in and the aid was it was fake it was just a truck full of like I don't know like very miniscule things but they wanted to try to ram these trucks through just to get the soldiers up in arms and try to get them to defect it hasn't worked they've been trying over and over again to try to get something going and basically at the end of the day what happened was just a giant money grab it was basically a money-laundering scheme you look at these people who are the opposition leaders now Juan Y doe Carlos Vecchio they've just stolen all the money back maybe they realized the coup wasn't going to go forward but they basically ended up stealing at least seventy million dollars and just putting it right in these people's bank accounts it's pretty shocking I mean you have international it's an international conspiracy to try to take the money back from from the people whose money's was was basically administered by Maduro for Social Services is nationalizing the oil nationalizing the oil is the root of it all and also just uplifting the poor I mean poor people got a voice and they never had a voice in that country their entire lives and that country was you know as a colonial holdover and so the Bolivarian movement started this pink tide all across latin america and it was scary it was a giant threat to the US establishment and actually that's why Telesur was founded tell us sir that the the organization that I used to sell the show to it was started as kind of a counter to this global hegemony in this corporate narrative trying to overthrow these democratically elected leaders but it's shocking when you see like the Bank of England seized all of this gold that was rightfully maderos they seized it illegally all of these these banks and international bodies just stole all this money and they just gave it to these opposition leaders so even though the opposition leaders weren't able to take you know take the power back in the country they still have taken all the money and no one's talking about that and everyone's just acting like this is some crazy dictatorship that needs are saving how dare you who the fuck do we think we are we're uninformed right yeah yeah you should check out everyone should check out our Empire files YouTube channel because we've done extensive coverage on the ground really going into the nuts and bolts of what the economic crisis really is and my partner Mike prize nerd did this epic takedown of John Oliver you know the liberal media is just as bad John Oliver did some fucking absurdly false kind of like analysis of the whole Venezuela situation and we just went through and debunked every single line of it I mean it was extremely disingenuous I bet he had someone who wrote all right right so I bet he probably has no real knowledge of it nor could you really unless you extensively studied it the way you have and especially if you have feet on the ground right I think that most people just in order to understand a complex nuanced problem like some sort of an international conflict that we're involved in that has to do nationalizing oil like goddamn you got to do a lot of work your deal you do and if you run in a show like last week tonight or whatever the fuck it was called you have producers doing everything someone else is doing that I mean you find that with a lot of these so-called online experts and when you talk to them one-on-one and you get them off the record without notes like they're just people well there's this guy this UN Human Rights investigator named Alfred days is that I did this big interview with and he said he tried to propose this to the UN saying there is new no humanitarian crisis there this is all fake yes people are suffering and dying but it's not because of maderos policies and corruption this is because of US sanctions that have exceeded the economy and prevented any sort of recovery from taking place and the economy is still in freefall they can't work with international bodies again we have the threats of sanctions with institutions that now work with Venezuela so they've been isolated they've been isolated from the world so was the idea that they just put these sanctions in place allow this political unrest to take place support the opposition and then just have a slow burn until it all collapses and yes I'm gonna swoop in and fix everything and make it a part of the United States government and then these people will not have a voice any longer and another thing that they hate is that Maduro is given two million free homes to people that's something that's completely unheard of to maybe Americans but that's one thing that Juan wydo said that he would do he immediately implemented a new hydrocarbons law or he was proposing to implement a new hydrocarbons law which is again you know reprieve atty zhing the oil and also just immediately privatizing all of the social services that Maduro and chavez did so it's it's pretty shocking what would happen and pretty devastating what would happen if if Y dough's coup did succeed and the whole Trump administration I mean it's not just Venezuela it's Nicaraguan Cuba too I mean we can't go to Cuba anymore what was the purpose and what was the rationale because socialism is terrifying and we can't just let this small island nation just live its life we have to create some genocide 'el blockade that prevents food and medicine from getting in there too but what was the did was there a justification did they say why they were doing this they're imposing these new laws no it's just John Bolton's bizarre speech about the troika of tyranny remember that member the axis of evil remember that now it's the troika of tyranny Nicaragua Cuban Venezuela it's like wait I thought that I thought that we were fighting a war on terrorism we're going up in Nicaragua - yeah because of Ortega yeah they hate anyone who leans left they want to crush crush hmm it's pretty fucking nuts what's that one is a weird one right the Cuba ones because what what has happened over there nothing the only thing they just did was actually give out free HIV prevention pills and they that's what they fucked up yeah no it's the Venezuela things a mess it's it's so difficult because it's so nuanced but that's you know I encourage everyone to maybe check out Venezuela analysis and Empire files and tell us or if they want to learn more about that situation have you encountered any de monetization of your channel from discussing these complex issues yes we have so we actually stopped monetizing altogether so we are at a free but we wouldn't we would have been demonetized and I'm absolutely sure and we also are slapped with age restrictions and sensitive content bans on almost every single video that we've put up whether it be Israel Palestine or Venezuela really and then what would cause you to get an age restriction or a sensitive content ban like is there anything that is like a fairly innocuous video that you guys put out that I was also gotten a absolutely like Mike's video about John Oliver was just literally taking clips from John Oliver and then critiquing them and they said that was sensitive content ban it's like well what do you mean why is that sensitive content ban but I think it has to do or an issue because you're criticizing an HBO show no no because it's happened with with almost every single one of our videos and so you have to make sure that you're logged in that you prove your age just all these different steps and gatekeeping methods to prevent people from from getting access to our channel and another crazy thing about it is if you just search like Empire files Venezuela like it will take you a really long time to actually find our work even if you type in the channel name Abby Martin and and these subjects it's it's really difficult to find and they've made that difficult to find on purpose I have no doubt well it's also weird like how they determine what is trending right you know because it's not real right what's trending right not really what is trending like Alex Jones freaked out is like they're Keita because the video had got millions and millions of hits like they're they're censoring us from trending I'm like dude I got news for you I've never trended ever really zero oh you know that's fake that's where it's for yeah zero times a channel dumbest but shouldn't they be building your channel up no some people like it some people over there like it I think it's too fucked up you know I think the like they don't know what I'm doing like there's not it's not you can't put it in a clear box and there's too much too many comedians on and there's too much weed and people get drunk and they you know they talk about easy shit and it's uncensored I just think I don't it's a very complex thing this sort of but you know it's happening there's you know someone has made a choice to never have it trend there's it's trended zero times how many views we had total you're talking about that one report the guy did that's in are zero times yeah well then we have trended but it's been like a very few amount of times like over five years that report was like over a one-year period but we haven't trended in years the main channel has in our Clips channel pops up there every so all clips Channel I don't know trending pages are telling pages in a good gauge to mark stuff I don't like well it's not like this is the news of the day kind of page but it does help people like see people that are trendy yeah my friend to look good I know that he's your friend to Peter Joseph who's been on the show before hit you know zeitgeist and the zeitgeist trilogy was like one of the most popular videos online and that was totally fuckin censored yeah hundred percent well can barely find that anymore this is the issue that people have with Facebook and Google and any of these gigantic online corporations that are deciding what is and isn't popular and and and using algorithms to steer people in directions you know one of the more fascinating discussions that's happened over the past few years is this understanding that their algorithms favor people arguing on things if like if you want to have a subject like say abortion and you put up you know if you're a pro-choice or pro-life person you're gonna get steered towards things you disagree with so that you didn't you engage with them more because that's where the money is the money is in you being upset and engaging and that's where people that's where people really get into it so the more you engage the more profitable it is for Facebook and the more they encourage that type of behavior so they're they're algorithm actually encouraged pisses you encourage it right pissing you off and wants you to stay on YouTube and just go down the rabbit hole yeah particularly Facebook but with YouTube that was one of the that weird New York Times piece the radicalization of some soft-minded child who got online and was turned into a right winger and then was subsequently turned into a left winger by another video and they're like finally he was saved like are you sure I didn't read it yeah nonsense because it sort of connected a lot of people that aren't even right-wing including me with the radicalization of this young man and they did link some websites that or some YouTube channels that are right you know that are right-leaning and and or even far-right but they also threw in a bunch of other ones that like Phil Edie right who's not right-wing at all me and a few other folks well that's the algorithm algorithm just takes you down down down yeah but they were New York Times article was suggesting that we all were right wing's it was a sloppy article just wasn't resident really well done but what's interesting is the conclusion ultimately he was saved by this by their algorithm yeah their algorithm led him got him out yeah led him to an opposition of that exact left-wing person's YouTube employee wrote it or some shit just idea that this is the thing that drives me crazy save you believe something right and then if you go online and you read something else and that something else is contrary to what you believe and you start believing in that something else somehow another that's bad this is one of the great arguments against censorship is like you have to figure out what the fuck makes sense the only way to figure out what makes sense is to read all kinds of things to engage with all kinds of content the idea that we're supposed to protect people because we know what's right we know it's correct well who are you let me let me talk to you if you think you know what's correct you're the arbiter of free speech or the arbiter of logical discourse and in common sense in this world let me ask you things let me talk to you let me get to the heart of how you feel how do you feel about trans kids transitioning when they're six how do you feel about all sorts of crazy weird things that have just been propped up as logical and make sense how do you how do you feel about war how do you feel about abortion how do you feel about ghosts how are you who are you and you just you just get to choose whether or not someone lien or information that comes to them leans left or right I think it's preposterous I just think it's incredibly dangerous because you have to have an unbelievably complex and nuanced perspective in order to be able to dictate what makes or does not make sense and you you have to have a lot of information at your disposal you have to have a lot if you're talking about something like Venezuela let's look at that for example look at what you know and then look what you see in what you would call progressive left-wing media that to your knowledge is incorrect and it's basically propaganda points that's being redistributed in this way that is palatable now imagine if the people decide that you abbi Martin are somehow another part of some right-wing conspiracy now and they they're gonna censor your voice and censor Europe because it doesn't fit in to this narrative that they're but because you need so much information to be like to really understand what's happening in this one part of South America the word right exactly it's so complex well they treat us like children and they think that we're not smart enough to actually discern what is information that we need and I mean I want the Russian perspective I want the Venezuelan perspective I want the Chinese perspective because I feel like we're smart enough to really determine our own reality based on all the available information well this is where we're fucked is that we don't have a reliable independent source that's not filled with hyperbole and emotion and and and dunking on people and screaming and insulting and I want someone who can break things down logically and clearly with no ideological Bend they are you're not leaning left you're not leaning right what where is that and why why doesn't that exist I think it's because it's not necessarily human and and you know people have opinions and they have biases and either that couch those biases and like these think tanks and pretend like they're these unbiased journalists or they just kind of wear it on their sleeve like I do with Empire files and media routes which is my you know my news organization that I do with my brother Robbie but I mean we try to lay it out but we also don't hide where we're coming I almost appreciate that more than then a lot of these journalists so-called journalists who are really kind of stenographers who pretend like they are unbiased and they're like I'm just giving it to you straight and and at the end of the day they're they're really not they're trying to tow a line and they're trying to push a certain perspective but it's just not obvious yeah it's just we live in such a strange time where we are overwhelmed with data I mean right overwhelmed you you cannot get away from it and there's no way there's not a fucking human alive that understands all of it it is impossible it really is impossible and it's so hard to find out what is true and what what is bullshit right oh my god what you posted about how you can now change people's like you can make a picture talk yes they're crazy we're in the way of a wave of lies I know I was like that's what Lisa looked like cool she's talking I like to do coke with other planes even though they were invented like you could have the Mona Lisa say anything yeah really disturbing what we're in for what like what's coming buckle up buckle up Yeah right imagine the fourth fifth and sixth generation of this technology lies by government you know oh my god and then being utilized by someone to sort of I mean you could easily justify assassination so you can prove that someone saying something fucked up you killed them and then you release the tape of them saying something fucked up don't really that this person was you can yeah sure for sure for sure oh my god this drone strike anyone what I'm hoping is that if you look at what this technology is doing with technology in generals doing particularly like information technology internet cellular phones and smart phones all these devices and and and all the the various new incarnations that are coming out what they seem to be doing is they seem to be creating portals for which information is more quickly accessed it's more and more transparent like ideas are getting to people quicker there's less and I think this is one of the things that these companies like Google and Facebook and Twitter and also they're trying to like figure out a way to manage this like well this is just too crazy we have to figure out how to manage information and get it right at people things that they want to say but I think ultimately it's going to fail and I think ultimately as technology as all these innovations keep coming down the pipe we're going to get closer and closer to this time where everyone has an instantaneous and equal access to information and I think that when that time does come lying will be virtually impossible I really do believe that because I think we're we're probably a decade away from implementing some sort of a device or an ability to read minds I don't believe that that's kind of terrifying I think they're gonna develop some sort of technology that allows us to link up together and through some some sort of some new way of communicating that we did we don't foresee now but if you just look at this trend like what is the trend the trend was oh you go to the library and get a book or now you can get a book online well now you get a book on your phone well now you could have that book read to you on your phone now I mean it's all this you know now in Australian accent boom boom boom boom it keeps getting closer and closer to you and I think there's going when Elon Musk he's being very vague about it won't write us what he's doing but this neural link thing that he's doing that he thinks is going to radically increase the bandwidth between human beings and information and he thinks it's going to literally change humanity wow what the fuck that means but if he's working on something like that he's not the only one and if you're wearing some sort of a device that allows you to access information that this round what what the next step would be was to is to make it so that you can tap into some sort of a universal language and this universal language would not be dependent upon like these various languages where Spanish or Chinese or whatever it is but some sort of a new language that kids learn and a new language the universal language that's distributed through online platforms and I'll have this all go straight to your fucking brain Wow it's gonna happen where we're becoming cyborgs in some sort of a weird way and that's the other thing that Elan said we're already cyborgs we just carry it around with us and that's what your phone is right we're so dependent upon these devices it just seems to make sense that the general direction that all this is going is becoming more and more invasive and more and more inclusive more and more invasive in terms of it's it's the way it's sort of ingrained in your body and becomes a part of your life but becomes more and more a part of everyone's life and then more inclusive in terms of more access to this information and more access to thoughts and I just think we're just a few years away from someone making a breakthrough Wow I think in some ways it's he's gonna do this have I shown you this before this thing is glass there you go or you can talk to it without moving his mouth and it can communicates with a computer this is this is over a year old so I don't know what the developments they've made since then yeah I sent this to Eli and he says it's just a trick he said this is basically like a trick he said yeah this has given you information you don't need to talk to it but he said what he's doing is far more complex and then I asked him questions any went radio silent that guy looks like a dork wearing that thing yeah probably but that looks like some Iron Man type shit he's gonna wear a football helmet that does that if I just one one step this is like then the next thing they get this on a Bluetooth thing just touched your ear that like everybody's been already been walking around with the last 25 years so he's essentially calculating his groceries as he walks around yeah he's just this is just probably connected to his phone I was just sort of showing you this this is already may be available and like they're showing this is proof of concept go back this up because it was let's read the narration because it just said something there so without right there without any voice or just go back to understand okay really right there without any voice or discernible movements enabling the user to communicate with devices just let it play um okay so a I assistance applications or other people in a silent yeah yeah so video wrote yeah who the fuck can read that fast I'm reading pretty very simply by vocalizing they're eternally sub to be wearing one of these devices tell your brain they're trying to tell you stupid stupid you need this can i play we have a little trailer for the film could i play it really quick short check out Empire files and it's the most recent thing how long have you guys been independent like ad-free basically a year since I came out right after I came on last year the sanctions shut down our show and so we had to do this giant fundraiser and it was just absolutely very difficult to yeah here it is yep let's check it out Empire files Gaza fights for freedom and this is this is the little trailer for a film that just came out and then I didn't know who does that move into the computer this is our eldest daughter she was my first joy she was killed she's a medic you want to read this first time female to field though as a girl she was the first to go to the March encampments and everyone participated I too participated the whole family did my husband my children my neighbors my siblings did to all Palestinians participated our March is peaceful we do not carry weapons and we should listen bare chests we stand before a huge force of a fortified army with tanks gas and warplanes our march is peaceful will react right I have the right to have a country I have the right to have a home all those refugees have the right to return to their homes so during this protest is this when these people were shot what we're seeing here yeah so it's a lot of people who are getting carried out cooing little kids and they're shooting at them and this is isn't it time yet she says everyone around the world is sitting there watching us and they're all comfortable with their lives here we are under siege we have no borders no life where are we supposed to go so this is coming out in a couple weeks where we're fine-tuning it but we just had a big theatrical release in downtown and it was it was really cool that's where you saw the Oliver Stone yeah there yeah it's it's it's sick I mean you texted me that video of the kid you know another medic was just shot so yeah there's something reasonably Mohamed who's well the UFC fighters had on his Instagram and I texted you that this week it's so again this is another thing that's so difficult to understand what's actually going on there's so many pro-israel people that put their head in the sand and don't want to look at some of these atrocities and don't want to look at some of the videos that you sent me of soldiers shooting in people that are not doing anything right I mean yeah I mean their whole argument is that it's all Hamas and their human shields I mean we looked through hundreds of hours of footage that these people gave us and it's mind-blowing footage it looks absolutely cinematic and epic but the footage is harrowing and I didn't see one weapon I didn't see one militant not one weapon it was literally people with slingshots throwing rocks at tanks it's kind of a rite of passage it's very symbolic they're not trying to hurt anyone no Israeli soldiers have been hurt or killed you know during 2018 which is what the film looks at is is through 2018 of the great march of return and there's not any weapons there's no militants Hamas has nothing to do with these with the March and it's just shocking I mean it's shocking how many war crimes were committed on camera and it's just amazing the propaganda that's just told to us about what this is and and why they have the right to kill people that pose no threat to them when you were on last time when you talked about this one of my email accounts was flooded with literally a chain letter the same letter like denouncing you and your lies and your anti-semitic perspective and your anti Israelis perspective it was it was weird because it was the same email astroturfed yeah I was fake yeah you know that's a campaign you know that that has a lot of money behind it yeah there's a lot of money behind that I mean the film is mind-blowing go to Gaza fights for freedom calm if you want to check it out when it when it gets released and it's just really on incontrovertible Joe I mean there you know even if it were a war between armies all of these things that Israel's done are still documented war crimes and very Grievous violations of international law and we're talking about direct targeting and assassinations by Israeli snipers of disabled people of children breasts and medics and that's what who rose on was she was a medic and and as you mentioned another medic just passed away was killed rather I hate to use the passive voice because you always hear Palestinians died no they were murdered they're all being murdered by snipers and they pose no threat to them and so the film looks at this UN investigation basically during the march in 2018 and documents all of the grievous crimes and atrocities conducted by the Israeli military and I mean you know Palestine has a right to defend itself and this isn't even what that is but if you look at the UN Charter of 1978 they say that you know occupied peoples and besieged people's have the right actually for armed self-defense and and the fact that this is not even what that is that there's literally people going out there in peace with their bare chests holding flags and they're getting killed and snipe there's so many amputations I mean just in 2018 alone there was 35 kids who were killed 900 shot Jesus yeah that's children and and you know some of these stories are harrowing a kid hiding behind a trash can who was sniped a kid who went up to the fence and just put a Palestinian flag and she was shot in the and died instantly it just it goes on and on and on and so you know we're just trying to document this to really kind of push the needle for accountability because these laws have been agreed upon by the international community some of them 100 years ago and to have kind of a rogue state acting with complete impunity knowing that it has total protection from the US Empire and given more freedom than ever under Trump with this Golan Heights thing and the moving of the Jerusalem embassy or the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem I mean it's just it's abysmal and it needs to be stopped and you know they can't control the narrative any longer because we're seeing this with our own eyes and that's what this film does is really lays it all out Abby you concentrate and focus on so many different fucked up parts of you so you're very friendly and upbeat like see like you're laughing at this how do you manage to maintain your sanity because I I have a hard time if I just watch when I have your pieces right I watched one of your clips and I just go what the fuck I just want to cry and I don't know what to do and I want to hug my kids but you're in this you're in the trenches every day and you go to these places all the time how do you how do you do it well I think that well first of all I go and camp a lot I get into nature a lot which is also kind of depressing knowing that you know climate change and blah blah blah but I try to get out and see the beauty of the world and understand my privilege especially as an American citizen because I don't have we can't afford to not be aware and we can't afford to not be educated and talking about these issues especially when our government is subsidizing this around the world ten million dollars every day with our tax dollars you know I mean this is this is going on and it's so close to home and we have to acknowledge our privilege and acknowledge the situation which is we have agency we have agency to lobby our government to change this and to stop these criminal acts but do you ever feel that it's almost like you're absorbing too much because you are looking at all the problems of all the people and said plus billion around the world and all these different horrific and Justices I try to focus on what I can do and what I can do is is challenge my own government and you know as an American citizen living in this society I think that the US Empire and the Pentagon is the source of a lot of problems around the world I look at the world as complex I mean you have to understand the issues that are going on especially with foreign policy in terms of the colonized and colonizers the oppressed and oppressors and the u.s. is role as well as other previous empires role in shaping the world as it is today and a lot of the problems that have arisen are because directly u.s. foreign policy whether it be the global war on terrorism whether it be terrorism in general I mean that you know drone strikes basically cause terrorism whether it be the environmental crises the Pentagon is actually the largest polluter in the world more than 140 countries that's essentially every country in the world almost a bigger polluter than the top four chemical companies combined so it all kind of stems back from this notion that you know the u.s. is the world's largest empire that's ever existed and it needs to be stopped to save humanity and so as an American citizen I look at all of the problems and I understand that there is like a very common route and I can do something about this common route and if you're looking at domestic problems the lack of health care the lack of education I mean Martin Luther King called it decades ago he says you know a nation that spends more and more on military spending is facing social death I probably butchered his quote but that's essentially the spiritual death I think he's what he said but I mean it that's exactly what's happening is when we're squandering all of our money bolstering up this huge global Empire we're not taking care of our people at home our brothers and sisters at home my empathy extends as an internationalist all around the world I you know I feel for my brothers and sisters in Palestine Yemen everywhere but I can only do what I can do based on what my government is doing and and you know it's doing a lot it's doing a lot of horrible things and it's time for us to really acknowledge what those horrible things are because we need to reinvigorate and or movement in this country and when you're saying that drone strikes create terrorism what you're really saying is it well what people if they don't understand drone strikes primarily kill civilians right yeah it's a it's a really crazy number and it's this very strange sanitized way of handling an issue where if you had a person and you had some Rambo character you send them overseas you said hey I want you to go get this Isis terrorist and in the process kill everybody the fuck that you see everybody everybody that's in front of them that person would be a war criminal all right if you had a guy and he knew that some Isis guy was in an apartment building so he just started gunning down men women and children in that apartment building until he got to the terrorists that guy would go to jail but if you do it with a remote control and you launch Hellfire missiles out of a drone and it blows up the apartment building and kills all these innocent people but also gets the terrorist its mission accomplished and it's crazy it's crazy that we're signing off on that right and what gives us the right it's to kill people it's it's a thing because we're not there where there's this weird sort of a just a there's a bridge that we're allowed to cross into this really sickening act it's very stupid when you have anything that's ineffective to the point where most of the people it kills are good people or at least our innocent people should say that's crazy I mean this is not saying that there's not terrorism it's not saying there's not horrible people and Isis absolutely right yeah look I'm a pro military person I think we need military and I think it's just like the same I need we need cops but to deny that cops sometimes are bad is fucking crazy to not deny that sometimes when you allow the military industrial complex to do things like have drones that launch missiles into wedding parties because you think one of the people might be a terrorist and are often incorrect often to the tune of 90 plus percent yeah it's crazy yeah and you look at you know the last 10 years you look at some of these terror who have conducted terrorist acts you look at actually what their intention was and a lot of them the vast majority literally cite u.s. foreign policy avenge u.s. foreign policy I mean every time you kill 98 percent innocent people whoever survives if you lost your whole family and that you have an incredible amount of motivation to get back at whoever did it right and that whoever did it is the United States we need to stop normalizing this and you know militarily speaking Trump actually you know it's not just Trump I mean this is a bipartisan effort throughout the entire Congress if there's one thing Congress can agree upon it's to make nonviolent BDS efforts against Israel legal and also to just keep ramping up the military and egging on whoever's sitting in the Oval Office to be more militaristic and that's exactly what's happened with Trump in a bizarre way I mean Congress approved like a 7 a near trillion dollar defense budget and the increase alone in the last year was basically Russia's entire military budget more than Russia's entire military budget that's how much this shit's ramping up and then you have the space force I mean it's just like how far is this gonna go the societies collapsing if you looked at the argument against this you would say we need this in order to keep people safe here that would be the argument against it I my question would be what are we what threat is there Isis when has Isis ever done anything here other than I mean there was like a truck I mean come on we already know the statistics on terrorism in this country and they're very low right I mean you're basically more likely to die from like furniture falling on you or sure it's hard man yeah yeah and the whole Isis thing I mean as we know Isis arose out of US foreign policy the the failed state in Libya the Iraq war that's still criminally ongoing I mean Trump announced this indefinite extension of the criminal occupation of Iraq it's just crazy how normalized this is you know far longer than Vietnam we're in Afghanistan fatalities that aren't all-time high all of these things are a direct result of u.s. foreign policy and look at the ref you crisis look at immigration the Honduras coup all the shit's connected and that's what we need to start like expanding our consciousness and our empathy worldwide to understand all of these things are linked and the struggle is all linked and our world is shrinking really rapidly what candidate speaks in this way like what candidate do you think understands and recognizes all these things that you're talking about I mean Mike Ravel is the only one who's like we need to end the US Empire Bernie and Mike Ravel was uh he was the guy who basically read the Pentagon Papers into record he is he's a good guy he's like this online campaign that's really awesome but I mean Tulsi is speaking a lot about regime change Wars which is extremely important but she still believes in drone strikes she basically has a little bit of Obama's foreign policy that I don't agree with that fundamental understanding limited drone strikes like maybe if there's an Isis camp somewhere I mean I can't believe that she believes in some sort of uh just broad brush use of it I haven't looked into the the nuances of that but I do think that no one is saying what I want them to about US Empire about you know scaling back the US Empire and and stopping all of the civil society movements because it's not just about invasions anymore it's about you know usurping the democratic processes of all of these countries like what we've done in Venezuela what we're doing all around the world to try to foment unrest all of this needs to be stopped do you foresee a time where our dependence on foreign oil is radically reduced to the point where it doesn't justify these regime change wars and our dependence on these resources that these people have I mean this is almost every conflict in the world you can boil down to the acquisition of resources right and also the protection of capital and that's like what a lot is what a lot of it is now is actually just capital interests needing to expand and grow and continuing to up and increase the profit structure of these corporations and that's exactly why we've seen imperialism you know kind of go out of control in the way that it has I don't know I mean I I thought that we were more independent oil wise I don't think it's good I think that climate change yeah I think that climate hasn't stopped yeah you know it hasn't stopped the imperialist misadventures of the US government so I think there just needs to be a really big shift in consciousness and and people to stop thinking that it's our right and that we have you know the right and the duty to do this around the world it doesn't give us the right we don't have it's not right man it's really not and we need to really reinvigorate the masses here because again society is collapsing that's pretty fucking obvious well if it is if it's not obvious what is obvious is that we're not evolving right in terms of if we're still involved in drone strikes that killed ninety eight percent of people if we're still involved in regime change Wars we're still involved in these unnecessary military actions against Iran it's these things that people freaking out about this is all the same kind of shit that people have been fighting against forever that we don't want our brothers and sisters and husbands and wives to die for nonsense we don't want them to die for some people that live in these air-conditioned rooms that are making billions of dollars that are profiting off of the actions of these these noble people who think that they're doing it to protect America I mean this is the narrative that they're being served this is what they're being told and when they're going to these places they're not going to those places to act as evil as to as the the boots of some empire they're going over there because they think they're protecting freedom they think they're protecting their family and their loved ones back home that's why they're doing it if we're still doing that we're not evolving well I mean that's what's so scary about the Iran thing because the people who are surrounding Iran and being directed to go out there they're the ones who are gonna be the sacrificial lamb for these defense contractors and I don't think that you can argue anymore that this is for I mean how can you what threat does Iran pose it's a tough sell I don't I don't understand what threat they serve either and what what benefit would it be for them to start some shit with us and theirs that is the craziest idea ever and it's like my you know a nine year old kid trying to pick a fight with Mike Tyson it's fucking crazy doesn't make any sense like what are you trying to do trying to get killed I mean inevitably we're trying to get to the global confrontation with China and Russia I guess I mean that's it's scary to think that we only have a couple independent states left to knock down to be under complete subjugation from the US military in global capitalism it's pretty nuts well not only that even if we do move into some sort of a some sort of a situation where we're in control then we're a bigger target and with the amount of nuclear weapons that are possessed by these countries that were I mean just what North Korea has just this one small fucked-up country could ruin life on Earth just this one country and forget about Russia we could literally annihilate each other right that's right that's a possibility right I mean if if someone chose to launch an attack if they decided that they have the justification to launch an attack and then all sudden we're in a real war yeah like a fucking war war with people invading us shit get down buildings and bombs blow up I mean over what this can't be avoided this is the only way the only way is missiles and bombs like you said we're not evolving or devolving I mean it's it's unbelievable we have the capacity to provide for everyone we have the capacity to cooperate to innovate and we're stuck we're stuck dehumanizing the other we're stuck with this mask conditioning to basically perpetuate these these and Justices and its really a shame I mean we have all the information at our fingertips but we still keep reverting back to what's the myths it's that underpin our society these conversations I have with you are so depressing because it's always I always leave going what what can be done what can we do what where does it end where does it go you know these are these are the the big questions and then also that what we discussed before it's impossible for anyone to really have a deep nuanced understanding of all these different issues right right I mean I think focusing on what you can do we can only do what we can do right and you have to understand that you know you can't get debilitated or disillusioned with you know the the influx of information or just the complete you know the heaviness of it all you just have to do what you can do you're doing what you can do you have me on to help spread awareness about these issues and annual free [Laughter] you're about to get spammed with a lot of Hasbro and they don't have my real email but that's that's what we can do Joe and and you just have to live your life and provide for your kids and and love what you have and but also just understand your place you know and just extend the empathy that you can and just yeah I mean it's it's hard because I don't have the answer all I know is what's needed and what's needed is we need a movement of the masses it's not going to come from the top down it's gonna come from a grassroots mobilized effort to try to change these policies that's the only way things have ever changed in the past and I absolutely have hope and optimism that we're gonna change things and that we're going to correct this horrible path that we're on do you think that the 2020 elections can have a real significant impact of any of this do you think that whoever gets into office can really have an effect on the kind of policies that we're talking about with the kind of influence of the military industrial complex of all these lobbyists of Wall Street of all all these like monstrous machines that this pure good old-fashioned democracy can actually step in and and turn this ship away from the rocks Bernie I really do think that he's one of our last chances not because I think that he's going to completely do some rebel upheaval from the top down as we know Congress is stacked with a lot of terrible people who will block a lot of these efforts but I think that he's going to mobilize the masses and reinvigorate the labor movement and reinvigorate unions and help workers understand that they need to fight for these rights that have been eviscerated you know over the last hundred years one thing that does inspire me as well as seeing people like Ilan Omar you know she is incredible she's a Somali refugee she advocates BDS against Israel and she does not fucking back down I love that woman what an incredible woman she got viciously attacked for retweeting one of my episodes from Empire Files and I think it just shows how scared people are of her and her ideas and you saw how hard everyone came down on her for just saying that Israel has an influential lobby in DC yeah well they she's also wearing religious garb so people are scared of that right right away the job and then there was something some hit piece on her yesterday they're saying they think she married a brother oh that's ridiculous yeah Thank You Nicholas to get into this country that she had a religious marriage but then she had another yeah I don't know she's the only one in Congress other than play Eve and of course AOC and you know some other very few people but she's out there every day speaking against the military industrial complex speaking against the wars I think as a refugee she understands the effects of US policy and I'm really excited that she has a voice in there but again I don't think that the hope is going to come from within Congress and the system is way too far gone with the Electoral College and the gerrymandering and the voter rights you know that I've been rescinded it's it's a lot and it's an uphill battle but that's why someone like Bernie I think will turn to the people and say I can't do this alone you have to come out and get my back and we have to have millions of people in the streets demanding these things that's the only way it's going to work all right yeah thank God Andrew Santino's going on later and we're gonna get hi hi hi Empire fire and barbells meteor roots radio eyes left my partner Mike and donate to keep us alive man Gaza fights for Jews and Gaza flight
