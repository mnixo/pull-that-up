hello freak bitches this stink yeah the bathroom smells so bad the bathroom smells so bad from pollution I think which is polluted water just polluted water makes a smell man and also they don't they don't want you can say it died thinking about it there's no toilet it's just all the porcelain hole the shine wha yeah you have to squat it's a squat suppose that's better few miles supposedly supposedly I was in the Forbidden City I was walking around there the Emperor's Palace yeah and I got bad diarrhea it was bad like sweating like I got a fuck and then there's a picture toilet you go in there and you fucking run and smells soon as you cross the threshold or the background smells horrible and you open up the first toy the stall door and your mind can't even register at first like this must be under construction this book cuz there's no toilet here so that's the only explanation and then you go to the next one and you're like what Oh zip a block no there's no paper what yeah well first I just said I'm not doing this I'm not done walked away oh my god I was like I was like two steps out of the bathroom oh yeah diarrhea what do you mean I'm not doing it of course I'm doing it so you went back in and washed your butt you have to do so they so this guy who owned the cone the bar the club was it in Shanghai gave me this these tissue packet and he goes you'll need it I thought it's for pollution and he goes you'll need this and I hit and I just had it yeah and then it was like oh yeah you got to pull your pants all the way down squat over it but also trying to shit into your pants oh you can't go over the balls of your feet oh no there's probably a better way what do you do with the explosive diarrhea though it seems like you're gonna miss last it into that hole you're you're you're never over that hole like half a foot over the hole is that good for your quads it's good for your core I would feel like that would really work your core a lot and there's no air conditioning it's so hot that would work you're resolved yeah that's why the Asians are thin maybe it's not the low sugar diets is the shit shit you're hit your ankle explosive diarrhea feels like I'm just gonna hit my picture this picture this I'm down okay or easily squatting right now so like you're your ass is right it's over the hole yeah filling the hole essentially feet if your moves are far enough away what do you do if you have bad knees how you do after that but I sit like that all the time that's how Asians just squat eat all the time I do that sometimes really sits like that yeah sure once in a while if we're back in one of those toilets somebody dropped their brand-new phone in the toilet and so the husband went to go in there and grab it ass down because of the fumes and whoa-ho the woman tried to grab the guy out because those few people died three injured fine by me but they're all perfect yeah we have a so good America Dick Cheney's right they have those they have those shitters on the train when it's moving around and stuff they have those jitters Dick Cheney's right eye open unlike tissue Pandits what What did he say right can we do a douche bags definition possible when you say douche bag there I'm curious as to the what specifically just dumb assholes okay just dumb oh yeah a lot of assholes like you ever go to Kim Kardashian's Instagram page not a long time Louisa's go there and just read some of the fucking comments about children right into anything anything that yawns just fucking hey I'm sure I'm sure it's there it's diluted YouTube it's because you're commenting on a photo or video instead of like a Twitter where you're just talking about words I honestly think anything worth anything should be comments deleted comics disabled because the the problem is like they very rarely it's it's rare that you it generates a really fascinating conversation in the comments it's super common that is just kunti shitheads it depends on a subject matter like in my case sometimes I do get relevant discussion in the comments anything tech discussion like pretty respectful but you get this weird fanboys and stuff that gets militant surprisingly these are like yeah I don't know I have this theory like you know when you go to a coffee shop and you look around yet Starbucks everyone has their phones on the table you know you notice that like yeah like it's in the public space it's like it's like representative of you in some way right and I have this feeling that this is for a lot of people this is a major investment you know outside of their car or whatever it's really close to you it's in your pocket all the time and so I think people are really concerned with making the wrong decision you know they're really concerned that their thing is not the best and so in my case what will happen is I'll put up a video within you know they haven't even had time to finish watching it and Apple sucks or Android sucks or whatever and really it's fear it's fear that you made the wrong decision and so it well like in many places in life you get angry when you're afraid and so god forbid a new product comes out that obsoletes yours and you don't have the money to replace it so you you take this position of defending the other thing because that's easier than justifying the cost of the new one so I've actually there were a couple of really cool articles on fanboy ISM that I was interviewed for and you know we went we went deep into how you know how people sort of figure that out but there's definitely this undercurrent below the the tech space the consumer product space where these are becoming more and more like fashion symbols like like you know representative of your personality maybe more so than at this then as a tool you know less less of a hammer and more like a piece of jewelry like a watch or some isn't it also that people just love being on teams whether it's team oh oh public an teams led team most most definitely and and I've done some rants on this in the past like I I feel they need to tell people like I'm a fan of technology when I was coming up as a kid like if anybody brought me any of this stuff I would I would be super excited horse and I'm cool with saying that you know but but yeah there is there is definitely a team aspect where people they want to belong to something I say belong to team technology if that's what you're into because the truth is these device is in these platforms push one another that the the positive things that happen in Android push iOS to be better in the positive things that happen in iOS push Android to be better and the same thing goes for laptops desktops really anywhere there's innovation having a little bit of competition is a positive thing
