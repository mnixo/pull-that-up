the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight if you go to Joe Rogan dotnet and click on the link for the flashlight and entering the code named Rogan you will get 15% off the number one sex toy for men a sex toy that Duncan Trussell my guest has put his penis into yeah but you did a dude only only 15 times 15 then you get tossed out and not by you yeah oh yeah that's happen I've got weird a lot of weird fleshlight stories I know having that around don't they a lot of them not all of them but there's a few women who look at that as almost like a minor league woman well they get yeah they get definitely get tossed I mean also they're the problem just gross to them it's it's I think it's also a little embarrassing cuz it's like yeah you don't want someone to open up your asshole and can when they come over okay what's this what does it can't oh there's an assholes this are large Foster's boobs are on it cube for a worker that must be so embarrassing you went came into your husband's office and there's flashlights everywhere yeah exactly well you got to hide him like yeah you got to hide them you can't leave them out in the open no one no one everyone knows that's not a Fosters can but they work so good it's so much better than beating off you know if everybody it's it's a weird thing to get behind because if everybody beats off why do you why is it so embarrassing to have like technology that aids you're beating on why is it a bear can I tell you my theory about how applies better than beating off because I think that over the course of evolution I think if at first beating off tricked your body into thinking you'd fucked you beat off your body got the same satisfied feeling you get when you fuck right and then body started ferrying out oh wait a minute is trick me we're not really reproducing and so then it makes it so when you jerk off feels great but it doesn't feel as good as fucking it's not the same you don't get that same feeling of like yeah I just had sex well you also you know I do a whole bit about it how you can feel your hand yeah problem you can't it's really hard to trick yourself but the fleshlight I think it tricks your body the animal part of your body and your body thinks you fucked cuz you know you should joint loads yeah you don't shoot the kind of you don't shoot the payloads beat-off loads are not as satisfying so you know you get up beat off load you're like that's it that's all I have in me that's it that's all I was able to muster up well it's funny when you're coming inside a fleshlight and guys I'm sorry to get dirty but when you're coming inside a fleshlight and you're you're pushing forward into the fleshlight and spraying jizz into it your body thinks it's getting something pregnant yeah your body really thinks it does yeah it's kind of sad and it really thinks it's getting a good specimen cuz it's tight and juicy like oh this is good genes here yeah this is a good vagina not the one you get the last one you gave me I mean I don't give you a bad one well I mean with all due respect it looks like Frankenstein it's a Halloween themed one it's a vagina that's got stitches what appears okay or no yeah [Laughter] anyway you go to Joe Rogan dotnet click that's the longest fleshlight commercial ever go to Joe Rogan dotnet click on the link and enter in the code name Rogan and you get 15% off and yeah it's silly yeah it's a silly thing but if you like beating off this is better and everybody likes beating off so go by stop playing we're also brought to you by Annette comm makers of alpha brain which is a point of contention on the Internet there's a lot of people who don't like the idea behind it a lot of people said is not and not enough science behind it I see a lot of your points I really do however people have been taking these these these plant compounds they've been taking these you know these different extracts from from plants for a long time I mean for there's like a recorded use of like velvet beans of thousands of years people been using it I don't know if it can have adverse effect anything because I'm not a fucking scientist but I've looked at it and it's it's worth it to me to take a chance I've looked at the the data and I know how to use some of the things like choline on Alzheimer's patients and man when I take it I I feel good it gives me a nice little a little bump or something and you know a lot of people say it doesn't do shit for them and other people have even said that it's makes it makes them sick like it makes them feel nauseous so I guess you know the human body look everybody is not the same some people can't drink coffee I fucking love coffee you know some people can't have milk they're lactose-intolerant I mean I don't know what what you know it's if something has an effect on you you know like this alpha brain stuff does it's got to not jive with everybody it's just that's the way it is there's no other way around it in my opinion probably you know I don't know what it would each person's individual sensitivities are but but I do know that for a lot of people it does a lot of good you know what's weird man is like what you're just saying like you know it's it probably interfaces with people's bodies differently and some of them might feel some nausea no pharmaceutical companies when they release products they know oh yeah there's gonna be like 600 people who get seriously fucked up from this shit because that's why they have to run that stuff in the commercials and the pharmaceutical commercials you know what they say may cause thoughts can you imagine releasing something like that into the world knowing oh yeah this is gonna kill some people so some people yeah that's the good and interesting point because it's like not everything is no one is exactly like someone else like as far as like how their body processes things we all know people who literally can't drink alcohol for whatever reason their body just doesn't process it right and they go fuckin off the wires right yeah and then we know you or I who can you know have a couple beers I've seen you drunk you're just dunking drunk you know you're you when you're drunk trying to trust yeah drunk you trust me well how about the thing he did me we've talked about this before but just if you haven't seen it you gotta go online and watch drunk history Duncan does this drunk history with Nikola Tesla and it's fucking brilliant they get him hammered where he's throwing up in a toilet and he's talking about the history of one of my personal heroes you know one of my shallow I don't want to say heroes but one of the the people that's been a fixture of my life one of my people the men that lived that I'm most fascinated by that Nikola Tesla so it's a fucking awesome thing we've talked about it before but go see it if you haven't see it go look it up on YouTube it's fucking awesome you know but yeah everybody's body's fucking different man you know some people some people can't smoke weed some people love it Dave Attell doesn't like it Doug Stanhope doesn't like it yeah yeah and this is brilliant people you know I love and respect him everybody's body is different man people some people can't eat fucking walnuts you know I have a friend candied walnuts well it doesn't bryan callen have a Brazil nut fucking thing don't like yeah he's got shit so very because you know sloppy kitchens are you get one no nothing your salad by mistake I mean there are names in there yeah I think Bryan Callen is allergic to Brazil nuts a pretty short said it I think it was him I don't want to have to ask but you know it's just some wacky shit man it's not it doesn't everybody's bodies on the same but all this stuff in alpha brain I think is relatively innocuous and I think if you don't like the effects of it you can get off of it it's real simple so if it it might not work for you and if you can I always say this and people say you don't really mean this I fucking do mean this what I'm about to say if you worry at all about how much I cross don't buy it just go look into nootropics try a bunch of the other shit what's that called stuff called piracetam that's a really interesting one there's a bunch of there's a focus factor that they have their own compound that they put together and there's a bunch of other ones man there's some interesting stuff it's interesting if I had nothing to do with this financially I would still tell you to try it out because it's fascinating and I've always endorsed nootropics I think I think there's some science behind it I think there's there's a there's not enough to like firmly state exactly what each one does unequivocably you know this is how you can measure it this is the exact dose it's not like you know I don't think it's that clean yet it's there's there's just a lot of anecdotal evidence that this stuff does something to enhance the way your brain works not not crazy it's not limitless it's not it's not a fucking magic pill it doesn't make retards intelligent it's it's just a little better I'm trying to not say read ours anymore oh yeah you're cutting that word out of your vocabulary just just to shut people up mana it's a it's a great word but you know automatically it becomes babies with Down syndrome right it becomes the worst possible definition for it all right you know you don't mean it like that though it's clear no I don't anyway if you go to music go to on it calm and enter in the code name rogue and try out for brain and what I was saying is if you don't if you just what I what I was saying that seems like I don't really mean but I really do mean if you think it costs too much go by the the quantities of the ingredients whatever the fuck is in alpha brain is we show it online just copy it copy it go buy the shit and try it out yourself or try one or two of them out yourself some of them you're not gonna like and some of them you might like I think you know it's it's a very interesting sort of a pursuit you know the pursuit of enhancing mental function through nutrients but I'm a big believer in vitamins and minerals I think it's it's enhanced my body and I'm very much in tune with my body because I eat well and I exercise and I think it's very important that you know you do that you've got to take care of the fucking machine that carries you around so for me I'm pretty tuned in to what my body feels like on a regular basis and because of that I can I can get a good feel of when something's helping me for real or something's a placebo effect you know it's it's a real fine line you know because quite honestly man possi bow is a powerful powerful effect and we don't really understand I wouldn't mind really placebos all day if they just rock my world you know I mean when you think about what the human body is really capable of and I'm not endorsing lying to people but I'm saying I mean think about what the effect of placebo is for a lot of people it's really fucking dramatic man they act as if they've gotten medicine you know cancer has been and I it's never been cured but tumors have shrunk you know uh that true look that up look that shrug I'm sure yeah I'm not a hundred percent sure heard that that's a good thing to look but I know that it's I know that there have been some substantial medical improvements because of the placebo effect it's a fascinating effect I wish someone could just possi about me all day I wish you just convinced me that I could go to some lady and she wipes me with a chicken's foot and you know and your your little liver heals up you know I wish that you know I wish it was possible to just trigger placebos left and right well somebody emailed me something else you could maybe check out Brian is that they think that it might be there might be you know there's natural cannabinoids in the brain yeah they think it's somehow associated with that the brain just releases these cannabinoids and it gives you a I'm just saying assholes with tumors on them mmm I'll take the way I'll take the word I'll take the word butthole out of it you always he a butthole to every google search it does this is a grown man anyway if you go to Joe Rogan then check out the link for @oh and the other thing is alpha brain if you

it's a fascinating thing and if you want to buy alpha brain go to honor taka work for me clear dreams the code name Rogan and you get 10% off that shit Duncan Trussell 'he's here let the music begin we're in the new death squad studio experienced trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night [Applause] I had a pink somebody on my board yesterday for complaining that I do the commercials before the podcast you know who's bitching about it stupid fuck go to the special ed room dummy it's ridiculous I'll give you a free podcast man I have to I have to do something to to monetize this bitch right yeah and bandwidth across money it's really fucking annoying when people give you those like those tight yeah look clean about something man I gave you something for two and a half hours for free and I'm just talking about you know a product for two minutes getting commercial man well here's a comment I just got on a YouTube video when I remember is really annoying what II's are the these are the fucking cock insult comments I have shelling out no they're the ones that start with a compliment but are passive the passive aggressive ones so this one was I liked for 20 minutes I took the paranormal activity you know how Paranormal Activity shows the crowd and doesn't show the movie so it's the crowd reacting to paranormal activity because yeah oh no and I thought well fuck man that's funny I wonder what that would look like if they were reacting to a Red Lobster commercial so I just put a Red Lobster commercial on top of them like freaking out over a scary movie and it came out kind of funny weird and so I put that up on my YouTube page and someone left the comments like well this is this is the only one of your videos that didn't make me laugh why would you even fucking say that it's like a compliment or a very nice compliment makes them adjust like a shitty jab you gave my check - well you know what it is is when you get on the Internet you're allowing yourself to interact with anybody anybody and everybody and you're not you don't you can't choose at all there's no choosing yeah any random person can just cut their way into your life just kind of store through your fucking life online yeah and it's not like a real commute I mean you can create a community online with a message board or something like that but and you could Twitter lists and shit like that like who you follow who you block but you know at the end of the day you know it's this is the boundaries between people are kind of separated all right and people just get at people and so YouTube comments are a perfect example of that you want to see like how the world is going you look at the YouTube comments at the YouTube comics were like well better luck next time and he seems like a cool guy it wasn't my kind of music but I can see how some people get like it that's a nice player eat shit drown in a river of a you faggot cunt ain't ya I mean do you see those over and over again in YouTube doesn't block them and it is a fascinating sociological experiment thousands of years from now if data still exists if you can still read off of our hard drives probably you won't be able to but whoever finds us in our archeological future the way we have found ancient Sumeria ancient Rome or you know any civilization that we've tried to piece together from information from the past they're gonna look at YouTube comments and they're gonna be like look at these crazy assholes look at these motherfuckers any any video that they go to what if they went to rebeccablack here's just a 13 14 year old girl talking about hanging out with their friends it had a song she's 14 years old man yeah she's a little girl you're not supposed to like that song if you're a fucking grown person but that song was assaulted by a fucking tsunami of shit yep you those comments and you look at like her 25 million hits or whatever the hell she had the comments on her videos are horrendous they're terrifying just fucking raw anger and all it is is just an easy target that's all it is it's just an open easy target what you're supposed to do you're not supposed to go this is fucking bullshit this is what passes for fucking music man no that's not what you supposed to we're supposed to do is go oh this isn't for me because I'm not 14 I'm not getting angry just move on with your life yeah but some people man they just want to get on that YouTube when you motherfucker yeah I want you to feel what I feel yeah they just went up sweaty they're sweaty fingers pecking Maki's I see people I got my message board all the time just get Kunti with somebody for no reason I just I'll just send them to the special ed room get out get out stop that you don't have to do that for no reason you know I've never Chitty with as far as I can recall I've never left of what shitty fucking car I don't think the time to leave a shitty comment so silly I mean single yeah I've gotten a bunch of those but what people don't understand about flame wars is it's kind of like a competition you know it's sort of like the dozens you know like you play the dozens you know if you don't know it is it's like you know your mama's so fat you know would you sit down people think she's a sofa you know and you go back and forth you insult each other you know I mean like it's like a big thing like with the brothers they love they love to play the dozens that's what it's called but that's sort of like what flame wars are it's like it's kind of fun that we're all anonymous right and so you kind of like just up to your wits it's just you and your wits against somebody else in their wits and all of a sudden you get in some content with someone online and you want to fucking you wants it back yeah my words carefully here fuck you up bitch I love watching it as a sport I like watching like smart people like go back and and the really kunti thing to do is to have a sentence and then respond with a big chunk and then another sentence and restraint a big chunk where it's like you're taking a little it's such a bully move where you're taking like little a sentence a little tiny segment of what someone said in not in the greater context of several paragraphs of writing but just one little sense and then they'll respond to it with like a river of shit yeah and you go back and forth and back and forth I've done that I've done it's stupid I don't do it anymore I occasionally I do but for the most part I just try to be silly with it but in the past man I've gotten involved in like long flame wars with people that went on for days well I mean if you think of it like imagine if YouTube had existed when Buddha incarnated on the planet so I keep it like upload his ideas onto YouTube it would still have shitty comments like what a fucking joke you idiot what are you talking about life is suffering go sit under the tree some more bagging I did with you what do you what you here's that though I mean don't you have a little bit of an instinct to say the same thing life is suffering Oh profound one please please ponder on when you get your dick sucked is that suffering no no no it's not when you're in an awesome movie that's not when you're on stage you're killing is that so wait but let me know let me know when you hold on when you're hanging out with your friends is it suffering no it's not if you have a nice current it's comfortable and you get a good stereo and the great song comes on is that suffering no no it's not Buddha Buddha's life sucked because Buddha didn't have cool shit or cool friends no that's wrong yes Joe he had the whole tons of chick bucks and actually said that's wrong well no that's knows what those Buddha go way back but you got this history's very vague but my relationship with my ex I know but the thing when you're saying Buddha at a shitty life there there's the story of Buddha and Buddha started off as a very wealthy prince and there was a problem what year I have no idea that life sucked it doesn't matter I don't care was a core 600 BC ad and a harem pr2 here yes that's good stinky girls with no razors not a razor in sight everybody's discussed there at that time as they're all scratching for food listen harem get the fuck out of here listen man it was a terrible time to live terrible no internet no cell phones no refrigerator no vaccines no fucking right u.s. military presidents overseas listen is a terrible goddamn time to live fuck Buddha his ideas ridiculous life is not suffering life can be no the rest of the Noble Truths Oh promise you're right you're right you just said noble fight I know but this was protecting a human could ever say do you know the noble truth I understand no problem I'm just fucking around here these are just jokes don't get personal he takes it very personal shit on boot every now and just to get a rhino just cuz you sound like you don't know what it is you could pick on Duncan and he won't even fight back are you talking about Buddha with a fucking kick you but it would be like big-time Dugga Dugga be like me making fun of the UFC and being like you know cuz their fight they fight eight rounds and then you'd be like well no they don't know rules like that where you where you're like it's that clear like you clearly have no you don't know what it is well dude it's a brother brother I'm telling jokes man I'm not don't believe any of this shit I'm saying well you everything everything Buddha's a loser whoo yeah you know holy gonnigan the whole truth about your fuck did you really believe in him all I'm saying is that I wouldn't want to live back then I wouldn't either I'm not saying that Buddha was wrong when he said life is suffering it just sounds a little pretentious if somebody said it today life is suffering I would want to probably kick them in the butt there's three other things after that okay good so this the second one is the cause of suffering is attachment to things staying the way they are the idea that things aren't going to change so life is suffering in other words you're suffering when you think things don't change oh so what I did is basically the exact same thing that I criticized people doing on the message boards well they take one line the rest of it I don't even listen to their whole sentence I took one one line and I just attacked Buddha and Fox I don't really mean anything things I say I say I really do our Buddhas I have a fucking Buddha tattoo in my arm come on man I'm fascinated by Buddha's it's one of the things I first saw during psychedelic experiences the Great Buddha made of light yeah a Golden Buddha in the lotus position and then there was like infinite numbers of them around them like fractals golden Buddha's in a lotus position was one of the craziest experiences of my life it's a cool religion man cuz it's uh it's it's a viral religion which is it's very different from a lot of other world religions like Christianity and Islam that kind of come into a place and try to change what's happening in the place to conform to Christianity Buddhism goes into a place and like analyzes whatever the belief system is in that place and then incorporates that into the philosophy of Buddhism so you get these vastly different forms of Buddhism all over the planet like and I like Tibetan if you look at Zen Buddhism and then you look at Tibetan Buddhism they couldn't be more different and Zen Buddhism is very austere if you look at a Zen monastery the walls I've never been in one but though the walls are made of rice paper and like it's like these guys fucking sitting there meditating for like just spinning their whole life meditating it's very very stark didn't you look at Tibetan Buddhism and it's like golden Buddha's and prayer wheels and prayer flags and it's like this bright beautiful thing and the reason is is when Buddhism came to Tibet there was a religion called banh bo n that was the original religion and it just took that religion and transformed it so that it embodied the Noble Truths of Buddhism Wow just hybrid dihybrid yeah that's what it does it infects or infects probably wrong word but it gets into a culture and then just the context is a great word that's what I mean it's is it's sort of a negative word yeah well I mean that is what it is it kind of it's viral it like gets into the DNA of a thing and then transforms it into Buddhism that's fascinating it's fascinating it really is you know it I've always wondered like what the boundaries of meditation are because I don't really have the time to be sitting around all day meditating but I always feel like anything like even the isolation tank which is very much like a symptom or rather a method of meditation the isolation tank you the more you do it the better you get at it right the more you relaxed you get when you're you're inside the easier it is for you to let go the easier it is for you to get to that really crazy deep state so I would assume that with meditation just like with anything with music or martial arts the more time you spend out it the better you get out I would wonder what what the fuck can you do with your brain if you have like 10 12 hours a day cuz you know any Bravo has this friend of his he went to Egypt with this lady and she was a Kundalini aficionado like a serious devotee of Kundalini Yoga and this lady did yoga all fuck a day and what she said was that it was all about stimulating particular areas of your brain that can produce psychedelic chemicals and that what you're trying to do is like open up your chakras and you can tune in to higher frequencies of consciousness and that these people say that at the highest levels that these these people are capable of putting themselves into a psychedelic state absolutely naturally so like what you would have to do by taking mushrooms or taking peyote or whatever they can just meditate and get there and they travel in their mind to like distinct different places and the idea is that what they're doing is they are literally changing the form of their mind if you look at the mind of a person who meditates you know a Buddhist monk you know a person who meditates 10 12 hours a day the way their brain works is different right what the size of different areas of the brain is different the when they look at the activity in the mind yeah different than a regular person's brain yeah I've seen that stuff yeah fascinating so you you mean they were tuning in to a higher like a higher plane of consciousness if that is what they're doing that they're able to do just like I mean what we see in marathon running just like what we see in everything you know like could you run a marathon I couldn't run a fucking marathon could you imagine if you had to run a marathon right now against one of those skinny guys from Africa that runs barefoot fuck you're fucked you're never gonna run as fast that's you're never gonna catch I'm never gonna be able to run 26 miles as fast as him but he can do it and know what that means you could probably do it too but it doesn't start like that it starts with you run one mile all right and you learn to run five miles and you build yourself up so you can run 26 miles barefoot but most people can't just do do that right from the jump that's gotta be the same way with meditation because I know that when I meditate I can get into a really good state just when I'm alone I'm alone in a hotel room I'll do like yoga and I'll do and then I'll meditate I'll go into a certain pattern of breathing and I'll focus and concentrate on my breath and when I do that I can achieve a good perspective I can achieve like a good objective look at and I can I can relieve myself of you know any unnecessary concerns and you know and I'm like I I'm pretty good at that but I would imagine that if you really devote yourself to really just concentrating on achieving like the the the possibilities of this different states of consciousness I think - I think - you'd be able to get high I I did this thing because I I studied I had to do this I studied religion and psychology in school so I got to do an internship at a Zen temple and part of the internship is you do this thing called a saw scene which is where you sit for like three days straight it's just staring at this wall for three days straight in the lotus position and do this and then you do well I went to do it and I I made it through I think like 11 hours of meta and I made it through you sleep like four hours then the next day you wake up and I meet you eat and then you go right back into meditating and so I made it I don't know I made it a pathetically small length of time because it was snowing outside and I started thinking about how good a beer would be something about the snow me like man I love to drink a beer but like I'm but during the time that I was staring at the wall I don't know like six hours in or it's some certain amount of time in they start doing this thing called the heart sutra they start chanting this thing called the heart sutra and it go and I don't remember the exact way it goes but it's something like no mind no body no life no death no beginning no it's very psychedelic it's very droney and it's a negation of everything no mind no bloody thing say it again this is not an exact rendition but as I recall it's like no mind no body no life no death no beginning no it's it's and they say this all together yeah yeah they all start chanting it it's dope and you've been staring at a wall let's go together six I don't know though no line you look nobody without no mind nobody exactly show death let's just try it no yeah no no body no life no death no my no body no life no no imagine that but you yes is something weird about that man what is weird about that plate look up the Heart Sutra on YouTube and play it right there sighs are we're stoned as fuck but listen but what is weird about like chance man let's do do buddy no my no body no life no no my no buddy no life no death there's something weird about that dude there's something zone II there's something hypnotic about any stupid chant even that you want to hear something super tripping I think you could play it legally it's because it's a it's a chant could you look up the Lotus Sutra on YouTube Lotus Sutra the Lotus Sutra listen to this one as well so fucking trippy yeah I mean what were they're trying to do they're trying to put themselves into a state of consciousness by a by humming lit like that yeah it's gotta be the one I'm looking so though I'll show you the one Brian hold on oh yeah that one at the very top the Lotus Sutra play the first one with the blue flower right there listen to this I love listen I'm high [Music] now murió Africa bellowed and that was the sixteen hundreds version of beatbox that's crazy I'm scared that if they keep going Candyman it's gonna come out a scream okay we get it yeah it's cool man it's really trippy how odd yeah it's almost like country music don't lean on what they don't know but if you listen to some of the like shaggy says she Bobo the the ayahuasca ceremonies if you listen to the channing of the people in the Amazon it sounds very similar to that it's the same kind of like droney thing that has within it that feeling of like a twangy weird light uh-huh I don't know like something from New Orleans bluesy AMA very strange and how many different people are doing that you think it's not one person right that is no that's a group of people how many think we're doing the sound like a team did everybody have the same job that's what I'm saying are they all saying the same thing or whether these other people do different harmonies and stuff when you do that chant yeah that's what I'm thinking it's because it doesn't sound like you could like you know I don't know I mean maybe you could mean sure you could like think of what the noises that that Michael Winslow guy makes I mean you probably could do it but it doesn't seem like that seems like a couple different things are being said at the same time is that right oh yeah no no it's one suture it's they're reading a scripture they're reading this thing called the Lotus Sutra which is this whole weird so they're all saying the same thing they're all making the same noises yeah I think so man I did it does seem like there's some girl the girl the opera girl sounding girl yeah there was an opposite to me maybe what she played again because it seemed to me that it was like a couple different sounds that are [Music] you're holding gecko know what I do now they're singing the same thing you're saying it really fast it's but there's like a hum to it that makes you think right it might be something going on in the background but it's not they're hitting up every now and then there's like a little intersection but it's yeah it's a harmony every now and then though someone will break oh yeah they're starting at different times they're saying the same shit but they're yeah and they're trying to catch up if you guess while Sherman this would be Univ a trip I know what are you talking about you'd get all the knowledge in the universe I think that would make just shit go crazy run over you like a river it's diamond encrusted fish be able to catch so much knowledge but you wouldn't build a grasp it yeah fuck you trip up this is nam-myoho-renge-kyo that's where nam-myoho-renge-kyo comes from that's the nam-myoho-renge-kyo comes from the Lotus Sutra so when you hear the beginning of it it's myoho renge Kyo open pond on EVPs that saundra semi under Nicki goes wow how did you memorize all that shit well but why the chance in a strangulation yeah eight months and I don't even have I don't have the whole thing memorized I just have the different but you have some parts I have the up until there's liked it there's two different prayers you don't have the first and I can almost do that completely without the book and then the second one I have to do the book if I'm there if there's like a but what up how did all this get started I mean you look at like how bizarre all that is and I'll psychedelic that religion is how the hell'd that get started what's that what's the history well that's the fucking question man I mean you've got this this the Buddha who according to the story wanted to be an ascetic like one it will live with his live with his uh Buddha live live with a king he there was a prophecy he's either gonna be a great Conqueror so this is a real human being absolutely proven by history ah man I think so I mean more more approvable than Jesus or love I couldn't answer that I have no idea I mean it doesn't mean it's like it's not that much of a consideration because there's so many scriptures that come from it there's clearly something there and it's like there are a bunch of interpretations I don't know but the story's closed there's still that it's not like it's in Buddhism it's different from Christianity Christianity some forms of Christianity they're like you must believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God they have to believe that for the magic toward Buddhism isn't quite like that Buddhism is more like test all of this like test it like you would be too if you're buying gold like you would weigh and measure and test gold because you need to logically understand what this is it that you have to logically it has to logically make sense to you and this is Zen Buddhism that's some decision that's not all forms of it sounds like there's a great so you were you were telling me I'm sorry I left you before you were explaining that he lived with a king yeah he was the prince and the king didn't want him to because the the the Prophet said he'll either be the war hatha god of the wheel Turner like this great prophet that he was or he's gonna be this Conqueror like he's gonna be like a world conqueror and so his father was like well fuck that I don't want him to be a fucking prophet I want him to be a world conqueror so I'm going to keep him locked up on the grounds of the palace and give him everything he wants you know a harem whatever he wants he can have and so the story is he was out with his like I don't know he was out riding around he saw three sites and I don't remember exactly what they were but why I know one was a dying man one with alone one with a corpse he saw a corpse and a diseased man and an ascetic he saw these three things and he's like oh there's I'm more in there all this pleasure that I'm getting and the pal is temporary temporary it's not gonna last I'm gonna get old I'm gonna die I'm gonna get diseased these are the this happens everyone there's no escape from this happens to everyone so I would write so these pleasures I'm experiencing I would rather figure out a way to have lasting permanent realization than this temporary transient shit so he went and became an ascetic and he he like starved himself to the point of death almost because he was like point he was like did everything in the extreme so there's like statues of like starving Buddha yeah I've seen those yeah you you you told me about that yeah because you know that I have this thing about collecting Buddhist tattoos and I've got a couple of Thai Buddhist and shit and then you you told me about this starving Buddha I was like what are you talking about you sent me a picture dude I almost thought it was a joke no this thought you were like height on his face he's not eating anything because he's trying to go the route of the aesthetic to to uh so that he could you know have realization and Bryan pull one of those pictures up man it's fucking cool of a starving Buddha cuz they're creepy as fuck man I never had heard about this before oh it's cool man it's how long did he do this in his life I don't know that time because every and everyone has a story all the doors of the story yeah this is it this is it all starts with this store and so then he um so that didn't work out so and then he he ate and you know the aesthetics rejected him the aesthetics rejected him because he was eating and yeah he got really close to death that way I think there's a full body one Bryan if you back up there's a there's some other ones that have like full body well either way you see you get a get the picture that's creepy who the fuck would want to keep that in their house huh I wish if you go over to chicks house and she's got that starving Buddha in her house fucking a run bro but run why would you want to look at that all day I wouldn't oh you can see the veins and his ribs it's creepy yeah you don't want to look at it that's barely that's like a cartoon he's an old tranny it's like he's about to eat imagine the day has come he's an old Tralee starving tranny giant bull come mmm speaking of come anyone was fun huh have a good time anyway speaking of commie with England it's fun what happened well no ego I'll tell you this oh no you came on Joe not really I mean he sort of did well Joe's fast fast like Buddha we went we went to a strip club for ten minutes yeah it was right next to the restaurant with this bomb ass Indian restaurant in Birmingham and then we add would stop it at this place it's a disaster well yeah yeah well good know wasn't dad it's just oh no there are people coming up here take your picture yeah but it was just so who's the weirdest strip club ever and I'm trying to be as nice as possible the best way to say it is you'd be kind of shocked those girls are strippers you know one that seems like there were other vocations that would have been better choices for them yeah yeah it seems like when they're guiding me here I was telling him what to do he should have said stripper anyway nice nice people but well is we could we you know we can do we got in there we thought we were gonna be able to sit down and just have a beer and just laugh and giggle you know for a little bit and then leave but we're getting bombed on yeah it was pretty sick I mean it wasn't even like when I go to strip clubs aside from like the fact of like seeing hot naked girls dancing the other thing I like is the they eat a darkness yeah you know saying this yeah ninis in the darkness because it's funny to me cuz it's all a this is a cultural this is a result of a specific type of culture it's a it's and like this wouldn't work if people weren't sexually repressed this wouldn't work if people didn't wear clothes there's like so many weird cultural things that have to happen for a strip club do you even make sense so when you go into there and you see like you see the the fucking weird relationship between the women who are trying to act dirty and slutty and then the guys who are kind of like feel like they're breaking the rules it's like it really is nothing it's like you're looking at a naked girl mounting a fucking pole you're getting a lap dance it's it's just I went to a strip club wants a Phil Hartman Phil Hartman was I wish more people got to see what that dude was like without being like mister like clean family you know he was like he was like super concerned about his image right but outside of that he would say like ridiculously dirty shit man he was always telling you to smell his fingers and saying it was claiming it was different people in the cast that he fits like it was ridiculous he was really funny I mean to the point where they would get mad at him you know and he cracked me up man he would he was a serious blazer phil heartman used to get high every day dude especially after work like he was very professional but after work he would get blazed dude get blazed and go out on a spoke then I went to a strip club with him once I've never seen a guy who's because he was such a great guy who was so expressive and he was a genuinely like friendly guy and this is a different era okay we're talking about the early 1990s it was like 1995 you know and it was like you know he was there and the girl was dancing in front of him and he was like like there was no shame in it at all he was so happy he was so happy and he was looking I just goes hey just remember forget his face look at him oh yeah that's beautiful that's beautiful he was like smiling like beautiful like you're beautiful whoo like he was just happy it wasn't creepy yeah no that's great it was a good I like looking at a gross vagina and asphalt Wow and I look I fuck it's beautiful I love people like that I feel hurt that guy when he died that hurt that sucked that was a tough one he was a he was a really good guy man that was a tough one did I ever tell you I found out there was a girl who I think she worked for like was one of those tabloid shows we'd went out on one date but just you know for whatever reason just didn't click so I was at home and it was like 8 o'clock in the morning the phone rings it's her and I'm like what's going on why you called me at 8 o'clock in the morning and she's like you don't know I go one and she was I don't want to be the first one to tell you I go will fucking tell me what happened and then she goes Phil's dead I go Phil Hartman and she goes yes she goes it was a murder-suicide I want whoa but first of all I thought he killed her and then killed himself you thought that first yeah I mean I mean so you hear murder-suicide you just automatically think men are the ones who commit violent crimes that's how I automatically assume I don't think that I think crazy bitches are crazy and they have a fucking shoot I always think I'm going to get shot by a girl I'm dating cool that you draw from has been peed in I mean just assume I mean don't you when you hear about a murder-suicide you assume that it was the man I know I actually really wow you're so nice and you're not violent at all that's why I don't hang out with crazy guys like I bet you cuz you hang out with fighters and a bunch of you know jujitsu guys you're around a different kind of animal than I'm used to I mean guys I have very fun stop cards yeah jujitsu guys are very friendly man you'd be amazed first of all their ego gets squashed real early cuz he get tapped out a lot when you learn jujitsu especially in the early years you have to have a healthy ego or you'll never get through being a white belt being a white belt is demeaning men manhandle you you know it's I remember my first time I was training at Carlsen Gracie's on Hawthorne Street in 1996 I first started doing jujitsu and there was this kid who's a purple belt this brazilian kid he fucking raped me just crush me every time we roll and it drove me nuts because he wasn't any bigger than me he was my size he was my age we were the same and he would just fucking manhandle me dude would just toss me around and strangle me and I remember thinking like man I can't believe that it's so easy for someone to do this to me and then I knew like this guy was only a purple bout he wasn't even a black belt like fuck like that feeling is not a good feeling the feeling of getting your ass kicked like that and gym is it's not a good feeling but the only way to get good is you to get used to that you got it you got a roll with good guys if you don't roll with good guys you don't know whether or not you can really tap them you don't know whether or not your shit only works on people who suck you got to get tapped you got to get in the beginning you gotta get strangled all the time people gotta throw you around they're gonna dominate you so if you can get through that usually your egos are really in check jiu-jitsu guys are some of the friendliest nicest most easygoing guys that I've ever been around kick boxers are a little more edgy and one of the reasons is kick boxers they don't go full-out in the gym they sort of go they go hard but there's always like you're going too hard like there's a thing that happens in stand-up gyms it doesn't happen as much happens occasionally but not as much in jiu-jitsu and that's someone going too hard because in stand-up it's always an issue because you're not really fighting you have big gloves on the gloves are 16 ounces as opposed to four and when you're you know a eight or ten if you're kickboxing but when when you're throwing at each other you're supposed to be pulling back a little you know yeah so guys are always like yeah if I didn't pull back into the fucking knock your ass out there's some unresolved issues with some guys so they some of them tend to be a bit more douchey it's like the and then that the the more like limited their sport is the more insecure they are and the more douchey like boxers are more douchey than kick boxers or more douchey and there's all generalizations but but for the most part jiu-jitsu guys and wrestlers seem to be like the most easygoing they go at it all the time you know you you you blow out all the the stress out of your system and all that you know all that ego shit especially the jujitsu just kidding you get tapped all the time you got to accept it yeah man it's spooky when you run into people who have a shitload of pent-up aggression yes very The Grove and I had parked wasn't the greatest parking job ever I'll admit it was a shitty parking job I'm getting in my car and this old man is standing there looking he's like why did you park like that and so it's forcing this weird confrontation in a parking lot and I and the guys you know that thing when you get around someone and like you can feel your like goosebumps something like they're thinking about hitting you or zone yeah like your body's telling you like this is not a good situation that was happening and it's like this old man I'm like this could be that thing where the the guy's got a gun and he just this is where it pops this is where the volcano explodes and I end up getting blasted Oh bang and they catch it in the background of Mario Lopez's I show ya doing somebody an old man that's the worst people fuckin like that all the time people get smoked all the time by people yeah I have these little volcano blows wrong place at the wrong time has a real switch it's a real scenario III the other day I was driving and there was a biker in the road and he was like doing one of those things where he was like wobbling it like I think the guy was drunk or something like and I just like kind of tried to go around him and then I just I did a I didn't do the horn the whole way I did like I did that you know they could just barely touch it and make some noise you know not even loud at all he's like screaming free you know where I never saw that Boulder Boulder Colorado you know why hundred thousand people that's why that's how you're supposed to live you're not supposed to live like this but man everybody's holidays I'm sure you know there's some agro bikers in LA man I said I saw it remember that guy just sooo many people fucking people in LA your your crate you're taking a huge risk if you're riding a bike places I mean I see no right to do it and I'm cautious of bikes I try to be cautious but wow I look at them I'm like what a crazy risk you're taking dude I've seen so many hipster bike accidents in Silver Lake oh we were walking down the sidewalk and you see a you know first it's a lot of record store they're like they were biking one hand and a couple of books and then you come up to like fucking hipster having a seizure I've seen a hipster on the sidewalk seizing up as the ambulance came surrounded all library books and oh my god weird like lace oh no crash no helmet on no helmet oh no helmet crashes and just but I saw I saw a fucking minivan just pull into a parking lot and wasn't paying attention to just t-boned a biker oh oh my 12 just just fucking dangerous so I understand why bikers here a freak out but do you remember that guy the comedy store there was a biker that used to ride up and down Sunset and he was this super aggro biker fucking ripped and I saw a guy yell at him in his car like what you did a comic no so just some bicycle or used to hang out as always they're always there he was always pissed he's always screaming at traffic and I remember like some car was like watch out because he's just weaving in and out of traffic and the guy just stops his bike because I don't think people realize that with bikers we're so used to in cars there's this like I can get away from you I grow something a bicycle er can weave through traffic at a stoplight and just attack you like they can get you we forget that there's no enclosure yeah yeah people have like gotten used to like to delay in violence between cars where you like it well fuck you work I'm gonna get out of the car fucking get all the way to you you know those guys an open fucking air and he's like weaving in and out of Sunset Boulevard traffic and he's deranged and so some idiot says something to him and the guy this is what he's been waiting to happen he like stops his bike turns and looks at the guy and not does he just hear he meant this he's like I'm gonna put you in the hospital I'm gonna break your fucking jaw is what he said and was just such venom and evil and anger spewing out of this he didn't he didn't there's people yeah you can't be a cunt there's people that want to punch people your brother Joe and your cuds yeah but I mean isn't it interesting that we have this sort of escalated anger that exists in inside cars because we don't have to socially interact with each other we don't have to like feel it yeah you know we don't have to feel the repercussions of social repercussions of being a shithead so people just get so elevated in cars they pop so I see it like SUVs I don't think I could ever go back down to like a small little car cuz II feel more protected as yeah the shit goes down you just run the person over and go over and you know a couple cars and xscape you watch too many movies the fuck you talking about yeah it's weird how you just assume but it's funny also the things that people say when they're in cars there's a video of Nick Diaz and he had missed a press conference and he was supposed to go and fight George Sam Pierre but they pull from the fight because he missed a couple of press conferences so he made a video about it and this is a video like a public video and he's in his car and as he's driving making this video he someone won't let him in he's like let me let me in fuck your mother fuck your mother when people say shit like that that's funny man because he wouldn't say fuck your mother if you were right in front of him with your like some lady but you know but if you're like if it's a lady and she's in a car in front of you you don't even have to worry about hurting their feelings you can say the most ruthless shit dude when I'm driving I try to chant to relax so I do yes I do so I'll be chanting when I'm driving like what occasionally I'm driving through traffic I hate driving so I'm chanting to relax and inevitably someone will cut me off and in the middle of chanting like this what's really there you dude that's a joke you should say fuck yeah that's hilarious you should talk about that on stage you could you could go far with that cause that's cool that's cool yeah yeah well that's the unavoidable stress of living in cities there's too much tension this is not healthy you know we're all we're all redlining everywhere yeah it's so weird in small communities are nicer it's just you you know y'all you deal with are you used to deal with in the age before the internet you dealt with a lot more small-minded people you dealt with a lot more religious wackos if you wanted to live in the little in the middle of nowhere it's tough to get away from the really really religious people you know what man I had a speaking of religious people I had a real American moment today where I was like man this is a pretty good country I was cuz that cuz like you know the inception at Birth thing that just got overturned you know about this no what is up so I can't can you see where it was man was in my camera where it was he looked at say for me Oh turret tilt the logo of your mic towards you yeah you're talking to the Scioto no no that logo in the front there's a thing on the on the mic see like this yeah see it's around here if I look at the part where it's written and the point that towards your face see it yeah yeah I got it there you go oh that's so much better hello there you go you're back so I yeah man it's like personhood at conception yeah I think that's what's called it's called person so I like it's this thing where they want it basically they want to say that I can't really the exact words for they have exact word for it I can't remember the term it's it again can set like say look up conception personhood at conception or it's the ideas like when you can't win can set when conception happens when this when when the fucking eggs are in the uterine wall and are fertilized by a sperm that is now a human being that's a person so they were trying to pass that which would make all forms of abortion illegal and maybe even birth control depending on like how you look at it I so anyway it got overturned the voters overturned it and they were thinking it wouldn't get overturned but it was like super religious fundamentalists were trying when you say overturn you mean it passed it didn't pass and they thought it was gonna there it is well isn't overturned means something person it's passed and then overturned know that I'm sorry it didn't get voted for it didn't make it in it was a measure it didn't get voted for it lost and people were saying it was gonna it was gonna win so it was cool the political system in that one case worked where they thought it wouldn't scary shit scary shit well you know it's also scary when when you think about what abortion really is you know that's scary to me this you're you're taking a baby you're sucking out of your pussy with a vacuum too expensive well there's different you know what man I'm there's a lot of versions of abortion that I think are fucking horrible and I and I I totally am NOT for but there's some there is definitely cases where shit where should happen and you not only that how about you know it's up to the person who's carrying that baby inside of them until the baby's born it's up to them I mean I think if you know if you have an aborted kid that's perfectly healthy and it's like six months old inside your body like that's kind of crazy but I know that people have done that in the past I think if it's not for a medical reason it's not you know and I don't know if they'd it's those fucking partial birth abortions you know about those right yeah they ice pick the fucking brain of the baby it's a baby I mean that's I think that's that's not that definitely shouldn't have that's crazy that's crazy it's almost like I don't see it you know yeah I don't see it I don't see yeah I know he's talking about just put a blanket on your baby why don't you give birth of thing and covered in a blanket it is a kit since it's inside the pussy yeah I don't see me sticking the ice pick in its head so fine it's okay it was outside and I jabbed it in front of you and then chopped it up into pieces you'd be like you just killed the war if it came out for a second and you put it back in couldn't do it same baby but if you pulled it out of the vagina and put it back in you couldn't ice pick it once it been in the air yeah the rule is once it's been in the air you can't kill it's a person then it's alive yeah that's fucked up that doesn't make sense easy is it yeah it's really straight I mean and you know it's this is a taboo subject this is a subject you're supposed to if you're a rational open-minded person you're supposed to just favor choice you know which I do yeah I mean I don't think any should be I think it's a real slippery slope it's a real slippery slope when someone tells you what you can and can't do with your body you know it it seems like you're killing a baby but I guess you should be able to do it you know well these are in it's it's yes we've discussed this before it seemed much easier when it's a small couple cells it's much easier to rationalize it's on its way to being a baby you know well just it depends on where the thing is you know and it depends on it depends on a lot of different things it's like everyone wants to make these sweeping things like one one the two sides of it are it should all the two extreme sides are it should be it should be illegal no matter what even if a rapist impregnated the woman and the baby's gonna kill her then it she should have that baby well raise the baby up to his name so his name Lord Jesus Christ was raised that rapist on his cross and he could be the next president now that's hear it very stumble what's that you see Rick Perry stumble yeah awesome hilarious it was such a fuckin it was uncomfortable to watch that was hilarious the thing that you don't know that yeah you forgot you don't know that you forgot that yeah you're running for president how the fuck are we gonna let you keep track of the world's military presence isn't he the executioner isn't Rick Perry the one who had like shit loads of people he executed in Texas in Texas yeah he fried he's leaving controversial one he sends him to the fryer yeah they send a lot of them to the fry which listen if people can't I kind of like that I like getting rid of them but I don't trust the political system the problem yeah that's the duck that is it yeah that's number one Rick Perry's that you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet kind of guy it's like if I got to fucking kill a couple of nice people to fry a bunch of assholes then well that's the price you pay for for liberty yeah he is one of those guys right yeah that's what he's like he's a you know he's a he's a he's a fucking assholes what he is man I mean you can't that it's like that's the main thing until we perfect the system the death the the government the legal system you can't have the death penalty you can't it's not part of being a citizen of the United States does not mean that you've gotta risk being falsely imprison and executed because the legal system isn't perfect that's wrong you dint you can't give the ultimate punishment unless you've really perfected the system yeah until we know like till we know a hundred percent I know there's way better methods now they've ever been before when you include genetics and yeah I've watched CSI I'm pretty sure I'm up to what they're up to but still is still fuckin there's a lot doubt in some cases is this in this also fucking shady cops man there's people who plant evidence they plant evidence it happens all the time you know it's it's not something that's never taken place in the history of man it is most certainly taking place it's been proven so you you gotta know your system is fucking airtight and it's just not also what if someone actually reforms yeah while they're in prison what if someone is actually now a good person are you still gonna kill him depends on what they did if they kill people they say they killed someone yeah I'm biblical on that man your Sharia on that yeah my friend of Sharia law I think there's that there's certain justifiable homicides you know I think I believe in that I believe in if someone's trying to kill you like I heard this story who told me this star was a youth about the death metal band yeah yeah you tell me tell me the story you told me on the plane yeah okay so here's the story there's a perfect example of justified there's a documentary on norwegian death metal that I saw in Netflix oh if I fuck up the story for death metal fans out there I apologize I'm gonna tell it as best as I can remember it but so the idea is there's it's uh it's about Burzum they're basically it's about this group you know like how like where did punk form did Pont were in in the UK other so punk forms and there's like a group of like punk bands wherever there's an art movement there's a group of artists who are like the core of them of the movement or even than like music you know like with gangster rap there was NWA there's a bunch of to you yeah right and they all kind of form together so Norway's answer to that is Norwegian death metal or these fucking guys decide that they're gonna go hardcore and be like truly truly as dark as you can get terrible people terrible well they like so they started burning down churches they started going through the countryside burning down churches and one in in one of the bands one of the band members was so depressed because he's in the death metal and that's all they think about his death that he goes back to his house puts a gun in his mouth and blows his brains out and the other guy in the band comes to the house sees his dead body takes a picture of his fucking head and uses that as the cover their next house fucking a hardcore man so they're burning down churches and Burzum Burzum hears that this other guy who is this competitor or these he was it had some history where the ear that this guy was saying yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna kill I'm gonna kill him I'm just gonna kill him and he was bragging about he's gonna kill him so this guy's like oh well okay he wants to kill me he's going to kill me so I'm gonna have to kill him first and he got in his car and he drove to where the guy was he I can't execute it the guy he killed him he went to jail is in jail in Norway Oh play Burzum receiving his life sentence wait to see this can we play that on YouTube so he gets like not live sentences the movie Brian powers here I'm noticing this before we is how would you have me reversed you have my left hand my right hand in my right hand my left hand yeah it's so freaking me out it's it's so that they look like each other that's cool oh that's so bizarre yeah yeah look up Burzum received sentence and it's really weird cuz the guy gets like a 27-year sentence in prison cuz I felt like in given Norway and he does it yeah and he gives the creepiest smile whoa he just so how many years has he been in for I I think I don't know I I don't follow death-metal that much you can only get 27 years nothing right you do nothing like that god I feel like I'm sorry man you guys if I know I feel like I've thrown out some like wonky facts we have a fuzzy Burzum be urz um Vlad Vlad something friggin s or something Vlad freakness let me see yeah that's him what is it that's a guy they were burning down churches man they were burning down these antique wooden churches weakness Leedom for overlock drop it Allah grant important for human calluses salty kuru golem also achieved a bargain of what foster for it's possible selves to Detroit inspire own you like it that's gets fuckin prison in Norway is like a country club is it really oh yeah man it's nice do they've got nice prisons there really yeah it's not like the u.s. prisons they Norway's got this really fucking intense ethic about reforming people they really want to reform people their prison systems are based on Reformation rather than revenge like in the United States it's like exacting punishment we must punish you we were going to take it out of your hide there they're like look let's try to fix them maybe there's a way to make it so that they don't go back into society you know as criminals though we might be able to just fix them you know fix the problem Wow cuz I mean the death penalty you don't have how do you feel about that I think it's genius you think it does it work I don't know I don't know that you know one of the works it's great you know when we were in England do you remember there was a moment where like I was talking with a crowd about how polite people are in England like it's crazy like this is so different than America yeah the way people act the way people behave the crowds are just so different and in Norway they're probably like pretty nice folks for the most bet right I mean if this is what they're trying to do yeah you know I mean think how nice and friendly people are in England and this is probably it's probably real similar in Norway it's almost like that system has to be in place almost from the get-go it's like once you get as rotten as the the prison system that we have today to take those people and just shove them into country clubs and make everything nice and fun and easy yeah well we but we don't the thing is man we there's so many other you know there's the what do they call what it does do you think that would ever possibly work well you have to I think you have to mix in some pharmaceuticals you have to be able to legally give them mushrooms and psychedelics in combination with like really radical therapies to reform them and I were not fun the way they're thinking yeah and you can't do that now you can't do that now but they used to Timothy Leary was doing it with a Alpert they were doing experiments with reforming prisoners and they were going to jails and eat mushrooms with the prisoners they would trip with the prisoners whoa yeah and it was you know it's it's anyone who's done a psychedelic if you think about it like oh yeah this could really this if anything can fix a person's deep psychic problems this could do it if was if it was done the right way you know but with because of the what is uh what did McKenna call it the pharmacological Inquisition that is happening right now these substances are you can barely even experiment with them and now that they have Johns Hopkins University is saying oh yeah if you eat mushrooms it'll improve personality yeah you know so so maybe that's the key maybe you know the the Hopkins study will lead to more studies which will lead to you know treatments for like people who have you know are all these studies when they get to do these do these studies all these people they're taking these studies are usually people that need money and probably are depressed anyway so they're probably made everybody's life happy they see the thing is man that I mean like they don't take like really nice wealthy golfers that are retired on Florida go hey take this study they're probably taking like people that need a quick three hundred dollars no they're very strict about it they have like when they do when they're getting applicants especially for big studies like these they have like that's part of the when the FDA is approving this shit right that's part it's a big part of what they go through is like where are you getting your control group are you getting your where are you getting your group from that you're doing the study on because if it was like you're thinking about the way they do tests for TV shows you know I'm saying that like is these studies like the same that I used to do in college or are these studies like a bunch of poor people or they like a mix of these things because you can you can look up there's like housewives in the Johns Hopkins studies they were like intentionally trying to find people who are like not its familiar with mushrooms or hadn't taken them because but needed a quick these new dollars for the study yeah you know I don't I don't know man in your point cuz L those people if they take mushrooms their life's gonna feel better because they're fuckin you know what I don't lie to me I don't like eating mushrooms when I'm fucking broke and if I was in a I don't know that I don't know that i don't know that i don't know the income I don't that sucks when you're tripping and you start thinking about bills that's a fuckin shitty true yeah it depends on how much it weighs on you for some people when you're broke it's it's it's all day it weighs on you other people can just kind of brush it off and they don't they don't seem to give a fuck I consider a party drug like I want to fucking leave this reality I want to just get the fuck out of this you know that's what you consider mushroom yeah yeah I do too but along the way you know it's always this white-knuckle ride where you're scared as fuck before you do it and then once you do it you realize how was I ever scared of this and then after it's over you you know he sort of assess whatever you've kind of absorbed whatever fish you've caught in your golden net that's cool man no yeah you catch some fish I haven't but I never mushrooms I've never thought of them as like a part go out party drug I I you know like of in the Oh in the days when I would take it acid was that like I could go out and like have fun or like go out into the I wanted to get yeah I'd go to like when I was a kid you go to shopping malls and trip just you ever get to a point where you weren't lucid like you couldn't communicate with LSD yeah like we're talking you out and you're talking to people and you just can't keep it together like you can't communicate with them not when I was out I mean I've taken like I took a really powerful dose and tried to have a conversation with a girl I was taking I was taking it with and I sounded like a schizophrenic I was having like word salad cuz like we had just gone to some Greek Festival and I had watched these little kids dancing and and I was like sitting watching these kids like doing some weird Greek traditional dance and it was like it felt like I could see through the concrete and it I felt like there was like it just felt like this beautiful moment where it was like the universe is like you know the this is like a watching a flower like it's a traditional weird dances it's so cool the way the universe can express beauty in that way and yeah so I was like tripping and sitting on the couch and I'm trying to like tell her and universe Wow flower beautiful you god yeah he kind of word salad just shit he's always so like spellbound and also tripping so are my language centers have gotten fucked up I mean when you see someone on a heavy dose of acid they have a problem talking they like their language gets all mixed up and weird my last shroom thing I couldn't even walk that was the first time I ever did a psycho dog where I couldn't use my feet I felt wow that's crazy fell to the ground the presence of Jesus I mean dude do you want to hear my podcast prayer yeah I do but I wanted to ask you something I just forgot what I wanted to ask you oh oh did you know that Ted Kaczynski was involved in the Harvard LSD study you told me that fucking crazy there's a whole documentary about it it's not an American it's called the net and it's all about how they caught him and it's all about what you know how he got started and he you know there's I think there's certain people that are accusing that study of wrecking his brain you know and that he was a fairly normal guy and once he went through the LSD study they cuts him they cooked his mind yeah they probably gave him crazy high doses why I don't think they do I don't think they knew back then they didn't know they were fucking around you know I think there was a lot of experiment no way they knew man they were just fun who knows they had no idea how they know what they could've been man it could have been they did somebody shit to people made some big mistakes man people made some big mistakes they tried to cover it though they tried to cover the fact that Kaczynski was a part of their their studies because it's a real embarrassment I mean I don't when I say they don't know how fuck they are I might have made that up how about that but what might happen what did happen is the guy became a professor of mathematics for a few years and I think was University of California Berkeley and he just did it to make enough money to buy this cabin in the woods and plot his attack on technology and he was gone man he was gone this guy was out alone in the woods if you don't know the story of the Unabomber you know for a young child if you're you know coming to us under the age of 20 you might not even have ever heard of it before but it was a guy who is a brilliant brilliant guy who was targeting all these various people that were involved in technology and fucking blown their heads sending mail bombs yeah yeah and he was doing it all from a fucking Shack in the middle of building mail your Unabomber yeah member that's what that was like I sketch that they had of him and he was really terrorizing people for a long time and they were having a really hard time figuring out who the fuck he was they knew he was a genius but they couldn't figure out who he was and then he released a manifesto and his brother read the manifesto and his brother said he knew you said he knew right away he's like oh this is my crazy ass fucking psycho brother that lost his mind to LSD he was living in the woods in a box he's got this wooden box that he lives in in the middle of he thought that technology was eventually going to take over and technology was the enemy and it was yeah there's a whole form of like anarchy there's a guy Suzanne if you look up John Suzanne yeah this intense like anarchist he's like anti technology which is weird because he's got a blog but Kaczynski um was right in a way though right I mean technology is sort of taking over our lives and eventually is gonna be a part of our lives permanently you know once you start going to what is there's an I mean you start getting to the point where people become human hybrids you know we've only become cyborgs you know technology literally will take over yeah totally man I mean it's like there he saw her I mean he saw a path and I mean it's a horrible thing that he did but it's fascinating that blowing his brain out on acid would make him reach that conclusion I mean I might be simplifying his position it was a factor it was probably a factor if the guy was already in balanced or was already off taking like heavy doses of Harvard LSD back and back in the day that's not gonna help you do you think it's possible to do that to a person who's fine do you think you take like you I just blast your fucking brain out you never come back fuck yeah like what about MKULTRA the government experiments with mind control and like the idea of creating a psychedelic bomb I think you're talking about Maddie Kirsch no yeah MKULTRA manlius yeah so the psychedelic bomb what do you mean like what were they trying to do their truck that's if you ever seen Jacob's Ladder yes yeah it's like that it's like the ideas they were they were experimenting with some kind of psychedelic that you could drop on troops like a nerve agent that would just all trip out yeah fall down trip fight if you're tripping really hard enough so true so like that it was like they were great idea that a great idea yeah I just booked everybody out on acid sure fucking love bomb a bomb Danko they wanted it to explode in the air and somehow know that everybody would get infected with acid I don't know that how they were gonna fucking distribute it was probably gas if you would think that LSD you just need a tiny amount of LSD they say it was explaining this shit wasn't LSD Joe this was like new something something they were trying to make to give me fucked up trips to give you like it wasn't like they wanted to give you a nice LSD trip this some of the stuff they whipped up yeah but I mean even if it was just a strong LSD if you do it if you blew it on the troops they'd be jacked oh yeah all right Duncan LSD true now this troop silverstein no it was a big ship that they're talking about it's like a rib they were like it was a bad like bad trip it's like a an evil Death Trip it's not a good trip and everybody would just fall down be twitching in this trip but is that more humane than the New Kingdom killing them yeah which is better that's better for sure make your trip out it's better than new Kadhim have you ever met a guy that likes bad trips like that was like that was his bondage like I just need the worst trick it's a fetish about to die oh I guess I'm yeah you know that's a real terror though people pretend they like terror nobody likes terror you pretend you like terror because you want to be different or dangerous or moody or dark but real terror bad trips you know you don't want that bitch did I ever tell you about the time I saw a woman freaking out on acid at a rave though we were leaving it was in the morning me and my friend were leaving and this girl walks these girls like crying and standing by herself and we went up to her like you're all right can we help you and she's like I lost my friends yeah I can't find them we're like okay well why don't we where do you know we're like we'll give you a ride home we'll take you home where do you live or do you have a car here we're trying to help her out her eyes were fucking black is that as night-black as the wings of silence is dilated in like so we're like so we're good so we're walking up the steps with her and all of a sudden she goes [Applause] whoa she's just screaming and we're like oh fuck this is a real bad trip she's melting down so we get to the top of the steps she's all of a sudden she's back to normal she's like my friends I can't find my friends and I really so we look over and there's some paramedics and we wave him down they get her put on a table straps strapped her down and the last thing I saw her was on a fucking table in front of a rave writhing and going back and [Music] strapped yeah they had to man she's having a psychotic break home she lost it she took some shit and freaked the fuck out and that was from acid I don't know I mean it's something that dilated her eyes could have been a million thing don't eat the brown don't eat the brown acid that's that get that to me with my luck it feels like that's something I would have heard right after I'd eaten the brown acid I would take someone had just swallowed that God don't eat the brown acid that's the problem with drugs being illegal you don't know what the fuck you're gonna get yeah and you don't and most people don't know how to take them no one educates people on how to take him so you end up with some fucking dumb dopey kid who slurps back too much acid or whatever at a fucking rave and ends up in a mental asylum probably for how many people you think have gone crazy because of acid has anybody gone crazy because of anything else like no one's gone crazy because of mushrooms right I don't know is that ever happened I've never heard of that I think if you're borderline anything definitely push you over to push you over yeah well I remember one particular DMT trip where reality was real slippery for like two weeks afterwards or I felt like I might be a little crazy all right I remember I felt like like this is I've seen something that doesn't make any sense and I got there so easy and it's so much more vibrant than this world that it's it's very difficult for me to accept this world so I start looking at this world as if this world might be some sort of an artificial construct and that might be the real world it's a it sounds completely retarded until you've had a real full-blown psychedelic true because when you have a real full-blown one that world that you enter whatever the fuck that is that world of hallucination I mean hallucination is a strange word because it's it implies something you see something that's not there yeah and I'm not necessarily sure that that's the correct way to look at it I I think you might be something seeing something that is there but you just can't see normally I think that's more likely I don't I don't think I mean I think you know people see fucking you know a six-foot tall rabbit that wants to take you to a secret room yeah you're probably hallucinating yeah you are definitely yeah if you're not you're in fucking trouble but if you go so far that the world around you has dissolved you you know at that point in time this might not be imagination this might be another reality it might be something that you're just not capable of tuning into a regular basis this is a prop this this makes me think of a problem that I think is gonna happen in the future which is that once they figure out how to like neroli put video games in your mind people are gonna start having these real big problems differentiating virtual reality from actual reality and there's gonna be some serious problems up ahead because I it's like imagine you know what's the new what's the modern warfare 3 that just came out like imagine that you know six generations of consoles and computers down the line right now and it's so whatever that is ever gonna taste good now they're gonna feel it you've never they might have smells involved in it but what happens when that reality gets so good it you could no longer distinguish realities you can no longer distinguish virtual world worlds from real worlds because what they're triggering the same thing in your brain that reality is triggering right now but they're doing with computers so it's indistinguishable so how do you know when you've turned off the game how do you know when you're not playing anymore this is hippie talk man no fuck you this is what if man were you're right you're I don't think this is a what if I will admit to a million what else but this this seems like if you think of where I talk if you think of where Atari was back in the when we merwin Atari came out remember that shit right you saw that for me it was like holy shit you have to consider the past ability that if this life is some sort of an illusion that it's some sort of an ever-changing illusion and that you're constantly in a part of it and maybe when you have these psychedelic trips you wake up temporarily from the illusion maybe psychedelic so like like like that sniffing shit that they give you when you get knocked out yeah smelling salts huh what's going on here am i yeah that is it maybe that's what it is yeah I know that this is the work of fiction I get appears to be yeah this is just some kind of law or it's just like really low down on the spectrum of awareness I mean it is happening but you're only seeing one tiny pixel of the bigger thing it does many times feel like it's a work of fiction no doesn't it yeah well yeah can I tell you when it really felt like a work of fiction when we flew on Air France first fucking class to the UK that was for me it got really really surreal and weird when we're sitting in that lounge like this was like I I never fly first class so this was the kind of first class that I'd read about if you're out there and even never flown air france first class first of all please stay away from me because I don't like talking with people who haven't flown for his class Air France but you I felt corrupted in the first 30 minutes yeah I was like holy shit this is this is so like different from any other flight it made every other first class experience I've had seemed like shit seemed like some it was well you know it was really creepy you know what a creepy movie they did man what everybody was there was first class which is really nice then there was business class which is still really nice and there was coach which always talks well we got up the plane landed and a lady went through the aisle telling the business class people to get out of the way and let the first class people get off the plane first it's like Titanic shit but I've never seen anyone do it as aggressively as this lady did she almost pushed a guy back yeah there's a guy who's trying to get through zone sir no no stay there and then we all walk by they if you have a connecting flight there's a Bond girl basically waiting in some kind of town car that picks you up drives you to the security checkin you go through the security check in there basically they're treating you like you're a toddler they take you through the security check in and then you go up to this lounge there's this special Air France lounge in Paris and we're sitting there Robin Williams walk that's where things seem like fiction words like okay really I don't know I don't want to bug him yeah we didn't say hi but it was very weird I will I've been bugged so yeah I don't need to talk to him yeah yeah I mean yeah it would feel weird talking hey you're awesome that Matt Damon movie man what's that you're awesome in that Matt Damon movie yeah what was it a year that I liked a photographer one oh that was creepy as fuck hey it's gonna one hour but yeah it is weird how they push people aside that they they want the first-class people to get off first like they made everybody sit down yeah it was disgusting it's disgusting and it's also that's how a lot of people have grown accustomed to living every moment of their lives you realize that the wealthy have because you know sometimes I'll go out to a public place with a shitload of people and I'll walk around I'll be like man I fucking hate being around all these people this sucks I don't like being in big crowds it's annoying it feels right and then I'll feel like you're being negative man you got to open up more you shouldn't let this bother you but I think a lot of super wealthy people they're like they analyze that feeling like yeah we don't want to be around anyone we just want to be around a small groups of people sequestered from society or like us that are like you know money yeah that's it and they vote they've they've essentially of you know how like the Galapagus islands have their own species from being separated yeah I think like super rich people they're there that they have their own species pop and they have the zone thing happening where they don't even there's they're really separated from us like they don't know they don't even know about you I bet there's some super wealthy people you don't even fucking know about Occupy Wall Street they don't need oh that's ridiculous I wouldn't be surprised oh come on that's impossible at this point that's absolutely impossible why it's it felt like there is a gigantic foam separation between like us and then did you see the Berkeley footage now I did cops with batons just shoving them into the guts of these little kids girls two girls shoving these batons into their sides just jabbing them over and over them the kids are screaming the kids are in a crowd okay so the kids are in the front of the crowd and they can't even go anywhere because there's people behind them so these cops are to push the crowd back the cops are thrusting their batons into the unlucky people that are at the front of the law and they're little people man little skinny kids and these comps are fucking jabbing with batons it's really uncomfortable Brian you have really got a great run you got the thing isn't even a focus no this isn't it it's probably one of them footage people they're sticking look at him I see him look at him doing that shit yeah the Polka this isn't as clear yeah yeah they're hitting them holy shit I haven't seen this one good is beating them are these people [Music] it's so crazy this small group of that it's like a classic - screaming stop beating students this small group of men has to face this gigantic horde of unarmed people and a small group of men you know they immediately have to automatically go on the defensive and I look at them they have bulletproof vests on at fucking helmets and gun strapped to their side and batons you know they also have two rare riot gear with face shields and shit I mean they're coming at you letting you know that they're there to fight you know I mean look this is what it is look they're wearing helmets with face shields and shit man I like the guys shirt pink shirt yeah sure I hate his belt though that guy shirts a baton target you're not calling in the Barbera dude why are they are they telling them to get off the property or why are they good question yeah what are they doing here they scooping these people off the property and you know the check them for lice you know obviously they're telling people to stand back and the people look you know if there's a crowd of people the people at the front gonna get pushed forward man oh shit yo this is dark stuff man look really good to the neck Wow fucking bastard he's uh he's going chin the neck that's a shitty control by the way people down don't teach them go shit in control John's neck on a normal person that get right up stupid yeah try tickling let's just try it you trying to hurt somebody when you go shit neck unless someone else is holding the back I mean they're trying to enforce you know then they're trying to like make them feel pain as they're cuffing them you know they're right down really hard they're really rough well it's not like that there did you see me - I didn't need to shove her like that who are these guys who are these guys what are these guys do after work I don't know these are cops man we need to find out who the specifically who these people are and create special videos with their names and everything their bachelor orders there's already I mean someone needs but there needs to be a website just dedicated to identifying the police at these protests who are being violent and pressing charges against them and suing them and making it so that it becomes financially dangerous for the individual to act the way that they're acting because if these cops if we if we could just get one of them and I'm not saying get one violently obviously I'm saying but if we can just get one legally or financially if one of these cops can go down like that then then all of them will start being afraid and they won't be so uh prone to use violence like that that should be what someone should be taking charges so this is so surreal to me that this is happening right now this is but what a sign of the times this is man it's like watching an Alex Jones dream or something like this shit he was talking about oh he's right this is what he's been talking what I always say about Alex Jones he's right seventy percent of the time seventy percent of the time he's right this is a thirty percent of the crazy stuff that he kind of makes up that but I won't even say makes up meat he just he get he goes a little too deep on certain subject these police III don't know because I mean who knows but it's it's hard for me to believe that they're thinking about the New World Order or protecting globalization yeah just normal guys they're doing it's a terrible position to be in I mean imagine if you're a cop and all of a sudden they tell you this is what you have to do you have to get the hippies off the lawn sir there's 300 thousand of them what are you gonna do how you gonna get them off the lawn good luck man you mean what do you supposed to do we will the mayor has ordered you to clear the lawn so we must clear the lawn you can't clear that lawn man what if you're a cop what the fuck you gonna do you know the cops are obviously being sent there to keep these people from protesting or push them off of certain areas or keep things from entering certain places but at the end of the day you know they're stuck there they're that this there's no excuse for what they're doing there's no excuse for beating those people there's no excuse for prodding those people they should absolutely not be cops because they can't handle that you don't have to hit someone who's not hitting you man no people were hitting back that's this it wasn't like they were in danger and they had to protect themselves they were rag dolling people there needs to be a public shaming of those guys of those guys there needs to be you know how I know it's also this here's the other part though the fucking the with the Occupy movement alright there's a lot of shenanigans going on a lot of it is just nuts it's not all a bunch of people with valid points that are out there trying to resolve the issues that we currently have a lot of it's just crazy assholes you know I mean it's not all activists at these fucking things these things are magnets for chaos they're magnets for various like constant patterns of behavior in humanity buying a stereotypical patterns behavior like hippies drift thugs drug dealers chaos is homeless people there's a lot going on I mean it's a community of people that have taken to occupying giant chunks oh dude they should occupy everywhere was a poster that someone put up online on the message board I looked at it and showed all the different places where people are protesting like what the fuck man that's when it really hit when you there's a photo it says occupy everywhere see if you could find that dude there's occupy us and occupy everywhere and the photos are fucking trippy dude when you look at all the different protests you like whenever has it been like this but right that's right never it's never been like this but right this is incredible yeah this is a strange strange time and it snuck up on us it was so quick all of a sudden there's protests are everywhere and it really makes you take into consideration like where's the where's the end point they can't win you know that Martin Luther who can't win the fucking pigs pigs man that's the best word when you see some fucking fatty with a baton poke and a 17 year old girl there is no better description for that man then pig oink er piggy that's what that guy is he's a fucking disgusting fucking pig a useless cowardly human who's been hired by evil people to push down the force of evolution in the universe and if you try to stop evolution you're fucked I don't know what's gonna happen to that pig or the people like him but it's not gonna be great that's you can't hold it back what's happening it won't work I think as soon as you turn cops loose on people cops are used to dealing with the enemy they're used to dealing with criminals they're used to behaving a certain way because out in their world they have to behave that way if you want to stay alive as a cop you got to take no bullshit from any fucking perps you got a you know you got a rest people you got to deal with dangerous violent criminals that don't want to go to jail and know that you want to put them in jail it's a fucking high-pressure high-stress job really the person to blame is not those cops it sounds like they should be to blame but the person to blame is the person who put those cops in a position where they're going after law-abiding citizens well that's the problem because then even though those people technically aren't committing any crimes other than loitering and what are they doing I mean isn't there a right now protest I mean who knows what the latest stats are I think it's the property that I know property it's just you know this they're ruining the lines you don't need but here's the thing can I just I just want to say because it couldn't be what I said could be misconstrued I'm not saying all cops are okay what I'm saying is cops are wired to deal with criminals I mean they try to work with people all day but you got to be on edge man you got to be on edge all the time and when some asshole tells these cops now you have to go and you have to push back these crowds of unhappy intelligent people who are nonviolent and these people have very valid points about the corruption that has eroded our system to an almost unfixable point and they're fucking upset because they're in college and where the fuck is their future cunts have ruined the whole batch there's nothing left for us we're growing up and we're coming out and there's nothing left for us you fuckheads you've ruined the whole thing and you're a cop man and you are the enemy you represent the man I treat you Hostelling you treat them harshly they don't listen to you you treat them like criminals that's how you're wired your wire to treat criminals like criminals yeah they'd all of a sudden these young kids who have very valid points become criminals but it's also because there's a lot of douchebags in those groups that's what those groups are never pure you know well no and also those groups by the way the whole fucking problem with the current formation of this protest movement or this revolution right now is that it's it's so loosely it's the problem that's what's awesome about it is that it's a modular and it seems to be you know broken up in all these groups that have come together into this one thing but there is no easier group to infiltrate than a modular group like that so by now the CIA they are they must have infiltrated they've got people there they're like they're studying like okay what's the best way to handle this how can we implement this break this up for me they start CIA guys who fuck guys girlfriends yeah stick fuck your girlfriend yeah CIA guys are just gonna they're gonna give my Agora and and get these chicks high and just fuck the shit out of ya a lot of these girls they've never been with a real man they're

Drew had her on there just to see it cuz everyone says her boobs are fake right so they had this doctor come in there and they made this whole like episode was like trying to figure out if it's boobs are real well I mean like the doctors had a hard time like I can't see through this muscle it's her thing you know like they really built it up even the whole time they're just feeling or tits raises their feelings where that was such a repressed culture we're such a sexually repressed culture that this kind of shit is what we fixate on this is a fixator this is a real thing like oh yes bring her in bring in the slut so we can test your breasts well it's not like they don't like each other they obviously enjoy each other's company they hang around together I mean it's just you're not supposed to be banging a 16 year old dude no and check this out the I guess the photographer of a lot of her photos her sexy photos like where she's with her her boyfriend her husband ever heard actually taken by her mom oh yeah what that scarlet letter did you ever see there was like a one of those 20/20 type shows and it was on this porn star whose parents support her work what was her name I'm trying to remember that it's the one that the bunny ranch guy yes putting out it's not it's not sunny is it I mean the white low noise so on the wane the wane sunny Leone something you Leone is that it yeah I don't think that is isn't it her think that's a different girl I think that's a different girl but don't you think it's really fucking weird and that's a dark-haired girl I think don't you think it's really fucking weird and I and I think it's like obviously completely fucked up to like fuck people under 18 but in general don't you think that outside of that which i think is like sociologically it's super fucked up and it clearly fucks people's lives up and do it should be thrown alligators but in general isn't it strange that for adults sex the terms used to describe sex dirty naughty filthy it's like we attach to the act of bringing life into the universe or simulating bringing life into the universe we attached to that so many adjectives that are just like it's disgusting smut filth that's what when you look at porn that's like the words they used to sell porn the dirtiest smutty is filthiest whores this side it's like it's so strange then well it's because of obviously because in order to have an industrial revolution in order to you know have the society that we currently enjoy people have to work and if people were just dirty fucking all day they would complicate shit nothing would ever get done we have an ethic and one of the ethics is you keep your fucking sexuality to yourself right all day long mr. Herman Cain with your fucking unwanted massages fucking yeah yeah it's it's so fucking strange man it's like so you're telling me about how you were in what do you say you're in Germany and you watch like a gangbang a regular TV yeah it's like they didn't show penetration but this dude was banging this chick from behind her tits were flopping around there was a lot of people behind them they were fucking yeah it's like it was almost like some softcore sort of a thing but what you said about Hartman at the strip club mm-hmm that's to me that's like that oh it should be joyful it converts it's like it's the fact that it's not is an indication of how like backwards and repress we are yeah I mean by the way you know filthy dirty things are awesome I'm not saying that that doesn't add to like the excitement of it but it seems like in our culture it's so it's so like fucking Scarlet Letter Nathaniel Hawthorne style humiliation of people who really aren't doing anything that bad right here to what other people in the world are doing right you know like it's it's a it's a lot worse for you know we've probably talked about it well I think it's because we we have the instinct to fuck more than is necessary we have the instinct to fuck like we needed to fuck 10,000 years ago and half the babies we're Anton by crocodiles you know we have this this Drive well as long as the man is alive as long as the man is breathing healthy and feeling robust they want to fuck they want to shoot loads and the people and create more people and it's just it's just the desire to breathe that's all it is the desire to breed manifest itself in a code that's in and that runs your body and as long as that code runs your body people are gonna want to fuck and if that's gonna be the case of people there's no way you gonna get anything done because people are just gonna be trying to fuck each other all day because that's what they want to do so you have to figure out a way to suppress them and control them to calm them down pedo bear pedo bear approval you you know to calm them down to the point where you know things get done so you have to tell them it's naughty it's dirty stop it - put it away put it away you got to shame them it's the only way they feel bad about pulling it out oh I don't want my fucker but I can't you know you go in the bathroom you know it's because you have this massive suppression during the day of your natural instincts and feelings it didn't make any man express them didn't McKenna talk about some primordial like Eat World War there were mushroom or Jesus like these people like yeah I sure this utopian view of the past was that there was at one point in time Society had engaged and like almost daily mushroom use and that's what it elevated us from the lower hominids and that was the whole stoned ape theory he believes that psychedelic mushrooms and the eating of them was responsible for the doubling of the human brain size over a piglia period of 2 million years huge huge mystery in the fossil record so he had a lot of like really nutty theories like that but you know they're very interesting to consider but I don't know there been an orgy no no no you ever been an orgy Brian just two girls I don't bioW I've never been in hello Columbus Ohio I know I know people who've been to orgies I was at a party that I know a girl worked at a place where they would have orgies she worked as a cocktail waitress at this place where they would go people would go and then they would just start fucking they would just meet up and go into rooms and fucking everywhere she went she like people were just fucking everyone you went you got there they weren't pretty they weren't good-looking people but they were just all of them like naked half naked some were dressed some some didn't participate they just watched and it was like a club in LA people would go and just fuck yeah it was crazy she was like laughing at she's like it is the weirdest job she goes after a couple hours I got used to the fact that people just all around fucking all the time nobody bothered me she's like that's the one thing that happens you know when everyone else is fucking and someone wants to serve you drinks you barely concentrate on that person yeah here's your money thank you bye wanna go fuck somebody what some fuck me so it was like much safer actually than working at a bar where you were looked at as I go look at this girl yeah were you going after what do you do it with me you know those those guys didn't even look at her because there's all these people that were fucking in front of them everyone was sucking cock and everyone you could bang anybody you know so this is probably a few contrarians they like turn their gaze towards her but fuck all these people that are banging each other what about this girl how's she feel about this always gonna have that one the one girl who doesn't want to fuck in the water is just some dudes that are just broken there's some dudes that are broken they always go for the girl that's gonna just be damaged goods and all right always gonna need need to be with the person who can't be with them yeah it's always the cage we need the grand distraction the grand distraction of relationships you know never imagined when you were young remember when you were young rather imagine if you felt like that now like when you were young and you'd break up you really would think like god this is the end I can never I can never be happy to relationship again you used to believe that yeah sure you know when you're like 14 how many songs are about that there's countless songs that that's the main message is that then it's over I met that are the songs like they're like begging for one more night yeah it's so beta it's so big don't you got a Rolodex homey don't you got other girls you can call this is some Planet of the Apes shit son let me just give you a little heads up you need to go to the gym and do some squats eat some bison meat and hey shit together son Dyson get some get some string stop doing that round get some strong game in your system something that's been murdered that lived a free life a wild life and then you shoot it with a fucking bow and arrow and then you take that thing and cut it up and eat it that's what you need to do and squats and carry logs up hills that's what you need to do we don't need to do you mean just one yeah that's what girls do go wet for begging girls don't go wet for bagging ah just gonna keep him around be nice to him fuck the shit out of him the end man if they leave they leave he go hey you know I did my best I was nice to you I fucked the shit out of you obviously you got issues what about this some burnt into my mind have you ever near that but if you imagine if that wasn't a real song but it was like a song that occurs in his dream world yeah it's Dan Fogelberg oh he's our divorce all mine these are divorce songs these are Fogle there wasn't there was a there was a divorce boom and during this divorce boom this specific genre of music came out and I know it very well because that's what my mama listen to she come and pick me up at the Y and I would sit in the backseat of her car as she listened to like that's a divorce son oh she would she would get was very like dramatic and those songs were burnt into my mind and one of them was that Dan Fogelberg here's my experience with Dan Fogelberg when I was growing up I lived in San Francisco when I was about from 7 to 11 and we had a next-door neighbor it was cool guy named Barry and it was my stepdads buddy and we would go over his place and listen to his records and they had some badass records in San Francisco in the 70s man he had the Monkees and all the shit I just loved the fact he could put a headphone on and it pushed into the jack and he'd play a record and it was like you know it was in your head and I'd be singing along they'd have to tell me shut up stop saying anything terrible okay but I remember thinking like wow you know my parents listen to some cool ass fucking music you know there's some cool music like I listened to some Billy Joel you know I remember listen to the Captain Jack when I was like seven years old don't know what a great fucking song this is goddamn and then we had a friend and I was over his house and I asked him if I could listen to his music and he said yeah and he had a Dan Fogelberg record and I put that shit on and I was like why does this guy want to depress me like this why is this guy singing this what is he saying you're making me cry man I'm fucking seven years old you're bumming me out yeah you know or whatever I was when I read list of that but I was like this is just nonsense music oh poor guy somebody needs to tell him but then you know the thing is this is where people get confused that one guy James Taylor did it right yeah and that's why everybody gets fucked up because he had songs that were like super emotional and everything but they they had such a point of view that they were special there was something - yeah - the shit that he was singing so even though it was it was it seemed like it was kind of mushy but in fact it wasn't what it was was just vulnerable and honest and there's like a strength in that yeah totally you know and so these are these other motherfuckers well whenever you hate a music whenever you hear in a song make it through the night that was something that can still confuses me what does that mean okay we can make it through the night like well how do you not make it through the night from fucking you're not gonna die fucking what's the what's the worry when people seeing making it through the night what is it making out there tonight no no this it's like it's just - no it's always sad when they're singing it like they're going going to war or something you know dude show me make it I make it they mean like getting going through trenches or like not having a nervous breakdown that ya know it's like what it is is when you listen to certain songs and you you you hear people getting all emotional and you don't feel like it's you don't feel like it's valid it's like you're being too much of a pussy in this song like you're being put too much of a pussy with your expression I could go along with you here I could get caught up in the wave and go with you but I don't feel like it's necessary I don't feel like it warrants it you know then you listen to like James Taylor and you hear like just yesterday morning they meant no you know that's a depressing fucking song I seen firing icing rain certain sunny days I thought would never end or Elliott Smith he was like like Eliot yeah I listen to some of his stuff I wanted to kick him in the balls I was like kid you need to get out of the house stop playing video games this is the one song because Duncan told me how great the guy lapdog it's like yeah well you know but there's a lot of shit that I love that I'm sure you don't love you know Elliott Smith there you ever listen to kiss alone in your car and stand along no Black Keys all the way got a lot of love life that's awesome they're great I went on a period for like four months but that's all I listen to I would go in my car and I got the iPod thing in the car and I would just go right to Black Keys okay you know what I've been listening to you lately what you'll make fun of me Shpongle you ever listen to Shpongle there's only did a Shpongle thing where they took their music and they combined it with me talking about DMT that's cool yeah it's pretty dope these songs are trippy man one of the songs I just listen and write I like writing and listening to one of the songs I was hearing today the lyrics are like LSD DMT it's like if you heard that song it's really weird I mean I can't even sing it because that you have to have like seven synthesizers in a UFO that's like rave music right is that what you would consider Raven it's kind of like ambient rave music or something it's but yeah some of its yeah it's not it doesn't have like as much of a driving beat it's just more like super trippy like the guy really did capture something and they brought it back through music he's it's yeah it's really good it's not like I've listened to some of that stuff that's not so focused not so tuned in it's really kind of gross yeah you know it's like everything else man it's like mushy songs like what we just talked about James tailored he's not mushy right you know but like there's certain that we meet nothing's not Moshi he's genuine there's certain people like they get really offended by non-genuine behavior like there's some huge push to get Nickelback removed from what is it a hockey game is it is it hockey the Nickelback thing I can't remember I thinks it might be football I saw this thing on reddit and I maybe I don't I'm not remember it right but is that if you ever want to hide files on your comfy oh my god that's hilarious I met that dude very briefly the lead singer guy in a venue once where the UFC was gonna be there on Saturday and he was there on Friday very nice guy as lions Thanksgiving game protest for Nickelback these guys they got some good songs man I'm sorry they're slick they're over produced it seems like they're you know almost people like them because they're too good a pop song you know and sometimes they're like the you know it's almost too cliche but they're good that I want to be a rock star song there's been a million of those the Cypress Hill version so you wanna be a rock star that's the best one I got it man I've got very limited yeah I can't in Cypress Hill version is badass thanks a person that's a badass Rockstar song but the Nickelback one is not bad man it's not it's not a bad song I've heard that song I want to be a rock star I'm sorry really well I don't I don't hate Nickelback okay I don't particularly look forward to listening to them but they got some good songs they're not sorry this style their music just just like chocolate you can see it seems almost it seems like people feel like it's not honest or something you know it's it well what is it I mean is it well their visit ected woody it's affected their videos the I think I've seen a Nickelback video and it was very effective affected and it was very hard to watch because it was sappy and like she's super cheesy but I like I I don't have a strong opinion about them they also seem like you know there's certain bands like remember when New Kids on the Block came right and it was like kind of hip to not like New Kids on the rock yes it's like they're kind of like Tyler it's a mark of like a fashion to not like them or yeah yeah they've got some good stripper songs I've never listened to them I've always liked that one how could it be worse than some of foreigners songs well no I've been waiting for a girl like you I've been waiting it's a good song but come on man how is however any Nickelback song is any less happy I believe that first I believe that guy I don't believe that nickelback guy I think this guy is just sincere so you think it's just package to pre-produced really thought out to to calculated is that what it is what do you think that guy I think radio killed Nickelback for I think it's I blame radio it's interesting with this caught subject because we talked about a real band I mean as real and Scratchy as you can get the Black Keys they're like scratchy they're like almost like even though it's an mp3 like you can hear the record you know those guys are like that that's a band man there's a band playing instruments and singing and these are some songs they wrote and this is the sounds they like and if you're drinking whiskey and playing pool that's the fucking song you want to hear you want to hear that shit in the background you know if they got that's real music man and then you got you know other stuff like Nickelback that's like this is a sort of a different thing it's like they just got it honed down to like the slickly packaged sort of kind of cliche and in its intent but very well done like you can't criticize any aspects so it's very well gone that's this the voice is strong and a sing the guitar is good but somehow another some for some people the they get upset by it some well some people it's really weird man some people just they're the rubber ain't touching the road when it comes to what they're making they're just they're purely imitative but some people have like plugged into the fucking magma and they're vomiting out this thing they're they're like they've become a channel to something and it's undeniable when you hear it even if you don't like it you can still tell this is definitely real most of the time you can still tell this is this is something super unique and special that's very to me it's funny when you see imitators it's funny when you because you can't fake it it's one thing you can't fucking fake it's like what Joey Diaz says I don't know if he still says it all the time Holograms Graham yeah he says that about people that are fake yeah he's a fucking hologram yeah that's interesting yeah yes you can't really fake it and when you see like and but with some artists they really plug into it like that fucking kid I was telling you about yes 12 world kid I think he's yet 9 or I think he's not well this I think he's 12 Wow yeah well I think the that's all going through the internet apparently there was like a big piece on him from like 2006 and now he's been like studying in Europe it's alright yeah you told me about him and then after you told me about him it was all over Twitter all over my message board there was a couple different threads about it you know it just it's a meme you know about this kid you saw this thing of this kid he's like a super genius I think it's super genius musician he's like the greatest musician to come along maybe based off of them no no this is a new kid and how money does this is crazy he wanted this segment I saw it I'm sure if you YouTube this kid you can find it right away but he there's a you he's with his piano teacher and he takes the music and he flips it backwards and upside down and he can play it backwards he can play music backwards and upside down that's what she and she was like I don't see how he al anyone can do this he's composed like five symphonies and they say that most people don't do that or do that in their lifetime wrap your head around that wrap your head around that kid what is that what is that it's is it a mild form of autism from the matrix he tapped that's too sad I don't we're looking at a little boy who is literally looking at the keyboard raises back to the piano listen to the music he's a prodigy what if we get so dumb that this is what it's a super chimp imagine if you had a chimp they could do that not only can my chimp do this Joe did you hear Brian why don't you find that video if I'm trying to do what is uh what would you think so you'd have to look up like 12 year old musician yeah and he pretty much says what all super genius guys say is that it just comes to them he says he hears it yeah he just hears it and he writes down what he hears that's what it is Wow how the fuck can you do it backwards that's amazing that's just showing off a little fuck yeah you know the crowd I don't think I don't know if this is an what is it that's actually did you put butthole in the SOOC sir yeah hey it's butthole in a search really I don't understand it seems like that wastes time yeah that's Brian balls Google searches he adds butthole so that's that's definitely definitely not amber I find it Brian that was listed under an amazing 10 year old yeah 12 year old I know that's what I'm super genius musician and it's not going to just Julie opposed how many what did you five we have symphonies right come bright twelve-year-old composed five symphonies put that in you'll find it yeah they probably already have but if you just google twelve-year-old composed five symphonies for sure you'll find that guy got it yeah see areas bluejack works renowned Julliard School who some say is the greatest talent to come along in 200 years whoa written to this now twelve what happened it's just a commercial accident there's a composer studying at New York's yeah now who some say is the greatest talent to come along into Sun Sun sighs Sam Zeeman is a composer he teaches music theory to Jay at Julliard in New York City where he's been teaching for 17 years this is an absolute fact this is objective this is not a subjective opinion Jay could be sitting right here and he could be composing right now he could finish a piano sonata before our very eyes in probably 25 minutes and it will be a great piece how's that possible well Jay told us he doesn't know where the music comes from but it comes fully written playing like an orchestra in his head you hear it playing can you change it as it goes along can you say yourself over let's bring the elbows in here or let's bring the string sections here they seem to come in by themselves if they need to it's not something you're trying to do it's like my unconscious mind is giving orders at the speed of light you know I mean so I just hear it as if it were a smooth performance of a work already written what it isn't it's involuntary oh so you like the beating of the heart you don't have to think about it like it sees all the kids are downloading music these days it's just that J with his composing program is downloading it from his mind the program records his notes and plays them back that is welcome cars up and running Jay composes so rapidly that he often crashes the computer it is an iBook at a picture of the score the prodigy Kinema MacBook JZ parents are as surprised as anyone neither is a professional musician his father Robert is a linguist of scholar and Slavic language who lost his sight at the age of 36 to retinitis pigmentosa his mother orna is an Israeli born painter that's Michael Jay's eight-year-old brother he's not a musical prodigy but Robert and orna remember when they figured out that Jay was I think around one of the Penn State kids writing whoa look at that actually drawing instruments we know that he was fascinated with it started writing yeah at the age of two yes wrote it too as chanson saying what edwin wrote the word cello and i was surprised because neither of us have anything to do with string instruments and i didn't expect him to know what it was what a cello was right you didn't have a cello no he had no channel at house have you seen a cello nope but he knew he wanted one so his mother brought him to a music store where he was shown a miniature cello and he just sat there he put the cello and he's not playing on it and I was like how do you know how to do this by age three James shield wrong cellos but he had turned them into notes on a scale reincarnation getting to compose Jays parents watched the notes come faster and faster he was writing anytime anywhere my elementary school his teachers had no idea how to handle a boy whose hero wasn't Batman but Beethoven Jay has been told his hearing is many times more sensitive than an average person's the sound of the pestle shut out manually but Jay can't turn off the music in his head in fact yeah he told us he often hears more than one new composition at a time multiple channels is what it's been termed multiple channels that my brain is able to control two or three different musics at the same time whoa mmm along with this channel of everyday life and everything else Jay channeled this piece when he was eight by the age of 10 J was going to Juilliard among the world's top conservatories of music on a full scholarship if you consider imitation an extra concrete object at age 11 he was studying music as if that was a real college like I'm a fucking idiot Janey's prohibited courses at another school which his parents say he'll complete when he's 14 completely Elizabeth Wolfe is a well-known concert pianist who works with Jay on his piano technique today Jay brought one of his own works to bright Jay writes things that he can't even play jesus fucking christ jenny wants to perfect his piano playing although he says he doesn't need the piano or any instrument to compose when you first hear this tune start to rise in your head what happens well at first I just listen to it and then I start humming it and then when walking it I like walking a lot when I'm in when I'm inspired because then I walk to the beat of the music I start walking and often I start conducting as well imagine seeing that walking down the street we're not unusual twelve-year-old whoops and he knows it what happens when da gets bored oh when he gets bored he kills ferrets improvising last week he took the Beethoven sonata the working right and now and decided that everything would be kind of interesting upside down in backwards so he took the volume and literally did just that he can do it free right now and I couldn't even follow but he actually took the clefts and inverted them the treble became bass bass became trouble and did it backwards thanks and she goes it's impossible closers might write five or six symphonies in a lifetime Jays written five at the age of twelve here Jays explaining the storm to conductor Jung ho puck at the rehearsal what a strange thing to be fucking awesome at music that's kind of like outdated but he got lucky man he got born into a great family well I could get that dude they should co-opt him and get that dude to make some jam and pop tunes so thinking yeah the listen dude is a dead fucking song yeah nobody listens the cello anymore come on man you want to make some money you love you rock star I live like Nickelback at least get him a MacBook Pro yeah is the shit is crashing man it's got that wack ass old laptop it's still running on Mac OS 9 yeah that's a shit computer if I can't even run a composing probably yeah well it's that it's like pushing a board it's not it's a goddamn genius fess up chuckles but if that kid had been born in the wrong family yeah you know where he's dry drawing notes quit drawing that shit what is that gay like gay language get this fucking kid out of here what do you think is going on with that kid do you think that's like Asperger's and autism thing it seems like it a little bit incarnation I think especially
