the girag and experience sort of so what is it with Scientology um that's a good question um I don't know like if they have ceremonies if they I think when you look at that Tom Cruise recruitment video which is fucking fantastic you know when he's standing out there have you seen the one where they give him a medal yes which is fucking just so rich it's a giant metal many times larger than an Olympic gold medal he's wearing this medal and he's standing there in front of a fucking it's called the freedom medal of valor and he's standing in front of all those people and he's such a charismatic person there it is right there oh Jesus Louisa look at that fucking thing come on just the the lack of like understanding how you come across that would allow you to wear that the lack of objectivity that it will allow you to put that on and and and be able to do this fingertips down thing on the on the the desk like you're making a very important point while you're wearing a fucking frisbee a gold frisbee around your neck it's almost like he's trying to convince himself by tricking all these people I think there's something to that there's something to if you can get a thousand people to cheer at these words that you're saying and you know no matter how fucking crazy they are if you can get all these people to believe you and listen to you it sort of validates that maybe you're not fucked up because you're in with all these other people that have agree in feet ins and fucking you know all the other wacky shit that they believe there's something to that where he's putting on this massive performance not just for them but for himself as well I have my own Bill O'Reilly story really please sell it to me well 48 laws of power just come out in 98 and Bill O'Reilly decides to have me on the Reilly if a Reilly factory which was big then but not as big as it became later on and so that I'm like this is like one of my first shows I've ever been on you know no no nothing like this ever happened to me before and basically till you go to a studio in Los Angeles where he's in New York and you're in this room and there's nothing around you and yeah they put an earphone in your head and you're staring at a camera you don't see anything you just hear Bill O'Reilly's stupid fucking voice in your ear asking you questions it's like you're on drugs and it's so disconcerting it's like the guy who's trying to put you off your game before and you're already put off your game yeah the moment you start anyway he interviews me and I prepared like shit for this interview because I knew the questions coming it was all about Monica Lewinsky and Clinton and the scandal in the 48 laws and I nailed it and he said that was a great interview Robert I'm gonna have you on again okay Wow and so I'm like feeling pretty good about myself so four weeks later I trudged back to that office and I sit in that same chair with a little earphone in my head and he proceeds to just rip me to shreds about what well essentially he hated the 48 laws of power he liked the writing or whatever but he was just using posing his game he wishes you know completely he was just using it as a way to attack Clinton which I wasn't wanting to do it oh yeah so anyway he was just like totally messing with me and I was so expecting the opposite that I was like woo and then he goes and then he says well what about this law about you selective honesty and I said well it's something that politicians and business people use all the time like Lyndon Johnson for instance and and I was about to explain how Lyndon Johnson use and he cuts me off yes yes the same man who send 58,000 men of our young men to death in Vietnam let's break for a commercial and that was so he like made me look like I was supporting Lyndon Johnson massacring 58,000 Americans in Vietnam he manipulated me and made humiliated me and like and the whole thing was he hates the 48 laws of power because it's all about manipulation and ugly and he's the most fucking manipulative interviewer look how he manipulated me he completely set me up by making me think this was going to be like a softball interview where we were just you know I think did I tell you this one if I've told it I'll stop we fly to Australia Kabir Scott I was on a little plane usually you're on a giant plane and it was on like a 737 you know like that you original story which is groovy airline so on the flight with me and my wife has the game you know the sky is rapper right he's going to talk to Ana and Carrie Hillman who's also rapper and uh and their policy right so it's hectic right it starts to get bumpy and the pilot comes on it goes like everybody's strapped in okay for like ever and it Australia's 15 hour 16 it's long yeah this all day and this lasted literally five hours right just bouncing up and down side to side pitching y'all the whole thing and on them on the sky map right it says like Pago Pago 1500 kilometers meaning you're 1500 kilometers from panca pego in other words the Pacific Ocean is so big there's no land masses nothing anywhere near you where you're going over right so you're not gonna go in because it's turbulence it's not your fucking freak man you're not gonna die this is an electric turbulence doesn't make planes crash and it doesn't unless there's some sort of shitty a structural defect on the plane like that you know the wings aren't glued on or whatever be a structure about generally you've been in a play of turbulence they you know that's not what makes them crash you know but anyway said it's terrible in any case so we get through it and next morning the rapper's get up and they're all like oh my god I thought I was gonna die and you know it was so bad last night I you know I was praying and lo I they're all really shook up and carry Hilton is a very lovely young rapper lady wakes up it's been all night mind you where no one can move I stopped holding my wife's hand for five you know like like this for goes like this Oh what happened and the rapper's you didn't feeling we're gonna dial out the claim about Noah Rihanna and she goes I took a pill and it's heating and beans a motherfucker yeah what and then she ate one piece of food and put on a leopard miniskirt and came out with her makeup and signed autographs and I was like you're a star I want you on my team you are Alexander the Great
