hello freak bitches 30 the last time I said a I was exactly 30 last time I said a three-month retreat but you just get you your unplugging from your life you're saying goodbye to everyone you know you know for all you know someone's going to die while you're on retreat until you there's this real discontinuity with every project and every aspiration everything you have going on and and also most of people in your life can't believe you're doing this it's not much support you thought it's just totally inscrutable yeah that you would decide to do this and then you'll essentially lock yourself in a closet I mean like essentially lock yourself in a room as big as you know these two tables and then you're just left with your thoughts and the the problem is is that just thinking itself even thinking happy thoughts is stressful and when you actually when you really start paying attention to it that just the sheer automaticity of it to just just to be just to not be able to stop the conversation and you just can't stop talking to yourself for a second and that now you eventually you can eventually you become concentrated on in this case the practice I was doing is called the pasta which is mindfulness meditation and the practice there is just to become very keenly aware of you start with the breath as an object of meditation but they but once you get a little concentration you open it up to everything so sounds and sensations and even thoughts themselves become objects of meditation where you're just noticing whatever arises in consciousness and but the difference between noticing a thought arise and pass away and being lost in thought is is huge and it's the all-important difference and it takes some real concentration to act to see a thought arrives and pass away because without the concentration all of a sudden the thoughts just you it just comes up from behind in a way and you're just you're just you feel identical in a strange way you feel identical to this sentence in your head do you feel there's amiss thoughts are just sentences and images and it's when you actually look at what a thought is it's very hard to see how you could how could ever define your subjectivity in the first place it's just like your thoughts are no more substantial than the sound of my voice and you're just hearing the sound of my voice is a kind of appearance in consciousness right now and it's not it's not defining you it's not you don't feel identical to it it doesn't have a real implication so much for how you feel you're you're not it's just it's easy to see or to in this case here that it is a and of just an appearance in consciousness it comes and it goes it starts and it stops and it's all sort of in plain view but with your own thoughts with the own with with your own voice it it sneaks up on you in a way that is and even to use the word you in this case is a little misleading because it but it colors consciousness and trims it down in such a way that it just feels like you it doesn't it doesn't feel it does it's it's you you feel I mean the feeling of being a self the feeling that we call I the feeling of being an ego in the head is what it feels like to be thinking without knowing that you're thinking it's that it's the feeling of this next thought capturing consciousness so when you say that thoughts you are identical to thoughts so if you're thinking something really fucked up like I'm fat I'm a loser I'm always going to be a loser like that is identical to who you are because you are sort of framing yourself in this thought there are these thoughts that are you're carrying around your mind there what's occupying your consciousness and if those thoughts are in the forefront of your consciousness that they identify you you are that you are those thoughts and you are identical to that idea yeah and they're and they're driving behavior and they're driving emotion and they're driving each subsequent train of thought so it's just its determining the the future expressions of your consciousness and your body as well so you're you're and again I'm not I'm not separating the mind from the body here I mean all of this is we could talk about this in terms of events in the brain as well but it's much easier to talk about it in terms of our first-person experience has thoughts and moods and and emotions etc but you know for the for the purpose of this argument you know there's no doubt that the brain is doing this it's just we're not you know that side of the story that is much less to say about that side of the story at the moment this brain is doing it but your your whatever it is your personality your consciousness your your Center is sort of what guides the brain one way or another like it is possible to while in the middle of having these thoughts to say you know what I'm not going to entertain these anymore and I'm going to think about something positive but it's very difficult yeah surprisingly difficult even to someone like myself we spent a lot of times a lot of time meditating especially a lot of time in isolation tanks it's still difficult every now and then if something's bothering you to just get it out of your head like here especially for me um one of my main issues is my work like like stand-up comedy for instance like if I have a show and I fuck a bit up if it goes wrong like if I have two shows in a night and I fuck a bit up on the first show I'm okay if I could redo it in the second show we're good but if I fuck it up on the second show god damn it now I have to think about that thing all night and I'll try to let it go I'll try to get it out of my head but I rationalize it by saying the only reason why I've gotten so good is because of this crazy obsession that I have with getting it correct and that when things go awry or when I go down a bad path it doesn't quite pan out and then I have to sort of restart the whole conversation on stage that that uncomfortable moment and then the subsequent uncomfortable recollection of that moment is the very motivation that's led me to be a good stand-up in the first place so I kind of rationalize it but fuck man when I'm eating dinner after a show and I just flub one word that fucks up a joke I'll be in the middle eating pancakes going shit yeah like I can't get it out of my head it doesn't matter if a good wonderful wife and a beautiful family and great friends and a fantastic job and a wonder of just a dream life doesn't matter I flubbed a word fucking idiot you know like why I'm cutting into my food yeah well that bet that's an interesting moment because so there's a moment before the thought has arisen right where you have not yet remembered the flub line so you're just cutting into your dinner and then it's it's an image or part image part sentence something there's some expression of thought that arises in consciousness and you are you do not you do not witness it arise it's not like is the difference between seen watching a movie and being totally lost in the movie forgetting that you're sitting in a room with a bunch of other people looking at light on a wall you're just you're totally captured by the movie stiffening that and actually just seeing the screen the light on the wall hearing the sound of the projector scene seeing the seeing the artifice and it's possible to see thoughts just as essentially like a play of light on the wall you just you see it before it captures you and the difference is total and it is kind of like it's almost like playing a video game where you can now not get killed in the same spot over and over again like this like you know not losing in the same boss fight over and over again yet we we lose in that same fight a thousand times a day but when you can actually see thoughts for what they are so the next time you flub a line and the negative x time you recall it it's possible with and again it takes a certain degree of concentration to be able to do this but concentration becomes kind of a native capacity a certain point it's like jiu-jitsu or anything else I'm you have certain skills and you don't really lose them then you can just see it and it just comes and it goes and it doesn't have a tenet and it's going it's going it's really gone it's and it doesn't have the same emotional necessity it doesn't trigger the same mental state and now that's not to say that these negative mental states haven't had the the benefit that you ascribe to them so yeah it could be that you're as good as you are because you were motivated to not embarrass yourself ever again because it felt so terrible right so you hated this experience of flubbing online you hated the memory of and the reliving of it the next day you hated what it did to your your time with your family and so you thought I'm the next tour I'm going to get this I'm going to I'm going to get up earlier I'm going to work harder etc so yeah that's all part of the clockwork that's causing you to hone your craft but I would argue that a little mental suffering goes a long way I think we nine times out of 10 or 99 times out of 100 we suffer unnecessarily and there's not no good comes from it it's just it's not actually making us better people is making us more neurotic people we're more worried we're worse husbands were worse fathers and and it's time to break that spell and and and then you can you can selectively be as as uptight and neurotic as you want it gives you a kind of freedom to pick your your your priorities in a way you rather than be captured by just whatever the next thought happens to be I've also found for me personally the discipline and diligence or the the best mitigating factors for dealing with neurotic thoughts like if I have an issue one of the big issues if I've ever had anything go wrong was that I didn't work hard enough so if I know for a fact that I worked as hard as I could like back when I was competing that was a huge issue and it also mitigated nervousness because look whenever you're involved in a competition as terrifying as a full-contact martial arts tournament where concussions are not just likely but it's someone in there's a hundred people fighting in this tournament someone's going to sleep someone's going to get knocked out is it going to be you someone's going to get their nose broken someone's going to get hit a lot of people are probably if I if I trained really hard if I know I did everything that I could I ate right I slept right I put in all the practice I worked on all my weaknesses I you know I didn't neglect my strengths I was much less nervous much less nervous and much better at dealing with losses whereas losses I think losses for martial artists can be sanely devastating like I was listening to this interview with Travis Browne do you know he is no UFC heavyweight one of the top top five guys in the world great fighter lost recently in two fabbrizio for Doom in a title elimination fight so Fabrizio has gone on and he'll be fighting Cain Velasquez for the heavyweight title now in October right in Mexico and a huge October November November believe it's November what at one of those he's fighting Cain Velasquez for the title a huge fight it could have been Travis Brown right Travis Brown lost the fight by decision and you know was it it was you lost without a doubt but you know wasn't embarrassing it wasn't he didn't get knocked out in the first round he didn't get submitted really quickly but he did lose the fight and it was apparently devastating to him I mean he's talked in great depth about lying in bed in the fetal position crying I mean he is this fucking 250 pound gladiator and he's curled up in a fetal position crying well the truth is the ego is always curled up in the fetal position crying we all have that part of ourselves and it's yeah I'm a that and that's what is so excruciating about the self and the self really is the center of the center of our problem you know and and when things are really going well we are consoled by how well they're going but we know it's it's vulnerable to change Mir only as good as your last appearance in some sense I mean I could do something incredibly embarrassing in the middle of this podcast and that will be the thing I'm thinking about tonight and I'll be I'm thinking you know god I can't believe I fucked that up so bad within Jose podcast and that it's you're always vulnerable to that but run for as long as you ahead as long as you're in the center of this thing vulnerable to what other other people think about you and captive of you're really crazy rehearsal of experience and when you when something like this happens to you just think of how many times you repeat it to yourself it's like you tell yourself the same story 15 times a minute four hours and it doesn't strike you as insane but it ashley is in say if your if your thoughts could be broadcast on a monitor for other people to hear and they could hear you repeat yourself over and over and over again it would seem starkly crazy it just and yet it seems normal it's kind of like like the dream state where you go to sleep and you're in your bed and you you know you're everything's obeying the laws of physics and then in the next conscious moment you are you know at a party somewhere is talking to someone who you know is dead and saying oh I can't believe you're alive now and and then you know there's a gorilla in the room and and and none of this strikes you as crazy is that means that the craziest things about dreams is that the mind seems to just accept them they accept these changes one after the other without any sense that there should be continuity hmm and this is do there's no question that this is due to the diminished activity of the frontal lobes during REM sleep we just are truth a reality testing hardware has come largely offline during dreams but there's something analogous happening when we're just thinking in the waking state because thoughts or thoughts don't make much sense because it the the repetition is we don't notice how crazy the repetition is and we would notice it if we were talking to each other if I was telling you the same thing 15 times in a row without a you know with the without honoring your expectation that I might move on to another topic you know you would you would notice and I would notice right and yeah and the other thing is this crazy about thoughts is that much of our thinking certainly our linguistic thoughts or it's structured as though were conversation and we play both sides of the conversation so I you know I'll sit down here and you know I said I came in I sat down and and I brought you a book and I wanted to sign the book and I see this pen over here and and I think oh good there's a pen over there right now I can see that there's a pen over there so Who am I why do I have to say there's a pen over there right Who am I telling is there someone in me who can't see that there's a pen over right so there's a conversation that starts like and I'm all sides of it that doesn't make any sense right and yet we architect if 'ti is continually just it is it is discursive in that way and they're just voices to talk into each other and there's a not only not only are there not two of us in there there's not even one of us and there's not that the thinker isn't there but we seem to have two of them it's like we're constantly talking to mommy and daddy and we in fact I could be the way this conversation gets internalized because you know I can see it in my kids now where they sometimes Eve you listen to my daughter playing by herself and she's talking to herself out loud in the way that that you know you'd have to be sort of crazy to do as an adult but as a kid you're just you know we're just talking out loud and eventually we all learn to internalize that conversation but and when you don't when people who can't internalize it well they're the crazy ones you know the person is walking down the street just saying oh good there's a pen over there and what would god of what we're late and god I know Joe I'm and Joe's gonna really be pissed I can't believe I should I should have checked the traffic before I left so these are the kinds of thoughts I could think silently in the space of my mind but and it wouldn't be starkly crazy but to verbalize them then you're a madman and that that difference between letting them out and just knowing to keep your mouth shut is it captures a large part of the difference between being you know a proper lunatic and a normal person but what I argue in this book is that it's normal isn't good enough you know I mean normal the normal state of consciousness wherein you are just chased out of bed every morning by your thoughts and you think think think think think every waking moment until you fall helplessly asleep at night that's not necessarily a happy place to be and it's not the only alternative and and so and again thought it's not that you're the goal is not have a mind without thoughts but we need thoughts and you can't you know everything we do as human beings for the most part requires thought too get off the ground so our relationships are based on thoughts and our every public institution and science it's all its this conversation we have with ourselves and with others is based on on language almost and and concepts that are mediated by language and so you need thought but the difference is the difference is between thinking and knowing that you're thinking in really knowing that you're thinking in the moment of thoughts arising or being lost in thought and then when you're lost and thought it doesn't really matter what the content is you're still confused about who and what you are I mean you could be thinking about the moat you could be think about the most profound things in science or in ethics or whatever it is but if you're just thinking without knowing that you're thinking there is a kind of delusion there it is analogous to the dream state in a way where you're just you're not it's not clear to you what's going on you thieves you think you're the thinker of the thoughts you think you're authoring your thoughts in a way that you're you're not I mean cuz thoughts just arrives we don't we don't actually offer them you
