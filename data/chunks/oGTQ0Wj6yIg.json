- one good hello Darryl hey Joe how are you doing my pleasure thank you for being here really appreciate it thank you um I read your story I saw a thing about you on NPR and it's crazy you've converted how many people 200 KKK members you've got them to drop their robes why some directors some indirectly yes how did that all happen Wow you know I keep running into these guys I mean I'm a musician by trade right position right rock & roll blues swing jazz mighty reason jazz but hey I'll play whatever you want me to play you paint I'm playing so uh everybody likes music now even the KKK so you said - well to my advantage I was playing on a bar one night in Frederick Maryland all white bar and when I say all white I don't mean that blacks couldn't go in what I mean is that blacks chose not to go in they weren't welcome and here I wasn't this bar with his country band a friend of mine Spann I was only a black guy in the band he's only black guy in the bar and upon finishing the first set this I'm walking to the to the band table and somebody came up with their arm around my shoulder I'm trying to see who it was it was a white gentleman maybe 15 18 years older than me and he says yeah I really enjoy your all's music I said thank you understand and he pointed at the stage and said you know I've seen this here band before but I never seen you before would you come from and I sprained yeah you know they told me they played here before but this is my first time in this place I just joined the band and he said well man I really like your piano playing this is the first time I ever heard a black man play piano like Jerry Lee Lewis and I wasn't um I wasn't offended but I was rather surprised because as I said you know this guy's like maybe 15 years older than me and he didn't he did not know the black origin of Jerry Lee there was a style of piano playing I explained it to him I got it from the same place Jerry Lee did from black blue and boogie woogie piano blares where the guy was incredulous are not are not jury invented that I never heard no black man play like that except for you something okay with us this guy never heard of Little Richard or Fats Domino and I said look man I know Jerry Lee Lewis is a friend of mine he's told me himself whether or not to play the guy did not buy that I need Jerry Lee hidden by the jury lead or anything from black people but he was so fascinated that he wanted to buy me a drink or that was like a novelty to him so him back to his table had a cranberry juice and then he announces this is the first time I was sat down had a drink with a black man and now I'm I know he was incredulous like how can that be you know I sat down with thousands of white people anybody else had a meal of beverage a conversation how was it this guy had never done that and innocently I asked him I said why he didn't answer me at first he stared down at the table top and I asked him again and his buddy sitting next to him elbowed him in the side I said tell him tell him tell him I said tell me yeah I forgot what is this mystery he looks at me just as plain as day and he says I'm a member of the Ku Klux Klan well I burst out laughing you know it was getting weirder by the second huh yeah I knew a lot about the plan I've been studying racism since I was a ten year old kid because of an incident that happened to me back then and I bought books on black supremacy white supremacy the KKK the Nazis the neo-nazis um for to try to understand this mentality and I knew what Klansmen would not come up and just throw his arm around some black guy's shoulder on phrases talent and wanna you know hang out with him buy him a drink so I know this guy's jerking me around so I'm laughing and he goes inside his pocket and pulls out his wallet and produces his Klan membership card Def cards oh yeah yeah and he gave me his uh card I looked at it and I recognized the Klan insignia which is a a red circle with a white cross and a red blood drop in the center of the cross and I was oh man this thing's for real so I stopped laughing it wasn't funny anymore and I gave it back to him and we chatted about the Klan and different things but the dude gave me his phone number and want me to call him whatever I was to return to this bar so he could bring his friends meaning Klansmen and clans women to see this black guy play like Julie I'm not sure he called me a black guy to his friends but but I said I caught you so I would call him every six weeks on a Wednesday or Thursday say hey man you know we're down at the silver dollar no Friday and Saturday come on out he came out both nights he bring Klansmen in Klansmen and they come and gather around the bandstand and watch me for the piano or get out there and dance to our music now you know they didn't come in robes and hoods right they came in street clothes and on the brick I would go to his table say hello some of them were very curious they'd hang out there and want to meet me and talk to me others would see me coming and get up and take off and those stands throughout the part of the room where it's like I just want to see you I don't want to deal with you so that was fine and I decided later on I would write a book and because I've been looking for an answer to a question that I had formed when I was age 10 my question was how can you hate me when you don't even know me and this was a result of having marched in a Cub Scout parade at the age of 10 being the only black scout in the sub parade and while most people on the streets and sidewalks were cheering us we were marching from Lexington to Concord Massachusetts to commemorate the ride of Paul Revere and people were like waving flags and yelling and screaming the British are coming and all of the time except for one small pocket of people who were throwing rocks and bottles at me and at age 10 my first thought was oh those people over there don't like the scouts now that's how naive I was it wasn't until my den mother my Cub master my troop leader all came rushing over and how to lower me with their bodies these are white people and escorted me out of the danger that I realized I was only targeted with nobody else was getting this protection and these were adults or these were other children's were a couple it was maybe about five people I'm gonna get me a couple of kids maybe my age a year older and some adults adults were throwing rocks and bottles at a ten year old boy that's correct yeah Wow and you know I I kept saying to my uh my Scout leaders I didn't do anything I didn't do anything I was not trying to find out what did I do right you know what why are they doing this to me right and they kept snow slush in me telling me to hurry up move along he'll be okay so they never answered the question isn't why this was happening when I got home that day after this parade my mother and father who were not there were putting mature chrome and band-aids on me and asked him how did I fall down and get all scraped up I chose my didn't fall down I told them exactly what had happened and for the first time in my life my mom and dad sat me down and explained to me what racism was at the age of 10 I had never heard the term racism now what year was this 1968 okay I'll tell you why because my dad was a US foreign service so we spent a lot of time overseas every two years you go to a country you're there for two years come back home for a few months and then you get reassigned to another country so when I was overseas in elementary school my classes were filled with kids from all over the world anybody who had an embassy in those countries all US embassy kids would've the same school my class was full of kids from Nigeria Italy France Germany Japan Russia you name it if you were to open the door to my classroom and stick your head in you would say this will suck in United Nations of little kids so that's exactly what it was and we all got along then I would come home after that two year assignment and I would be in either all-black schools or all schools I'm sorry all black schools or all black and white schools meaning they are still segregated or the newly integrated schools and there was not the amount of diversity in my classroom that I had overseas today you walk into a classroom you know you can't tell where we're from from all over so literally um between 1961 and like 1968 1970 I was living about 12 years into the future when I was living overseas because that that multicultural scene had yet to come to this country and when it did of course I was already prepared unfortunately many of my peers were not so I didn't experience racism had I lived here my you know my whole life I might have had a different perspective and not taking this path so I was very curious about it and fascinated with it like how can somebody hate you and they don't even know you it was just beyond my comprehension and I knew something was wrong because the people who did this to me did not look any different than my little French friends my Swedish friends or my fellow Americans from the embassy or for that matter my fellow Americans right there you know at the school where I went where we did the March so I knew it wasn't a color thing in fact when my parents told me this I did not believe my parents I felt for some reason my parents are lying to me because my ten year old brain could not process the idea there's someone who had never seen me had never spoken to me knew nothing about me wouldn't want to inflict pain upon me for no other reason than the color of my skin so I did not believe them well a month and a half later that same year an associate on April the fourth Marta 13 was assassinated and I remembered very well we were in Massachusetts st. Louis and nearby Boston Washington DC my hometown Chicago Illinois Philadelphia Detroit Baltimore Richmond LA all burned to the ground with violence destruction all in the name of this new word that I had learned called racism and so then I realized my parents had told me the truth this phenomenon called racism does exist but why I'd understand why okay so it's here but why and so that's when I formed that question how can you hate me we don't even know me and so I've been looking for the answer to that question now for 51 years I'm uh 16 years old so after I uh I met this Klansmen sure Oh maybe he I don't know three or four months later I quit that band and went back to playing rock and roll and blues and R&B and then it dawned on me Darryl you know the answer that you've been seeking since h10 fell right into your lap who better to ask that question of how can you hate me we don't even know me than to ask it of somebody who would go so far as to join an organization whose sole apprentice has been hating people who do not look like them and who do not believe as they believe and this organization has been around for over a hundred years somebody would go that far to join the KKK sure damn sure have an answer to your question hmm so get back in contact with that guy and why don't you write a book because I had every book I still do every book written on the plan and they all were written by white authors obviously because a white author would have you know less fear of ramifications talking to a Klansmen or interviewing them would have easier access or could join the plan undercover get the story get out and write about it so my book became the first book ever written by a black father on the foofa's plan from the perspective of sitting down face to face I decided I would go around the country interview clan leaders there in Maryland where I live up north down south Midwest and West and I said I would start right there in Maryland so I got ahold of that guy and I wanted him to introduce me to the Klan leader from Maryland what was his reaction when um when I told you mine grabbing the microphone just pull it just pure little closer to okay perfect what was his reaction when you called up and said hey I want to know what makes you guys tick like why are you doing this Wow so funnier than that the I um I found the guys number you know from the bar from Silver Dollar Lounge and I called it it's like months later and it had been disconnected so I'd to track him down turned out he hadn't moved he didn't have a phone robbed they were giving an address and so I had no way of no no letting him know imma come over and talk to you so I showed up at his apartment one evening and knocked on the door and I hadn't see the guy in a while right he opens the door and sees because they're all you know what are you doing here and he and he steps out into the hallway and lifts up and down the hallway see if I brought anybody with me now and when he stepped out of his apartment I stepped in so we turn around he comes back in he was what's going on he's still playing what's going on I said yeah yeah yeah I'm playing but uh I need to talk to you with the Klan this is the Klan I said yeah you remember right it was well I was but I quit and he went into this long dissertation as to why quit the plan so long story short I said I want to meet the Klan leader did he quit the Klan because of his interaction with you no no no actually he lied to me yes he was no longer in the Klan but what happened to us he said he quit because he didn't even like their ideology I later found out in my research that and I got this from the guy who banished him the the leader of the of that particular Klan group vanished yeah yeah that's their term they banished you okay so every year claims were small shape first of all limited me it's written the hierarchy of the plan okay okay today there is no such thing as the Ku Klux Klan all right there used to be there today there are many Fuchs clan groups and they all are autonomous they use the same name Ku Klux Klan you might have the dixie Knights of the Ku Klux land the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan the rebel Knights on Iran and on these are all separate Ku Klux Klan groups they believe in the same ideology there were the same colors on their robes that designate their rank they have the same secret handshake this lends the secret handshake just like honey I'll show it to you later yeah yeah we'll do it later oh we can't tell people in case honey shakes your hand they don't even know I can't reveal clans secrets oh okay serious stuff oh yeah same passwords everything that passwords yeah you know understand the plan was formed in 1865 at the end of the Civil War and it was formed by by sits Confederate soldiers who were of Irish and Scottish descent and what they did was they borrowed the the rituals or similar rituals and names and a mystery from the Scottish Rite the Masons you know grin this or that I wasn't sure exactly precisely don't they have dragons yep yep okay so here's how the hierarchy works all right so I said over the years central split apart into different splinter groups a plan so and they're all arrivals with each other if you see a couple different plan groups out in public they will hold a you know unified front but behind closed doors they don't like each other really yeah you know we're real clan you know they're wannabe plan competition another thing because they may have been in the same van at one time and something happened somebody embezzled some plan dues or didn't get promoted you know or whatever so anyway if you have a chapter of your particular clan group in another state or in multiple states you may then consider yourself or your group to be a national clan Roop therefore you must have a national leader so oversees all the states in which you a chapter of your particular group so we call our national leader the president and clan terminology that person is known as the Imperial wizard anybody who is prefixed with the word imperial is that person is a national officer wizard being the top I sir Imperial wizard black the president an imperial clay Liffe will be like a vice president and he have secretaries treasurer's whole nine yards and then the next level down would be state the head of the state which we call the governor that person is known as a Grand Dragon anybody Grand is on the state level state officer dragon being the top governor a grand clay Liffe will be like a lieutenant governor and then secretary treasurer and then within the state who have counties the County leader is known as the great Titan anybody on the great level doesn't look as on the county level within the county we have districts what they call clavin's and we would call a district leader a mayor a councilman aldermen that individual is known as they as an exalted Cyclops so exalted Cyclops arrest them you would say sir exalted Cyclops yeah Wow that's hilarious so anyway um why Cyclops that's what that's the name they chose I mean when you think of the Cyclops thing one of those guys with one eye and yeah that's forehead yeah but you know they have all these different names and then below of the Cyclops are just you know rank-and-file Oh plain white robe Klansmen transwoman so um I wanted to do meet the I'll start in Maryland where I live I want to start with the Klan leader from Maryland now you could have several different Klan groups in the same state and they are rivals with each other and you didn't have chapters of those same clan rooms within your state so this guy named Roger Kelly was the Grand Dragon for the state of Maryland for this guy's Klan group and Roger Kelly at the time had the largest Klan group in Maryland how many members they don't give out numbers but to Roger had probably just over 200 which is a very high number for that time period sometimes with some they only have ten members some you know they have an internet presence but only one guy sitting in his basement you know putting on something but anyway this guy didn't I want him to introduce me to Roger Kelly I want to I want to Roger to be my first interview and he was terrified and I can't do it Darrell both of you in trouble I said but you're not in the plan anymore is it doesn't matter I cannot take a black man to the Grand Dragon so he was concerned generally for my safety as well as his own and I said well look why don't you give me mr. Kelly's address and phone number and I will go to his house and talk to him and he would not do that I begged and pleaded for 20 minutes he finally gave me mr. Kelly's address and phone number Wow on the condition that I not tell mr. Kelly where I got it and I said okay then he warned me he said Darrell well that guy could crack under pressure yeah oh I want to tell you what why he got banished okay but that's coming less coming okay he warned you yeah he warned me and he said Darrell do not you know look do not litter watch Kelly's house he'll kill you and then he said there's a bar up in Thurmont Maryland now you know Thurmont Maryland you don't know it for the Klan but that was one of their headquarters you know Fairmont Maryland because it's also the home of Camp David the presidential retreat and and the headquarters for the class right there right down the road that's hilarious yeah and thermal the time was an all-white town any time a black uh person moved in or interracial couple or a gay couple somehow mysteriously across will be burned in the yard and boom they move right out now that is not that does not mean that every person in thermite is in the Klan because they're not in fact most white people up there wanted the Klan gone but that's where it was headquartered so um he said there's a bar up there where they hang out every Saturday night and if I go to that bar I'm sure to find Roger Kelly and you know unless you're out of town rallying somewhere he says but I don't guarantee you that Roger will even talk to you but you're safer to approach him in a public place then corners property did he give you a photograph how'd you find no no I knew Roger kill he looked like this he was always in the newspaper on the news you know being interviewed something like that I never met him but I knew you know his image so he drew me a little map how'd it get to this place and so Saturday night I'm sure that thing off and um he uh he says um do not do not you know approach on his own property that's all right so I you know I'm a musician I'm working Saturday nights I can't go you know go chasing the Klan on Saturday night just a hobby yeah so at that point it wasn't as a full-time profession I call my secretary who books my band I said you know do I have any Sundays off I figured Sunday still part of the weekend maybe he hangs up there on Sunday to you she said she found me a couple Sundays and I said okay I'm gonna go find this Roger Kelly guy she was where I want to go with you now here's the problem she's white not that I have a problem with that but a black man walked with a white woman walk into a plan bar right could be more of it yeah yeah might find them sooner than you want so um I said I said you know marry and she said no no I want to go I said I know you know you got your own risk she said all right so we drove up there this particular Sunday evening it's about an hour and a half from my house and my guy gave me perfect directions there's the place right there boom we locked the car I walk up these little steps and I told her I said look I'm gonna walk in first you you walked right in behind me if I turn around and face you start running and I'll be behind you and she says all right let's go so we walk in by 7:30 on a Sunday evening place was practically empty I was saying maybe no more than six or seven people in there a couple guys in the back playing pool a guy at you sitting at the bar and the guy told me the this was a Klan bar and what he meant by Klan bar is the clan doesn't own it that's where they hang out he described it to me then when you walk in the door to your left would be a row of booths and the first two booths closest to the door we come in are reserved for the Klan so now you know I looked over there and nobody was sitting there so I'm looking around see if I recognize Roger Kelly and I didn't see but it looked like him which did not mean that some of these people were in Klan but I figured out what an answer my right was a um a long bar behind the bar was a mirror and scotch tape to the mirror was a picture an article from the Washington Post newspaper had a picture of Roger Kelly they'd interviewed him about something the n-double-a-cp was suing them over some kind of cross-burning ceremony or something and I recognized the article I said wow you know and there's a big confederate flag on the back wall like you have the US flag right there so I know I knew I was in the right place or the wrong place but now you wanna look at it right so I didn't see anybody look like Roger Kelly I figure no I drove an hour and a half to get up here you know I don't want to go home empty-handed but I didn't want to just walk up to somebody say hey scuse me sir you in the Klan so I said you know Mary and I are standing in the middle of this bar basically looking stupid and not knowing what to do so I said come on Mary let's go over there and sit in one of those first two booths because if the plan is in here they will come to us and then we'll know and then we can ask them hey you know we want to see Roger Kelly so woman over him was sat down nobody bothered us everything was cool eventually we might read it over to the bar I chatted up the guy sitting next to me like I was lost in some directions very nice gave me directions we failed so we left the next morning Mary walks out of my house I gave her a Rodger Keller's number Monday morning I said give him a call I said tell him that you're working for somebody who's writing a book on the Klan would he consent to sitting down with your boss and giving him an interview however do not tell mr. Kelly that I'm glad if he asked you know don't lie to him but don't lose to it don't give him reason to be curious she understood and the reason why I did not want him to know that was a I figured you know if he knew that um he may not give me the interview but if he agreed to do the interview then also he would see that I'm black 20 when he meets me and he could decide right then and there if he wants to continue it or not but I want him to see me first secondly um if he agreed to do the interview knowing that I was black he may have different answers prepared in the interim then he would have for a white interviewer as opposed to a black interviewer so I want to be spontaneous candid so she understood and that she called him and he agreed to do the interview so we set it up for the motel above the silver dollar lounge up there in Frederick Maryland and 5:15 on a Sunday afternoon and Mary and I got there oh man I don't know several hours early um I gave her some money sent her down the hall to get to us and sort of pop out of the Machine put it in the ice bucket fill it with ice get it all cold so I an active odd to offer on mr. Kelly a beverage a cold beverage I had no idea what this man would do once he laid eyes on me I saw that I was black we come in the room will he attack me or would he walk away you know but didn't even I want to be hospitable so she got the soda pop put an ice bucket set on the dresser now just by happenstance the way the room is laid out if you are standing in the hallway in the doorway of the room looking into the room you cannot see what's in the room is to literally walk in the door and turn to your right and the rooms laid out back there so there's no way if you know who's in the room standing in the hallway and it's like took advantage of that I took the lamp cables to the lamp off and put it in the most obscure corner of the room I put a chair on one side for me and a chair on the other side for mr. Kelly and I had a little bag beside it like duffel bag and in my bag I had a cassette recorder blank cassette tapes and copy of the Bible because the Ku Klux Klan claims to be a Christian organization and they claim that the Bible preaches racial separation now I've read through the Bible I've never seen that in there so I want to be able to pull out my Bible when he brings it up and say here mr. Kelly show me please in this King James Version chapter and verse where it says blacks and whites must be separate so I'm all prepared right right on time at 5:15 knock on the door I'm seated there where you can't see me into you come in the room and there he hops up and I am by the way Mary's white and as I mentioned before so she goes around the corner opens the door in walks what is known as the grand night honk the nighthawk in Klan terminology means bodyguard security so a grand night honk ooh get my aims if their names are so ridiculous cyclopses trans and wizards oh it goes on and on it goes on uh of course a grand club brand clay be grand Magi all kind of stuff anyway so the Grand Night Hawk which means slightly guarded the grand dragon like an imperial Nighthawk bee's body like an Imperial wizard and walks into this grand Night Hawk he's wearing military camouflage and on one side of his chest is that clan emblem a red circle white cross blood drop on the other side are the initials KKK and embroidered on his beretta said Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and on his hip he have a semi-automatic handgun in a holster he comes in and mr. Kelly is walking directly behind him in a dark blue suit and tie and when the Nighthawk turned the corner and saw me he just froze and mr. Killian that really that his Nighthawk has stopped short and he slammed into his back and knocked him forward and so they're stumbling around regaining their balance and looking all around the room and I'm just watching watching them and I just see the apprehension in their faces you know I could read it you know if they were they were thinking did the desk clerk give us the right room number you know or just an ambush and what's going on here so I stood up and I displayed the palms of my hands as to say hey I'm unarmed and I walked forward I stuck out my right hand I said hi mr. Kelly I'm Darrell Davis and he shook my hand he shook my hand and the Nighthawk shook my hand so so far so good I'm doing I'm doing well I said come on in come on in have a seat please mr. Kelly sat down even better and the Nighthawk stood at attention then mr. Kelly's right sanyas sit down officer them right and mr. Kelly says to me mr. Davis do you have any form of identification I said sure I produced my wallet and I handed him my driver's license he looked at he goes oh you live on such-and-such Street in Silver Spring now this had me a little concerned why is this man really must-read address all he has to do let's look at my name look at my picture match it up to me and give me back my license URI is like looking at my address is she gonna come burn across in my lawn what's up so I did not want to let him know that he had you know unnerved me a little bit I want to let him know under no circumstances are you to come to my house uninvited with any known nefarious intentions so I said to him I said yes mr. Kelly that is where I live and you live that and I named his house number and his Street and that the warmer God given me that way I was implying hey you know you know where I live I know where you live if you come visit me I'm gonna come visit you so they were so you know we're gonna confine all this visiting to this motel room so he smiled he nodded his head like he understood and I did not find out that day it was several months down the road that I had been presumptuous I had no reason to fear mr. Kelly coming to my house to do anything stupid what had happened was one of his Klan members lived right down the road from me I didn't know that mr. Kelly would have to travel down my street to get into that neighborhood where this clan member lived he simply recognized the name of the street that was it pure Cohen so he wasn't trying to threaten no not at all not at all so um you know and today that same Klan member is in a federal prison he'll be there for a long time he would later commit a hate crime which landed him the federal penitentiary so um anyway we got on with his interview and within 10 minutes mr. Kelly let me know why he could hate people like like me black people are inferior we're prone to crime there we were criminals that is why there are more blacks in prison than whites now that's a half truth there are indeed more blacks in prison than white people it's not because we were prone to crime like you said it's because of inequity in our judicial system where whites in the same predicament either don't get the same jail time or don't go to jail or whatever anyway so I'm a criminal I also said that black people are lazy we don't want to work while we prefer to skim the government welfare system we're looking for handouts and freebies and all that where white people you know you know they they work etc and also this book called the bell curve had just recently come out and yeah yeah you know the one yeah exactly so you know he jumped on that and he said well you know it's a known fact you know they say the world's biggest Authority is they you know you never see who they is right they say that uh you know black people have have smaller brains than white people and that's why their IQ is not as high so I guess the bigger the brain the more intelligent you are so now I'm sitting there listening to this guy tell me that I'm a criminal and I'm lazy and on welfare and my brain is smaller than his what he was saying was indeed offensive but here's the difference between me and most other people I did not take offense to it I'll tell you why I don't take offense to it why should I be offended by somebody who knows nothing about me he only met me ten minutes ago he sees the color of my skin and has made this assessment so why should I take offense to somebody who's telling a lie I just let him roll along with it where did you develop this kind of clarity but it's very unusual to not be offended when someone's judging you instantly in saying disparaging things about everyone mm-hm that looks anything like you just right off the cuff freely right in front of you how did you develop this clarity to just not be offended by that because it didn't make sense what he was saying of course so I figured you know how could I be offended by somebody who's who's all twisted right you know who obviously doesn't have the the foresight to see that he's wrong I want to learn more about this where it's coming from and so now see that's what usually stops a conversation and then and then people get into combat yes you know and then it goes nowhere so I was not offended by sudden roll on with it and then when he finished you know and he was he was proud of him you know explained to me you know why in the stance I so you know when will mr. Kelly I mean you know I'm not gonna be straight up with you I don't have a criminal record I have never been on welfare I've never measured my brain but I'm sure it's the same size as anybody else's you know whatever it would go on well every now and then the cassette would run out of tape right and I'd reach down into my badge and a lot of fresh cassette or mr. Kelly would pound the table mr. Davis the Bible says I reach down pull up the Bible every time I reach down like this to get the Bible or the cassette out of the bag Leonid Hawk would reach up onto his hip right now yes that was cool I mean I got that that's his job his job is to protect his boss he has no idea what's in my bag that's a little distracting though isn't it well yeah but you know I realize that these people are afraid of me right okay so you know I had to be cool I'm not afraid of them right so I have to be cool but but be transparent all right so you know he's doing his job and just like you know when will you get put well you know maybe you don't get pulled over as much as I do right by the cops tonight but you know I can tell you right now you know when when you get pulled over in a and a cop tells you to get your license or whatever and you you send the glove is in the glove box and you reach he gets a little more tighter on his hat you know he's protecting himself so the night hopper was doing that and I got that so um you just kept happening and after a while he realized there was no threat in the bag and I went in and out of the bag and I don't didn't move he was relaxed just over an hour into this interview there was a sudden a very quick I mean less than a second noise in the room which that was it and it happened so fast out of nowhere that my ear could not discern what it was I just came out of the blue and I'm sitting closer than you and I are right now the table was smaller to mr. Kelly and and and the Nighthawk alert was here and was right there and I flew up out of my chair hit the table um because my ear could not discern what the noise was I perceived it to be an ominous threatening noise and I knew I knew for a fact that mr. Kelly had made this noise where did it come from why did he make it um and how did I know that he made it I knew that because I didn't make it so you know you know if you if you don't want to accept responsibility or you know you're not responsible what do you do you assign blame alright and um so I scooped out of my chair hit the table and my mind was racing what did I just did what did I just say the cause mr. Kelly to go off and make some threatening noise you know I instantly put everything in perspective we're enemies he's a head of the clan I'm a black guy and now you know and then I I heard that former classrooms voice in my head Darrell do not fool with Roger Kelly he will kill you so I didn't want to die and in that split second I had gone into a survival mode and when you fear for your life that's what you do what was the noise I'm gonna taking us out yeah that was it and because it was unexpected and was so short I couldn't discern it I you know I I went into self-protect mode and I can't hit the table well when you fear for your life as I said you know you go into survival mode and in survival mode you know you're only you can only do like one of four things some people they just pass out they faint because the fear is so great their brain cannot process it and it shuts down and they pass out other people they their muscles contract they get tense and they can't move and you can be punching them kicking them and they won't even be deflecting the blows they're all constricted that's called paralysis by fear that you're too afraid to move the third thing people will do is to run away from whatever the fear is and that is your best option when something scares you that bad take off separate yourself as quickly as you can from that fear but as much distance between you and the fear as you can and that would have been my choice had it been an option but it was not an option for me because you cannot outrun a bullet and in a motel room right so I was not armed my secretary was not armed the only person who I knew for sure was armed was the Nighthawk you know you can see his gun right there and I didn't know if if mr. Kelly had a weapon up under his suit jacket or not all I knew was I don't want to die today so I chose the fourth option which was to do a preemptive strike you get them before they get you so when I flew out of my chair I was like dive across the table I was going to grab mr. Kelly grab the Nighthawk and slammed him down to the ground and take away the Nighthawks gun whoa no it was gonna happen that quickly okay well I think pretty fast sometimes a little too fast but I'm glad I hit the table because I'm looking right into his eyes trying to figure out like what did you do I didn't say one word to this guy but my eyes had locked with his eyes I was like I gotta see right through him and I let my eyes do the talking I knew he could hear my eyes um with my eyes was shouting at him saying what did you just do well his eyes had fixated on my eyes he didn't say a word either and but I could read his eyes his eyes are saying to me what did you just do and the Nighthawk had his hand on his gun looking at both of us like would either one of y'all just do Mary was sitting to my left on top of the dresser for there were no more chairs and she realized what had happened and she began explaining it to us when it happened again the ice in the ice bucket had begun to melt oh Jesus and the cans shifted down the ice so the tension was so thick yo get the ice in the bucket wasn't just like a normal like if there was ice in the bucket right now just noise yeah you were just on edge absolutely absolutely and the cans are just falling on me how long and you'd been talking for an hour yeah yeah and now they've been sitting there before mr. Kelly came in okay and we know we forgotten about it right I offered him a drink when he first got there and he said now but um what I was gonna get too is like so you're talking to him for an hour and in that hour is the tension the tension is not being alleviated at all he's explaining everything to you he's telling you his theories you're being very calm and just letting him speak yeah but you are still so on edge just being across from this guy that that sound right because it came out of nowhere you know it came out of nowhere and I mean yeah you know the detention hadn't had had de-escalated all that kind of stuff as we got more into the hour but I think you know we each were aware you know this is not a normal situation yeah you know black behind a Klan leader so you know each each one was still you know a little wary of the other kind of thing but we were mutually respectful okay so then it happened again and yeah we began laughing we began laughing all of us and how ignorant we had all been I won't say that this was a learning moment but it was a teaching moment and the learning would come later the the what was taught was this all because some foreign an underscore highlight circled the word foreign entity of which we were ignorant that been the bucket of ice cans of soda entered into our little comfort zone via the noise that it made we became fearful an accusatory of each other so the lesson taught is ignorance breeds fear we fear those things we don't understand all right if you do not keep that fear in check that fear in turn will escalate and breed hatred because we hate those things that frightened us if you don't check that hatred it in turn will escalate and breed destruction we want to destroy those things that we hate why because they frighten us but guess what they may have been harmless and we were just ignorant and we saw the whole chain unravel to almost completion the last component being destruction that stopped just short of that had I pounced across the table and hurt one of them or had the Nighthawk drawn his gun and shot one of us you know that that would have been the destruction fortunately that did not happen we did see that that whole chain unraveled to completion three years ago on August 12th 2017 in Charlottesville Virginia okay which is like two hours from my house on August 12 2017 in Charlottesville Virginia there was a lot of ignorance in Charlottesville there was a lot of fear in Charlottesville there was a lot of hatred in Charlottesville and what did it culminate in it culminated in destruction when a white supremacist got inside his vehicle and drove full force into a crowd of counter protesters trying to murder them he succeeded in injuring 20 and and murdering a young lady named Heather hire so that that whole chain is there if you want to solve this problem of racism we need to stop focusing on the symptoms don't worry about the fear don't worry about the hatred those are just symptoms like putting a bandaid on cancer you've got to go down to the bone and treat it at its source the source of all this is ignorant ignorance can be cured the cure for ignorance is called education so you fits the ignorance there's nothing to fear but you fear what you don't know when you fear the ignorance you know something there's nothing to fear if there's nothing to fear then there's nothing to hate if there's something to hate there's nothing to destroy so we need to focus on the ignorance and we address it with exposure and education and conversation we spend way too much time in this country talking about the other person talking at the other person talking past the other person why not just spend a little bit time talking with the other person so I said you know we carried on with the conversation had a good time you know nobody got hurt everybody laughed and I thank them shook their hands and they told me to keep in touch I'm thinking keeping shush you guys are homies yeah yeah but I did you know I called him say hey man I'm playing in your County come on see me how long did you guys talk that day oh maybe I don't know two and a half hours some like that did at the end after the ice that everything's sort of loosen up oh yeah yeah yeah so the laughter and then did the conversation loosen then the conversation loosened then I mean you know it wasn't like you know we all hug each other but though did you offer any counter to the things he was saying like yeah Charles Murray stuff absolutely absolutely how did he respond to that he said well yeah I don't know about that you know I know you know that you know these guys are doctors and dah dah dah dah you know so you know he looks to Authority of course but of course if you find Authority in the in the other direction what something's wrong with them you know so you take a narrative you know that fits that fits your narrative so like for information yeah so for example he did bring up that the Bible preaches racial separation and I gave him the Bible I said show me where so I forgot now these that chapter in verse 4 I think it's in Leviticus and I'm gonna paraphrase he pointed you this verse and I read it and it said something to the effect of our lamb should not lay with the wolf I said what does that mean Kelly he says what means the two different species should not lay together as a hold on I said blacks and whites are not two different species we are the same species two different colors oh no no no you know we're different species so you know he takes what he wants and twists it to fit the narrative okay so he had to say I thanked him I began calling him he talked to my kids he'd been the Nighthawk um III would invite him down to my house he came down to my house with the Nighthawk Wow and I thought was sit on my couch next to him sometimes not help get bored right and pull out his gun and twirl it on it and but what the fuck I felt I felt very comfortable with with them you know after time and so they at that point I would begin inviting over some of my black friends some of my Jewish friends some other white friends just like let them know in advance sometimes sometimes not so does not they say when they come over they see a Grand Wizard and a Nighthawk well or a dragon is he a dragon our wizard you know who still a dragon at that point okay okay and sometimes they freaked out and my band oh my god my band uh you know we I have a band van so the old my house get in the van we'll all right at the gig together especially it was far away and sometimes I'd want to stop at some Klan rally on my way to a gig and so so my god said yeah I'll say what I just meet you there yeah another ride with Jesus Christ see this became a full time here Jack figured it did well how much how quickly did it escalate so it went from this you you obviously had some you were compelled almost obsessed to meet this guy and get to the bottom of this thing that had been bothering you since you were young years old and and because my relationship with him was really growing it was turning into a friendship I mean you know I'm not gonna lie I'm I genuinely liked this guy and I could see him beginning to like me a lot um I did not like his ideology but I saw the human Humanity in him yeah and he was seeing the same thing in me we both want the same things all right and I and I began interviewing a lot of other clan people from different you know areas up north down South Midwest etc some would talk to me would not talk to me some want to fight me you know I I when I ran the whole gamut and I put it all in my book now I was seeing 14 over like two years he come down to my house or we go out and have lunch or dinner together Wow yeah and but during those two years and by the end of two years he was coming to my house by himself he trusted me that much no nighthawk you drive on down right and um by the end of two years he had not invited me to his house you know after two years he got promoted from from our Grand Dragon state leader to Imperial wizard national leader at that point he began inviting me to his house Wow he was the man in charge right so I go to his house I would see his clan then we'd have his clan meetings they have a Dan at the house well yeah they call it a den you know it's a room you know it's all that certainly without plan altar and chairs what's a clan altar look like it's a table that has a plan flag across it has that big red circle with a white cross and blood drop then they have a candles things like that and a note and a cross and the cross has some either candles on it looks like a flame or light bulbs so anyway and and a sword then across the table I take pictures take some notes and then he began inviting me to Klan rallies so yeah yeah and so I go to these Klan rallies and it had this big wooden cross the wooden cross is wrapped in burlap the burlap has been soaked and what they call Klan Cologne which is actually diesel fuel oil kerosene and the plants men and clans women are all in their robes and hoods and they have these torches the torches are lit and they walk in a Sano big wide circle around this cross which is in the center and then either the Imperial wizard or the Grand Dragon well will it will shout you know Klansmen halt and they'll all stop in place Klansmen face the cross and I'll turn in and face the inner circle and then he'll say for my god and they all repeat for my god and bow for my race for my race for my country for my country for my clan for my clan white power white power Klansmen approach the cross and they all close in and now they're all right there at the base of the cross Klansmen light the cross and they drop their torches at the foot of the cross and whoosh this thing is a flame and they stand there and admire this burning cross and then they give some speeches from the podium and then they have hot dogs and hamburgers and the rally is over you know and I'm sitting there watching this I'm taking pictures taking notes and how did it feel to be there watching all this uh it's definitely so different but you know I knew what to expect pretty much was I mean I read all these books yeah so you know I mean I know that's what they do it ran rallies it burned crosses now I love expressing to you that I learned there two times two occasions upon which they set the cross the flame as they put it they have a cross burning and across lighting the difference being across burning is when they take a 5 or 10 foot cross wrapping that burlap soaked in kerosene and and put it in your lawn because you're an interracial couple you're gay you're Jewish in a white neighborhood whatever the deal is that is meant as as intimidation it's a warning we know who you are cease and desists move out if you don't next time we come we mean business notice in a bomb your house or something okay when they do that that's called a cross burning all right across lighting is when they do love if they 30 or 20 or 30 foot cross at a ceremony and they parade around it and give a lecture that's got a cross lighting and that's what you want to I wanted the cross lighting how often they do those things as often as they want and several times a year what do they talk about like when they have meeting um the future of the white race you know and what they want you know and and with the Constitution Gaming to use them this is a white man's land this land was built by white people the Constitution was signed by white by white men this is their country you know immigration whatever issues are that the Browning of America ISM is a big topic or white genocide and same thing unless a white genocide they mean their race is getting smaller through miscegenation hmm so you know that is the table that they cover um it's pretty it's pretty interesting but check this out though our relationship would grow and grow and eventually mr. Kelly you know yeah well he got there he began he'd be the Rope sneak right in yeah he began believing whoa that's him right there in that photo with you that's them right there and it's grand dragon robe this is his imperial wizard robe right here and he gave his robe in his robe if he no longer believes and what it stands for Wow and and how many years is it there it is a hundred years to take before you just by being around talking to him for him it's probably like around maybe six and a half seven six and a half seven nine some summers as a matter of months a matter of a year or two years and so what'd you just talk about the Hat that's the hood yeah oh Jesus and you see this is this top part is the hood and this lower portion here that's what's called them the mask and remember someone anonymity they don't want you to know who they are they wear this in the house which is attached by three snaps or velcro just remove it they don't fear in the face is exposed as you saw in that picture so what what is it like you said you guys got closer you said you became more and more friends you started visiting each other yeah did he ever say you know I'm starting to think this is bullshit yeah but how did he say it um he called me up one day and he told me yeah I want to talk to you about and I said okay you want to meet for dinner I said sure so I drove to Frederick and met him and said me they said you know I'm quitting the clan I'm leaving it and he's the top dog who's top dog you gave it all up and here's the thing um he did a smart thing you did a good thing he didn't hand it down he shut it down Wow yeah um you know did he convince the other people in the clan that whether they had their choice to do whatever they wanted to do right a lot of them left a lot of them left as well then there were those who tried to keep it going but you know but failed did he use you as an example when he was speaking to them they knew why he did it he receives him hate me he began receiving some email from from some of his own members anonymously the same kind of hate mail that at one time he would send out to people Anonymous was nothing back to him you know yo you're in bed with Darrell Davis you're a nigger lover all that kind of stuff unsigned you know the same stuff that he would put out to other people and so he he began seeing himself in the mirror and then so that was that was very crucial and and I have repeated this process many times with different people do what it what is the process do you went like when you're talking about like the charles murray stuff the bell curve stuff how do you refute that what are you saying to him I'm saying him look mr. Murray anytime you want to prove something you find something that fits your narrative yes you can find some black person who has are very low like you okay if I'm gonna if I work for Ford and and I want and I want to prove that my car is better than Chevrolet then I'm gonna find a Chevrolet that isn't that doesn't run very well hmm you know I'm gonna do it that way so I I refute it mr. Murray's and his uh his partner but you guys who wrote the book are there they're there documentation and and I'll and see they they they go buy things that they can see and understand I'm gonna give you an example of something that's gonna and help you understand this Cyclops was riding around in my car one day with me he's sitting in my passenger seat right and we're driving I'm driving wrong and somehow we got on the topic of black crime and he made a statement he said well you know you know we all know they say that again that they authority say that that black people have a gene in them that makes them violent and I'd heard that before from other Klan people you know that's one of their narratives and you know the wild black savage kind of thing and I said what are you talking about he says well who's doing all the drive-bys and carjackings in Southeast he was referring to Southeast Washington DC which is predominantly black area some whites lived there it's predominately black very high crime ridden I said okay it's black people I said but that's what lives there I said who's doing all the crime in Bangor Maine white people because that's what lives there I said you know you're not even considering the demographics is that no no you all have this gene in blah blah blah so you know he's gonna shut me down and I said look he's right here I said look I'm as black as anybody you know I said I have never done a drive-by I am never gonna carjacking how do you explain that this man did not wait one second he answered me like that he said your gene is latent hasn't come out yet how do you argue with somebody who's that far and I feel right I mean you can't even bite into that and chew on it right so I'm dumbfounded and I'm speechless I'm just driving along he's over here all smooth and you see nothing to say so my thought about it and I said you know they say I use his authority I said they say that all white people have a gene that makes him a serial killer is that how do you figure that I said name me three black serial killers he couldn't do it here I'm gonna give you one I named one for him I say here just just name me two he couldn't do it I said Charles Manson Jeffrey Dahmer Henry Lee Lucas John Wayne Gacy Albert DeSalvo the Boston Strangler Ted Bundy as David Berkowitz Son of Sam Ed Gein Ed Gein right Ed Gein and his crazy machines to skin people okay I said son they're all yeah he said you know I've never killed anybody I said you're just hasn't come out yet that's stupid I said well duh I said you're right it is stupid I said but it's no more stupid me to say that about you than what you said about me and he got very quiet but I mean you could almost see it Joe this one here is ending yeah and now he's thinking about it and then he changed the subject but within four or five months he left the Klan Wow based on that conversation Wow and his robe was the first row by ever got Wow so he came to you and gave you the robe we said first he said no he didn't come to me give me the rope he called me and and I wasn't in that area and yeah and I he said you won't you want to get together I got together with him and he went to go over to the courthouse for something he'd been in some kind of trouble he would go pick up something in the courthouse so I gave him a ride over there and he told me he was he was like with the Klan you know and he thought a lot about what I said and I said what are you gonna do with your stuff he said trash it I said I said no don't don't trash it I said give it to me he says you want me you want my room and all my class stuff and I said yeah he goes why why would you want that I didn't know why but something told me just take it there I'll just take it and I said I don't know what I'm gonna do with the bus yeah I said yard I do want it so we went back to his apartment now I've never been in his apartment that I'd met him outside outside in the driveway or whatever a parking lot and I said come on in and so I'm walking up the stairs them to the department I'm thinking you know I'm not getting set up here you know but I walked on in and his fiancee was sitting on the couch glance woman I've seen her before and sat down and talked with her and he went down the hall through this room he came back when we came back he got a hefty trash bag went back there again and came back with this trash pile all loaded up and his robe his hood clanton belt buckle never clam down oh yeah that plant I Clips all kinds of stuff man and his certificate of membership um all kind of stuff in this baton gave it to me and I said okay thank you you know and I I didn't know why I wanted it but I just knew I should have it well first of all is history okay and you don't destroy history the good the bad the ugly in the shameful is still American history and the KKK I've said it before is as American as baseball apple pie and Chevrolet you know it's a shameful part of our history but it is our history nonetheless now I know what I'm doing this stuff I got my 501c3 I'm gonna have a museum one day put all this stuff in there Wow what's a 501c3 so it makes you tax exempt ah yeah KKK conversion museum yeah yeah pictures of you with the dudes right next to the robe and each most of them most of them I do and so I began collecting all this kind of stuff this is well here this one this is a grand dragon robe Green is the sign for the Grand Dragon and Confederate flags here you know plant patches whose is that who gave you that this guy Bob white Robert white Robin white used to be the Grand Dragon of Maryland for another Klan group which was a rival to Roger Kelly's group all right when I when I first heard a Bob white I was in my late teens and he I heard him I heard about him on the news he had been busted arrested and put in jail for conspiring to bomb his synagogue in Baltimore upon Liberty Road the Liberty Rose a synagogue and he was convicted he went to prison for four years this is before I started writing the books all the time sorry I just remembered him and then he got out after doing his time continued running the Klan and then some years later he got busted again assault with intent to murder two black men with a shotgun all right understand something as a plan leader you don't make any money or not a lot unless you're embezzling money from the dues a lot of people do that that's what causes these splinter groups if you're a leader like a wizard or a dragon you might get like a small stipend out of the dues but not enough to pay your rent or put fooling your table so you have to have a regular job you know Cyclops wizard dragon whatever is all just titles like Boy Scout leader you have to have a regular job to pay your rent and mortgage this man's regular job when he was doing all this nonsense following places and stuff Baltimore City police officers Wow this is his police officer uniform okay yeah he was not an undercover cop in the Klan gathering intelligence it was a bonafide Klansmen on the Baltimore City police force okay uh and they're more they're more okay um but he went on this guy was vehemently vehemently anti-semitic and racist and very very violent but he went on to become one of my best friends and he gave me his Klan robe his police uniform and I do a lot of lecturing all over the country and stuff did he quit the police force he was forced to quit the police force or be fired the police force Baltimore City police force I mean even just last year they had a consent decree from the Department of Justice against them they are very racist and very corrupt what they would do is they would turn up and I to the clansmen on the force because you know as a police officer you're not allowed to belong to any subversive groups alright then we turned a blind eye as long as the guys would not bring unwarranted attention to the to the department and I just keep keep your stuff you know whatever well you know he wouldn't get him busted for for planting a bomb near synagogues and and you know firing a shotgun and all that kind of stuff at black people um so they they you know they get in you know hey you know you got a yeah you got to retire or we put off the force actually you you causing those too much publicity this is before he left the Klan yeah so what did he do after he did that well get another job another job he began dealing in a homing pigeons ridiculous way to transmit information it's perfect for someone's in something like the class but job you know I mean you have to work yeah and but I'll tell you something though not all of them in fact probably not most of them but some of the of the hardest-working people that I've ever seen in my life has been in the plan I'm serious work I mean working hard you know to make a living and support are their families is there a universal factor like when you talk about how they got involved in it is the neighborhood is it people that they knew they are family well let me give you an example of why people join the plan they're different reasons in some cases it's my grandfather was in the Klan my daddy was in the Klan so I'm in the Klan and my kid doesn't be in the Klan it's a family tradition right passed down and when you are dealing with somebody with with that kind of tie that you know a generational thing it makes it a little longer for them to come out because it's hard to break family tradition right another reason why people join you take a depressed town I'd like a coal mining town in West Virginia or Scranton Pennsylvania some like that where people who are not racist they they're hard workers they did call all their lives grandfather dug hole father does go now you don't though did cold after high school so all you know if I were to hand one of those people a vacuum cleaner I say vacuum this rug they wouldn't know how to do it all they know is digging hole and they're happy they are making their paycheck they're feeding their family paying their rent whatever you know they're not concerned about people's color they're happy but then the company gets greedy and decides hey you know what we can save money make a lot more money if we lay off our our employees and hire some of these are these are immigrants whether they're legal or illegal because they'll work for for less than half of what we're paying our people right and so they lay off these people and how are these people who just came over to the country looking for work and and they pay the next to nothing so now these white people who would never racist or out of a job the bank is going to foreclose on their trailer or their house or whatever they can put food on their table the Klan sees these things and the Klan will come into a depressed town like that and hold a rally and see the blacks have the n-double-a-cp the Jews had the ADL you know nobody stands up for the white man but the Klan come join us we'll get your job back you know you that was your job your jobs not gone but you're gone and now some some nigger or some spics got your job you know well why is that come join us so these people have said we're never racist you know they began thinking well you know they're they're right my job is still there and I worked that job for 25 years you know and I got laid off for no reason and someone else is doing my job so what do I have to lose give me an application and they sign up so they're like you know coerced into this group they may be a little easier to come out you know you're talking with them then third reason why people would join if somebody relocates to a town that is very clan oriented a lot of people who kindly don't live there and stuff you know if you want to do business in that town you've got to assimilate you know you join the local Country Club local Chamber of Commerce and the local KKK so you know those are those different reasons why people will uh will join and depending again you know depend upon how strong the ties are why they join can determine the long their longevity or their or their their hold on it what is the one that took you the longest to crack well I'll be honest with you I never set out to convert anybody and even though in the media it will say black musicians in first 200 Klansmen or X amount of Klan members I didn't convert anybody I didn't even convert one of them I will say that I am the impetus for over 200 leaving the plan yeah I know that for a fact and people have told me yeah you know I'm out of because of you things like that but I did not convert them they converted themselves I gave them reason to think about their direction in life and they thought about it and thought you know I need a better path and this is the way to go because what would happen will be this it's like you know when you when you believe in something um some people just believe in it just because it's it's that person saying it right like in a way we have a current president we're in no matter what he says some people are gonna believe and others are disbelieve all right um and that and that can go for any president really if you're a big fan no matter what you do what you say you have a base that's gonna believe you so I would tell these people when I saw fault with what they were saying in their ideology I said well let me tell you why I think this is incorrect and I lay out the facts for them and then they now then I can see it right then and there when they go home that check it out and that rolls around in their head and they began thinking you know Darryl does have a point but he's black but he's black but he does have a point but he's black so even though they know it's true they don't want to believe it was I'm black so it's like that cognitive dissonance thing going on so they have a strand internal struggle and they have to make up their own mind do I continue living a lie or do I turn my life around and live the truth well it's also Lewis you're a very articulate guy and I'm sure a lot of these people are not very educated so the continued exposure to you is probably confusing to them as well because you're so good at forming sentences and speaking in calm and you know the words flow so smoothly out of your mouth and you have these wonderful it's wonderful grasp of the English language they're probably like I think this guy might be smarter than me let me say something though don't be fooled you know we think of Klan people I say we are the people in general because most of our exposure to it is is that the Jerry Springer Show right or Geraldo where they throw Cheerios time yeah third grade dropout right on a thing caricature yeah and those are the types that you know that they would bring on the show for whatever reason and I know plenty of those types trust me those stereotypes do we exist but they can go anywhere from third grade dropout all the way to president of the united states president warren g harding was sworn into the Ku Klux Klan in the green room of the White House what year was that whatever year he was president so was my host 65 oh I well we got 65 1920s right was he was he with the tea with a tea down the dome what it was um President Harry Truman before Harry Truman became president he was a member of the Klan for a short time that's right Harry Truman who an integrated the army all right Wow he joined for a short time he didn't like it he got out um Supreme Court justice Hugo black Hugo black was in the Klan at the time he was appointed to the Supreme Court he had to leave the Ku Klux Klan to sit on this on the Supreme Court as a Justice Morton more recently um Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia who just died a few years ago he was a Klansman in the 1940s he was a grand legal Kleagle means a recruiter grand mean state so he was a recruiter for the state of West Virginia a grand legal in the 1940s and then yo he later renounced it and stuff yeah so you know all kinds of educational backgrounds particularly a long time ago yeah yeah I mean it was considered the an honorable white man Society at the time you know they didn't allow women in the Klan and they had a women's auxiliaries now they allow women but women is still a male chauvinistic organization so women are making progress even in the class oh yeah yeah but but but they cannot hold the highest offices they can't be a grand dragon or dragging this when did you start on this what year was it I started how you know meeting them and all yes or researching them just when when did you start meeting them when G when did you have this meeting after the first the first friendly meeting that I had with with the Klan was in the bar that was 1983 but um so my first encounter with the Klansmen was that the year before and I didn't know he's the Klansmen I beat him up so this but the bar things at e3 yeah I was wondering it if it was pre or post the Dave Chapelle bit that's why and what's funny is you know everybody asked me you know did you see that yeah the Clayton Bigsby or whatever yeah yeah you know they think it's hilarious but I'm gonna tell you something it's not hilarious okay Dave Chappelle he's a comic genius he's great okay and perhaps if I had never done what I've done I find a lot of humor in it yeah but I tell you what he's never been to a Klan rally I have I've been to plenty of them those things are not funny they are not funny okay they are a pressure cooker waiting to go off and if that fat was not really you know released it's gonna explode and we saw that in Charlottesville well you know that he his joke was oh yeah and how ridiculous it was yeah absolutely my fault aligned yeah i'm not voting in this black right exactly I understand we've seen from your perspective it's not funny yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah I mean everything but uh but you know we shouldn't take take racism you know we need to take it more seriously than we do and I'm gonna tell you something our country I'm gonna tell you where it's headed so you understand our country can only become one of two things it can become number one that which we stand up I'm sorry that which we sit back and let it become or number two that which we stand up and make it become so we are charged with this question do I want to sit back and see what my country becomes or do I want to stand up and make my country become what I want to see and I've chosen I've chosen the latter but I don't like the direction it's going in well you've chosen a very noble not just the latter but a very noble path I mean what you've done is pretty incredible in the amount of time and energy that's required for you to get close to these guys and the fact that you could be doing a lot of the things you're a successful musician yeah I'm sure you have friends I'm sure you're busy but you chose to span an extraordinary amount of time pursuing I would much rather be on stage playing music and making people happy and closing the job up and dance and carry on and sing along than them in attending Klan rallies but I find it more and more necessary because we have dropped the ball you know the topic that you and I are discussing right now you know 20 30 years ago would have been taboo talking about on radio or whatever people people did not want to discuss it hmm and you know and I know we can talk about that you keep in the closet you know because out of sight out of mind denial and and denying it does not make it go away you can't see it it's always there so now we're forced to address it but let me tell you where it's going which will just what a lot people do not talk about and don't understand well first of all let's let's let's define what it is back in the day there was only one group the Ku Klux Klan they were the first and the largest gang if you will of racists at one point in time they had four million members all right it's pretty big gang Mama's on about in the 1920s and into the early 30s how many people are even in America in 1920 Oh more than that left more than yeah but I mean how many it wasn't even 100 million I don't even know what Cindy I bet it's probably about 80 90 million oh we can look at first yeah because if there's 4 million that's a straw Denari number and the majority of them were in Indiana Indiana Indiana yeah 110 million Wow and how many four Lorien that's fucking crazy yeah yeah so it's basically somewhere in the neighborhood of four percent of the entire population of the country was in the fucking clan ya know at that time it was called white supremacy because that's what they believe in you know this is our country we're in charge with supreme didn't call it the Klan yeah it was a plan but the ideology was called white supremacy and a lot of history started in 1865 a lot of violence a lot of you know lynchings brahmins you know dragging people behind vehicles all kind of stuff began happening and oh if it became a lot of baggage with the term white supremacy where a lot of white people did not like black people or did not like Jewish people they did not want to participate in in this night writing you know lynchings and murder and all the foul stuff either for for moral reasons or legal reasons whatever that the membership began dwindling who began dropping out all right it was too too violent for them this white supremacy word became unpalatable and became negative when the membership decreased they had to rebrand so they they changed it from white supremacy to white separatism I'm a white separatist I don't hate black people or Jewish people I just love my own lamps and Jews should be able to have their own schools their own neighborhoods their own churches their own workplaces we should be able to have ours and that way we don't have to mix oh yeah yeah I like that idea sign me up I'm a white separatist ship began increasing and of course you know the more people you have somebody's mom started acting up so here comes the violence so now the term white supremacy also became unpalatable and people began dropping out so membership went down again and then they had to rebrand next they call themselves white Nationals or white nationalists all right now what is a nationalist a nationalist is someone who loves their country like the patriot so you're a nationalist I'm a nationalist why do we have to say white nationalist why don't you set my nationalist right but no white nationalist so yeah I love my country and I'm white sign me up here comes the violence so once again they rebranded and now they call it B all right and I hate to use a cliche but as I say a rose by any other name is what still a rose so you call whatever you want to call it it's still white supremacy do you think that Charlotte was a wake up call Charlottesville excuse me yes it was from me because I knew that it still existed but I didn't think they would show themselves publicly like that and the age of the Internet and walked down the street with tiki torches let me tell you something let me I'm gonna show you something okay okay the rally there was called unite the right rally I know the guy who put it on I know all the speakers there I know them personally all right what was your understanding as to why they were having this big unite the right rally I only knew of it peripherally I didn't know why they were doing it I just had probably heard it on the or something like that went on and then when I saw the KKK showing with those guys the Charlottesville guys with the torches with those KKK or was it another white supremacy move all of the above they had different different whose unite to write all the different right-wing groups came right League of the South the Ku Klux Klan National Socialist Movement our different entity Socialist Movement yeah the National social life with Nazis exactly a necessarily yeah okay they were there too now in the media they they gave a reason as to why why were they there what were they protesting what was their reason for being there and Charlottesville I have no idea okay well if the media put out was they had come together to protest the removal of the Confederate statues okay you call that yeah I remember they were tearing down those statues right I had a conversation with somebody about it those statues most of them were very cheaply made and he stood up during the Civil Rights Minh right exactly yes yes okay so that was not the reason why they had the rally okay that's what the media said okay any time okay the reason why they had this rally there yes there were some people who went there to legitimately oppose the the removal of those statutes robert e lee and stonewall jackson whoever else but the majority people who came there were there to start the initially initial steps of the race war Wyatt that's right the race war okay the white supremacist have been predicting and had been preparing for a race war just like Dylann roof was trying to start the race whereas what he said when he went to that black church and gunned up the place a lot especially trying to the guy who shot all those people in El Paso he said the race war all right here here's what you know any time you want to occupy a piece of public property because you want to have a rally a demonstration or even if you want to set up a lemonade and hotdog stand it was gonna be on public property you must have a permit right you go down to the city get an application state you know fill out your name and state your purpose you cannot very well say on the application I want to start a race war you will not get the permit all right so you you provide some quasi legitimate excuse my great-great-great ancestors fought in the Confederacy that's my heritage I don't want you messing with it okay that's legitimate you sign off here's your permit sir and now you can occupy that corner of 12th and main from 12:00 noon to 4:00 p.m. or whatever okay so they went through all the procedure they legally got a permit to have their United to write rally under false pretense all right now two things anybody who knows American history knows that they were also blacks and also Jews who fought in the Confederacy all right the black slaves had to fight for their slave owners in the south there were a number of Jewish slave owners they didn't want to give up that free labor so blacks Jews and whites fought together in the Confederacy against blacks whites and jews in the Union my great-great-great ancestors were slaves who also fought in the Confederacy I have ancestors who fought in the Confederacy all right my parents are from Virginia Roanoke and Salem I was born in Chicago because that's where my dad was working at the time but Virginia is is was the seat of the Confederacy all right so there are black people today and some Jewish people who honor the Confederacy they don't condone slavery but they honor the Confederacy because of their great great ancestors they honor and house all like they have Confederate France has taken place mostly in the south so there's black people in a Cell that have Confederacy find tomorrow that you'll find them yeah and no they don't don't slavery they're just honoring the Confederacy close your ancestors were indicted or whatever I honor my ancestors however I don't honor the Confederacy me personally if some of the blacks in Jews want to do that that's their business I don't do it so and ironically ironically this is a historical fact the Confederate Army was integrated the Union Army was segregated all right which don't make any sense okay so here here you know we're we're we're fighting to free slaves and then the defender army has Blacks and Jews ensue and uh and whites were fighting together and the Union had them all segregated it doesn't make sense but it does because it's all so ridiculous yeah that's what humans are exactly exactly you got it you know irrationality yeah so okay now if if Blacks and Jews and whites could fight together a hundred and fifty years ago why can't they march together in 2017 wouldn't it make more sense and give more credibility to your cause if your cause was truly to preserve those statues why not invite descendents like yourselves of Blacks and Jews to march with you in Charlottesville and say hey that's my heritage - leave it alone would that not add more credibility that certainly would but what what are the numbers can you get even if you only got five or ten right okay that still would lend some credibility okay okay but instead so they're claiming this is the heritage instead of inviting including Blacks and Jews they excluded them in 2017 so if Blacks and Jews wanted to march they would not let them yeah exactly I mean they're I don't know there were any who did or did you implicitly stated there's no white people this is unite though are united - right okay you have white white supremacist organizations so instead of including Blacks and Jews you know heritage should include everybody in that heritage you talk about the good you want to preserve the Confederacy well guess what there were blacks in the Confederacy you know that that's historical fact they were Jews in an in the Confederacy the Confederacy was simply a reflection of the south okay so instead of including them they excluded them and they marched through the University of Virginia campus with their tiki torches and the streets of Charlottesville yelling and screaming anti-semitic and racial epithets what does that tell you it tells you their protests was not about heritage it was about hate that's number one number two nobody in Charlottesville or anywhere else ever met their great great great ancestors who fought in the convince Confederacy right those people were long dead and gone by 1865 and if you weren't even born then right now you tell me but it's okay you know you can honor people that you don't know all right that's fine but how do you honor your great-great-great ancestors in the Confederacy and at the same time you dishonor the very ancestors who you do know the very ones who raised you your fathers your grandfathers and if you're lucky enough you may have met your great-grandfather these people many fathers of these people in Charlottesville many fathers grandfathers and great-grandfather's lost their lives fighting not in the Confederacy but fighting in World War two and who were they fighting in world war two the nazis so how do you tell me you're gonna honor your great-great-great ancestors and you're gonna walk down the streets of Charlottesville side-by-side with people wearing swastikas we went to war against the Nazis why are you marching with Nazis and flying swastikas now now wait wait so is um what did the Nazis have to do with our heritage right the not just had no heritage in Charlottesville in fact the Nazis weren't even in existence during our Civil War Adolf Hitler was not even born during our Civil War so what were the Nazis doing in shortest Ville it wasn't about heritage it was about hate and that's what the media failed to tell us because what the media did was they went to City Hall for this public record it's pulled pulled the permit and we oh there they are to to protest the statutes I took it verbatim and reported like that didn't do the background check now was it a small percentage of them that were the ones that were marching with the torches and the swastikas now they join into the entire group was the entire group all about hate then I was everybody was there I would say probably about 95% of people there were over about 8mm and so there was a few misguided people that were there because they really thought they were protecting their southern heritage right and they were lumped in with all these other people that used it as a ruse to sort of set up this hate you I hate meaning to have to have a permit how many people went there for that thing I mean there were there were more protesters of course yeah as usual which languages should be um I I don't have the exact numbers myself I'm not I'm shredding to get them okay yeah they they get skewed from either side the police will tell you one number and the people they were taking another number the guy who was the the killer that ran those people over James fields that that guy seemed twenty years old the epitome of a lost soul that got sucked into a horrible ideology it was not very smart and that that must be a large percentage of what they prey on absolutely lost people and then there's not how a good works sure and they give you a meaning and a reason and heritage to defend and then everyone is in a status right and a bunch of crazy names like Cyclops and you know and I know Susan bro Susan bro is the mother of Heather hire the girl who was I was murdered and run run down by James fields that 20 year old boy threw his life away and it was premeditated yeah you know he had set some stuff on the internet before even going there yeah and praise Hitler and so forth and so on you know these are things you know that we have to be very much aware of and which is why today you know I I'm helping a an organization as an advisor in fact we're putting on a festival of ideas this year in in June we've already got a Cornel West and Temple Bill Ackman and and several other people who have already committed to doing this festival of ideas to D radicalize the Internet and there's a there's a new internet platform who's been around us for just over almost two years has already gotten two million members called minds minds I got your mind yeah I've had the guy who created it yeah Bill upman yes yeah yeah fantastic guy fantastic guy he and another co-founder uh but they put together this thing and they brought me on as an advisor and we're gonna put on this festival I'm bringing in some formers now now the head of the of the NSM is a very good friend of mine and what is the NSM a National Socialist Movement they're not not before going slowly convert those guys as well well yeah he's out now because of you no no I I was a contributor okay but he saw the light and he's a good guy and and he's helping to get others out you have an amazing ability to forgive people that other folks would write off for life other people would think that those people were horrific monsters that aren't worthy of salvation don't get me wrong there are some of those people there are some horrific monsters on all sides who some of whom will go to their grave being hateful with violent and racist or anti-semitic there is no change in them whatsoever but I can tell you this if somebody of that of that attitude or that beliefs you know they're there and you're here on the spectrum at opposite ends if they're willing to sit down and have a conversation no matter how extreme they may be there is the opportunity to plant a seed but but the important thing is anybody can plant a seed but the follow up is what's important you have to nurture that seed you must water it all right so it grows as you you know when you're here you think you have nothing in common but if you spend five minutes with your worst enemy you will find something in common you will find something in common and then you begin nurturing those commonalities yeah okay and you're and you're you're closing that gap so now you're about right here so now you have formed a relationship you've gone from here to a relationship and now you begin nurturing that relationship and you're closing it in and when you get about to hear you found a lot of commonalities and now you've made a friendship all right and when you get there the trivial things that you have in contrast such as the color of your skin or whether you go to a church a temple or mosque or a synagogue begin to matter less and less if you begin to see that you know um I and I not be honest you know the most important thing that you have in any endeavor is your credibility your credibility you only have one opportunity to make especially in this kind of thing to make a good first impression you may you may have a second or third opportunity to to to impress somebody but you only have one opportunity to make a good first impression and most people would judge you by their first impression of you so when I would meet these people I'm as transparent as I can be I'm honest I don't lie to them I let them know where I stand but I'm willing to listen to them I want to hear why I'm saying enlighten me teach me why I should believe the way you believe in see things you know I'm here to learn from you now how did you start the conversation with this National Socialist Movement guy anyway same that same way and what was the conversation like with that well he believes and he believed at the time in the ideology of Adolf Hitler you know the master race how old was this guy when you met him I met him in 2016 he he just left last year and he'd been the commander for 27 years that's it you have an amazing gift like the ability to just slowly talk to these people and talk some sense into them and the fact that you're willing to spend the time to do that that is we have to do that we have to do that I mean what choice do we have you know otherwise we're gonna self-destruct yeah now I will say you know Joe I I have been between traveling with my parents as a child in the Foreign Service and today as a professional musician playing all over this country and around the world when you combine those travels together I have been in a total of 57 different countries on six continents so I've been extremes from from you know three years old all the way to you I'll be 62 in March I've been exposed all my life to a wide variety of religions cultures traditions ethnicities from all over and no matter how far I've gone from the United States no matter how many different people I've met I can conclude at the end of the day we all human beings we may practice different things have different cultures different beliefs but we all are human beings and one of my very favorite quotes of all time is by Mark Twain and it's called the travel quote and Mark Twain said travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow mindedness and many of our people needed sue early on these accounts broad holds some charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime and that is so true perhaps if I had not done that traveling and been exposed to different things would I be doing this today maybe not but I think the future of this are things like like what bill altman is put together this minds.com people should check it out my eyes calm all little change minds calm they can follow me there at Darrell Davis where it's a platform for free speech free speech and when you can come and express your ideas not be you know kicked off from the tough stuff yeah there's gonna be protocol you know where you know you never be able to threaten people and cause some harm to things like that but you allow people with some of these toxic ideologies to come on in your mind and then you engage that and we engage them and and talk it could be about about politics have you it could be about technology whatever have you had luck talking to people just directly online cuz my perspective is that one of the things that makes this work is that you're very personable and that you know you're you you're just you being around you you're a very nice guy to be around I that probably helped them get closer to you and get to appreciate you that's that's the credibility I'm talking about because you know if like for example I don't meet somebody one time and that's a you know they're stripping themselves of their Robin Hood I think yes okay it may take repeat visits but that's in person is what I'm saying yeah like talking to people online well it's very difficult to get through to people yeah it is but you know what people have watched or seen things online about me and then have emailed me that tons of emails people in the client people did not see movements or whatever was so hey you know I appreciate what you said you know you know you gave this person a fair shake I wasn't really expecting that from a black person or something like that mhm and it wasn't that I was you know kissing up to somebody no you know I'm gonna be fair and be transparent and because of my credibility that affords me a second visit with them and a third knows if they didn't like me if their first impression of me was this guy's an ass you know and I say you know can we meet next week now I'm done with you the only person I've ever known or heard of that's been like radically converted just online was Megan Phelps do you know she is sure sure I know yeah I I never met Megan I I had conversations with Rachel who was crazy no this is Rachel the mom or one of the sisters Megan's sister yeah mehgan's very very nice person yeah it's hard to believe that she was ever locked into the Westboro Baptist Church and her husband her now-husband actually converted her by talking to her on Twitter of all things might be the greatest thing that's ever been accomplished on Twitter that's right yes so do you do you participate in other social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram or any of that or do you just use mines I'm gonna focus on mines I think mines has the best platform again like I said is transparent anybody is welcome you know there's two million members now yeah I think and growing and you know Facebook you know will kick you off for certain things mines and as I do that I mean you know they won't allow you to threaten somebody does mines have the same sort of algorithm that directs things towards you that you're interested in that could facilitate people getting upset you know Facebook does that yeah and it turns out that most of what people are interested in is what upsets them yeah yeah no they don't operate like that yeah I think it's worth anybody to check out you know and people get frustrated you know I'm getting off Facebook because I hate all this arguing so on and you know you can come here and and talk to some you know be listen people have a hard time getting together Thanksgiving because of our current political climate where somebody you know voted for our current president and some other family members did not vote for that person right um people should be able to families should be able to talk about that and and respect the fact that your brother or sister voted for for our president and you didn't you know that should be fine you know let's let's discuss it we know what impressed you about him what didn't impress you why didn't you vote for him and do it with civil discourse we have lost the art of civil discourse and and mines is going to restore that but that's what we're working on the that's I'm glad you said that that's one thing that I've learned how to do by doing this podcasts learn how to talk to people better learn how to really listen to people and mean when I first started this podcast ten years ago our problem wasn't very good at it you know it didn't really have any experience doing it mostly what I was doing was me talking like doing stand-up comedy tomorrow I was talking to my friends the the civil like social civil discourse like being able to sit down with people and calm each other down and talk and have compassion genuine compassion for each other and just listen to each other is one of the lost arts in in human interaction because you know what it's because we see only what the person did we don't you know in terms of who they voted for or what they believe and what they did you know what group they joined we don't see what led them yeah to that and because we don't talk to them right you know when you know we're only interested interested in the result like let's go back to Roger Kelly black people are criminals why why are they criminals well how do you say that well because Darrell you know there are more blacks in prison than there are whites he sees the result yeah not seeing what led up to that right so that's you know that's where we lose well it's also it's very difficult for people to actually have conversations like most people are committing to text messages and emails and occasionally phone calls mm-hmm that's that's how they interact with each other and then you go out to a dinner dinner at a restaurant you'll see people just sitting across from each other stares and phones yeah I mean it's it's one of the worst times for interaction face to face I mean I've never seen a pie chart on the difference between the way human beings talk but there is no question that the amount of people per capita that communicate through electronics versus the way just talking person-to-person over the last 10 years has radically increased and so has our hostility towards each other in a lot of ways particularly through those electronic mediums hostility through social media is a relatively new thing social media hate meaning in these mob groups to just go after people like that's that's ten years maybe max Wright 2010 issue this is a new thing in human history and this what you're doing what you're talking about just sitting down it's so old-school talking to people becoming friends people speak and you've got these projects I mean you've you set this sort of friendship in motion with these people and you've changed the course of their lives and that's it and then they in turn yes what is that the wizard dragon fellow what's that guy doing these days uh he has to work like two or three jobs because unfortunately you know when you have that kind of stigma mm-hmm and you work for a company where the public sees you and they were oh that's that guy what did he used to do bricklayer brick brick maker so he works security now and but you but there are a lot more of them you know they some of them if they don't have a young family some of them will come out with me mm-hmm and speak out against their former organization this other guy who's very prominent Christian peach aleni yeah I know do you know him I do along the same lines he's doing that - he's like yeah he's helping - Adi radicalized he was co-founder of a of a group called on life after hate mm-hmm and and there are a lot of those farmers who do that especially if they don't have a young family because oftentimes um they can get ramifications you know for speaking out against their their organization right so you know you can little conversations yeah and they'll come after you or come after your family insight that so some some fly low under the radar so your book what is it titled the book is called clandestine spell with AK a clandestine relationships and right now that that book is out of print I'm working on the second edition second copy which will handle all new stories and and plus a lot of the old stuff and updates have you ever done an audio book no about thing I'm gonna do it you got a great voice man perfect for an audio I have laryngitis right now but I have a normal voice - it comes and goes I can hear I hear crackle up yeah but you obviously have a booming voice it'll be gone in a couple days that laryngitis yeah I mean that that way it's always easy to put back in print as well just so many people that are digesting audiobooks versus books me included I mean I listen to listen to a lot of podcast but I mean I think half the time I'm in my car I'm listen to an audiobook where'd you get the idea to do a podcast what was the impetus probably no one would ever give me a radio show mm-hmm that was from and I think I had gotten some offers to do radio shows but it was for like no money and you know satellite radio kind of a deal for no money and I had a friend Anthony ku Mia who was on this show Opie and Anthony and he did a radial can internet thing in his basement just for fun he was already on a radio show but he put up a green screen in his basement and he's kind of a nut and he would get drunk and do karaoke holding a machine gun like crazy shit but hilarious and I was like this guy just set up a studio in his basement how wild is this and so I said well let me just do a little web thing and so me and my friend Brian we started doing it with a webcam just in a laptop just talking to people online answering questions and then it started carrying on but and then that was 10 years ago and it just kept growing and then it became what it is now just by just keep doing it that's all it was I just kept doing it and then it went from thousands to millions to just this weird number of people that are listening to it and watching it now - it's you know because they have a hunger for which of what you're putting out there well conversation yeah real conversation like I don't have a agenda I just want to talk to people like with you as soon as I got the pitch I was like I need to talk to you like what you're doing is insane and and amazing and very very unusual that for someone have that kind of patience and commitment to something like that and to convert these people and without judgment and to be able to rationalize with them and talk to them reasonably these are my fellow American yes you know we all are we all in this game together and sometimes people get trapped in a really fucking stupid ideology yeah and they don't they there's a part of their brain that knows it's dumb there's a part of the brain that knows it's toxic and they deny that they ignore that they squash it and they try to avoid thinking about it and then someone like you comes into their life and you kind of like open this door and then Joe you know that a toxic thing happens on both sides you know I catch hell from people who look like me not everybody you know but they're they're people who look like me who totally disapprove because you're giving these people a platform because I'm working with them yes yeah I mean listen you cannot change somebody's mind by just allowing them to express what's on their mind right you know well that's the argument about deep platforming people online right right but then the argument the other way is that you're radicalizing young people the argument is there's a lot of young people that would go on these social media sites and and they're impressionable and they don't know any better particularly YouTube they worry about that because these YouTube videos they have music and it's a multimedia experiment helling and with a really good narrator you can get people to look at this fucking flat earth movement right where's that coming from it comes from a few articulate narrators who put together these videos on YouTube where they're the only ones you get to talk scientists don't get to interject go stop that's wrong that's not how I'll show you nope it's like this look here's a satellite photo look here's a hundred satellite photos look here's all the satellites to take pictures of the earth they don't get to do that so these guys they they'll have this long uninterrupted narrated video that makes so much sense you you listen to this guy guys he's changed oh my god the world's flat I can't believe they're fucking lying to me so there's hundreds of thousands of people that believe in the Flat Earth now because they've been radicalized because they've been converted by these multimedia things like YouTube this is what people worried about in terms of radicalizing them towards hateful ideologies as well and I'm glad you're using that word radicalized yeah cuz that's exactly your spot-on because you know we was until recently that we began using that word domestically we know for a while there were only using it for from middle-eastern type people you know when when somebody like Dylan roof did what he did we didn't say he was radicalized so you know he must have some mental issues well it's both isn't it well sure I mean anybody walks in the house and starts shooting up people and has mental issues yes but but they but they have beacon what what allowed them become radicalized maybe those mental issues yes you know but but we don't we don't say radicalize when it comes to our own yeah because we're ashamed of it so many different code words for example what do you call these groups of white people who go out in the woods and practice maneuvers and survival of stuff survivalist stuff they're like anti-government kind of a paramilitary yeah like what do they call them malicious exactly right okay militias all right what do you what do you call the same type of things with black people I didn't know they have they call them they call them militants oh like the Black Panthers okay okay right right so what you know it's that same thing right but one term hasn't had more of a negative connotation militias got a pretty negative connotation not as negative as militant yeah yeah yes no it seems to say shit to me and let's take back when when Obama got into office we had a new political party that came out of nowhere the Tea Party the Tea Party right last time you heard of a tea party was in 1776 what happened to them those Tea Party folks they're still floating around really yes themselves a tea party no because Obama's gone now I think they were out by the time he mean it was before he was even gone didn't they fall apart because he got a second term you know work but but their their slogan was take our country back take our country back okay take America back that is a Klan slogan mmm okay and it was a code term for the Tea Party that that was a clarion call and people it resonated with a certain ilk of people that slogan started in 1954 with the Klan 1954 when Brown versus the Board of Education desegregated schools you know on YouTube find all these Klan rallies with these Wizards in translating with the burning cross and balancing whether I take our country back I'm not gonna let my little white boys and girls go to school little nigger children and blah blah blah well not take our country back back the segregation didn't want integrated right so I would ask these tea party people why are you using a Klan slogan and it's uh Nana now Darrell that's not what we mean I said well you don't say take our country back from who you don't say take our country back to what you say take our country back or kind of open-ended I said you know what would you know we trying to say uh what we mean is we will not take our country back from the Democrats take it back to Republican rule okay that's fine why not say that exactly they're using an already used slogan the right take a case exactly so it harkens to those people right and here's the thing last time I checked Bill Clinton was a Democrat Jimmy Carter was a Democrat where was the Tea Party where was taking our country back and then all of a sudden a black guy gets in the White House and they start screaming take our country back right right you can put two and two together right where were you guys eight years ago it's the four years ago yeah is that right and now check out martyred the king all right we had to fight fight for decades to have Martin Luther King Day there was a lot of resistance to that do you realize that and a lot of resistance it was the fact that Marty the king is the only American man in this country to have a holiday all to himself and guess what he's black what do you mean by a holiday all to himself Columbus Day was not an American oh that's right okay what kind of was when he became no he thought he well first of all Columbus didn't even land here and he was like basically a serial killer he's a serial killer he was a rapist yeah and a pillager and he didn't he didn't discover a damn thing what did they call an indigenous peoples day now ya know how do you discover something when you get there people are already there well not only that like why did it take until basically the later latter half of the 20th century before people came to grips of the fact that he was an atrocious human being like when we were kids when I was an I'm a little bit younger than you I'm 52 when I was in high school it was Columbus sailed the ocean blue yeah into the Santa Maria Maria this was this was a guy who was an explorer he was going there for Spain he was in LA and then when you get older and you lead these missionaries accounts of the horrific crimes and we still celebrated yeah well I mean do we sort us out we kind of are done celebrating him right now we still have Columbus Day it should some dizziness people's day now no they call it that yeah but we've to win the counter so says Columbus Day does it yeah not on the Apple calendar really that's great I don't think so maybe I was ahead of his time I think it says indigenous peoples day now okay maybe I'm wrong but fucking should it should yeah now so we used to have two white guys who each had a holiday all to himself Americans who are those guys we used to have maybe before your time during my time George Washington day and Abraham Lincoln day really yeah you remember that yeah and then so we had too many holidays so they combined those two days in one day call presidents okay we'll just do any holidays you have productivity exactly sweet so yeah so it took those away and combined them so so now the only American man who has a holiday to himself is a black man and they can't handle it Martha King and now they we had to fight for decades to give this man a holiday when he gave his life to bring this country together yet we give a holiday to Christopher Columbus who as you pointed out was a murderer or a serial killer a pillager a rapist okay who didn't discover a damn thing right Marge the King never murdered pillaged and raped but yet we don't want to give him a holiday you know so that's the inequity in this country and I'll tell you something else um well now there are a lot of people who would disagree with me and that's okay because we're Americans we can disagree and we're all all individuals but there are people who will agree with me also and I've been saying this now for 22 years one of the things that will help us to to advance into the 21st century because we are behind the times we need at this point to get rid of Black History Month now I know a lot of people listening are gonna like freak out let me explain all right for the longest time we needed Black History Month Black History was not being taught in our schools now you remember when you pointed out a moment ago that when you were in school you know Columbus was a hero looked up man etc and then you go to college he learn otherwise when I was in high school it was not in our textbooks that we had our internment camps with japanese-americans I did not learn that until I got to college like what are you kidding me right I didn't believe it and now it's in the textbooks yeah so I said you were behind the times okay so anyway um we didn't have black history all right yeah what we had was called American history it might as well have been called white history because that's all it was and and even in some cases whites are being given credit for things they did not invent and for places they did not discover but we knew we were told at home then said that but not in schools so we had to fight fight fight and finally we got one week it was called Negro History Week Carter G Woodson created that and schools had Negro History Week one week a year we continued fighting harder and harder finally we got one month you know nobody's gonna give us everything at one time right they'd dole it out little by little so we got that one month shortest month of the year right February tomorrow yeah it's no coincidence but but but we accepted it for two reasons it was the birth month of two of our heroes Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln all right so we accepted that and then we stopped fighting and that was a mistake on our part we became complacent all right and now it's my belief that Black History Month has become detrimental to to us to all of us might am black I'll tell you why yes we needed it for a certain period of time because we had nothing but here's the problem we only study black history in February and each February we study the same half a dozen people Martin Luther King Rosa Parks Harriet Tubman Booker T Washington George Washington Carver and one or two other ones by the time we get through half a dozen up our month deserver we did our black thing let's move on all right yet we study Benjamin Franklin Eli Whitney Alexander Graham Bell Thomas Edison F F scott Fitzgerald Francis Scott Key all year long we're constantly reinforcing what they did all year long we never forget who flew the kite and the lightning hit the key and we have electricity we all know it's Ben Franklin all right but yet if you ask some kid in June say um who was a Harriet Tubman oh yeah yeah I remember her yeah she was that lady who refused to give up her seat on the bus they got confused with Rosa Parks because there's been no reinforcements February and then next year next February is the same half a dozen people all right so you're constantly I'm not taking anything away from those people they were some of the greatest alright but you're constantly reinforcing that there were only six or seven black people in this whole country who ever did anything what about the guy who invented the traffic light what about the person who invented the ironing board and so many other black discoveries and inventions oh we didn't have time for that we only have one month you have you got time to talk about Ben Franklin all year long you know Women's History Month is March when did you get rid of that to take these things out of those months and put them where they belong under the umbrella of American history and teach them all year long that way kids get accustomed to this and they learned that and they have more respect for each other look I remember when I was a kid Miss America beauty contest there were only two categories and was all white women black women were not allowed to join us him to compete in Miss America all the judges were white males two categories the evening gown evening wear and the swimsuit that was it women were objectified there were sex objects you know they didn't have talent they didn't need to write an essay or show what else they can do they just looked at and judged on that so black women were deemed not beautiful enough to do compete in Miss America plus they didn't want any white man judging a black woman in a bathing suit or whatever so black women began having low self-esteem as they were told they were not as beautiful as these other women so what did we as black people do to elevate the esteem self-esteem of black girls we created the Miss black America beauty pageant to give them something to aspire to and that worked for a while finally finally Miss America the bid one came to his senses and opened his doors I don't know the exact year um I guess was back in the 70s some time opened its doors to all American women regardless of their ethnicity color or whatever as long as they were American they could compete and since that time we've had we've had more than one Miss America who's been black starting with Vanessa Williams and then Debbie Turner I think maybe one or two other ones since that time so now because Miss America has come into the time we can get rid of Blatt of Miss black America we don't even anymore right we got the main one when are we gonna come to American history mmm we need to get rid of Black History Month we just we just finished the first black American president what are we gonna do with Obama or we gonna put him in in the end the February box that sees black only talked about him in February talk about him in March or September cuz he's black history put him in February right it's crazy how we how we do this listen we claim to be the greatest nation on the face of this earth I have a problem with that and don't get me wrong I'm a patriot I love my country but I do have a problem with that statement and I'll say that perhaps we are the greatest nation on the face of this earth technologically after all we put a man on the moon we invented the technology to carry that man to the moon safely and allow him to walk around get back in his lunar module and come back to Earth safely we invented that technology not only that when he was when when Neil Armstrong was up there walking around and made that famous song one small step for man one giant leap for mankind quote we were able to talk with him live all the way from Earth NASA headquarters all the way to the to the moon live via satellite radio phone we invented that technology Americans everybody you know has a cell phone everybody you know has email hit a few words hit a few numbers hit Send you're talking to people nextdoor in Nevada or over in Africa China Australia wherever you want off anywhere on the face of this earth we invented that technology so how is it that we as Americans can talk to people as far away as the moon or anywhere on the face of this earth yet so many of us have difficulty talking to the American who lives right next door because he or she is a different color a different religion a different ethnicity a different persuasion are different whatever it seems to me that before we can call ourselves the greatest our our ideology needs to catch up to our technology and when we get ourselves up there both of them up there then we can truly brag about how great we are because we are living in the 21st century we are living in space-age times yet there's still so many of us thinking with Stone Age Minds what is this doing in the 21st century what was it doing in any century but yet in the 21st century I'd be kidding me well it brings me back to what you were saying earlier that the problem is education the problem is ignorance right and the the solution to education is ignorance and this is sort of the same thing when it comes to radicalizing young people online right they're one of the reasons why that works at all is because these young people are susceptible to other ideas because their intelligence immune systems very low they don't have a lot of data they don't have a lot of education they don't have a lot of information and they don't have a lot of perspective so they can be they could be tricked they'll be roped in yes and this is this is the same with everything this is the same with what you were talking about with not trusting your neighbors because they're a different nationality or different color and not communicating with people that are any different than you and then being toxically tribal it's all kind of the same thing it's like there's a lack of understanding of what the consequences that are globally and in personally to your own life well again you know back to mines mines is my those young kids get to get those perspectives we'll have people on there who are the experts and and sucking those kids into enter these are things I know a former jihadi a recruiter for Isis who used to recruit kids to put them in Isis here in the States ok get him Jeff scoop the guy from from the NSM he knew what to do in order to lure people into his movement what's the NSM a National Socialist Movement the Nazis Tom yeah so these people are willing to help on minds and help point out these different things with little telltale signs as to what they look for you know you know so parents can spot what oh and this isn't sound right you buy blah blah running to get my kid off of here yes and give kids a better perspective Mines have a video component to it or it will it will it will absolutely absolutely my working on that now ya see that is for better I mean whether it's correct or not that's apparently the people that are really worried about people being radicalized online they're more concerned with that than anything else with video there's something about the compelling videos the music in the video and yes oh yeah you know they play video games all day it lures the men but you know back to what I was saying before and they finish it what's happening that that we we don't see in the media a lot is this when I was a kid the black population in this country was 12% 11.9 12% Native Americans just under 1% Hispanic people Latino people 2 and 3% Asians 4% white people 84 86 % so white people of the supremacist type mindset their biggest their biggest nemesis of course we're black people at 12% whoa that's way too much you know they didn't care anything about Native Americans if their attitude was that's just 1% sticking on a reservation forget about them right and that's where these negative terms come from you know that allow people don't realize are insulting terms you know when you say somebody has gone off the reservation you've heard that term before right yeah yeah I think it's out of that it's now exactly yeah you know wow you see what I'm saying uh-huh you don't realize it's a it's a negative term yeah or when somebody says that's not your cotton-picking business okay who picked cotton right right okay I thought it was a nice way saying motherfucking it's a freaking yeah it's none of your kind of picking biz but yeah yeah or when somebody comes to the wrong side of the tracks yeah yeah the railroad track divided by some one side west on the other the wrong side of course was the black side anyway so their biggest nemesis if they were of that supremacist mindset were black people 12 percents too much right now today black people we remain at 12% we've not grown 12.16 means you look at 2017 census we have not grown 12% Native Americans are still at 1% Asians are at 6% Hispanics have surpassed us they're like at 13% or something just above 13% so let's just take 12 percent black 13% Hispanic look at the only 6% Asian or whatever that's 25 percent non-white this is happening okay and it's well predicted by 2042 which is 22 years from now this country for the first time in history will be 50 percent white and 50 percent non-white right so that's the story you've seen is true that is a very hard pill to swallow for people of that mindset they're becoming unhinged and and disconcerted you know well that was that they will not replace us thing right precisely you exactly now you're getting it it's exactly and that's what they call the Browning of America yeah um and and the white genocide and see what they're doing as these groups are stepping up their recruitment efforts now because one of the one of the main problems is in this country one of the main concerns is illegal immigration so these groups are saying hey you know we're against illegal immigration to come come join us you know they're getting on on a legitimate bandwagon but when they say illegal immigration is a code word it's a code word for people from South America Mexico West Africa okay because there are plenty of people here in this country right now we're here from Canada nobody gives a fuck about Canadians come exactly Canadians or people from the UK or Eastern Europe Canadians speak perfect English too sure they slide right in and it doesn't even matter the English or not you know if you're you know he's not seasoned Clampett will tell me Darrell I don't want my grandkids to be brown well you know if they're if their kid were to marry somebody from Canada their grandkids might be white or the UK of Eastern Europe that'll be white but if they let their grandkids marry somebody from El Salvador or Guatemala or Nigeria Oh heaven forbid right Heather's prepared you know it's a trouble so what happens is this they said come join us you know we're gonna take our country back we're gonna build that wall blah blah blah so people you know people see the landscape changing you know and so they're going join these groups and the loop doesn't do anything so then what happens is so you know what if the Klan can't do it if the NSM can't do it I'll do it myself and that's when they walk into a synagogue boom boom a boom or into a black church from a boom well Passover buh buh buh buh okay these are called lone wolves now we have intelligence agencies or whatever that can infiltrate some of these groups and get in there and get all the stuff and foil those plots you know gather intelligence but you cannot infiltrate a lone wolf it's only one person alright and as we get closer and closer to 20 42 unfortunately we're gonna see more and more of these lone wolves and that's what we have to watch out for so you notice every time one of these white supremacist types gets a busted and they go and raid his home what do they find a whole cache of automatic weapons and all that kind of stuff that's for the race war when they track racism over the last 100 years it's a decline it's at a measurable decline but not enough what could be done to accelerate that decline what do you think can be done to sort of start start teaching us something of civics spent you know spike up the civics in elementary school and I don't wait to high school by civics what do you mean exactly you know our country is so diverse now we need to learn about the history of everybody in our country and everybody's contributions to making this a great country white black Hispanic women whatever our country is truly a melting pot and we and we need to treat it as such and give everybody credibility so you know this person you know looks different than me but he contributed something that I need I look different than him but I contribute something that he needs yeah you know that kind of thing so we have more mutual respect for one another you know the older generations are going to die out but we have to stop them from proliferating their their BS to these younger generations you know and we do this in schools right you know look when I was in junior high school which they don't have any more right to have middle school now sex education was being introduced parents were freaking out oh my god I don't want my kids learning that well guess what they didn't want their kid going to school and learning about sex but yet these parents were not teaching their kid about sex at home either they don't want their kid learning it how do I stop a kid from learning about sex if you don't let your teachers in school educate them properly and you're not willing to do it at home your kids still gonna learn it and where where is he or she's gonna learn it out in the street and then what are you gonna do when your kid comes home pregnant you don't be all freaked out so if you want to take sex ed when I was in junior high school we had to bring a note from your parents saying it was okay yeah yeah okay and then you have like a little small class of five or six people taking sex ed today this part of the regular curriculum yeah and as a result kids today are better informed about venereal disease STDs family planning contraception and all these kinds of things because they're no longer ignorant they have more information all right the same thing has the taboo on sex education has been lifted okay we need to lift the taboo on on on racism in schools and talk about it at an early age how much time are they allocating towards teaching people how to accept diverse groups and how to accept how to how to fight against racism I mean is that something that's taught it seems like that should be a core curriculum in private schools where I see it as mostly in private schools I don't see in public schools which is very unfortunate you know you know parents parents seem to cinder to run the schools you know you know if if your kid for example you send your kid to school and you find out your kid is not learning what you think he or she should learn what do you do you take him out of that school and put him in another school right if they don't learn it there you put them in a private school they don't learn it there you can come home and you homeschool them and so I'm from you know you know a lot of a lot of schools are very loath to to step on eggshells with parents you know that you know they don't want to upset the parents whatever but they need to the parents are not the teachers the teachers are the teachers well it seems that if you could explain to kids how people get radicalized if you could explain to kids what happens online how they draw you in what's the appeal of being a part of a tribe and which is a big part of it right a big part of his being like a gang run same thing that attracts kids to gangs like everybody's in it we're all together it's like it's in a a tight group right yeah I mean that that gets people in and when they draw you in like that if the kid said oh this is that shit they talked about in seventh grade I know what they're doing I mean just that yes that information yes exactly yes and so schools are one thing academic at an early age the next thing I fault our church is what want to say churches I mean religious institutions which would include synagogues etc and you know I hate to get down on the clergy but I'm telling you they they are they they have accountability that they're not accepting um and don't get me wrong I'm a Christian all the time stuff out and I was a deacon in my church at one time but here's the thing whether you're Jewish Catholic Protestant Mormon whatever you have some form of Sunday school after you go down in the basement in your eager facility and you're in your church or temple or whatever um and your Sunday School lesson you're when you're four or five years old they teach you that uh we're all God's children God made a rainbow right and we accept that at four or five years old and then as we grow older we reach puberty and adolescence whatever we move upstairs to the big congregation now we're sitting up there with the adults arm the the clergy the rabbi the priest the minister the pastor the Reverend whatever you whatever no longer teaches that Sunday School lesson they stop saying upstairs we're all God's children what do you think would happen if the Reverend of the priests we're sitting the congregation one Sunday morning hey folks guess what it's okay for blacks and whites to marry it's okay for Jews to marry Catholics half the congregation would get up and leave and they wouldn't be putting their money in the in the collection plate because they're not hearing what they want to hear right and because it has not been continued that that Sunday School lesson needs to be continued upstairs so adults feel hey you know we're all a rainbow with all of God's children but the priest does not say that or the Reverend is not said that anymore because he's afraid of walking on eggshells and and stopping the flow of money coming in the tithes and all forints in that collection plate people be changing churches or firing him right and then your kid is uh um let's say let's say let's say I'm Catholic and now I'm in a 12th grade and I'm going to senior prom so my mom says so so Daryl who came to the senior prom I say I'm I take Susan Goldberg yeah you know this is a nice girl but but don't you think you should take a nice Catholic girl well yeah mom but I mean but you know I thought we're all God's children uh yeah we are but exactly but it's not a god word but it's a man word yes God was perfect if we if we are to believe in the concept of God then we are to believe that God did not make any exceptions and buts and mistakes etc little loopholes he was perfect from the word go but is a man word it's an exception yes God was perfection man is exception all right so that's what happened you know if so so that's why the clergy does not continue that Sunday School lesson they're afraid of losing money in other words they put they put money above morality and they should be held accountable well it seems like there's a lot of problems it's not it's not one thing it's not just a clergy it's not just the schools it's certainly the parents and it's what the parents were taught so it's the parents parents it's the continuing of the Inc rights but but the big inherited one of the most the most influential unless you're atheist of course the most influential authority in your life is your church everybody you have the list of churches a kid yeah unless you're atheist or whatever so that weighs very heavily well how do you even ask the atheist then huh how do you reach the atheists then you know agnostic a lot of atheists and a lot and Gnostics have excellent morals a lot of them do their the oh they have our churches called ethical societies and I should welcome any of them before you know they don't believe in God you know it was nothing beginning that I advocate but I'm saying that they they know right from wrong and and and you find less controversy and and and racism and more acceptance in these places so it's about ethics and morality more so than division well why do you have a white Baptist Church and a black Baptist Church was that all about a Baptist should be Baptist it's the same King James Bible you know and what you know why aren't they aren't they preaching the same lesson in Sunday school that they preach upstairs they're not concerned about something little four and five-year-olds there were all God's children I made a rainbow you know why because a little four and five girls don't have any money so they're not consumed they're not getting any money in the collection right there it doesn't matter it matters where the money is you you say what you got to say to get the amount of money that you need that's you know I don't go to church so that's an alien concept to me but that's sad if that's the lesson if that's the way they're structuring their lessons in a church or synagogue or a temple that that's how they're doing it they're structuring their structuring their lessons to achieve more donations lose megachurches yeah well look at them hmm look at how many times do some of these priests and preachers get in trouble these those mega churches always seem to me to be run by cult leaders that are keeping it together they're just keeping it together staying within the structure of traditional Christianity want to believe in something yes so why not believe in the Klan when I believe rights you know and whatever yes yeah yeah yeah it's tribal we have this intense desire to stay tribal but we've got to consider ourselves a tribe of the human race exactly the human race that that can be taught to people you can yeah I think what you're done where you're proving and what you're doing by your amazing accomplishments is showing that that even in the most radicalized of people the KKK and the National Socialist Movement you're converting people well I'm gonna hook you up with some friends of mine like by Jeff scoop who was the the recent leader of the NSM Arno Michaelis who co-founded our life after hate and he spends his whole life dedicated to D radicalizing people please do have their stories absolutely you know and you can get their perspective what got them in right but more importantly what got them out what were the triggers that got them out after years of hating people and yeah and doing this you know what made them see something differently and and how can that be parlayed into into other entities well I'm hoping that just hearing it from someone who's maybe struggling with that maybe maybe they live in a very tribal community or there and some sort of a toxic environment their family would drag them in and they're they're really trying to figure out how long they can do this and how they can get out and what's the steps to get out well it's not only getting out but you know there has to be and here's another thing that I provide for these people when they come out eisah bra I provide support because oftentimes you know these people if they come from a family that belong to these groups you know they and they decided to leave the group of what everything they still got their family or whatever but if if they come from a family that was not racist for example maybe it may have been some dysfunction or they just read the wrong book or made friends with the wrong person and went down that rabbit hole or whatever and they you know they give an oath and they join these groups the family disowns them you know you don't want your kid around your house if you have black friends and Jewish friends and he's over there insulting them you know you you stay away from this house you know you long on my kid right right so their family becomes that group right right you know you took a blood oath you know we got your back you got our back we are your family just like gangs just like gangs okay yeah and then finally you come to your senses and you see how crazy it was and you quit you you get out well now you're left out there swinging in the wind because your biological family still doesn't want you you have disgraced them your old friends from high school you know found out you know you've gone down that road they don't want to associate with you because you have that that stench that stigma attached to you you may be an ex Klan member but that ex clan member will always precede your title you know like for example David Duke um you know he belongs on all kinds of different white supremacist groups but whenever you see him listed in the media so it's X Klan leader David Duke bla bla bla it's never just David Duke that Title X Klan leader it follows you and people you know look down on you for that you can't go back to your old group you've betrayed them you know so you know they want nothing to do with you so to beat you up or something and so now you're out here can't go to your family your friends have disowned you you turn to alcohol or drugs or some other gang it's just a that nurture that belong right so they need something there to support them and that's also where I come in well you know I give them a chance cream something to believe and help their self esteem etc damn that's very important Darrell for anybody's listening right now what what is the best way for them to find out more what's the best way for them to take a step like what what website would you point them to would you point them to your minds account yes I want them to uh to minds.com and change dot minds DOM and Darrell Davis comm dar a yl only one R Darrell Davis com listen what you've done is amazing and what your you know your message the way you handle yourself the way you've managed to you know infiltrate those groups just talk sense to them and convert them it's it's very inspiring and very humbling and thank you I really appreciate you being here man really my pleasure my pleasure spreading your message let's consider this part one yes sir let's do it again I would love to thank you thank you thank you very much Darryl my pleasure bye everybody [Music] [Music]
