Abby Martin ladies and gentlemen how are you great how are you a good day to be here long shits going down exactly it's a crazy day for Bill Cosby whoopsies hey I'm I'm reeling in that news man yeah I was I was wondering what was gonna happen because the first one was a mistrial that would happen yeah but what so what's the difference between this one is this a civil suit or is this I think these are these find a civil this was a the retrial so he got convicted of man charges felony sexual assault three different counts each one carries I think at least 10 years he could go to jail for 30 years which is death for him I mean he's he's already blind yeah he's very yeah he's a to barely see you right good I'm so happy that he's getting charged at the end of his life as amazing he's a creepy dude he like to have sex with lifeless dead bodies yeah we were trying to I mean purely speculation right like what would cause someone to want to do that like what mm-hmm but I I have this theory I think a lot of people did that shit in the 60s I think in the 60s it was a normal thing to drug people and I think they you know remember the terms have you ever heard it slipping someone a men they I think they used to do that all the time back then and they didn't think anything of it you know he's disgusting it's that people are fucking gross if you just go back a couple of hundred years like I'm watching this show Vikings it's great show by the way but you know they were obviously fucking crazy people they did wild shit but it was common I mean this was how people lived they would storm into villages and kill everybody this was normal shit just a thousand years ago or so and I think if you go back just a hundred years the way people treated each other was horrific if you go back 50 years ago that's Bill Cosby's era I mean I really think that people back then were different they didn't have the internet they didn't they didn't understand how other people were viewing their activity they thought they could hide this activity and I think there is a group of people specifically you know partiers that would drug people I think it was a normal thing I think there's probably a lot of people out there that are here in this Bill Cosby thing and they're thinking about all the times that they did it that is horrifying it's fucking scary especially when you couch yourself into being this like responsible like I'm gonna lecture all the black people you're gonna pull up your pants yeah be good yeah I remember one time Wanda Sykes interviewed him at something and he was uh chastising her on the way she was talking Wow her English and he was wearing sunglasses inside he's like sorry I'm just recovering off the raping that I just can't look you in the eyes I'm all raped out I'm so happy to hear this and did you see Weinstein chased out of that bar like in Florida or whatever some guy comes up and like slap slap to my face yeah hopefully that happens to him all over the world I think that he's a disgusting pig who should be chased out of every public forum there's a lot of those out there there's a lot of a lot of creepy humans in this world you know I just I think we're in this unprecedented time of understanding in terms of like the consequences of your behavior what you can and can't do now and then the fact that people will just if you're doing something horrific to people other people are now gonna know right whereas you know like again 50 years ago nobody fucking knew anything like think about JFK write this shit that's going on with Trump and Trump just kind of this it's like water off a duck's back with Trump whatever reason so he's got some strange ability to just like fake knows that's his brand his brand a misogynist yeah it's hard well it's also he does he's he just says it's lies yeah he just keeps going and everybody knows it's not a lie like what he gonna do well he's not freaking out he's acting like business as usual and somehow another that's okay like it's but if you go back to like what JFK was up to like JFK was a fucking freak and everybody knows it it's like comment but he was a freak in the area in the era where the press knew everything that was going on and everybody like kind of kept their mouth shut and everybody there was like an unspoken agreement that they wouldn't report on affairs and all the other stuff and it's just it's fascinating to see our culture change wildly over a short pier at a time yeah the tabloid journalism is taken completely over I mean that's true that's good but to see what these people are really doing but yeah you're totally right JFK was a complete womanizer there's a lotta does this hero still I think everybody was back then yeah I think that's what they did I think that's why they wanted to be press in the first place so they could just fuck everything that moves try to save the free world where it's fucking weird you know we're in a strange time I think historians in the future when they go back to the period where the internet was created essentially was like 94 when it became mainstream I think they're gonna look at this time between 94 and 2018 is unprecedented explosion of change Trump is nuts I don't understand why you know the stormy Daniels thing I feel like could be his undoing I don't think anything is gonna come out of the Russia stuff I think that if anything it's gonna come out of the Michael Cohen yeah it could but him pardoning Libya's basically him saying a message saying don't worry man I got your back I'm gonna pardon you if you go to jail to Cohen I think cuz I mean why the hell should you just pardon Dick Cheney's former man oh yeah scooter libby yeah yeah i don't understand that it was just him basically just being like don't worry bro got your back i'll get you out of prison yeah but not in pardon that guy right yeah it's it's insane the Trump stuffs nuts the stormy Daniels thing is ridiculous did you see that interview with Anderson Cooper no I didn't watch those nuts I mean it's just the craziest part about it is not the fact that he had sex with a porn star and that she was trying to do a transactional thing to get on the apprentice it's that he sent someone a threaten her and her child yeah after that yeah nuts yeah I think what is he capable of you know I think that standard operational procedure for a lot of people you know he's a mafia acting dude well that wasn't that what who wrote who who's saying that about Oh call me call me was a man who was essentially it reminded him of when he was prosecuting the mob that they have this sort of you know same kind of attitude there's us versus them keep everything together loyalty is everything totally yeah by the way a great job at stand I've been going to a bunch of stand-up shows everyone just talks about jerking off to pixelated porn in the 80s and their dicks and I mean you you your set was awesome and I really encourage everyone to check it out it's just it was amazing thank you yeah it was really fun Netflix special last weekend how was it it's great I'm very excited very happy what is it called haven't decided yet the tour I was calling strange times cuz you know obviously when strange times I might just keep that I don't know I maybe might change the name I don't know I don't really haven't decided I was impressed there's a lot of really good jokes about Trump which is you would think would be easy but I guess for comedians it's probably not easy because it's so satirical yeah well yeah the problem is reality is already a joke it's so it's so crazy that you have to have you have to figure out what is your unique perspective yeah you know if you have one you know I just think we're very childlike and what we do with and you know how we treat our leaders and how we choose our leaders and I'm really fascinated by the cult of personality that goes behind really any big-time leader whether it's Trump or Obama there's people that think that person can do or not know wrong I was very fascinated by that with Hillary there was a giant group of people that refused to look at any of the things that Hillary's doing that were wrong any of the things like the Clinton Foundation or those speeches that she was giving to these bankers where she wouldn't release the transcripts or the lies that she would talk about the difference between commis version of what the FBI had found her to have done wrong versus her version of it and there's a video where you see the two of them back-to-back and she's a deceptive person she's clearly a liar she's not she's not a good person she's not like this shining example of what we would like our leader to be we'd like hardly like love or hate or Obama what that guy was to me was like a statesman like he's so the way he would communicate was so calm and smooth and he was you know even if he didn't like his policy you got to admit the guy was incredibly articulate beautifully literate like the way he would speak and communicate he was well-read like he to me represented what I would like the version of the person who's running the big thing to be and I think that's the whole crux of people who have brainwashed themselves into thinking there's some sort of like deep state apparatus that's outing Trump I think that the real problem look the deep state is in military industrial complex they're winning at the end of the day no matter what defense contractors stocks are skyrocketing Trump is basically the de-facto arms salesman and chief on the phone at the Japanese Prime Minister being like hockey's killer drones bro like we got to sell these surveillance drones that's who's gonna win at the end of the day the neoliberal establishment is who hates him because he removes the mask of empire that's what he does he removes the mask he's making it less palatable to sell imperialism around the world and I think that's that's the crux of why you see a kind of these think tankers and the Liberals on on TV and we can get into this later but there's a whole misnomer going on about the left and a mischaracterization about the left the left has no fucking power in this country the left has no voice in terms of news coverage so well the spiritual meadow she is not left she is a neoliberal corporate shill you you say that and so does Jimmy Dore Jimmy Dore says the same thing yeah he just thinks that she does not represent the left not at all there's a myth of the fact that the media is liberal in general I think that you know TV culture aside news is not there is no liberal media media is owned by multinational corporations with conservative business owners that have interlocking boards of directors it's at defense contractors Monsanto etc those people are fucking liberal they're not left they they push down their policies it doesn't matter if you're a Maoist working at Washington Times you're not gonna be able to put out that contradictory narrative you know that your shareholders are pushing it's it's really unfortunate that the left has been basically I don't know I mean they've just demonized the entire left where now you have the NRA fomenting civil war against the fucking left Trump and all of his followers are just like the left is what's really wrong with this country where there's no power we don't have any power you have given me like I have more of a platform than probably any other left just because you have given me a platform on the show when have you ever heard my views like on TV ever you know what I mean well when you were on TV I heard them which is why we go to Artie it's nuts yeah but that's a weird thing to write because people think of Russia Russia's the great enemy and you were on Russia today yeah she's a tool of the Russians the Russians that the Russians like the Russians were nothing forever like the Russians like we got through the Cold War like all the Russians are our friends now when I was in high school we were always worried we're gonna get bombed by the Russians right that shit well how does it feel to just have that back feels weird I don't believe it I don't believe we're gonna get bombed by the Russians I don't think we're gonna bomb them I don't think they're gonna bomb us and I think is cliche as it sounds mutually assured destruction is probably a really good incentive to not launch missiles into the air I think that's still real what do you think what the serious stuff scares the shit out of me everything anything to do with Isis anything to do with like ideological warfare all that stuff scares the shit out of me you know when you when you see what people are capable of doing if they really believe in their cause and they really believe God's on their side they really believe and also if you really believe you've been fucked over by the Great Satan all that stuff scares the shit out of me because most people are blissfully unaware of what the United States and you know what the commander-in-chief or whoever the fuck is pulling the strings is doing overseas and what the repercussions of those actions are gonna be yeah that that the guy who I think I don't know when the Quebec mosque mosque shooting was but his basically his justification was you know Islamic terrorism wanted made me do this so if that's the case what are all the people that we kill with drones and we just killed the bride at a fucking wedding party in Yemen so another one of those yes just two days ago bomb wedding or at least eight that's our thing yeah and it's deliberate because we're supplying intelligence and weapons to Saudi Arabia it's not just you know we supply them weapons and turn a blind eye we are supplying military intelligence and targets for them to bomb and we're actively helping them do that so yeah they just bombed another wedding party on top of the funerals hospitals schools but why are the wide wedding Arty's is was there someone in the wedding party they were trying to get her was it a mistake I don't even know what the official line is but how many wedding parties can you bomb before we draw our red line I mean it's just disgusting and they killed the bride they killed the fucking so what are all these people who grow up this was supposed to be the happiest day of their lives and now you know are they gonna grow up wanting to kill American tourists yeah if you were conspiracy theorists that's what you would say you would say the reason why they're doing this is that the United States wants an endless war the best way to ensure it in this war is to occasionally blow up some people that really have no dog in the fight and you create a bunch of radicals you create people that are hell-bent on revenge because that that's the real hardcore conspiracy theory the Alex Jones take on it I think that a good way to look at the world is you know there's the colonizers and colonized the the the states that are basically remaining that we know that the establishment or the empire wants to take down Iran Syria Venezuela North Korea right what were they all in common they're all independent of our economic agenda and so we use our economic and military might to commit violence around the world to subject these countries to bend to our will economically and it's really obvious and unfortunately people just continue to buy into this humanitarian bullshit propaganda no matter who's in office yeah it doesn't matter who's in office if you look at like the actions that the Obama administration took versus the action the Bush administration took they're super similar yeah yeah and this whole deep state thing I mean look as Giuliani III's the deep stage okay so the deep state I think is the military-industrial complex it's the machine that churns on no matter who is the commander in chief it doesn't matter right they're not trying to get rid of Trump absolutely they love him dude right they love this so look Trump has a lot of enemies because he's scorched earth like he pissed a lot of people off so of course you have tons of people who hate him that appears that the media is uniformly against him but I think he loves burgers Kanye on Ellen this shit on Isaac burger on Twitter yeah video there's an animal dude he have you seen the Ellen one where Kanye Rison no it's just amazing just something he put together yeah it is hold on I got it wait look at Ellen just look at his face when was this from maybe we're looking at Kanye's Kim one more children make crazy faces one more disk MJ is in the building [Applause] [Music] [Applause] noses out of context yeah the real question that candidate gets really good that huh [Applause] what is he Sanders in the bill Kanye's in the building all right what's dead Picasso Steve Jobs is dead what Disney is dead hmm I'm dead what look at that one no joke is rock camp say it did you see that he wrote that he's gonna be the next president between dad from TMZ they call him erratic he's like please don't call me erratic you're speaking to your next president oh my god did you see Kim say like look you guys Kanye is just living in the future in a couple years someone else is gonna say what he does and you're gonna praise him oh yeah like really yes I'm just trying to keep him home she's gonna say whatever she can keep him from vanishing so bizarre though right yeah I wish I knew what was really going on like Jamie thinks it's a big part of it a big publicity stunt because you got an album coming out look at him look at him nodding a million percent no there's a huge backing number all you have to do is be you know a token person and like the Joey Villa woman who was like all right I'm gonna wear a trump dress to the Grammys and then I'm just gonna you know to sell tons of Records because there is a huge vacuum to be filled of Trump supporters who are looking for people like this there's definitely that there's definitely that it's fascinating to me it's really interesting because he's changed the what's possible this is one thing that Trump is absolutely done like when he won it's like that changes who can be president it really does cuz it's now I okay we know that the mean we've already decided we're willing to elect someone that we know really probably shouldn't be doing it so now what like we're just electing a famous person so what's who's that that's why people are like well what about Oprah yes like no well how about fucking NBC tweeted you know our president know like a Spanish by our so someone gives a good fucking speech and then we should vote them into office what the fuck is in control of the NBC Twitter page let's their own something about a speech from our all caps president like it wait a minute I thought the rock was gonna run for a while and then I was like yeah well and then I saw that he had a big dinner with the Saudi King and he was like a man like next time I'm bringing the tequila to your house and everyone was like Saudi Arabia is a dry country dude like and he was like oh shit and he dobby didn't treat it like obviously you just drank a giant bottle of tequila with the king and the King's not sighs yeah yeah oh and and who else was there Oh Morgan Freeman the voice of God and Hillary Clinton's soul was was with the rock and the king of Saudi Arabia somehow this is cool you know but bashar al-assad is a monster yet the king of Saudi Arabia's a cool dude who we should have dinner with that makes sense is this the young king that's trying to like it or not yeah what is his deal he's like he locked up all those people for who the hell knows probably consolidate power I mean that was the line that came out was like oh he's you know he's revolutionary he's reformist but I mean I think that it was just to consolidate power as a power grab and hey listen even drive there now so why don't you relax can't they they can write but not at night simple right they still have their male Guardian men escort them around so dude last time we were on Wow crazy crazy stuff happened after that right yeah campaign gigantic pile of email thankfully to the wrong email address but I still was aware of them right of a bunch of people and it was a it was like a form letter talking about how you're a liar and you're anti-israel and none of this stuff is happening between you know Israel and that I just yeah it was it got weird because it was like hundreds and hundreds of hundreds even that's and that's a campaign that's a campaign with large amount of money behind it because the Israeli Lobby likes to come down very hard on people who speak out against the crimes of Israel as you see this is a third rail issue no one talks about it even though it's so fucking obvious I mean we hear the mantra Putin kills journalists all the time while Israeli of forces are sniping dead journalists and children on camera and yet the world turns a blind eye well someone got killed just a few days ago right journalist just died yesterday he was shot yeah they're all Palestinian there's been no Israeli casualties wounded or otherwise but yes stand with us is directly funded by the Israeli government it's part of their giant Hasbro operation and that's they made a video they were promoting a video kind of trying to debunk what I said on here look you can look at the Empire files and see all of the documentation of what I said that's your stuff that's all my stuff yeah the Empire files vampire files TV and it's a YouTube channel that you can subscribe to too but I mean it's just very easy easily verifiable facts like that Israeli military law governs the West Bank this is verifiable in five seconds on Amnesty International so it was just very desperate measures to try to obfuscate what I was saying and this is really all they have left because the tide is turning man I mean look natalie portman just signed on to boycott this conference in israel and they are running scared i mean they're trying to revoke her citizenship because she's basically participating in BDS because she said recent events have made her greatly disturbed as it should disturb everyone the fact that there's this ongoing massacre and if I could just explain to people what's going on really quickly it is horrifying you guys I mean there's a thing called the great march of return and it's been completely nonviolent on the side of Palestinians it's in Gaza which is the open-air prison where about 2 million people are housed in caged like animals and they're not allowed to leave I can't think of any other place in the world that refugees actually can't leave otherwise they'll be shot so there's like Israeli guard posts surrounding this place they count their calories they they don't let them have concrete anything that can be construed as a weapon etc so anyway they're protesting this right because they have no dignity no humanity no agency to live their lives and so they're protesting non-violently they're going up to the to the fence and you know thousands and thousands of them and 40 people have just been executed there's Israeli soldiers sitting up perched on a hilltop with sniper scopes this isn't just random gunfire that people are being hit with they are deliberately attacking every single person with headshots with genitalia shots it's sick and pres there's people marked press I mean that's an egregious war crime yeah you have nikki Haley of vetoing every single UN resolution or investigation into Israel I can't imagine what other countries so I think that you look Israel it can only survive with us sponsorship and we love to have that beachhead in the Middle East we love to have that military garrison because we use Israel like what happened in Syria we used Israel to bomb Syria first to test the waters we use Israeli forces to execute nuclear scientists in Iran we use the Mossad to do all kinds of stuff so we love to have that kind of you know military military post outpost in the Middle East that we can use to try to intimidate all those post-colonial states that are independent or we want to overthrow so I think that's why you know a lot of people say oh the lobby controls us and I think that that's wrong I think that there's a lot of lobbies that have influence but I think it's it's more strategic than that I really do and so for the Palestinians so the Palestinians that are trapped in Gaza and if they leave there's no other way to go other than through Israel yeah well they yes and a lot of people are like Oh what about Egypt and and Jordan they can they can try to go it that way no I mean basically they're all in cahoots with the Netanyahu's administration and they're all basically client states of the US so no they can't leave and Israel controls their water the passageways everything that they don't let them leave like a lot of these people who have been shot with sniper rifles can't even get treatment because they're denied treatment so there's so many amputations that are totally unnecessary so now you have like thousands of people who are just amputated five thousand people have been shot with live ammunition and you've been there and how much time did you spend when you were there so I was in the West Bank for a month and they let you go back and forth from Gaza no unfortunately I was banned from Gaza because I was told I was a propagandist and I was not a real journalist and I was told I was an Iranian agent which was confusing because I thought it was a Russian agent who's saying the Press Minister of Israel yeah yeah so I think they thought it was they probably calculated that it would be less risky to just block me from entering than having me go in and show the horrors and the abuses that are going on there but I mean we're talking about executing children and sniper scopes and there's videos of these soldiers gleefully laughing they are literally like man did you see his legs go up like look at that shit you get a headshot IDF soldiers have t-shirts where they have pregnant women in cross hairs it says one shot two kills like these people are fucking sick yeah look it up IDF soldier pregnant women t-shirt they also have crosshairs of babies what them yeah and then and then not only that but on top of all of this happening you have colonial settlers who come down and they're cheering them on they're like this is the best show in town they're sitting there drinking coffee and beer and just cheering on this Massacre that's been going on for four weeks look at those there it is one shot two kills Wow yeah that's crazy so to stand with us that is organization sake that is a crazy fuckin t-shirt yeah so stand with us and all these other organizations that work on the behalf of the Israeli government to try to smear anyone who criticizes it your time is up man people are waking up you can't just keep executing people on camera and getting away with it and you know if stand with us means stand with the snipers shooting kids from a sniper scope why are they doing this they want to terrorize and put fear in the hearts of these people they don't want them to protest they want them to sub submit they want them to submit and they want they basically have dehumanized them to the point where they you know you can't you can't put a kid in a sniper scope and kill him unless you are you've completely de hue manizer unto the point where you think that he's an animal and that's just that's just how it works I mean they've been so dehumanized they're it's not even funny and what these people are asking is is very simple they want the right to return which is authorized by the UN when the refugees were expelled in 1948 seven right to return to Israel the right to return Israel and live as equal citizens it's not about you know a Baal like it's not about expelling the Jews or people who live there it's about living and coexisting and having equal rights because right now there is an apartheid state where there's 50 discriminatory laws within Israel proper not to mention the fact that the West Bank's under Israeli military law not to mention the fact that Gaza is an open-air prison so within Israel proper there's apartheid too so it's it's sick we are sponsoring this with ten million dollars a day Israel would not survive without the u.s. which is why I focus on ending the US Empire because I'm like it doesn't matter if everyone in the world boycotts Israel we're still gonna subsidize the horrors in the daily atrocities with our tax dollars and they're not going to stop and that's why this is so fucking brazen Wow have we been vindicated Joe because I can't think of another I mean one else have has anyone done something this brazen committing an ongoing massacre for a month straight just sniping people who are completely unarmed this is insane the only thing I can think of that's slightly similar is when Israeli commandos hijacked that boat there was a flotilla going to Gaza to bring wheelchairs because they don't allow wheelchairs in that can be construed as a weapon even though there's done tons of amputees there was a boat going with aid workers and they were bringing aid supplies and commandos jumped on the ship like helicopter down and just started executing like people humanitarians that were going to bring Gaza aid and the news made it seem like they were they were like look at these people on the boat like hitting them with chairs and stuff it's like dude they fucking propelled on to the boat and started executing people of course you're gonna use whatever you can to try to like ward off these soldiers so that's the only other thing and that really woke me up to the whole situation is when I saw how the media was covering that massacre so now seeing this I don't know how they're getting away with it I don't know how people have not woken up to this but the media the way that they're covering it is atrocious they're saying there's clashes they're saying that the Palestinians are dying of head wounds it's like no just say that they were executed with sniper scopes like this is deliberate but the way that the media plays around and uses this passive voice is just not just whether it's Palestine Venezuela Syria whenever you have like complete media uniformity just peddling a line probably the truth is somewhere on the other side what is what is Israel want but as a state like what do they want from the Palestinians what do they expect they expect just keep the status quo keep business going as usual never let those people live a normal life like what it what do they want and why do they have so much hate and why why haven't the Israeli people like seeing the horrors of this and rebelled well to be a leftist and Israel it's it's difficult and to be an anti-zionist it's even more difficult cuz you're rejecting your entire like religion as well as your political organ but look it's a settler colonial state just like a lot of other things in the past but this is different because it's ongoing and ever since the inception of Israel to today the colonizers who colonized that land always knew that there was an indigenous Arab population that they wanted to kill or expel and that's still the goal like from Ben Gurion himself the the original you know Prime Minister of Israel I mean he said there's so many Arabs here we need to expel them and take them their places so it was never a land without a people and a people without a land it was always overrun with Arabs and they've always just wanted to expel the indigenous population so they can have an ethnos supremacist state and that's really what it what it is and that's oh can you be I'm sorry but can you be a Muslim and live in Israel can you be a Muslim and live in Jerusalem yeah but you but there's so many discriminatory laws that are that basically it's an apartheid state for non Jews like in what way like what are the laws that I mean there there's so many things that that people can check out but um I would really recommend the work of my co-pilot and Ronnie Barkan they're too anti Zionist Israeli born Jews who have extensively talked about this but I mean just just in the roads like there's settler only roads compared to only yeah compared to Palestinian roads people have different license plates you have different ID cards so if you are segregated schools like just all that stuff so you can't go to a regular school no you can but but it's so segregated in hostile and you're so indoctrinated from an early age to basically hate these people and think of them as the other and and I encourage everyone to check out interviews that I did with with just averages Raley's in the streets because the genocide already Rick is very apparent and it's very open and anyway right now sure yeah check out abby martin israelis candid candid interviews you have one opinion of that situation before you went there and then a different one after you came back well I didn't even know what Palestine was until I was 18 years old so when people say oh you're only telling us one side of the story look I didn't know the Palestine side of the story until I was an adult which really should say something about our education system and our media when you completely obfuscate an entire reality and are only told one side but before I went there I I you know I had a conception of what it was but once you go you really see how much worse it is so this really party approves annexation plan I'm sorry I lost it yeah yeah so go to course Palestinian departure yeah go go forward like a minute or two go forward like two minutes yeah these people after this keep going keep going and what do you ask okay this is good too okay so so you guys start playing here so I this is the thing and also the stand with us people in the Israeli Lobby basically said oh you cherry picked these interviews you only pick like genocide all people to talk to you what the hell are you talking about I was in Jerusalem there's a place called tolerance square as a bustling shopping area I spoke to people from all backgrounds all walks of life and I just asked them very simple questions what does it like to live here how do you deal with the you know problems and basically they just were very very readily like comfortable to tell me very crazy genocide all things on camera like no thinking that that would actually look good for an American audience so keep that in mind instruments out in plate can you talk about what it's like to kind of live in this situation first of all it's very hard I also I'm a nerd is organization it's called lava it's against the Jews for the mary arabs did you say the organization was did what again we there goes in the organization is the the thing of it is to that Jews should I marry era shouldn't marry Arabs why do you feel strongly about that because Jews is a special relation that God gave it to the Jews and we Jews to get mixed up together with a different nation I think Israelis have to take over and they have to kick them kick them away it will be much better not a lot to kill them just to go back to to Arab countries as if they are people there's no need to try there's no need to talk to them what we can do is one that they do enough harm we retell you that's war and that's the situation that any Jew lives in Israel has to deal with be afraid because any more trouble and all will be fine they'll be in their villages we don't have to live together and everything will be just fine we have to kill him and not because it's Arab because it's a terrorist I think you should also kick out the family because it's all begins with these were the sons of anarchy teacher by the way which is so strange it's the kids does you know it's families how do you say kick out the Arabs boy come on tell me the words I don't know she doesn't I think we should give them a country if you're doing any problem you just go in there to give them a country and then it's going to be a war between countries you know if they're going to rock it we're gonna throw one big one and done I don't think there's any answers insane there's only one way I would carpet-bomb there it's known it's the only way you could deal with it like or try to stop them a different way it never worked you mean all Arabs are Gaza I I believe that they like I hope to believe them they're not but I do think they are because I never I don't I don't trust them one more key one coming up and that's the only way I believe that the only the only way is just to stop it completely I think that there we miserable there they are abhi say make epic we aim and they we need to she's laughing it's like alright we'll talk about this later this is reflected in polls a lot of people when you look at Israeli society you know it started off as kind of a socialist project with the kibbutz is and now it's just turned into a fascist supremacist state where Netanyahu reflects the true face of Israel just like Trump reflects the true face of this country and when it's getting too toxic for even Natalie Portman to be a you know this ambassador to Israel you know that the tide is turning but unfortunately there's so much shit going on Congress hasn't said anything they just totally support this man and there's weird like BDS legislation trying to criminalize basically dissent where you have contractors in Texas having to sign clauses promise that they won't support boycott of Israel to in order to rebuild hurricane homes what is BDS boycott divestment sanctions it's the movement that Palestinians have asked us to help them to you know boycott and and that's what Stephen Hawking was all about he boycotted scientific conferences in Tel Aviv so this is what we got to do and we have to fight our government to stop endorsing these massacres and atrocities well obviously this attitude that these people have it's coming from a place and they were talking about terrorist attacks like how many terrorist attacks are actually happening in Jerusalem or Israel you look at if you look at the breakdown of terrorist attacks how many are against soldiers and that really gives you an insight look these people are being occupied militarily the occupation is illegal under international law and resistance is a lot of times acceptable under international law when you're being illegally occupied so so there'll be a terrorist attacks against all true there look not not many and when you look at the actual amount of people who when you look at those terrorist attacks and see how many are against soldiers like how many stabbing attacks are against soldiers the numbers become very different don't you think it's a it's a bit different in Israel and they're more unified because the fact that mandatory military service exists totally so everyone is if soldiers are attacked citizens are attacked they're all the same thing everyone is a soldier in Israel essentially well no a lot of these are like aren't armed soldiers that are I'm saying everyone identifies because they have to do military totally yeah yeah it's the same thing with South Korea places that have mandatory military service they have a totally different idea and concept of nationalism so they like if if a military base got attacked in the United States we would think damn soldiers got attacked we wouldn't necessarily think of it the same way is if say Dallas got attacked someone a terrorist attack happened in Dallas we think of it as an attack on American citizens not just military but their military is their citizens because mandatory military service yeah and what's really weird is during the last massacre in Gaza and 2014 like half the Israeli soldiers that died were American because that's what colonial that's what the colonial settlers are they they go over there from New Jersey and they just post up in top of an Arab village and this is what's happening I mean it's half of the soldiers have died where's Arkin soldiers I'm a lot of them where I'm not actually sure but that's a lot where I was like why are so many Americans going over there seventeen year olds and joining the idea I mean how bizarre is that what kind of mentality do you have to have to move from like a comfortable suburban Philadelphia to go like move on top of an Arab village and these Jewish people that are doing this yes I want to go back to the motherland yeah this desire to go to the motherland like it's such a tribal thing the purest form of the the conflict right like that's touch the Wailing Wall and yeah I mean that's the spot right it's the epicenter of conflict too that's why it's so sad that so many Palestinians can't ever go to Jerusalem which is one of their holiest sites is there and they're banned because again they're banned from everything so so if you a Palestinian and you live in Gaza you just you're just stuck you're stuck forever and that's why the people are like people from America they're like why that you know that's why you have this mantra like oh they want to die they raise their kids to be suicide bombers know when you're in Gaza you are born dead you don't have a life so that's why these people are giving up their lives to send a message to us that's why they're doing this that's the only reason they're doing this is to send a message to us help us that's all they can do is use their bodies so their concern is if they open up Gaza the idea is that if the Palestinians come and they live in Israel with everybody else that they're just going to cross trouble and kill people and create suicide bombs that's that's my idea that's what they say even though when I and and and the Israeli Lobby and the stand with us and all these people have said you know you're you're portraying us as really different than we really are because they like to portray themselves as this peaceful loving democratic nation and they're like Palestinians will say the same thing about us not true I was driving around in settler plates in a car that looked like I was a colonial settler I did not hear one person say anything remotely genocide all about Jewish people I talked to you look like you do I'm Jewish easy yeah you could fit right in fit right in just move on top of an Arab village I mean it's nuts and thank you for letting me talk about this because it is difficult to talk about and I'm sure it wasn't easy to get you know hundreds of emails telling you to denounce me and all that other stuff well we've been friends for a long time yeah I know you denounced it and you know it's coming from somewhere coordinated that's a thing there's a lot of money behind these attack campaigns well I and I understand their perspective if they don't have the same experience that you've had being over there and Experian there's a lot of people over here that are extremely loyal to Israel that have never stepped foot in Israel totally you know and maybe they haven't experienced what you've experiment not maybe most likely it's just terrifying to me forget about whether it's Israel or Palestine forget about what it is the idea that people could be stuck born stuck in this spot and really have no recourse and not know where to go and just be thought of by people that live just a few miles away from you you're subhuman and that the fact that someone can make that t-shirt with one bullet two kills and show a pregnant woman with cross hairs on her belly that scares the shit out of me that's that is Nazi Germany I mean that the fact that they can't understand that this treatment of the Palestinians in that t-shirt is essentially the same way the Nazis were looking at the Jews it's treating people as the other it's a very difficult to understand quality of human psychology is that when we're in conflict with another nation another person we think of them as less than us like literally less human not human the enemy they're that thing that we have to stop and it's been a part of warfare since the beginning of time absolutely that's what's so tribute to me about like the British occupation of Ireland because these I don't know if you've seen that movie the Wind That Shakes the barley is holy should know happy I mean it's just nuts because I can see like the conflicts around the world and you know the other ISM is usually someone who looks different than you and but this is like all white dudes who like all speak the same language and they're just massacring each other yeah I was at first a few years back I did a show out there and after the show we went outside and the cars the police cars they looked like they were in the craziest fucking war zone you'd ever seen first of all the entire thing the front of the car was completely covered in thick steel they had this big steel grate over the windshield they had bomb like bombs shielding all over the car we were looking at the cop car like what the fuck is this like oh yeah man this is when the IRA was bombing this is what they did they just started setting everything up like this and we were talking to this driver and the driver was explaining to us what it used to be like when you know they were at war and what people had done to people that knew him and you know just people that look incredibly similar to each other again speaking the same language just gutting each other in the street torturing each other killing each other Protestants versus Catholics I mean it's that thing that humans do where they treat an enemy as something less than them the other and just decide that that's the red team and we're the blue team so fuck them that that is a scary creepy fucking thing the humans are capable of I'm not really yeah I'm confused about the whole religious like how it grew into a religious conflict because originally it was just the British colonial overlords like harassing the fuck and beating the hell and raping women who were just Irish and in these villages and towns and you know how much can you subjugate other people and put them in cages like in Gaza or do this and harass them and humiliate them and told they do something about it yeah I mean that's just the nature of human beings you can't cage people well if anybody wants if you really want peace on earth I mean is that really possible first of all right there's always a question like we're so tribal and people are so committed to their side and and their team and is it ever possible to eliminate all war but the first step has got to be you we have to be able to identify with those people and see their plight and understand put yourself in their position if you were born in Gaza if you were born you know in Northern Ireland back when the war was going on if you were born and we pick ups pick a spot where there's a conflict you've got to be able to realize like we got lucky you got lucky we got lucky we live in California we got lucky I got lucky I was born in New Jersey we got lucky we're not in Gaza we got lucky we're not we're wherever it is wherever the conflict is if you can't see that if you've blocked off that aspect of your perception that that is this is a classic trait that human beings have exhibited since probably the beginning of tribal life the beginning of like organized groups of people living together in a community fighting against all outsiders and it's almost like ingrained in our DNA that the way we stay alive as anybody who's outside of us fuck them well like you said we're only two people ago like literally like yeah that's crazy yeah yeah three people ago we had slaves people people go yeah people have to be a hundred that's it yeah that's real I mean that and no one says that you know they don't look at it like human beings we rely on information right we rely on like oh that's what's going on oh I didn't know you know like most of us don't know you're just driving in your car you do in your life you you're really not getting information from all over the globe how many people accurately even understand why North Korea hates us so much oh no one do you the amount of fucking shit we dropped on them during the kill twenty percent of their population yeah twenty percent yeah imagine how many millions of Americans is that we're like oh that wacky Kim Jong moon he's fucking haircut he's crazy yes Dennis Rodman comes over there they play basketball that's literally most people that's the extent of their understanding of why North Korea distrust the United States after we decimated you know the entire country all the infrastructure dropped napalm over the entire country where we actually retreated only because there was no infrastructure left to bomb and for the past I don't know 70 years North Korea has literally been building up defenses to to prepare for the next time that they know that that will happen and we're like oh my god there's like I'm crazy look at this crazy military fascist state it's like well I mean there's a reason behind all these things they don't happen in a vacuum I was reading an article today about how their nuclear test site is imploding like they've they blown up so much over there that the fucking grounds caving in they're opening up a portal the hell-like played to blow a hole through the earth but something really good could come out of it with the the peace talks president moon of South Korea and Kim jong-un and no trump is forced to jump on board and if Trump can can pull this off then more power to him men that's got to be so strange to North Koreans and South Koreans looking exactly the same staring each other across the lawn you know back when I was competing in Taekwondo it was the you know Koreans are extremely nationalistic and the South Koreans and the North Koreans you know they would occasionally compete in North Korea it was you know it's got to be so bizarre to think that if you zigged your ancestors zigged instead of zagged if you were born like 50 miles that way you'd be North Korean and you'd be stuck under the ruling of this fucking wacky Sun and instead you're over here making samsung phones you know well for the first couple decades South Korea was ruled by dictators I'm also crazy so this whole like oh we're we weren't friends with him because of him being a dictator it's like no you just were trying to you know what we supported one side yeah and the side you supported makes kick-ass electronics and they're addicted to plastic surgery have you seen what they're doing with women's eyes over there no oh my goodness women in South Korea it's so common that they get their eyes done they get their eyes done like an anime character like yeah their lids cut and pulled up so that they have these giant Western eyes but exaggerated and it's so common that like if you didn't know any better you would think that this is like oh well some people look like this ya know there's so much plastic surgery over there that it's extremely common for these women to get these weird fucking eyes Jamie see do you pull it up because this is something that I became aware of alright she's is I want to say like eight or nine years ago when I was like I just thought it was just a girl that looked like that like that's not even a good example that that girl still looks Asian that's a boy like look at what they're doing they're westernizing their eyes but there's some there's some really go that guy got his job done he looks better on the right that's a good example Wow see what they're doing it's like they're doing a strange thing with their eyes or they're making their eyes larger yeah but it's extremely common and whitening cream is yeah it's huge - there ya see there they're changing their eyes before after yeah look that's so much more eyelashes well I wonder what was going on yes see this girl that's painful yeah I'm sure it sucks but afterwards she gets so much more dick I mean it's well I wonder first of all I wonder why genetically their eyes are like that that's interesting think of like what like we know that the reason why people in England and Ireland and in this northern climates like why they became so pale they became so because they had a very strong lack of vitamin D because there's no Sun in the air so they're basically a reflector for the Sun they try to absorb as much Sun as possible because they live in this cloudy area as opposed to our great-great ancestors lived in Africa and that's that's literally why white people exist yeah we're just Africans with lack of vitamin D so race is a construct fuck most certainly is but it's also observable right like like there's a clear ancestral origin to certain body types and diets like there's certain people that live in parts of West Africa they're just fucking phenomenal runners and there's no denying that there's certain traits that people have that you can clearly say I think the real problem is when we say race like the real problem then that gets us tribal again that's a must versus them again because it's just humans it's just humans that it's they're all it's one race but humans that live in high-altitude climates are much more adapted to low oxygen environments humans that live in like the Inuit that live in extreme cold climates and have no access to vegetables they adapt to this specific fat rich diet their hands are less likely to get cold they actually developed like a genetic predisposition to for their their ability to withstand cold with their hands like we would go over there and we fucking our hands would be nominal and they would just be like playing piano and shit like this this is genetic I mean this is because their bodies have adapted but they're one race right it's just humans are malleable we're super flexible you know and we could you could see that in your lifetime right I mean if someone works out they develop more muscle to get stronger and then there's the concept of epigenetics and the possibility that some of these traits and some of these learned behaviors you're passing on to your children through genes so I'm using Animal Planet what do we mean that what is it the show yeah it's a show that it shows how animals and the symbiotic relationship between humans and animals it's really insane and there's a hole in youatt section but there's like you know tribes in the jungle and stuff who will work with birds to get beehives and the birds will get the reward and don't worry and if you and then if you don't give them any honey then they'll trick you and take you to like I mean it's just nuts and then helping humans fish and man blue planet too is also a fucking nominal you have to you would love there's an octopus who makes a seashell suit he literally makes a suit of armor out of shells to block himself from a shark it's nuts it's super nuts yeah animals are huge I mean they're weird and we're we're animals you know yeah we don't like to think we are because I mean talk and sing songs and shit and get our eyes done but we're animals in some sort of strange way we're the same as Trump yeah do you see those boxy suits somehow he's got a good ass tailor man well buck obese is the Trump Statute Jamie now we're talking about yesterday in the which was it the presidential House of Wax or some shit Disney one please tell me it's bad it's crazy it's like they're punking him go away that's great make that larger so you can see what it looks like operation fuck drop pot trump debuts at Disney World but I'm telling you it doesn't look anything like him like if I was the person who create like look that's George Washington seems normal but look at the Trump one-way tag what in the fuck is that it doesn't look anything like him oh look at this so did he pause that Jaime he looks like he's like 20 years older than he doesn't even look like him I mean whoever that artist is like he's got to be punking him this is no way he like did some weird shit to his jaw his jaws like extended and creepy he made his neck skinny the same artist that did a Christian rock Cristiano Ronaldo bust no he looks pretty much the same and find a photo of it because in high-res photos is a low-res video it's difficult to see how shitty it is but it's so shitty that it looks fake like like no this is not really the one like no they fucking commissioned an artist and this is the artist creation where is this animatronic one question Museum I don't know but I'm going no inbred looking do you think they look in bread Aaron Trump he looks odd he looks like as near like upper deyrnas like look at that come on oh my god that's them good yes but either way good or bad this is clearly at the wax museum of Hillary no do not tell me that's no okay they saw okay fire this guy look at the Obama one that's terrible they just saw I could do better than that doesn't look anything like him it's great today they can do like Jefferson and Lincoln all that stuff because all they had was drawings no terrible yeah it's pretty bad I don't know how we got onto that Oh humans malleable humans yeah I mean I'm hoping you know in time but just like slavery doesn't exist anymore in the United States at least I'm hoping that as time goes on there's gonna be less tribalism and then as human beings are able to freely travel and communicate with each other we're gonna be dealing with less of this but is it sad that it seems like it's almost getting worse even though we have all the information available at our fingertips we're still like we just elected someone who basically got famous politically because he said Obama was a secret Muslim Kenyan people who are hearing that shit they love hearing that shit and they don't want to hear anything differently do you know what's going on right now but unity Yeti coolers and the NRA no it's fascinating because this just shows how tribal and crazy people get Yeti coolers they cancelled some they had these programs like go to go to do you know my friend Ben O'Brien's Instagram do you know that yeah put it on Adam green trees and we could read it but what what Yeti did they discontinued these I forget what they the way they describe the program but they had a bunch of outdated incentive programs where like you know like if you signed up something get a discount like if this kind of program here it is discounted discounting program Yeti makes super high-end coolers okay they look really expensive but they literally will keep ice for days you could put ice in them and go to the desert and five days later you have ice in that cooler and I'm not bullshit like they're fucking phenoms like that that's exactly what I do with it nice they're phenomenal so anyway they notified the NRA and the organization's has changed Yeti explained to them that they're offering an alternative customization program broadly available to consumers and organizations including the NRA Foundation so then the NRA releases this statement that Yeti coolers doesn't want to work with the NRA anymore they don't support the Second Amendment so fuck them so people start blowing up their Yeti coolers up with that thermite shit or what is that stuff not thermite what's that explosion Patek had a bunch of that shit in his car what is that shit not whatever that is that what it is and Yeti support is blowing up Yeti coolers American so they filled it with this explosive shit and by the way these coolers are fucking expensive they're super engineered and you know they start at like 300 bucks so this is look at their below this thing I'm telling you these people are just looking for an excuse to blow shit up but there's a great quote in this article which is this article from what is this website does the Washington Post nuts there's there's a great quote in this article that sort of highlights how fucking preposterous this all is it's these are such babies so it's good god but I don't think it's that what I really think is that they want an enemy they're happy when something has and even though yetis explained though their whole fucking business is hunters and firemen and anglers they're not anti NRA they're definitely not anti Second Amendment like fucking relax so even after they put out that statement the NRA doubled down and released another statement you know you made a big mistake and now you're paying for it really think we have a real problem and especially there's a real problem in that regard because they need to understand everyone need to understand we should all anybody that supports any outdoor activities has to understand that the conflict if you have any internal conflict against each other like but the thing about hunters and fishermen all these people what their real opposition is is animal rights activists and radical at Animal Liberation Organization type people that's the real enemy the enemy isn't Yeti coolers who makes their business selling shit to hunters and fishermen and anglers like these people are crazy so this conflict just shows to me like people are just looking for a fighting right like right how long it takes to get all that fucking explosive shit and put it at a core this just happened I need to get some like boom and they're blowing up these fucking $300 500 our coolers go crazy buy and buy him up yeah but now these this also is really fascinating yeah I'll send this to you Jamie because I sent it to unbelievable my friend Ben O'Brien who's freaking out about this cuz Ben is he's he's an executive at Yeti my buddy Ben and you know I sent him this thing where all these other coolers all these other cooler companies are freaking out and jumping in and saying we're all sick it's on Deadspin here Jamie I'll send it to you right now these people kill me all these all right I mean I don't know if they're all right so even alright a lot of people who say you know liberals are snowflakes and you cry but everything that's like dude you guys are literally have built careers off being victims I mean what is happening here I mean I know that this is not exactly the same thing but it kind of is ridiculous now you think what protests you throw your Caird coffee maker out the back well that's sean hannity he speaks the truth and these goddamn flippers we're trying to silence the truth and I'm not having it from Keurig you want a boycott shot like the Laura Ingram thing was fascinating yeah here it is bison coolers look at these people only tap like if you ever second amendment supported site Lyon made the us we love guns join the herd it says look at that join the herd how about join the herd what join the herd flock you mean sheep you fuck you're trying to get people to be sheep like join the herd what do you why would you say herd our people cattle you're easy asshole is akin to an audience there's a great great quote in that scroll down a little bit Jamie scroll down a little bit here it is scroll down roll down so I could read that bottom text says so here we find ourselves in the midst of a dumb as rocks arm race between essentially indistinguishable cooler blended brands all trying to declare their undying devotion to guns more fervently than their rivals the whole shit is exactly as stupid as it seems and amid the fog of marketing bullshit and bad faith nra posturing there's one truth that none of this can none of this mess can obscure 479 99 is too much to pay for a cooler thank you solid fucking coolers they're very they're worth it if you can keep it for what you're if you go hunting or camping you can keep harvesting fucking very important yeah I mean it does organs very sane ly good coolers but who wrote that article give that guy's hilarious man the Deadspin author Patrick Redford promise you Patrick from dumb as rocks quote is what our discourse has become yeah it's like mass hallucinations on both sides of the political aisle you're either a Russian bot or troll or your everything's fake news and it's all you know cueing online or your lip tart or snowflake it's let's talk about that other thing the queue nun thing no the guy who blew up or guy who ran over those pis is what is the new word Ansel what is the word soul involuntary celibate yeah so yes for killing people because now Bourdain was tweeting that there's like some sort of a rabbit reddit forum with all these folks and there's like $40,000 totally well the guy who shot a bunch of women in Santa Barbara a couple years ago yeah so like I'm so attractive why don't you guys want to have sex with me it's like look it doesn't matter what you look like there's healthy loving relationships that exist for everyone crazy blame women and our violent misogynist because they are you know honored they think that they're unattractive and they're basically just blame like attractive women for not having sex with them it's really disturbing and this guy apparently mowed down a bunch of people in Toronto because he he was one of these people in seoul's creating rules and honestly the sickens me what now but I think it was 40,000 yesterday so there's like a bunch of goofballs that just signed up just to just to read see what the fuck's going on over there because people are freaking out but the idea okay here it is insult tears is a place for folks to submit screenshots not direct links of crazy stuff posted by self-described this is this is the mocking one there's another one though there's another one that Bourdain was quoting like it's fucking hard out there for a pimp I get it but don't take a truck and run over a bunch of civilians cuz you can't get laid just to the rear classes that teach people how to be nice so people like them that's man like there's those pickup artists type guys who do like Sam shouldn't it be like like hey this is not be a nice person right like this is how you want what you want a girlfriend okay we got to be someone that people want to be with like yeah exactly how do you do that oh well some people don't know how to do it right but just socially fucked up and they live on reddit they don't leave their basement and this is what comes out of it it's really unfortunate they need to interact with normal people in society and realize that there's some someone for everyone I mean you know and not really though right you got to find out in Seoul women or they're in there's no in so women women can always get laid right there's no something tells me there's no insulin well you know I know that yeah I mean did you hear about this term before I did not know about this term before no how many of these terms are out there that we don't know about they're going to blow up at our face yeah right I mean that are gonna commit massacres and to find out about some other weird subculture on reddit that has been so fucking weird time to be alive like the weirdest I think in history saying I mean like I said before the mass of the nation's there's no way to have actual dialogue or discourse about reality because you're a Russian bought you know the Liberals have not and I mean the Liberals meaning the neoliberal the think-tank establishment the people that people call leftists which is a misnomer but those people are so in denial about the fact that Trump won that they still just have to blame Russia for the fact that Trump is our president they can't accept that he won democratically know so it's really pathetic that now you have them suing the DNC over this erroneous fraudulent lawsuit that's basically threatening press freedom they're basically saying if you publish leaks including Trump's tax returns you could even say I mean this is what journalists do they publish things that are sure people give them that's a key an economic espionage they said so this is like this has profound implications for press freedom and it's incredible how desperate they are they're slapping a lawsuit on Julian Assange who's still arbitrarily detained in an embassy his internet yeah they cut off his internet so how's he get online he is not online he's they basically are trying to force him out at this point and if they forced him out they're just gonna jail him on trumped-up charges because they're trying to get him on this sex charge but hasn't that sex charge been dropped it was dropped yeah there's a lot of weird things about it initially I don't know you know all I know is that Assange they they basically said that they could not promise that he won't be extradited to the US which means they will extradite him to the US and we've already had Pompeo who's this psychotic Koch brothers shill who just got appointed said he he wants to basically see Julian Assange go down I mean he had harsh words for Julian Assange so even though Trump talks out of both sides of his mouth on the campaign he was like I love WikiLeaks he is going to prosecute him probably to save his own ass and to pretend like he you know did he say I love WikiLeaks he actually did yeah during the campaign he's not Julian Assange banging Pamela Anderson it looks like he did brought up a bunch of Chinese yeah it gets crazy I never fuckin wear embassy Julian Assange yeah promote Gateway pundit thats disturbing but um what is that well remember last time I was on your like you brought up the whole pizza gate thing and we were talking about of Julian Assange has been um I love WikiLeaks I think that he's trolling but it's irresponsible trolling where he's just kind of trying to stir shit I mean I don't know if I were Julian Assange who knows how I would feel being pushing an embassy and you know being arbitrarily detained like God I'm not able to leave ya shitty Road oh he must be going crazy I mean Julian Assange literally must be going crazy right I mean without the internet the internet was really what it was saving him so now that I know and look at all these quotes yeah yes just came out Trump said WikiLeaks I love WikiLeaks I love wiki Lina Jenny says October 2016 the Whig League stuff is unbelievable it tells you the inner heart you got to read it it tells you the inner heart what this guy just flies by the seat of his pants so full fucking hilarious I know this is prepared it's been amazing it's coming from WikiLeaks and then the other one says another one came in today Trump said this WikiLeaks like a treasure trove another one he says getting off the plane was just announcing new WikiLeaks and I wanted to say there that but I didn't want to keep you waiting said Trump boy I love reading those WikiLeaks hilarious like let him go then Donald I know that go free yeah why don't you uh pardon him yeah pardon his ass yeah well why wouldn't he like I understand why cuz because he's a bullshitter he's a con artist and he's tricked everyone into thinking that he's this somehow anti deep state anti-establishment guy and he's not and Julian Assange you know if he pardons in and that's that's his undoing I think I think if anything he'll prosecute him where's that girl that accused him of was surprised sex that's what she accused him of like they had sex with a condom and in the middle of the night he had sex with her with nobody that way that I can and we didn't knock it in and in Sweden it something I think they called it surprise sex is that a new term is like a salsa but I mean how the fuck is that guy gonna get exported to the United States because of that how's he gonna get deported sex by surprise Oh sex by surprise Pamela Anderson's the next honey pot they need editors because they should cut out a couple of words there yeah it's insane and and meanwhile while Trump is this like internet troll and he definitely is an internet troll meanwhile the evangelicals are taking the fuck over all these 5th Circuit Court judges that Trump is appointed they're all like from the 1600s the mentality is like 500 years old like session scares of shell dude sessions DeVos Pence Pence yeah Pompeyo it talks about the rapture all the time sure why does it come in does he have a knife I don't know man but they're all doing a self-fulfilling prophecy with Bolton at the helm I mean Jesus Christ with Bolton and Giuliani and nikki Haley and holy I do he's gonna fix it he's gonna come in and face another deep state outsider this this motherfucker what is he supposed to do I don't know he's like he's supposed to like end the Mueller probe and Mueller's

were the most psychotic outliers of the Islamophobic neocon wings where John Bolton's writing op-eds aying why we need to attack North Korea first why we need to bomb Iran bomb bomb bomb Iran so Giuliani meets with Mueller tries to determine if he has an open mind another headline I just saw says he's sort of he's meeting with Mueller to see her to negotiate a interview with Trump remember

in the middle of just this huge empty room and he's just like trip he really is a trip and he's he's whether he means to be or not he's a master at getting people to pay attention to him whether yeah whether this is just because he's so wacky that everybody's paying attention to him or whether it's a real calculated sort of maneuver to act outrageous and act like he's out of control but boy is he fucking good at here it is it's like dude do you have any furniture there's like a bench at the end of this a weird ass do this look like something place cry laughs and he's crying laughing now looks

through tweets yes she's like come home and take care of the kids Wow poor about her blowing minds do you like how Trump is so desperate for attention that he was like cool Kanye I think yeah thank you Kanye yeah I was talking about how I wanted Kanye are not Kanye I wanted to meet with Trump to see if I could talk him and actually fighting Joe Biden it's like you're a businessman you wanna make nice I'd be like you you're the best at everything you'd be the best at fighting hey we're in a reality star why not why not fight of all the awesome Joe Biden's on death door all he has to do is have a stiff jab and Joe Biden's going down he's fucked you know he could Trump really could win steak is just a diet pills choke him with the hair piece is fragile I can't so dude last time I was on I was just about to go to Venezuela and that was insane I went and embedded myself in the protests there holy shit is the media lying about that too and then are they lying about their you know vices on the ground acting like badasses they're embedding themselves in the protest and being like look at these fucking awesome dudes it was basically fascist mobs tried to lynch us and we got chased out of the country and then our colleague got shot because we dared to tell that the death toll that we kept hearing in the mainstream media that Maduro is mowing down all these protesters we found out that the majority of the deaths were actually caused by the protesters like either shooting people lynching people alive burning them alive or doing these giant road blockades where they would light giant flaming piles of trash and people would be you know flying off the freeway or getting an accidents and shit and so once we just reported those facts then this lynch mob came after us it was very very scary and look I mean the media is lying about the popular support that maderos government has there was massive pro-government rallies there and the country's pretty divided where it just depends on who you talk to so what is what is Vice doing over there I mean vises is an imperial arm you should everyone should check out my brother's documentary called vices an imperial are oh dude percent of the US government mmm Shane Smith's and Imperial Shane Smith welcome to Obama and Biden into their office and they were like BFF dude the CEO of voice was like Obama's like spokesperson I mean good friends with Shane I know him I know I'm I mean vice agree to you he's not an autumn of the Imperial government saying their line they're lying they're like the line not lying the line because they look I think Obama and Biden our war criminals so I don't think it's cool as a journalist to not challenge power and so when you invite these people into your office and and are really buddy-buddy with them I'm offended by that you're such a radical lefty I love it I think it's traveling Obama and Biden a war criminals even other lefties even a lefty so fucking drunk King babe Troughton King yeah there was definitely a lot of drone deaths but um check out a very heavy agenda my brother's documentary just goes over kind of a lot of stuff about Vice but I think the problem that I have advice is is just like the problem that I have with all other corporate media like we were saying there's always a line that's uniform that basically promotes the u.s. Empire and promotes American exceptionalism cellularly you've never when you fuck that's delicious that's the best show on Vice Long's world Eddie Wong's world those two what's that action bar actually Bronson is fucked that's delicious that's his show you know action bro is the rapper oh yeah yeah I haven't watched it never had a human being come in the studio and smoke more weed never seen anybody smoke just non-stop we had an ashtray that we took photos of it afterwards like this is how much weed Action Bronson smoked while he was on a show I just ran into him the other day at the UFC he smoked like how many joints 10 joints easily big ass joints big fat boys just puffed him down to a nub we were Jaime and I were stunned we're like how does he keep going does have a lot of good shit the problem is that when it comes to coverage or foreign policy I think they really missed the boat why but then they're good I'm like that's the thing it's that still except you know it's like anyone can kind of submit it's so kind of like huffington post it's like a huge tent i think they have a hard time filtering everything out i think they've gotten you know they were this radical sort of like upstart where people hadn't heard them before and they were doing wild shit and they had some really cool videos like like the guide to travel and they did that thing where they went to Liberia yeah I met with general butt naked and he's explaining about eating children and fucking insane so that was all Shan Shan did a lot of that stuff that really that's all great but that that's I I appreciate that that kind of style of journalism but I feel like what's missing is the context behind it like just vice will go to like India and be like fuck this is fucking nuts and you're like well why is there this massive disparity and quality so it's a different style of journalism but I do think that they really missed the boat on Venezuela Russia and and Ukraine and some other things when it comes to covering global conflicts because that's just the problem with a lot of journalism and corporate media in general is that you're towing a line because you're an American just like we're talking about Israelis I mean you have preconceived notions you have your own bias you have your own ethnocentric lens about world issues so it bleeds over into those conflicts and unless you're like an internationalist can you see the world from a different lens but when I was on the ground in Venezuela I was like this is not what we're seeing so what do you think is happening in Venezuela so what we I mean there there's a lot of things happening but the thing that the US government wants to obfuscate and that's why you see Venezuela continues to come up all the time as another country that needs to be taken out and helped by US interests right because they haven't bowed down to us economic of Germany it's very simple so how Maduro has popular support Maduro has a mass movement behind him the chavista movement is alive and well and that's undeniable doesn't matter who you hate him or love him but what is the narrative like what are we being told the narrative is that he's a totalitarian dictator who has seized all of power and that he has there's zero democracy and that everyone wants him gone and at the protesters he keeps mowing down and executing them whenever they comes you're saying that's not true 100 percent bullshit huh I think it's and that's you see the same thing all these countries you see the same thing whether it be Cuba Venezuela Syria I have a lot of questions about the Syria shit that we're seeing a lot of people that have questions about the Syria and they they don't believe the gas attacks there's a lot of people that don't think that actually have it makes no tactical sense for Assad to do that when he was winning the war and was taking back the remaining territory but also didn't we let them know that we're gonna bomb them and like the I don't think anybody got killed right we don't know I mean that's the thing is there's multiple who have gone to the site of of the hospital and they and there's very contradictory narratives so we don't know until the chemical weapons inspectors go and do their investigation but what I find odd is just the again uniformity with putting out these fucking narratives by the same people who sold us e-rock do you remember when Obama wanted to bomb Syria and everybody's like fuck you and then it just went away remember he stays off he's saved off a lot and and unfortunately we've you know the white helmets over there are kind of an arm of the US government - we've been funding them with 200 million dollars and on USAID I mean all of these groups on the ground it's like whether you're Obama and you use more covert means through USAID and more like drone warfare or you're the trump john bolton type where you're like let's fucking preemptively bomb and kill their families and torture their families I mean it's two sides of the same coin that's the Empire that that's consistent and will maintain but it's scary because Syria it shows you how easy we're duped you know I mean during the Iraq war it's like at least you had colon Powell holding up the vial being like here's the anthrax now it's just like you just have a social media video and we just fucking have Israel our garrison and Middle East bomb Syria to test the waters and then we just bomb them and then you have asshole like neo liberal think tank errs all paraded around the media all these generals right all these experts who are all literally Iraq war propagandists or generals or defense contractor CEOs and they're all just like Trump isn't doing enough he needs to bomb more this isn't sending enough of a message to Assad it's like what have we ever won is bombing anyone ever done anything good what tell me when the fucking us is intervened that's actually turned out good so don't sell this bullshit humanitarianism it's just nuts that we just keep falling for it and people are like well what are we supposed to do fucking don't do anything don't don't do anything and I know that people are like oh you know isolationism is bad look the US empires horrific and the largest threat to humanity the world's biggest polluter exempt from climate treaties all the shit you never see on the mainstream media why because it's owned by oil corporations and defense contractors that's why you see ads for Boeing and Raytheon like we're not looking to buy a tank when we watch the news that just there or overlords controlling the narrative they know the limitations of the debate they know that parameters and the framing that they're allowed to work within they can't even talk about the u.s. as an empire the world's biggest Empire the world's ever seen isn't it fascinating the difference between what you hear from internet commentators who are free of networks and producers and executives are telling them what to do and sponsors and and the version that you're getting on television the version that you getting on television on CNN or on any of these any of these major mainstream news networks you're getting a very watered-down very modernized and pasteurised narrative absolutely absolutely because I think that's why I do the show the entire files and and media routes radio with my brother Robbie Martin at florescent gray on Twitter but I do the show with my partner Mike prise nur because we want to retell these narratives that have been lost histories always been written by the victors all of the shit that we're seeing around the world needs to be analyzed within the lens of the u.s. being the largest empire that siphons all the fucking money in the world for military expenses I mean every issue domestic and internationally let me it's all shaped you're you're out there doing this you're traveling to Palestine and you're traveling to Venezuela you're doing all this stuff you're riding on these things you're doing all these videos does this ever get too much for you is this ever like overrun your brain does this ever freak you out that none of this is getting any better and in fact some of it's getting worse I mean it is depressing to like I was saying I mean that just the the discourse now where I'm called a Russian stooge and I was like look I I guess once a Putin puppet always a Putin puppet doesn't matter if I left Artie three years ago I you know I told you what they were on this fucking ship you off to Crimea because yeah your boots on the ground young lady go check out the war zone and then the intelligence report that came out as the definitive proof of Russian hacking basically said my show that it ended two years prior was part of the reason why Trump won so you have all this desperation to try to dilute the narrative and call everyone a Russian troll and but yeah it's depressing as hell Joe because I feel like the sanity is fucking lost and I can't actually have conversations with people and talk about reality because either you're a Trump boot licker who thinks everything's fake news and you think Q and on is gonna fucking expose the pedophiles across the country or you think I'm a Russian troll because I'm saying something that goes against the grain it's really disturbing we're living in a really really disturbing time I think there's too much information too I think that's part of the problem I think part of the problem is a narrative gets so Dinah's detoxified and there's so much shit think about because you know there are pedophiles out there I mean whenever someone does get exposed and some pedophile ring gets broken up you go oh that's real why don't even think it was real because these people are so fucking stupid and some of this shit that they believe is so dumb you know there's a lot of them are the same people that are chemtrail people or flat earth people there's like so much of the same shit coming out of these people that when you find out that there is a group of people that are pedophiles that there really have been involved in human trafficking or child slavery which is a real thing I mean this is something that's almost like it's almost like been talked about by so many wacky people that people don't believe it until you read like the the story about Jimmy Savile is that I say yeah the guy in England you like wait a minute what how long this go on four or Sandusky or any of these other you know oh my god this team yes how many gymnast were molested like a hundred more I think was more than a hunting right this is modern times this is real like it's almost like when you hear about someone like that you like that's not even possible how could that happen and then you go wait a minute he oh now he's in jail no it's true and all these poor gymnasts are coming out and saying this guy was molested you know 9/11 and it's fucked but you that stuff gets lost in the shuffle because there's so much noise there's so much information and there's too many things to pay attention you tell them being about Venezuela you're telling me about Palestine just those two things right now and back and forth in my head and then what about stormy Daniels shit jokes like it's like just happen quickly I mean why was also in Colombia and the front lines of the drug war that people should check out in the Empire files too and that that shit's nuts to do you know I saw that was great what that fucking Tom Cruise movie that much American made made in America what it was American made the movie about Barry seals who's a CIA drug runner wait is this older no it just happened a year ago no I did not hear about the Barry seals is the guy who was dropping off the drugs that they would get from the Colombian cartel and he would drop him off in Mena Arkansas do you know that story last night story it was exposed because two kids were there when the drugs got dropped off and they were murdered and their bodies were put on train tracks the the trains ran over their bodies the cops said these kids were high and they fell asleep on the train tracks their parents did an independent autopsy found out that there's stab wounds and the kids so then the parents brought this information to light everything unfolds they find out that this is gigantic drug ring that was supported by Bill Clinton this is a big part of the movie was that this Barry seal guys gets arrested with millions of dollars in cash and coke and Bill Clinton calls up the prosecutor makes him walk that's real that really didn't happen this was all in Mena Arkansas when Bill Clinton was the governor of Arkansas then goes on to be the president but this guy was bringing in drugs from Colombia and from South America at the behest of the CIA and it's a big part of the film now how much the film is bullshit and how much of it is real we don't know well I can tell you so much border of Colombia I fucking walked across there's like not I mean it is ridiculous how open that show porous very porous the border is very I'm sure but now Colombia is a different animal I mean I'm sure they're still growing coke there but it's not what it used to be when they you know very very dangerous and now it's not at all yeah the civil war recently ended in FARC is now dee-nice no fucking amazing the guy who plays Escobar is a fucking same love Emily wait what's her name Emily the woman in it she's awesome anyway yeah yeah it's fucking great I mean it is really good nice oh it's one of those shows we like to the end of it you like Oh in season two my wife shut it off so I can't do this things anymore too many people are dying what really happen watch Waco - it's all I'm scared dude it's amazing because everyone remembers Waco vaguely but wow you really need to watch it because it retells the story from one of the victims eyes and damn big fucking people they Massacre you see those tanks blowing fire into the building and they were trying to say that it didn't happen the fucking video of it right you could watch the video the tank lighting these buildings on fire while people are inside of them they were driving over the houses while the people are inside of them that's when the militia movement posed a threat to the government and now they just become isn't it weird the evolution how now militia people are like pro-trump it's sort of weird but not the guys up in Oregon that we're trying to mooch off public land to rate to run their cattle who knows they might be pro Trump Trump just sold off the last national parks Grand Staircase opening up for oil and gas drilling they probably like that shit man yeah that's an interesting thing like I've heard very different versions of that from Zinke when that guys what is he Secretary of Interior what is Zinke yeah when he was talking about it he was explaining us not what happened and that essentially went right back to where the way it was before Obama changed the the legislation changed the rules all I know is I understand it was protected under Obama for a good reason there's dinosaur fossils there Native Americans have monuments there but of course we don't care about Native American monuments we just care about Confederate monuments we don't care about abolishing all the Native American land and all the treaties we just care about protecting bizarre Confederate statues around the country I don't think we should protect Confederate statues in the sense that I don't think they should be in like you know the middle of fucking Times Square's but they should do something with them the same way they should do something with Genghis Khan statues do you know that most of those things were made during the the Jim Crow era that was being constructed that's an amazing point a lot of you think that it was right after the Civil War in fact it was like in the 60s it was during civil rights movement there was a protest to the civil rights movement oh yeah here yeah you want right you want to get a waterphone well here here's a statue in their shitty statues to a lot of them like really poorly constructed there made them quickly yeah there's it was a protest to the civil rights lot of them yeah that's crazy but the thing is like they are a representation of history just like good Genghis Khan statue would be a representation that monster I mean we think of Genghis Khan as a guy who opened up trade with China today you know you vaguely understand that he was responsible for the death of 10% of the population of the world back then changed the fuckin New York Times an article about how he changed the carbon footprint of the earth they there's literally a difference in the carbon footprint because 10% less people were alive during Genghis Khan's reign they killed everybody they fucking quit killing millions of people there's a great Dan Carlin series on it called the wrath of the cons but I've talked about that way too much but today the Genghis Khan's not offensive like you could bring up Khan nobody cares me way more horrific than anything that happened during the Civil War they had slaves and they they did everything they used they would capture people and use them as the frontline that pushed them towards their own people so they would get shot they would be the first people to get shot with arrows you know I mean there's some horrific shit but I think we should melt Genghis Khan statues I think the Confederacy is just so much more recent as Minds that they should do something with it though I mean I don't think it should be in town square for sure yeah in anybody's town square yeah but I think they should do something with them instead of melting them or smashing them they should put them somewhere at least for the future least for future people to like look back like look this is how fucking wacky people were in the 1960s they constructed these omage --is to the 1800s and slavery was legal they constructed these statues to sort of paint these people in this heroic fashion that we're fighting to keep black people slaves that's part of the thing that was this is alright there's part of the history of this country kind of put it somewhere I mean I'm not saying it should be worshipped it definitely shouldn't be prominently featured so it should be something like that right yeah and but it should be like detailed description of when it was constructed who mated what was the political affiliation of the people that created it totally yeah totally stop this whitewashing bullshit like that every time MLK Day comes around I'm always just like did you know MLK was like rabid anti-militarist and anti-imperialist no because they he was the most hated black man in America yeah someone said you know that he used to fuck all these white women like who doesn't like fucking white women you just turned it around for me no it's so strange with people how they turn on things what do you think about this whole like dueling narrative though about Trump like how he's somehow absolved from all of his wrongdoings or he's a Russian plant like are you having trouble talking to people about that well what do you think well I think the good thing about him this is the good thing is that we realize now how easy it is for a person to win the popularity contest that is the presidency of the United States and that you could get a popular person whether it's Trump or whether it's Oprah or whoever the fuck it is that decides to win next and this is a ridiculous way to pick the person who runs the biggest fucking military complex the world has ever known I mean the greatest army the world has never known by far as the United States military the commander in chief is now the guy was the host of The Apprentice that was famous for saying you're fired yeah I mean this is this is a popularity contest that's insane you don't have to have special qualifications you just have to be deemed the people that the person that people like the most yeah that's insane it's also insane to have one giant alpha chimp to be the top guy or the top gal to run the whole project and I saw that with Hillary too there were so many people that were looking for Hillary to win because they wanted a woman to win because they thought it would be a historic victory regardless of how fucking creepy she is regardless of all the crazy shit that she's done regardless of her history regardless of all the the fucking way that they hacked the DNC and they literally conspired to keep Bernie Sanders from winning the nomination I mean they act the democracy they did it not the Russians and everybody's like yeah screw voter ID voter suppression all that shit gerrymandering I need a woman so bad that they were willing so back to sleep yeah and then well the gay person next you know the black person a woman or our trans persons mmm-hmm I mean honestly yeah and that's the problem I think that's the conflation with like the left and the neoliberal think tankers is that they use identity politics to sell more corporatism like they use it to brand slap pink shit on Boeing Jets and be like no be Women's Day you know I mean bright but it's not like they actually care about oppress and marginalize people so it's it's really interesting we're in an infancy the infancy of understanding we really are I mean three people ago three people go yeah and it's like three people from now or be like these fucking Apes we're crazy yeah I think we're in the middle of it you know whether it's the apprentice guy I mean if he didn't win what you want fucking Ted Cruz to win get the fuck out his mind too and now all he's doing is sucking Trump's ass you see all the speeches about him dude crazy Trump calls his wife a dog says his dad killed JFK Andres and Ted Cruz is like you know what I'm I really like him now yeah why am I like him I love how he calls people a name like it's crazy Hillary just a lot of things that he does that I wish he wasn't the president I wish I could just laugh at some of the things he does and I wouldn't feel bad about it right you know because he's a fucking loon I mean he's a crazy old rich dude he does a bunch of wacky shit that I find to be incredibly entertaining if he wasn't the leader of right if he wasn't in fucking power I mean I think it wants to be there either if John Paul Ryan sure didn't want to be there anymore probably got some sweet-ass deal with some big pharma Lobby or something he's probably realizing like the writing's on the wall for him like yeah he's like oh I see what happens if you're president I'm catching radiations just for being on the outside dollar check waiting for me yeah I'm gonna go fishing but I don't I think the Democrats are so stupid Joe that you even saw their slogan come up for 2018 it literally said look at the other guy don't that was their genius slogan look at the other they're gonna do the same thing they're gonna do the same thing Trump is gonna win again guaranteed I guarantee you unless they really let Bernie Sanders take the reigns and I just feel like they're too threatened by his economic policies that they're not going to by the time Bernie wins his head will be right nipples are his head just keep sinking further and further down she keeps getting more everybody are going to you all the job that's his latest one he wants a guarantee a job who's gonna make these jobs Bernie you fuck you don't know shit but looking ahead say that you can't say you're gonna guarantee a job cuz who's gonna make the jobs you're just gonna make up jobs what are you do we're gonna get that money gonna take it from me and give it to people because you haven't give a fake job yeah what are you gonna do how can you say I'm gonna guarantee every American a job that is a fucking insane thing to says he said how no because here's the thing what if you just like I'm on job and you just let you don't want to do shit you're lazy you're a fuckup well I guaranteed everybody but I got fired you guaranteed me a job there's another job I don't want to be a liar like what are you gonna do how are you gonna give everyone a job it's literally not possible that's a fucking insane thing to say I guarantee a job for everybody you know it's not in the same those saying the other shit that he says I mean he's been out on the floor you had to give him credit for the last 30 years whether it be Gulf War Syndrome like GMOs I mean he's out there fighting for his people article yeah like it's important to have people yo you have to have like both sides you have to have radical right radical left and let's meet all somewhere in the middle you know but if you look at like Europe and other countries he is considered probably center yeah like you look at Jeremy Corbyn he is like he's Bernie Sanders on steroids where he we're seeing he's in Britain yeah yeah but um what's crazy about the Hillary sick of fans is like you see near a Tandon and all these assholes who worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign on the fucking eve of Trump bombing Syria they're like thank Susan Sarandon thanks a lot great job it's like I'm sorry Susan Sarandon made Trump I'm serious dickwad thanks lamer and it's also like Hillary would Ben would have been bombing Syria very quickly yeah she called for a nobody she's got a big dick I mean you remember that I mean everybody quickly forgets that Qaddafi shit you know what she was laughing in that interview nothing laughing we Came we saw he died ha ha ha like who are you well what person laughs like that when someone gets killed even if Bill Cosby if some woman who Bill Cosby raped showed up outside the courtroom he was walking down the stairs and she ran up leave Harvey Oswald Jack Ruby style and shot him right in the chest I wouldn't laugh I'd like whoa that's fucking crazy I would say that I would be I would be freaking out I'd be like wow that guy just lost his like what a crazy life that guy had that guy's life was like this magical ride of celebrity until he got busted raping people and in the last years of his life were in a hellacious state of being accused of something and and probably only got a fraction of what he was actually what he actually did I mean how many women out there know that they were raped by him and just said nothing because they just don't they don't want to be a part of the big circus and how many victims are there fuck is at least 50 it's at least 50 yeah Weinstein is there anyone else that's that much of a serial rapist see but the Weinstein thing was like he was forcing them to have sex with him in order to give them roles right he wasn't drugging them it's just as creepy in a way but it's not quite the same thing because but Bill Cosby was almost like a monster right like you would like rile you who knows what the fucking did to you while you're passed out for a day in his house yeah but he's also the woody posed at like Ryan's team is this fat gross I got like Shrek ears on either human we was everybody everybody knew stay the fuck away from him back up to his room he's a monster that was the whole thing with that guy but what what Bill Cosby was with this moral voice of black America back here pants up yeah don't don't you have those those sagging jeans using all those bad words remember what we were talking about before do you remember the Eddie Murphy thing where he called up at Eddie Murphy had it in his movie raw right it was in rar delirious might have been tell there is so good fucking good but oh man he got a call rich a liar he called up Richard Pryor so you can find that so you'd find that online Eddie Murphy on Bill Cosby because richard pryor talked shit to bill cosby alright yeah bill cosby wasn't half the fuckin comedian the ratchet Pryor was and I'm sure that bothered I'm here play this look at his outfit damn he has a good outfit and chastised me on the phone for being too dirty on stage it was really fun ever met him and he just started was you should call me up because he was Bill and tell me that he did about what comedy is all about and I sat and listened to this man chastise me and when you you forget you groan you feel like one of the Cosby kids telephone and Bill got rowing me I was like hello mr. Cosby here I would like to get how good Eddie Murphy was my guy everything you do comes home from school the other day with a big smile on its face if my son looks just like me he walks through the door looking at me with this big smiling because I need money to go see a show please if the child is smiling this way because she needs money I have to give them money but I do not handle the money in the house my wife Camille handles the ticket money so I must go seem like a bitch anyway it is a long bit it's like 60 seconds it's great but basically calls up Richard Pryor yeah and he goes Richard Pryor said do the people laugh do you get paid hotel bill to have a Coca to smile and shut the fuck up but that was really really did really did call him up meanwhile while Eddie Murphy was doing that you got to realize this is the 80s right so while Eddie Murphy was doing that sketch Bill Cosby very likely was probably raping somebody oh absolutely entirely possibly raping him as he was on the stage it's entirely possible yeah I just saw I just saw Whoopi Goldberg do stand-up have you seen her recently no it was really interesting I mean she going back to the horse not her pussy well ya know crazy I thought she was gonna talk about Trump or some shit and she came out talking about her vaginas so so dry that she has sand coming out of it and I saw her in Vegas it was it was really was it good um it was interesting to see she would be like extremely fucking dirty but it was also yeah uncomfortably you know but then she open it up to Q&A which I thought was weird oh yeah yeah how did she do that did you have a line of people or she just she just like in you know now I'm gonna open it up she's like ask me anything and I was like I don't know what the fuck like what asked you people were like how how was a ghost what's it like working with those cunts on the view how do not murder Meghan McCain when you're sitting next well who is the one that she used to always get no whatever happened that gal got replaced by John McCain's daughter I guess how the hell is John McCain still alive he's had brain cancer for like a year he's just gonna get some more surgery he's got some new surgery like gut surgery coming yeah I mean it's got something going on in his gut it's gonna have to get in tests really hurry yeah serious shit um what that Elizabeth Hasselbeck chick she was like the original megan kelly yeah like the original hot blonde mean lady you know the hot blonde mean conservative lady shut your ass down there's a fuckin market for those oh yeah hot blonde mean conservative ladies a tough market no good yep you know again filling that back in the Tommy Laurens they love it get pull yourself up by your bootstraps how weird is it that Megyn Kelly's just now this like weird talk show host just a normal like an Ellen she's like trying to rebrand herself as an element like you cannot go from like in the Fox News mouthpiece you know frothing at the mouth about all the shit to just being like problems this is an odd switch yeah but they don't ask the fangs come out they don't then yeah the Jane Fonda shit you know what the Jane Fonda she has Jane Fonda about plastic surgery and Jane follows yeah you asked me about plastics right I'm gonna promote a move right we have three minutes you know would I look good yeah but I accept that she's talked about having plastic surgery so why that's because she's this is not organic right these shows are not organic it's not a podcast I'm just sitting down talking wants to get some sound bite and this is probably part of the agenda so Jane Fonda shut her down and just start talking about the movie again and then talked about her and so then later on damn good she's not not bad for 150,000 years old so later on Megan Kelly started talking shit about Jane Fonda on the air that's saying about how people used to call her Hanoi Jane she went back to them but you could see the things come out remember when she said she alluded to the fact that Trump poisoned her the morning of the debate I think we talked about that what yeah well she got coffee from some weird driver the morning of the debate and we already know that that crazy shit was happening between her and Trump and she said she got violently ill she was trying to tell him I don't drink coffee and then he was like no drink is good she drank the coffee got violently ill and had to like sit next to a puke bucket almost thinking that she would have to cancel the debate basically alluding to the fact that Trump might have poisoned her that day Oh mom I swear on I don't know I have never taken coffee from some stranger right it forced me to drink right right right yeah and I'm not as famous she's recanted it after he got elected maybe out of fear maybe she was like oh shit you really did do this then shit their pants once he got away God you know gorgeous earth I mean he made a lot of enemies and a lot of people made enemies with him it's gonna be really interesting to see what happens with all these criminal charges and what's gonna happen with Cohen and all these other people that you learn investigation it's so strange because it's all just we're waiting for something to be highly illegal and obvious and it's not yet so I'm like where's the thing and when the thing right it's out and people start going down they start going to jail well who's gonna rat them out what's gonna happen pardon him I mean that's gonna be to impeach him you have to have a consensus in the Republican majority Congress so I don't understand how that's going to happen unless he perjures himself right the perjury trap like Bill Clinton unless he says some shit on the stand but I think that he's smart enough to just say yes no I don't know hopefully well personally I want him to be fuckin engaged I fuckin hate that guy the Trump some people are saying that Trump supporters since Republican Trump supporters are the ones that okayed the Mueller raid on Cohen's office right what do you mean you know I miss that wouldn't would the the people that raided Mueller's office right that Trump supporters Republicans had to give the green light yeah the judge was appointed by Trump yeah yeah so this is like this there must have been overwhelming evidence the crazy thing about this is it's almost like Game of Thrones like it's playing out so slow and it's it just keeps building and people keep getting indicted and people keep getting pulled in and Cohen just pleaded the fifth right and as that one happened that little pussy Kushner gets indicted for something man that have you heard the one speech he gave and you've never heard from him again because his voice sounds like a little mouse I grabbed you talk there's a good reason for that couldn't act like that he reminds me of American Psycho yeah you know holy dude just as inaudible like as a looking pretty boy j.crew when my father in law decided to run this campaign the best I could because I believed in him and his ability pause group the lives did he reach powder yeah how does Donald let that guy fuck his dog and he wants the fucker right so it's like how are you letting this weird guy fucker you only let some fucker only if I'm in the room do it right praiser touch your feet I did not collude with Russia like he's like I did not collude with Russia I did more than I want to hear his voice a small Americans and now serving the president and the people of the United States has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime oh my god I am so grateful I believe the opportunities are great I'm so unimportant now you know what actually like such as Middle East peace hold up and that guy's a man of character your strong will I bet that motherfucker the Middle East conflict remember when he was like you know what Jared crusher is actually gonna solve the peace between Israelis and Palestinians really interesting I would like to see that guy hike with a heavy backpack see how long I bet he's got about 14 minutes in them his hands are probably likes openly they probably do this thing paraffin wax little tiny hands he puts his hands in paraffin wax ever you know just let them sit do you know he gets manicures for sure how good God just face strange character it's a little facial that's his wife his wife is hot Donald's daughter is fuckin huh yeah she had a lot of work done so we good yeah really I'm not against getting work done yes how about that that's like weird shit that's like changing your ethnicity yeah yes that's nuts but yeah Jared Kushner is nuts all these people are men they have a kid right oh they have a bunch I think they just had their third child in the hammer in it yeah somehow look there look she's smoking hot where you go what are you well our Trump I'd want to fuck her too woo imagine no it's interesting to like stormy Daniels and the other woman who said you know that she had an affair with Crum she said that both of them said that Trump told her you remind me of my daughter Ivanka you're beautiful and smart yeah and then they've had sex hala hala de playa can't bang you kid but you can bang someone who looks like them yeah remember when Ted Cruz liked a porn treat did he yeah did you sure he did that or saying in his staff I think it was fucking him because the woman in the porn video looked exactly like his wife oh Jesus Louise's who what what what presidential candidate is ever gonna come out and say I love porn great you know I can masturbate and then they'll be done with it and I don't have to have sex with anybody yeah it's great why not I mean well Obama admitted that he almost shot up heroin it's like why couldn't Trump have just said yeah I banged a porn star okay almost did he say almost shot up here only said the needle was like oh yeah he said that he was almost gonna do it and he was in there and yeah that's heavy yeah but like why did Trump go through this whole NDA nonsense knowing that it could bite him in the ass yeah I probably thought that Michael Cohen had it locked down and then you know they'd pay people off in the past I guess and probably no one cared until he became president right right what's your president and they're like oh screwed a is just so overwhelming I mean it's not just a scrutiny from the American media it's a scrutiny all across the world I mean everybody's paying attention to everything you've ever done ever and with him with him honestly the thing that scares me is not that the thing that scares me is all the business deals what's crazy is how many small business owners went under because Trump had these relationships apparently allegedly whatever I have to say with you know he would they would do these construction jobs and small contractors would just not get paid and they would have to sue and they would wind up going under they couldn't they couldn't compete with him and this is something that Joey Diaz talked about on the podcast and he knew people that were involved in construction companies that went under because Trump fucked the moment this is like a standard thing that he would do back then not a people damn yeah I mean he had a reputation Google Trump had a reputation for not paying contractors construction contractors it's it was it was a real issue and it's an issue of character and morals and ethics that is to me way more important than who he decides to have sex hundreds alleged Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills oh god looking at soldiers what must you say billionaires didn't pay dishwashers painters waiters yeah lowly minions you know and then you know how much of that is he doesn't really pay because someone else pays for him and it got lost in the shuffle and you know we know Chris there's a giant slumlord - yeah I'm using oh yeah yeah I mean looks like a salami yeah they're all diagonals I mean by that car imagine being Trump having as much money in property as you do and not having any criminal activity I mean how the hell you can't be that fucking be hard you know a few crooks you know and just the amount of money that's involved like how the fuck can you pay attention to all that like you'd have to have someone like to think that he's responsible for all that is also naive honestly because if you look at the amount of properties that Trump owns and to think that he's paying attention to all that and the management of all that and the paying of the contractors and all that but it probably trickles down from the top right right that the kind of ethics that would be involved in not paying off contractors that's like the whole Russia thing just kills me because like we were saying it's been a year and a half there's been no smoking gun it's just a whole bunch of little things like Oh Russian trolls online right this that the DNI report which I was in but no one's talking about the fact that he obviously has ties with Saudi Arabia Turkey Israel like oh there's collusion with all these countries why just stop it Russia would you see what he said today he said that Comey lied and that he did stay the night in Russia Comey lied in his memo that's me saying I did not catch that this is the latest Oh so something happened whether he's realized that they they found his flight records and they realized that the jet was in Russia for more than 24 hours so then he said call me lied I never said I didn't stay the night in Russia who this is this is a strange move here yeah because this is either check or checkmate like this is a sneaky one like what happens here because you're Colonials I happen if Comey lied the whole thing's fucked if Comey really did lie at stake the whole thing's fucked Wow and if Trump lied and Comey somehow or another has some recording or something of it I don't know if that's the case it's also Jews I just don't think that yes the Russia collusion thing it's like where is the smoking gun oh where is it I mean all we see are these this Hamilton 68 dashboard that's literally run by the Chertoff group Michael Chertoff was Bush's DHS in Hamilton 68 - it's the think tank that you see unquestioningly repeated in every single article about Russian trolls where it's like Russian trolls are spreading NRA shit online to try to foment discontent in this country or Russian trolls are promoting Bernie Sanders or Russian trolls are promoting Jill Stein when you look at the actual methodology of how they determine who's a Russian bot and who's a Russian troll it all comes from this think-tank run by literally Iraq war propagandists Bill Kristol and Michael Chertoff so that's what I'm saying these narratives are it's so obscure to find out who's really managing the narratives but it really is all the same people sent were they're conning us again they're conning us hmm because we want the end goal of the Empire is basically Russia China Iran you know Iran and Syria the stepping stones basically ultimately to China and Russia and those are the biggest competitors with with the Empire and so they want to just foment that hot war with Russia you know what I've been going down a rabbit hole well yeah Chinese electronics Huawei got banned from AT&T and Verizon when all these other Huawei is the number three phone manufacturer in the world and they also manufacture network equipment and there's some so it seems to me like this is my conspiratorial mind and I'm just gonna say right away I'm a moron and I know very fascinating the Huawei makes some really good cell phones like beautiful 40 megapixel camera excellent design gorgeous screen and they were about to be launched in America under AT&T and then the State Department warned against people buying Huawei phone saying their spy devices and told people to not buy huawei phones so weird then they're bringing up charges against Huawei for something to do with Iran so and then there was an article today this is where it gets really weird the compliance of the media there was an article today about this the drop in sales of Chinese cell phones it's Chinese cell phone sales plummet by 21 percent I was reading today but what like what is happening here like they were saying that there was some networking equipment that was made by Huawei that was sending was sending a certain amount of data that didn't seem right and they believe that some something was encoded in their software in their hardware that allowed them to hack into it and extract data and use this as a spying device so then they were saying that this is the case with the phones and these we shouldn't buy these Huawei phones but then the Android people like I sent Jamie a couple articles on it because I was fascinated by this I really thirty articles about it I'm like in like the last week and a half and these real smart tech people were like this is horseshit first of all if these devices did have something in them other than stock Android or Android with whatever their operating system is that they put on over it like their skin you would see it these guys would be able to see it they'd be able to find it this is they're not any more sophisticated these people well there's just something going on there's something going on there's some weirdness to it all it's like they might be trying to tank these companies they might be like there might be a concerted effort and then the thought was that maybe perhaps there's some sort of a deal with Samsung and iPhones which are the two top manufacturers to keep out this third party which makes these really high-end cell phones like this the huawei has this porsche design mate pro RS it's $2,000 it's like the most expensive cell phone you could buy this thing's off the charts awesome I mean it takes like night time a photo it turns it into like almost daylight like crazy 40 megapixel like the adjustable aperture like like as good as it gets in terms of like modern-day cell phones they're saying don't buy it don't buy it's a spy device shouldn't buy it because they don't update them very well yeah I'm sure I mean okay I talk about something and I don't type it in I don't write a message I don't write an email and I'll see an ad so it's spying on us all the time that doesn't happen to you it hasn't happened to me but it's happened to enough people that I believe you it's insane well I believe you know what no matter what really crazy talk to so many people that have had that happen somebody sent me a tweet yesterday that said they were listening to a podcast that we were doing we were talking about something and then that something appeared in their Google ads exactly and he's like I never looked up this I never and the oh no it wasn't a Google ad it was a youtube search it was a YouTube suggested he's like my fucking computer's listening yep computer and and what map is doing this I mean I'm about just go to a flip phone I don't want to it's it's bull we know the youtubes audio is being listened to because they're mining it to four ad ad stuff already it's not even that's not a spy thing that's just out there that's how they do it right but is that if you're playing things yeah so when we're playing so if he's playing a podcast on YouTube YouTube's listening to that and that's how they suggest it's just how many ads well I think might be happening which people are noticing now is not just that it's happening within software it's that your actual device the microphone is on and the laptop camera is on so people block the camera with tape but they're not blocking a microphone exactly how the hell do you block the microphone I don't even know where it is how do we have like some sort of tutorial about like how we can prevent all of our shit from being collected like that whole the Facebook Cambridge analytical thing I feel like everyone missed the boat of what that story was you heard about that data mining all your shit it's like yeah they're on Facebook everything's being taken in data mined that's very obvious but what wasn't really investigated I think Channel four did this crazy investigation where they pretended like they were a patron trying to hire Cambridge analytic Essam billionaire dude and they put them on camera it's all recorded the guys are basically like it's basically like a private intelligence firm almost like a Blackwater where you can hire mercenaries to set up honey pots with prostitutes take down politicians spy on them they set up shell companies with mi6 Mossad it's all just untraceable shit they just ghost out they said they can ghost in out of countries they literally said that they staged the entire Kenyan election they were like we staged the whole thing we wrote all the speeches yeah can you Jenna this is this is backed by billionaire Robert Mercer this is Channel four did a crazy investigation about it and and so that's why I'm just like why is everyone focusing on Facebook data that stupid game that people play with it's called wind farm world farm fuck yeah what is that shit yeah that was the thing per farmville yeah that that's what people are talking about data getting the government there killing people and like the banna nights and the Breitbart people are how many other companies are there like this I always think yeah well we're all focused on Russian trolls 14 Russian trolls in saint-petersburg how many companies like Cambridge analytic alike Blackwater like all these things are operating around the world doing all this got to be a fuckload a lot there's got to be a lot that we don't know of it because it's only one with something fuck's up or someone gets shot and AD and like what is that change the Kenyan elections cool like in cell we never heard it right so people are talking about thing there's got to be so many of those things that are just bubbling up in the distance stir being man disturbing well you said how do I deal you got to do art and you got to go on hikes and go explore major yeah but you are do you ever want to like non-constant rent do you ever feel like it's not gonna do any good like this is this is my question that I'd give to everybody who's like an activist who's very adamant about change and doing something do you ever feel like you just don't want to participate anymore you just want to just just someone asked me the other day they said you know you have to admit that you wouldn't rather live anywhere in the world other than here and I said I I would because I can't have a kid here because I don't have maternity leave and I don't have any help I was like so no I stay here because I have to and I have to fight it's not about me and it's not about myself it's about the greater good and it's about putting this information out there because especially in the Trump era I feel like no one is really criticizing him in the correct way and putting it in the proper context of the u.s. Empire and I feel like I need to do that and I I don't get sick of it and I don't think that you know even if you do get burnt out and you get tired you just have to keep going because this is you don't have to you don't do it for recognition you don't do it to be on a magazine cover because you're never going to be rewarded in the system that we live in that we're gonna always live on the margins and we're gonna always fight on the margins and that's just the way it is and you hope somebody's listening so that alters their perception and then somehow another it spreads yeah I think history is instructive and I think that's why that's why I do what I do I want to instruct people about how history has shaped our reality today and how we can use it to learn and prevent similar atrocities from continuing I mean I just hope that we can evolve to the point where we can do that you essentially work for yourself now right I work for Telesur Telus or is a also state media six Latin American countries including Venezuela and including Cuba Ecuador and some other countries fund Telus or but because of the sanctions that Trump has put on Venezuela it's it's on a tedious leg so it sucks that the only other place that you can go is really just begging for donations on patreon but is the Empire files that is it through Telus or no we yeah so we are produc I have a production company and I produce the show and then I sell it to them but you say begging for donations I really don't see it that way because if you just give people the option I bet people would be more than willing to support your your work if they're interested in your work and it seems like there's so many people out there that would be now and it'd be a great way to be completely independent and not beholding to any state-run group or anything else you just basically be putting out content if people didn't like it anymore they wouldn't pay for it anymore yeah no III think that well I'm not beholden to anyone because I don't really have anyone telling me what to do like in Venezuela I was interviewing the Defense Minister no one vetted my questions I was confronting him about all this crazy shit I mean no one in corporate media would be allowed to do that with our government but yeah to your point I think that we've just got into a place with journalism and media where that's the way it is like you have to invest in the journalists that you want to support and that's just the way that the world works because media is not a sustainable business if you want it to be holding power to account but it seems like that's not the worst thing in the world to have something like patreon or some similar type of situation where people can just donate and I have that on media routes and on my podcast media routes radio I do have a patreon there but yeah you're right I mean to do in but to do investigative journalism it's hard to do documentaries it takes a lot of money and time and I think that's probably where it'll end up if if we keep going down the road that we are which is you know whether it be arty or Telus or this this fear campaign against state media and against the Russian dragon yeah and yeah it's tough so we'll just keep trying to speak that truth you know well I'm glad you're out there swinging you know it's a it's a scary job and luncheonette you go to crazy places too I mean you're not you're not swinging from the comfort of your own home you're out there in the war zones it was scary when we I confronted soldiers in Colombia because I realized that I could probably die either by housing or a mine like because there's mines all over the fucking place and they were just like you need to leave right now if you want to live basically and it was like okay well see you later see you later guys that's why I asked if ever this seems like how long do you see yourself doing this until you're an old lady you know I think that if I have a family things I might drink if you want a family whole no I think that if I have a family and things might change where I might you know not you know put my life on the line so often I mean I would imagine so but um yeah I mean I have to someone's got to keep poking holes in this bullshit because it just keeps happening and we keep getting duped and someone has to be out there countering the narrative and telling these stories from marginalized and oppressed people who have not been given those platforms and I have to keep doing that part well I would suggest you stay offline for a couple weeks after this one just to avoid the shitstorm and it's always great scene thanks so much everyone happy Martin org and the Empire files and media roots thank you so much Joe you are amazing everyone check out Joe's stand-up and Abby Martin on Twitter and Instagram is just a grand thank you so much [Music] [Applause] [Music]
