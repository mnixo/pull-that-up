three two one hello Mike hey Joe hello pant pant Ellis pant you call it pant pant pant Ellis pant Ellis one one word yeah one word like Roseanne or like Godzilla okay cool all right dude well nice to meet you guys well nice met you yeah but nice to meet you for people who don't know let's just give them right off the bat your story what happened to you how you got in trouble in Canada for a joke yeah real trouble yeah realtor I got fined $42,000 of Canadian American Canadian which was like now close to 40 mm yeah yeah and it was yeah let's say like 38 that was an American and there's a thing in Canada called the Human Rights Commission that every province has one of those I had a joke about um a little boy that was famous he was a singer he was a disabled boy and the the joke it wasn't even that mean it was just this little kid that was disabled and he was uh he was kind of like a make-a-wish Foundation type kid right and he was famous in Canada he was famous in French Canada he had sang for the Pope and the the joke was but like I was super happy for him at first this little deaf boy he's dying he his dream was to sing for the Pope and then he became like like front-page news on you know everywhere Montreal and then he got a record deal and he sang for the Canadians then he came out with a book and then at the end I was like why isn't he dead yet like wasn't he supposed to die that's just the right the base system like he's a little dark joke yeah yeah and like it's what I do is dark humor like I'm not I'm not Ray Romano right so I did that joke and in never did that joke on TV did that joke in a special that it didn't air on TV I cut a couple of things out for TV but I get a letter from the human rights people saying you owe 80 at first it was they wanted eighty two thousand for the joke they were like we listened to the joke we think that this boy's family deserves eighty two thousand because of this joke what a weird number yeah and I thought I thought they were like it dis how fucking stupid I am when I got the letter and I saw human rights commission I thought I was getting an award or a prize or something because I do I do a lot of benefits and suffered for I raise money for disabled people so I was like fuck it's a bad time they recognize me as a good dude so I read this and then I called my manager and I'm like fuck they want 80,000 and we were like okay let's just get the best lawyer we can so I found the best lawyer in Canada that does a free speech stuff met him and he told me the reason why it was 80,000 80,000 is a weird number like if they ask two million you're gonna fight it but 80,000 is big enough to kind of scare you but not enough to really scare you so you'll go like look okay can I give you 40 and then they'll go okay can I ask a question so this bit you said you cut it from the special right so how did they know about it it was a I did this interview on TV and the the reporter talked about the bit he had never seen the bit also how did he know about the bed someone told him about the bit but the bit was in the special in the special so it was on the Internet also you could watch it yeah you could watch it on the Internet and this special had been in movie theatres in Canada it's just when we sold it on TV right is this in French running yeah it was in French that's how it was weird whenever people were talking about the bit they were like it was especially in Canada and in England where it's very left-leaning people were were talking shit about the bit and I was like you you can't even understand that joke that's in a language you don't speak about a person you don't know so they people almost made it look like I just picked this random disabled boy and I was making fun of his disability but I was making fun of the fact that he had become famous because everyone thought he was dying and then he didn't die which is a you know yeah it's a it's a dark joke no it is not even that particularly mean no it's a question really you're not saying hey why don't you die I spent money you little fuck you can say that no you said how come he's alive yeah exactly yeah and when I did the the thing for TV I cut a couple things out that I thought could get me in trouble because I figured you know when you put out a special and people pay for the special you should be allowed and I still think this and you know this I think everyone should think this way if like if you put out a special you should be allowed to say whatever the fuck you want to say but if you sell your special to like CBS or ABC then of course they're gonna cut shit out of course but like your last special on Netflix it would be crazy if Netflix said look Joe we fucking loved your special but this you got to cut this at you got to cut welcome to Netflix credit that's one of the reasons why they're so amazing they don't give you hardly any input at all there's to go hey we really liked it it's like they don't do anything yeah they you know I had some controversial shit in this one in my last one they just let it go that's much appreciated yeah I was really happy when I saw your last special I thought it was the perfect thing to come back from Nannette like the Hannah Gatsby special that it's an important special but it's not funny and and it's like it's almost you know what it is it's her art right yeah you caught the problem is we're putting it in this box right you're saying it's stand-up comedy but if you do something and it has some laughs in it and then it goes on this this but by this journey biographical journey of your life and your observations and you say it in a way that's meaningful and people still enjoy it but it's not funny anymore it's still I mean a lot of comics didn't like it a lot of commas get upset and I was like okay I get I get why you would say it's not comedy but I don't get why you would get upset because obviously people like it like I don't get upset if people like certain books or certain yeah songs that like hey I have a good friend who likes fish you know I mean I don't hate fish but it's not my cup of tea right it's not a bad that makes me upset that your friends your friend likes 50 likes it's not it's not Jamie and I don't nothing to get fish I just maybe I need to listen to it hi maybe I need Jamie says no it's not Jamie like that that Chanukah to be special like I really wanted to watch it because I didn't want to be some guy that listened wrote three minutes said fuck you so I did listen to it and I do get why it's like it's in it's an important special and I think it's good for what it is but it I didn't like the fact that people were saying this is comedy and time came out with the list the most hilarious specials and that was number one at a time when it's like a diversity Olympia award yeah whole thing is it's all very diverse there's some funny people on it no doubt but you can still like these list first of all these lists are always weird because like especially when you it's a someone subjective opinion and there's nothing wrong with that but it like who the fuck are you like who's this seat it's it's who is this person I would like to see Chris Rock's list yeah of top ten comedians or a top ten comedy specials or you know someone like that someone who's who I know who they are I understand their thought process maybe this person is a famous writer I don't know that I don't know that they're famous journalist I'd like to see like Matt Taibbi 'he's like top ten movies but it's like a certain tetes to these top ten things he like says who yeah so this is also subjective it's so weird yeah and the comment like the Nanette thing is I need to watch it I've only watched parts of it but my reaction to it was my reaction to everybody else's reaction so I'm like what is going on here either it's the most amazing thing ever or it's some sort of an affront to comedy yeah you know and either it gets a bit of both well because I think it is it's like it's it's I like a lot of people were saying it's like a TED talk and I think it kind of is it's a funny TED talk nothing wrong with that yeah there's nothing I mean this is my point on all this it's like why do we need these sort of parameters that comedy has to stay in before we accept it because it doesn't have to be your kind of shit Yeah right for it to be something that people enjoy obviously someone enjoys it there's a lot of people enjoying it because it's not theirs some of those when they make those lists were you like let's include this person let's include that we got to make sure we have X amount of women or X amount you can see there's almost like there's a thought process behind creating these lists but some of those people will appear on those lists over and over again so that means to me for sure somebody loves that special like that special is like number one on so many people's list not just number two or number three its number one a lot of people's list so someone's enjoying it so like what do I give a shit what does anybody give a shit does my reaction is my reaction of these comics that I look up sadly what but why I remember why I remember why they got mad it wasn't because they were saying it's the number one special is cuz she went on an interview I think in Australia and said if you're a comedian who only cares about making people laugh then you should stop doing comedy you shouldn't be in show business they shouldn't see you publicly you should give a message right but I disagree with that strongly but from her perspective what she's trying to do it's like someone who's really in a rock and roll like fuck rap music I mean the rock in rock okay you know that's what they're saying I mean that's what she's saying she's doing it in like a comedic form she's like you're only an economy that makes people laugh fuck you yeah yeah I'm in the deep comedy bitch I mean there's nothing brought luck one of my favorite all-time stand-ups for sure is Mitch Hedberg and Mitch Hedberg had all non sequiturs nothing was there's no deep meaning to any of it all of it was super silly and still to this day like especially if I'm in traffic I'll listen to that shit cuz it's just so silly yeah you know he's fucking it was amazing yeah but it's just that is his expression and everybody's expressions gonna be different enough this is something I've figured out over the course of my letting get it right all the time when I was young I was like you know I I hated people that didn't swear and I was like there's no way you talk like that for real there's no way you talk like that for real but then after a while I was like why do I care do some of the best ever don't swear like Jerry Seinfeld didn't swear some of the best comedians of all time is it's it's not even a subjective question I mean or an opinion like you you everybody knows it's one of the best ever if you have a hundred comedians that are the best ever Jerry Seinfeld on yours that lists bullshit yeah Brian Regan hilarious doesn't swear it off you know like there's a lot of great comics who just have their thing like there's there's comics that have puppets that are really funny like just because you have a puppet doesn't mean you're not really funny but for a lot of comics folk games go to poker yeah it's weird I'm not there yet like everything else I was on board I was like George yeah I don't George but but that was almost making fun of the whole thing Moses thing but and then I fucking love that people get mad at him because he's moved to see me tryin to hide it it was just funny you know there was a there's been a few really fun puppet acts you know um I mean what cuz a shit do whatever the fuck you like you know I think that's a thing though when you're in your 20s that anything that isn't like what you do or you like is garbage right yeah cuz I remember I was like that too like a plus like that was I think a thing about being in your 20s in the 90s cuz we had just had you know Kennison and and you know like Bill Hicks and so if if you were doing like like like Jeff Foxworthy where we were judging you but we shouldn't like yeah who gives a shit yeah Jeff Foxworthy apparently is a nicest guy in the history of the world yeah he looks nice I don't know Larry the Cable guy's nice as fuck he's super sweet and he got super judge - oh dude hard people went hard on him Dave crossroad a crazy letter to him like a letter from Dave the desk of days cross it was for it was like tongue-in-cheek but it's the idea was that he was somehow or another promoting racism I think that was what people that said he's doing characters real name's Dan Whitney yeah alright his character is a really dumb guy who doesn't have sleeves who's fucking hilarious and he's a good character his character isn't racist though it's not racist but you know there's like these lands that like there's once you run out of like really high-profile targets that are actually racist then you have to like find gangs or clothes do that I don't know what you're I don't like we say in there what are you saying about Asian people like don't do it don't you fucking do I mean there's some there's some things you could still get like there's some like absolute realities that you you can say right like you could say Asian people in generally have higher IQs and they're better at math as a fact Joe that's a it's a solid fact you know but if it goes the other way yeah if it's positive right like I always do it the thing about white people is we are not as smart as Asians see I could say that because I'm white but if I was Asian I was like white people are just not as smart even though it's true like terms of IQ tests and mathematics in particular they're just fucking smarter they're so so much smarter you know what they're doing in Harvard yeah see this shit they're they're making it more difficult for Asian students to get into Harvard there's a class-action lawsuit because they've actually raised the score levels that Asians have to achieve because there's so many that's racism that's actual racist racist super racist it's fuckin racist but you don't hear left-wing people progressive people calling out that kind of racism because because of the way of many Asian cultures have sort of structured their society people don't complain as much and they work hard and they like fucking put their nose to the grindstone and they get going yeah and this is you know it's part of their culture and so when something like this happens there they have to break out of those norms in order to protest this really obvious racism and because they really haven't done that before they'd just been sort of silently working hard however just decided you know it's too many of you you fuckin smartypants Asian folk well a few people have Jordan Peterson has sam harris has you know there's a few recognized public minds i would you know that were intellectuals such a weird word right public intellectuals but those guys are definitely public intellectuals they they have these long-form discussions i don't you ever watch them on the internet they're doing these debates together fascinating man it's really fascinating especially they're just they're discussions about religion because Jordan is fairly religious but he's got a really interesting way of putting it he says he he acts as if God is real there's not that he believes in God but that he acts as if God is real and he finds great benefit to that which is very arguable right and that Harris is like not buying it at all and he's brilliant too so the two of together it's like wow this is this is a fascinating it's like really cool high-level conversation and you get to sit in on you know the thing I like about during Peterson I've noticed whenever I watch his interviews he he thinks like sometimes like if someone asks him a question you'll see him stop and think to really see you know where he's gone where it's like a dumb guy like me I just start talking and I'm like I'll eventually he knows exactly what he's saying you know especially in regards to like Marxist history and things that he gets very upset about you know he gets he's also he's having these conversations like literally on a daily basis going over a lot of these grievances and a lot of the material he talks about he's going over to a lot he's got that shit bolted down and he got in trouble too with the Human Rights Commission and not Kerry oh yeah he got in trouble because they were going to force people to use compelled pronouns and there was some weird language that he didn't like about the way that could enforce it or what they were asking people to do and then it got to the point where saying well we're talking about made-up words now like it gets to a certain point where people get look people are fucking self-indulgent we all know it we all know it and and but there's also the other side of it says well people also should be able to express themselves as freely as you guys get to do on stage why can't they do that with their name or their gender or you know whatever the fuck they want and why do you care if it's it's so simple to just say whatever the fuck they want you to say you know it's just a name right juror or all those there's except but Jordan was like there's 78 different ones now ya can't do this like this is this is chaos and necessary like I'm very Pro trans like I'm you can do whatever the fuck you want to do but it's the same as like on stage I can do whatever the fuck I want to do on state but that doesn't mean you have to come see me yeah and it's the same thing if you want to be called sir I don't even know what the fuck that is so I'm accidentally gonna call you her or him you know that can definitely happen you can't get upset at that no knows the fucker it's it and plus like like it if you get it wrong it's an accident right yeah you know what there's a difference between you being stage because this is like a choice with your life right you decided to be a comedian there's an argument there right and then the other side is well they didn't have a choice they there they feel compelled like they actually are of the other gender and they their brain is wired like the other gender and their body just isn't what they're supposed to have and it's fucking with their head got it okay I'm cool with that too you know like i don't it's fine like as long as you're not interfering with other people's lives because of your choices like if you're not you're not fucking with me i don't have to do anything i just call you she now okay yeah as long as I know yeah I'm comfortable I'm why would you bully someone on purpose you know it's gonna fuck with them his problem was that he didn't wanted to be compelled because then he'd get in trouble if you fuck up exactly exactly and this is this is what he's talking about he has no problem calling a male who transition to a female girl or she or her but he's like you can't use these you can't compel me to use these made-up words because at a certain point when these things get rolling they become contests and they become this battle it's an idea battle like which side are you on and they try to win it's one of the problems that I have with police officers and in even the court system that what happens when you get a prosecutor and a defense attorney is there's a contest going on and these guys they're involved in this contest multiple times a week with a bunch of different cases and they're moving things around all the time but they're constantly trying to win this is what they're trying to do when a cop pulls you over and he gets you for something he's trying to arrest you he's trying to win like we're playing a game now you know this is he's allowed to play this game and this is what he's supposed to do and you know he's got every right to do it so he's gonna search your home and he'll shoot your dog because you have weed and this is where all this stuff comes from it comes these this insane justification for these ridiculous acts comes from the fact you've been given a set of rules in order to participate in this game but the game you know when it comes to like things like compelled pronouns and if it comes to like pushing the envelope further and further and further at a certain point in time you can't say no you you can't make up a new language okay agreed okay you can't begin to build at length I can't I don't have to learn you know fuckin Mikey language in PD language and Tommy like so let's just agree on the words we we knows how many different new words do you have boil them down to one get back to me if you want to call it a trans person or a queer person you want to call Missouri is everybody agree zhe are zhe are oh that's a new thing yeah good I don't give a fuck but don't say I gotta go to I'll go to jail or you can bring me in front of a trial or some tribunal some fucking tribal council what are you gonna do you're gonna bang drums and decide if I've uh turd the wrong phrase but who are these guys to judge also because Mike didn't tell you but one of the judges on that tribunal who was saying oh we hear a piece of shit for making fun of a kid after that was found to have kiddie porn he was some kind of child molester he was judging that he was too shitty to a kid there were two people at the Human Rights Commission in Quebec there were one of them was the president that had to resign that he had paid off a thirteen-year-old girl like fifteen years ago to not tell anyone that he had had sex with her and another one I think he had had sex with uh it was a six year old like it was aa fucking crate but these motherfuckers that that's what I hated these these people were telling me okay you're you did a joke onstage and that's all and you're intent that's what people forget oftentimes yeah in my intent wasn't to hurt this little kid my intent was to make people laugh yeah but these guys their intent was to put their dick inside of a child that's fuckin and they judged him and they judged me he's fucking crazy well hypocrisy knows no bounds and and and I think you know anybody that's doing anything like that that's just a sickness that yeah incomprehensible these fucking guys man so they put you through some shit like you yeah went through this for a long time like my my lawyer went when I first met my lawyer I told him he was like look they want you to settle and he goes I could I could get it reduced get a reduce of like 20 grand and I was I told him I said if I do that I'm fucking everyone it's like any comic in Canada is gonna be fuck because I'm gonna set this weird precedent so I told him I was like I'd rather give you a hundred thousand of them five so then but he told me he was like we can't win the because I didn't go to court I went to the Human Rights Tribunal I was judged by the Human Rights Tribunal and the Human Rights Commission was bringing me there so is me versus them judged by them so he told me you're definitely gonna lose Suzu kangaroo court yeah but he said you see he said then we'll appeal and the government will probably accept the listen to the the case again and then he goes then you'll win that and but so I said yes I was like look I have to do this and I'm out I loved rocky and there was something weird about I was like this is like fucking Rocky - I'm gonna be the champ so but so then like I was something really weird happen to me though is I didn't I didn't think it'd affect me this much because when I was in court and I saw this kids family fucking crying and I was like holy fuck okay these people really took this shit seriously and I felt it was weird cuz my joke my intent was to make people laugh in this kid I'm fucking nothing against this kid like that I don't I don't I don't not like him I don't you know but then to see that they took this this seriously and then that how the media was portraying me like the the on in I did a series of shows in Edinburgh and there's a newspaper in Montreal the wrote Mike ward mike Ward is getting rich off of this little boy and I was doing shows in Edinburgh that no makes money there like I was playing like a 200-seat theater and I was like oh these fuckers are making me look like I'm becoming rich because of this little kid you became a target yeah and then clickbait that's how they get people to pay attention and I didn't think it'd affect me but the thing that I think the reason why it did affect affect me is if all you get is hate you can block hate out it's super easy to block a doubt and all error if all you get is love that's easy too but I was getting hate and love so so I'd be like you know I wouldn't let the hate in but then someone had show me love so I'd open up and then the hate had come in and it was just so fucking weird and I was googling myself too much so I'd be like no I fee I'd be like oh fuck okay there's an article about me in in Russia and then I google translate to see that I'm a piece of garbage so it was weird and then I just saw I I chose weren't fun anymore so I was doing shows and because people were like I'd get these weird hecklers and I was like I don't I didn't like comedy anymore and this the only thing I've ever done my whole life this the only thing I've ever loved like I don't have kids cuz of comedy cuz I was like I know I I'm not the type of person like like you're good at organizing your life if I had kids I'd like the the way live my life I'd be a horrible father so I never had kids because of that and then I was like fuck the only thing I liked I don't like anymore and now I don't have kids weird but that yes so I went through this how hard did it take to get out of the funk I took about a year and a half Wow and I told like I didn't have like I make a good living but I'm in Canadian comics so I make Canadian comic money like so so I had money I I had money to pay like it's cost me 150 so far in lawyer fees I'm so far it's Lauren yeah it's ongoing cuz now the appeal is uh the appeals gonna be cheap though it's gonna be like only a couple thousand but and I love that I had I had Bruce Hills from Just for Laughs that organized the benefit for me Bruce is the best fucking person he raised about 20 I had a GoFundMe to raise 30 so I paid a hundred grand and then I had 50 I had people helping me and that pretty much got rid of all my savings so I told my manager I didn't like doing shows anymore so I was like book me the minimum amount of shows that I can you know I can pay my bills cuz my like I've you know my wife doesn't work so I was he'd booked me like a week of shows and so three weeks out of the month I was going through this weird depression one week out of the month I was doing shows pretending like everything was okay and that took like maybe a year a year and a half of me going through this really really weird weird funk but the thing that was good eye I don't meditate but I'd spend my days in the bath like I'd just be like lying down in the bath just staring at the ceiling drinking wine like I was drinking wine in my bathtub all day like at least more hours a day Wow and then and I could feel like I like what you never know like when you're in a weird funk where the bottoms gonna be but once you start going back up then you know okay I'm getting out of this and then when I started feeling better like I was like okay I'm feeling better a little better a little better and then like six I've been out of it like six months ago I called my manager six months ago and I was like okay I'm back book this this this I gotta get you know you know I got to get some money again well has the new cycle in Canada gone away from it yeah definitely so that helps too yeah yeah definitely like people have found new things yeah this is a thing like people whenever people go after you you it affects you and you remember and then two weeks later people don't even remember mmm even people that I had this woman that she had written me on my facebook like this 60-year old woman that her facebook profile is her with a cat and you know you know the clouds and a sweet old lady and she'd written I'm happy your mom died because if she was still alive she'd she'd kill herself seeing what her son has become and I was like oh you fuck a bitch but I started like I go to her page I kept on going to her page now and like a about a month ago I did an interview and she shared it and she was like oh like like I was a good person again I was like this crazy bitch yes probably a medication doesn't remember ever saying that to you and what's even crazier is I keep going back to her page fuck she's on the fucking Roseanne type adderall she's probably whacked out of her head on something you know who knows what she's on and alcohol really helped like I know it's not good but alcohol really helped and so you recommend it recommend it if you're because it's a depressant but it's it's a number it's better to be sad and drunk than just sad interesting yeah and but I knew like and now I still drank but I drank like my way less way less I was drinking like I wasn't I was drinking maybe like four four or five maybe six twenty six ounces a week like I was drinking almost a full bottle of vodka every day that would be impressive but yesterday jake the snake' was on he's not an eighty mile drive with Andre the Giant like 48 beers yeah no I that's fucking crazy and he did forty eight beers so yeah no no I was a lot of wine though man yeah and the fact that you just sitting in the tub just that's uh and you're diabetic right I'm sorry Betty you're not supposed to be drinking why are you oh there aren't that many carbs in wine like not that much sugar but that's you know much but you're drinking it all day yeah yeah no but that's why I switched a vodka good mood yeah don't start thinking about my health yeah get it organic just make sure it's organic you'll be fine exactly yeah so um do they give you a time where you have to finish this thing like where it's gonna go by I just got those many years ago right what yester this uh this is a joke I wrote in 2009 and I did in a special that was from 2010 or I did a tour 2010 to 2012 so this is a super old joke and what's fucked up defending something that you wrote ten years ago like people were like what were you thinking when you wrote that joke and I'm like I don't know what the fuck I was like not even yeah and some one guy told me he was like you know you can't say things like that anymore nowadays and I was like I know like what that joke ten years ago ten years ago we used to do say shit there was way fucking meaner than that yeah there's some funny dark jokes ya know I always bring up his Brian Holtzman bit that he did right after dinner that Susan Smith lady that drowned her kids do you remember yeah some crazy shit they found this lady like drove her car into the river and just drowned her kids did it on purpose and it's like right after it happened Brian Holtzman goes on stage the comedy story goes ladies and gentlemen I heard those are bad kids they set that close to the TV they never put away the constantly spilling in milk those kids will not be missed and everybody's like oh shit it was so ridiculously mean and funny at the same time and people have to understand that that's you're in a nightclub people are drinking yeah you are a loud freedom of expression it is fun these aren't bad people Holtzman's not a bad person you're not a bad person you're bad people these are people that are doing a certain type of art form and here's what's weird this type of art form when you do we say mean shit that you don't really mean for whatever reason you can't do that because you're a guy on stage and it's too much like you're actually saying it but if you were saying it at a movie if you're playing it'll be fine be fine yeah you're playing a mean fucking villain characters saying awful shit in a movie everybody would be like yeah Samuel Jackson's a great guy he didn't really kill that guy over a cheeseburger like that I mean that was just his character did that he's a murderous monster right he's screaming Bible vengeance by believers and then fucking shooting this dude but nobody has a problem with that because it's Samuel Jackson's obviously an actor and Pulp Fiction was a movie we don't have any confusion here second Santa file yeah yeah in the movie oh yeah yeah yeah there's something that's fucked up about Canada though there's a makeup artist named Amy quit sir he's uh say that five times yeah that's like the GSP of makeup artists but he's yeah yeah he he does like horror makeup and he did this movie sort of like just a like a demo of what he can do it was a short film where he had this little kid and he murdered the kid he didn't actually murder the kid and uh the and then he put that out on the internet with you know his name at the end and the whole who played who and some fucking weirdo in Germany saw this and thought it was real called Interpol Interpol called the Montreal cops Montreal police went to remain cujo's house to arrest him for murder and then he said no but the kid they were like we saw the video and he goes yeah but the the kid see the Kin in the video he's my neighbors so they went to meet the the murder victim which was a little kid neighbor and they saw he was alive and they still they they took him they took him to court because they said what he did inside violence that's and and he and and hit everyone told him they were like you're gonna win for sure cuz this is just stupid but the thing is he had to defend himself he had to go to court and he had to and when you win a court case like that like if it costs you thirty fifty eighty thousand to defend yourself the government doesn't give you your money back and that's a stoop like my case I find it is kind of stupid but his case is fucking retarded because no one ever kills someone films it and then has third end credits ya know it's well if they did now they'll do it because yeah I said no one ever does yeah I would like to point you to a pot yes with Mike Warren clearly showed some fucking established he's like challenge accepted this is why Jordan Peterson was so adamant but that that bill was dangerous and that would be bad for everybody in bad for free speech when we look at it America I think we have a distorted perception because I don't think we totally understand your system of government when it comes to censorship because you guys don't have freedom of expression the way we do in America what's fucked up to about being Canadian is since all of our TV and all of our movies are American like the first thing I asked my lawyer I was like what about the what about the First Amendment he was like yeah we don't we don't have it I was like no I know we don't I know we're not America but we must have like the Canadian version of that and he was like no there's not like like people all over the world that talk shit about the states the states is the only place in the world that speech is protected by law yeah you can still get in trouble by saying shit you can still get protesters you see Michelle wolf Duncan the president today no no she dunked on Trump dude she's Donald Trump talk shit about her saying that she bombed so hard last year at the White House press Correspondents Dinner which unfortunately for him we've all seen the video and she didn't bomb yeah at all in fact she killed she had some funny shit and so he wrote today that she bombed so hard they're now gonna bring someone like they're not gonna do comedy anymore they're gonna bring in an author here it is yes so-called comedian Michelle warwolf I'm so badly asked here in the White House Correspondents Dinner that this year for the first time in decades it will have an author instead of a comedian good first step to comeback with dying evening and tradition exclamation point maybe I will go question mark she writes I bet you'd be on my side if I had killed a journalist hashtag best well guess she's got two hundred and ninety seven thousand seven hundred sixty nine likes sixty-four thousand one hundred sixty nine retweets one of which is mine little that she's hilarious she's she's a savage and he's that's silly what he did was silly you can't say someone but but he does I mean that's his new right just it doesn't have to be real but you shouldn't say someone bombed when we can watch the fact that it didn't bomb yeah you pull it up at any time you want oh she can say that though cuz since the the people that have seen it no she didn't bomb but the people that didn't see it now they think she don't think it matters I think in the mag of mindset okay if you had a mag of mindset it would be you don't need any reality other than reality they all decide upon and you press forward with fucking hashtags and American flags and red and white hats and you just keep moving you just keep moving and eventually what you're doing is you're like hacking the news cycle because the news cycle is just so everything lasts a day maybe two days four days say no he's a fuck about stormy Daniel stop talking about story it's over like that's what's going on I mean that's it's and they've kind of figured that out sort of an odd way like even him with a stormy Dana's thing you still talk about it it'll go away it's going away not only that like the fucking lawyer now he got charged with domestic violence the lawyer for stormy day yeah yeah yeah the guy who was gonna run for president now he got charged with domestic violence and check out a restraining order it's over baby so he like you just keep moving all they do is just keep moving just keep moving and eventually it good like this like yeah obviously she didn't bump he could say she did and even she'd dunk to him keep moving just given it to nothing ever sticks because he's caught a wave like this is the new cycle so crazy everything so crazy there's nothing stationary that we call can examine for long periods of time everything's just moving everything is just constantly moving this there's no stability it's him in the white house he knows there's no stability because he actually got to be the president yeah he figured shit like he treats everyone like a comic treats hecklers yes and he's and people that that say that he's stupid he's he's so smart like he figured yeah he figured all this shit figured out that all the protocol that was established in the fucking 1800s and early 1900s that doesn't mean anything anymore you know this is not Harry Truman yeah this is this is not George Washington this is 2018 there's porn everywhere ok oxycontin's are killing people and no one's talking about it cigarettes are killing people no politician ever brings up the fact half a million people die every year in this country just from cigarettes shut the fuck up keep moving and then you know he said he had that little Jeff Sessions a little munchkin working for him forever which is saying that good people don't smoke marijuana like the whole thing's chaos he knows it's chaos because he's the top guy you imagine being the top guy and something as insane as like the United States governmental system and seeing of the lobbyists and special interest groups and all the money and all the fucking cast in Saudi Arabia's cutting up journalists and you got to keep your mouth shut it's fucking madness and he's the top madman no wonder why he tweets shit like this he knows there's no rules so crazy it's a fall apart at any minute it's so fucking wacky I was watching today him pardoning a turkey I don't know why you guys still do this kind of crazy shit but he was probably tweeting about Jim Acosta being a fag and then turns around and goes this Turkey good turkey he came here illegally let him it's so stupid what did he do with that Turkey he just he just decided the turkey gets to live yeah what happens to those yeah for sure yeah you're we're gonna eat you for Christmas yes so the idea that that would be a thing is so fucking stupid we're gonna decide one turkey one turkey is a good Turkey yeah and it was like save it save it nope out with the axe psyche I was just kidding put his head on a log chunk people freaked out but you know I was gonna kill a turkey yeah why were you upset that I'm killing this Turkey yeah but it's all insane here yesterday he tweeted he said some I believe Saudi Arabia may have been behind that koshish eggie murder like did you just figure that out is he a detectives it took this long everybody knew well okay let's examine that you say everybody knew right yeah how much do you really know only what Turkey told us only what they everybody tells you yeah I'm not I'm not saying now that shit kidding conspiracy theories but anyone who says they know what happened like Jesus the only people that know what happened are the people that did it and then the people who think they know what happened to the people that are examining it and then the people that are reading third fourth fifth six hand about what happened we're just talking shit you know oh they killed him are you sure okay I'm sure this is what I'm sure I'm sure if you stare at the Sun it burns your eyes right I just tried it I have a lot of people have done it yeah I'm sure you know I'm sure that if you like dead trees up on fire they becomes a wild fire it's very dangerous I'm sure of that that's real who killed that guy I'm sure someone killed him they're all admitting they killed him pretty sure that pretty sure she said pretty sure I don't really know right because weren't they saying that they had the Turkish government had recordings mm-hmm but they didn't want to share them publicly cuz they didn't want the other embassies knowing how they record embassies because you're not supposed to exactly so that's what they said I'm supposed to but I think they probably all do it yeah yeah thanks definitely well apparently there's there's video and audio is what I read but I don't know if that's true fuck do I know but wouldn't you want to say oh they killed him they fuckin kill them said they there is an audio tape but he wasn't gonna hear it because he didn't want to hear it still he didn't need to yeah you know what man that brings me back to that movie Grizzly Man remember Grizzly Man they had audio the guy got eaten by a grizzly bear lived with grizzly bears forever everybody's like this guy's gonna get eaten and then one day gets eaten and along the way have you ever seen a documentary no it's a Warner Herzog movie it's one of the greatest unintentional comedies of all time it's really good okay what get lit and watch it you're gonna fucking love it it's a guy who is there's something wrong with them and right away like you you start making judgments like is he gay I think he's gay I think he's gay and he's fighting it and one of the ways he fights it he goes and lives in the forest I'm not bullshitting he didn't get the term bears no he's saving bears me somebody's so effeminate and he brings his fucking camera and he's walking through the forest he goes I wish it was just gay but I'm not gay if I was gay then I would just go meet a guy at a truck stop or something but I'm not gay so it's like what you're walking around by themselves in the woods surrounded by bears go well if I was just gay it would be so easy I do hear how you're saying it like the stereotypical gay voice is one of the weirdest things because there's like not a single masculine heterosexual male who uses that speech pattern like that speech pattern is exclusive to gay men yeah like I'm not gay whatever here we go like this is a speech pattern that we associate with homosexuals and you know you could say someone's prejudiced but you look you know it's true you know that's true you know you hear someone talking and saying homosexual type things in that voice you love it sounds like a gay guy have you ever had I had a friend come out of the closet to me and the whole time he was coming out I was like oh shit I'm gonna have to pretend like I'm surprised because he was like look I got it I was like yeah it's weird it's weird yeah well you know what's and what it's weird is any discussion of it is Dean homophobic some homophobic at all no problem with being gay but it is weird that some percentage whether it's 10% 20% whatever the number is of gay guys talk gay they're adorable you know they say gay fans they snap their fingers just in Martindale's good friend of mine gays fuck loves it swings you know he swings when he walks she sashays as he walks into a room he's hilarious too fucking funny stand-up comic but he's he you know he will take on those kind of vocal affectations you know negative there's a comic in Montreal he's a good friend named John Saint Godard he's a gay guy but gay audiences don't like him because he's a guy guy like he's from a small town in in Manitoba or whatever so gay people don't like him cuz he Muriel cuz he's he's a guy guy and then we were talking last summer and I was like you should do a show and call it no gays allowed because whenever he has gay people it always goes wrong cuz they get angry that's so weird he's a guy guy but he's gay and they get mad but here's what's funny if he was a guy guy but he was straight they'd probably want to turn him yeah he should pretend to be a straight guy that's like really easy to turn buddy of mine who was a makeup artist super good dude who's gay as fuck and he was only telling me about these he would do air tag straight guys that would suck give me details look great what is going on what's going on they like it they get a thrill out of turning guys but I don't think that turn any yeah I had a friend that used to when I first moved to Montreal we he'd be like let's go to a gay bar cuz a lot of women go there cuz they don't want to get hit on and then he was like we'll just pretend like we're gay and we'll try to have sex with the lady for the first time I mean he was really good at it because he was like super thin so he did look like a gay guy but I just looked like a fucking weird weird fucking chubby straight guy don't go no gay bar like gay guys built like you yeah but I'm always surprised when ever I see chubby gay guys right don't relieve I don't believe they're really gay cuz I'm like okay I'm a dude and I wouldn't fuck someone shaped like that mmm interesting yeah maybe yeah maybe I just have different genes they see it differently I don't know something about them is attracted to someone who has got a lot of natural resources stored and again you know what if it gets really cold out this guy's gonna stay alive he could keep me warm he'll protect me fucking me hang on to him yeah did you I don't know if you were doing any archery today but did you see that tribe this morning I saw a video we were talking about right before the podcast about the the guy in India who's trying to convert them apparently Jamie was saying and they shot him full of arrows with one of the last uncontacted tribes in the world but what a doofus would you think was going to happen right Jamie said the guy's been there before right do you say that so they knew him though the guy why don't the people that kill them knew him wouldn't they say this between fifty and a hundred people on this island I believe see if you can get a good article on it set the number so there's like 50 or 50 to 150 people they don't exactly know and they they came there just say from it's the size of Manhattan Sand Island and they came there from Africa like what is a sixty thousand years ago that's why I'd read it I don't remember exactly where I had the art and this is near India yeah yeah somewhere in India or near near India so Island um fucking dude was trying to bring him to Jesus and they said if you like the guy we'll introduce you to him they filled that motherfucker for Wow it's in the middle of nowhere oh that's fun that bitch is in the middle of nowhere so they came off of Africa that's crazy how the spreads like see all that shit that's crazy yeah you know what's interesting too in England they call people from India Asians they think of that as a teacher but we got weird with oriental at some point in time oriental became derogatory some weird way yeah oriental was normal you know rugs that was like yeah a thing you'd go to oriental rugs yeah that's like if someone was saying you know spic toothpaste hey yeah hey motherfucker you can't say that shit anymore but at one point in time oriental was like a total this is a real thing yeah it's part of the language but so now we say Asian cuz we try to be politically correct but Asia's fucking Giants there's a lot of different kinds of folks in Asia you know what with those like the the people that ended up on that island one dude they yeah they how the fuck do you you're running away from something to end up well everybody's that's you know if you read about the migration of people from Africa spreading out that's a big part of what they're doing is trying to get away from people that are trying to tell them yeah like it's all either they've run out of resources they're out of food or they're being they're being forced out of areas like new people come in people escape and survive and did our entire history as human beings it's like bigger more powerful human beings moving to an area and kill and rape and then spread spread out and then keep going and everybody else just keeps going and they eventually fortify in the distance and get a new city and they try to hold them off and the new people are coming through I mean there's so many instances from the Mongols to the Romans meaning go back and back and Matt all through history but if you broke it down if you looked at it like a math problem like what's happening here here's what's happening these groups people get together and then they develop some shit that kills other groups of people and then they push into those groups of people and try to fuck their checks steal their money fuck their checks eat their food and then they do the same thing then and then people go back and forth and and this is all people have done like there's never been a time where no one was at war like if you ever gone through human history there's no like well there was a period of a hundred years where there was no wars it's never happened yeah never and ever happened you're the best guy to ask about this isn't impressive how they built those arrows right the craftsmanship because they're proper Erebus they look like these live pictures of the arrows but apparently he digest of the arrows hitting him so the way I was thinking it was in order for an arrow to be done properly right and you could aim and then hit someone and kill him it has to go through the whole structure of the pelvis no it doesn't have to I mean it especially the kid hit him a bunch of times you know if they hit him a bunch of times they get a shot them in the gut even with shitty arrows well I don't think they have shitty arrows because they need them to survive right so the guy there's got to be island animals and they're hunting these animals but it's not that hard for these people and these kind of tribes to is if they have the proper wood on the island you know they they've been people have been making bows and arrows for a long time and they they'll use certain fibers from certain trees and they weave them together and make a bowstring and you know if they have enough good wood and they have good fiber and they have the knowledge I mean even if they don't have metal you could still to this day I found one in Nevada I found an old I don't know what era it's from but I found a an arrowhead but I was actually bow hunting I found an actual Arrowhead from some Native American tribe that they had left by and apparently they were like really common like people find them all the time because you think of the thousands of years that the indigenous people were here and all the different animals they shot with bows and arrows they figured out how to do it yeah so these people must know how to do it too and if they have enough good stone to make you know something Flint or something similar to make the arrowheads or maybe they're using something toxic maybe they have some sort of toxic plant and they're just dipping the tip of a sharpened tip into it if you dip the tip in something toxic don't can you eat that mean you can't apparently but but not the area near the other question it's a good question I don't know but a lot of these tribes that shoot things they shoot things with poison on the end of their arrows you know yeah well the idea is that they just they want to eat it right they don't if they don't hit it perfectly they're not gonna wait for the perfect shot they're just trying to hit it so they can hit it in the ass or in the neck or wherever the fuck they hit it if they have poison that thing's gonna die you know these poison for a lot of weird shit too they use poison to fish it's really strange they take this poison the fish yeah yeah it's crazy they take this plant and they smash it up and they make it's like this green plant things it was that the Yanomami of some more maybe Bolivia or something like that it's one of those tribal peoples that lives almost almost uncontacted but still some conflict that what they'll have like Under Armour t-shirts on and shit we got it's weird but they you know the barefoot and they take these plants and I forget what the kind of planet is but they smash this plant up and make like this green pulp and then they put this pulp in these ponds and these fish just float it's some sort of toxin and it just fucks these fish up and they just float up to the top and then they go and scoop the fish and take them out of there but it like paralyzes them it's not toxic to us I guess I don't know man I mean maybe a little but I guess you you have to be really fucking hungry to think okay I'm not killing enough or getting enough fruits or vegetables I'm gonna poison these things and I'd rather die being poisoned than starving to death well I think these people have been on the edge of survival if they've figured out survival down to like everything in their area they know what's edible they know what's dangerous what to avoid what to cultivate what to seek out they just you know they know how to do it so if these people are on our if it's a resource-rich island it seems to be like an island the middle of the ocean as long as they don't kill too much as long as they keep a certain healthy population of animals around cognizant to that is this these people it's the video I found on YouTube from 2008 or some fisherman or someone found them and gives you those different coconuts Wow so these people apparently if you if you follow the the story they came from Africa sixty something thousand years ago and I guess probably during the Ice Age the coastline was very different right the water levels were way lower and then when the ice all melted the oceans rose and then we get we got now so maybe it was a much larger island or maybe it was like the bering land mass where you could get across it fuck i know must speak a language that no one else eat not even close to anything else since it's been like so long fuck man here's it combined with language throw it here is combined with body language to seem to have a link hmm so they were like telling them to throw things and they're giving them coconuts that's pretty cool it's crazy how friendly they are without knowing who the person is and where they're from well I mean the dudes giving them free food so I think they're pumped yeah again a bunch of free coconuts that's definitely a way to come friends with people yeah that guy if that guy had coconuts instead of a Bible they probably threw Bibles like fuck they try to eat the Bible they're like motherfucker yeah look at that imagine some guy just showing up and giving you free food Wow can you see my dish is that what is but is this video some videos outrageous alright that's a real translation yeah yeah a really such as a wooden axe similar to a mountain ax yeah that's a fucking crazy-looking carried by all men so they yeah so they might not even have like metal but seems like if he's got a wooden axe I wonder what what they're using for arrowheads and stuff like that this kind of stuff fucking interests me Oh dudes fascinating man the thing is it's what's weird about it is you can't really go there like yeah you guys never read or watch that um that movie about the city of Z the lost city of Z is how it was called it was about an explorer from England who made way to South America and eventually getting eaten by cannibals allegedly they think but he was looking for this Lost Mayan or Aztec city was a Mayan city yeah so he was looking for some you know apparently and they've they know this for sure now there's some really really really ancient cities in the Amazon and they don't know what they are they don't know from when they don't know who built them so they know from who they it's a different culture well it's a culture that's long gone and it's the the area where they had the city has been absorbed by the jungle so they they find it I think either from satellites or from some kind of imagery where they're noticing these really obvious grid patterns that indicate irrigation and that they had fields and they had streets and so this there's this English explorer was the gentleman's name Harry Fawcett yeah it's the books not bad Percy Fawcett Percy Fawcett and so this this dude went to the jungles of Brazil multiple times looking for this lost city of gold okay 1867 yeah so he it was really it's a cool movie but not it's not the best movie but it's cool because it's like you get to see the lost city of Z he found it before he was killed no no he found something he found so I don't want to spoil or at the movie but it's um it's not a bad movie what's interesting to me is that these people you just got to put yourself in the mind of people that lived in 1860 and they they literally had no idea what the fuck was going on in South America they just but someone would come back and say author has a story of his journeys down the jungle river and the guy would stand up we met the uncontacted tribe and they would talk about I've brought back part pottery and this is a spearhead and and here's drawings of the the animals that I saw is get drawings of crocodiles and fucking a giant piranhas and shit there must have been guys that made that shit up though just like the difference between a guy that actually had like real pottery and just me getting my wife hey make a ball well you know that happened with the dinosaurs right the people had pretended to have seen dinosaurs like in Australia no no no when when they first discovered that the dinosaur was a thing some people started faking it and they would come up with fake dinosaurs to sort of like boost their science cred okay so like legitimate people or thought to be you know the credibility the accountability rather back then just was not what it is today like you don't I don't think the peer review process was the sound and these fucking people were maniacs out there just try to pretend that they found dinosaurs so they use like like a fucking buffalo horn or some shit right here I mean I was just digging randomly even now though even it like if you found bones from an elephant and and you like said hey I dug this out in Vermont people like people would be like that came well what is that thing that's like 9 feet long for a little while and then you know actual scientists will get a hold of it I go oh well this is an elephant bone you fucking idiot this is yeah dinosaur but if we were in 1746 yeah what year was it when they did that with the dinosaur thing I think that yeah there was some sort of like a battle like everybody's trying to discover the latest and the greatest they piece shit together it didn't belong it was so there's some weird wackiness but you know what's fascinating to me is that something has to die in like mud or it has to die and it has to be at the bottom of the ocean or a lake in silt something has to happen to preserve those bones because if it doesn't then you get nothing that's why we don't we don't know jack-shit about what like octopus look like with octopi looked like 5 million years ago 60 million years ago like like the Kraken like that could have easily been a real thing right a fucking super enormous octopus it could eat whales cuz there are some big fucking ones I've seen some videos yeah but they don't have there's no bones you know they just die in mud yeah I didn't die in something to become fossilized now yeah is weird it is when you're seeing that fossil do you know that that's not really the bone that is all the mineral that has replaced the bone over like thousands and millions of years or whatever it takes yeah but something's fossilized like if you see like a fossilized like shark tooth and it's black that's it's not the real color of the teeth it's the color of all the minerals that have replaced what the tooth used to be as it remains compressed and all this sludge and mud and shit over millions of years it's pretty freaky shit it's like when you see these dinosaur bones like their fossilized a lot of them like a lot of the bones that we find of dead things they've become like a piece of rock so it could look completely different because I've heard people say that most dinosaurs that we look at now that we think about how they look they really had feathers was a now thing I just assume that the sound of Jurassic Park is correct probably isn't what the fuck they sounds like they might not have made anything else here the great dinosaur fossil hoax oh the new one China has enjoyed an unprecedented gold rush of feathered dinosaur fossils but how many are real yeah there have been some feathered fossils if you go to there's a museum in Montana in Bozeman in the museum is some sort of Science Museum and they have one of those raptors a Velociraptor with feathers like a model of it like a life-size Velociraptor like I got freaky demon that my see first thing you ever want to see before you die I'm not I'm afraid of birds so imagine how fuckin big bird like that I'd lose my phone here it is here's the bone Wars the great dinosaur rush a period of intense and ruthlessly competitive fossil hunting and discovery during the Gilded Age of American history marked by the heated rivalry between edwin drinker cope drinker that's my middle name bro of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and Wow spell this guy's name's auth and you off Neil what do you say that is both Neil auth Neal Charles Marsh of the Peabody Museum of Natural History euro each of the two paleontologists use underhanded methods to outdo each other in the field resulting resorting to bribery theft and the destruction of bones each scientist also sought to ruin his rivals reputation and cut off its funding using attacks in scientific publications so this doesn't seem like these are the people that were using fake stuff I was on a Google a fake shit yeah this if this was happening they probably fix it yeah people are all crazy man those guys like doing that you can tell like at first that were real scientists and then they became famous they're like oh shit I like being famous imagine if I enjoy being a famous scientist and scholar but wasn't the Chinese when what do you get now from and also the Chinese don't I don't for making counterfeit stuff so I don't believe that article right they made Paris if you go to China to Paris I was in China I did a tour of China like two years ago and there's one of the guys booking me he told me his girlfriend loved France and there's a neighborhood in Shanghai that's exactly like France so he brought her to France and then she was like not that Chinese ones better well because it's it's it's the exact replica and they do that now in the era Dainese one is better so the arab emirates they redid the they redid I think the the Sorbonne and the Louvre like they redid buildings from France so you're in the Arab Emirates and your everything is exactly the same as it is in France that's so except it's all like Saudis and and people from Kuwait what's weird thing to do try to recreate a historical building that's still exist yeah yeah secretin something you I don't know why people copy I think it's because they like it's probably complicated too because they're like fuck we're gonna go to go to whatever country is there gonna be food it's a food gonna be halal is it gonna be complicated to go the mosque fuck it thanks to the mosque and will be good there's enough oil money floating around they can't build a whole world out in the desert yeah yeah they could visit New York City here we are New York's have fake Manhattan fake Brooklyn Bridge drivers there's such dicks like that building the biggest building in the world and Dubai when you go in in the elevator they turn the lights off and it becomes kind of like a ride and then it starts going up and then it shows okay we're at the level the the biggest building in New York City like the Empire State Building is here at like whatever the 300 meters and then this is the biggest building in Shanghai and then they so they want to just show look.we guts and it says in the elevator in the elevator Wow like they're like let you know bitch yeah I saw oil money since they did like the first time I was in Dubai the biggest building was I don't know how big but they built one in Dubai and then the year after Shanghai beat it by like three meters and then Dubai I was like fuck you we're gonna beat you by five hundred meters so it's like it's a kilometer or almost a like a like more than half a mile high it's crazy high more than half a mile high yeah that's sane and the city what you say it that way like yeah and the city in the 1970s didn't really exist yeah so I was like this is fucking insane like that their national anthem could be the eye of the tiger it's fucking like I was it's insane how big it got so quickly but they're all so fucking rich it's insane Jamie what we you know say they as you were saying that like it I don't know why I definitions island or just a theme park in Ohio and Cincinnati area there's a Eiffel Tower there there's also one somewhere else at another Park oh really but it's an exact replica one-third replicas oh I feel tower that's nice to take the seven but all those rich Arab countries would be like instead of one-third this is big seven times vague made of diamonds you can see you can see this Eiffel Tower from the moon gucchi everything yeah it's weird people do that but you know when you had that kind of money man you like make me up France what else am I gonna do I want the countryside the whole thing man yes you're like make it like now you're podcasts we've gotten so big in three years I want to hear Joe Rogan belt Rome he's got a fake rub no oh that's why I fortified compound somewhere don't dump top mmm start selling freeze-dried food preparing everybody you know water purification tablets get ready solar panels dishes did you is your house okay yeah we're gonna lucky okay we got lucky they did someone said Google this that Malibu lost 600 houses what yeah someone said that the other day but everyone's hysterical it's hard to know if they're right or not how many houses got lost at Malibu because I know a lot of people that have lost houses I know at least [Music] eight people that have lost houses and how is the evacuation cuz was it like Airy like you you can just grab like one one or two things I grabbed my laptop 1,500 structures 15 totally destroyed Jesus Christ so the the number probably keeps going up but those are a lot of them our homes you know out of those 1,500 oh no how many of them our homes but a lot of them are a lot of people lost their homes it's a it's a crazy thing that happens the wind gets behind that fire and everything's dry and it just goes straight to the water and there's almost nothing they can do they lost so many houses on Point Dume what you would think how the fuck is a fire gonna get to that like if you ever see what Point Dume is it's like this beautiful area of like very wealthy people live in this this like cliff overlooking the ocean I'm it's spectacular and like you would never think that a wildfire would get there but it was raining fire man that's Point Dume out there so so many of those houses got cooked man and there's videos that people made of them leaving there rific yeah there's like fire raining from the sky every way you look houses on fire and this is a super exclusive really rich area and no one could protect it there was nothing they could do the firefighters did their best they saved as many structures as they can but it was fucking raging man it was a rocks throw from my house when we left we left at two o'clock in the morning how was day night the traffic because the traffic is always crazy so when you evacuate in the traffic's like that must you must freak out well most areas would happen to the people in Paradise California they were evacuating and something like sixty plus people died in their cars yeah the fire just overcame cars and there's nowhere to go and they're stuck in gridlock and the fire is literally coming at them ready for this eighty football fields a minute that's how fast it was traveling at some at one point happen Athens over the summer yeah yeah there's a town right outside of Athens Greece yet wildfires took over the town was wiped off in a couple of minutes people died in their cars and homes you couldn't get up they were just traffic that's what happens in paradise I think a lot of they've more than a thousand people are missing comparators yeah they don't even know and the problem is they'll never know like they whatever was there is incinerated there's nothing left like they won't be able to get DNA they it's over I mean it's the craziest fire they've ever experienced I think it's the scariest most destructive California wildfire ever and that one the one down here was nothing compared that one in Northern California in comparison the size and scope I mean that thing is fucking insane there's fire there's a photo of this one firefighter it's sort of iconic photo he's standing on like a rock and behind him the whole mountain is on fire it's just like holy shit and people in my friend Brendan Schaub was doing a show in Sacramento in Sacramento out his hotel room the whole street was filled with smoke you could see shit he's like dude smoke is everywhere and he sent me a photo of the television that was showing the air quality it was like very poor air quality everywhere all through that area is just all in red so it was all like people were walking around with masks on it would literally be like you're walking through a fire there's smoke everywhere nuts man and this is in Sacramento yeah yeah is it contained no sort of contained I mean the one here is but I don't know about the one that's up north but the real issue is that can happen again like that like they all they're all they sparked up so quick and more hit what's the plan that they could do to make sure this doesn't happen something they can do I don't know I don't know what they can do what is that Jamie the air quality in San Francisco was so bad being there for a day's like smoking 10 cigarettes fuck look at that picture yeah that's all fire smoke where people like wearing masks I guess people are wearing masks they're like yeah yeah Bert Kreischer was walking on the street with a mask on I texted whoa what the fuck are you doing that thing's like dude it is so bad it's so bad here he goes you you can't believe how smoky the air is and there's just all through San Francisco everybody's coughing and wearing masks and Sacramento looked even worse than that okay that's the kind of shit you never think about yeah yeah but that's the thing it could just hit you look at that that is San Francisco right now and if you don't know San Francisco you wouldn't know how shocking this is like you you can't see the hills can't see all those houses on the hills it's all just smoke from the fire and yes like for that shit to blow out it looks like San Francisco's super like just fine yeah yeah he is um that fire contained a couple a couple days ago so it was at 57% contained and I was just trying to Google more how about that only 57% contained it airs a little clearer today they're at moderate like severe whatever but see the thing is man but these fires all it needs is one gust of wind one new storm one new you know Santa Ana winds pick up some embers then whoosh this whole state is just dry as fuck yeah to 80% but 80% contains gonna rain tomorrow nice hopefully that does it's supposed to rain tonight isn't it yeah no it slides maybe so it's fucking like everyone moved out here like from out east like when you moved here you've been here for 20 yeah 20 years yeah you must have been scared the first couple years of earthquake but you never thought that hey I might have to leave my house cuz of fire dude I've been evacuated three times because of cause of fire yeah yeah how many how many major earthquakes since you've been here none one minor one it was enough to let you know like whoa like when it happens and the the the house seemed like a you ever get a refrigerator and you take out that cardboard box and you stand inside of it as a kid push it back and forth that's literally at the walls of my apartment looked like oh he just started moving like this like it was very different than I thought I thought it would be like shake like Rumble everything would shake no it was just like this like dum dum dum dum dum dum but it was so nothing it was a nothing earthquake it was like a 5.5 or some shit or 5.7 but it was enough to where when the walls moved you realize like whoa if a big one happens this shit just falls apart like this is man this thing ain't gonna make it how does it just fall apart the walls just break what floor were you on second floor that much that that must like if you're on the ground floor you go okay I can run out the shit can't but she ends in your hands you're trying to get it no but you know how fucking stupid humans are we go like nah I got this I can I can run out the second floor I think the opposite I think if I'm gonna top floor I'll surf my way to the bottom I'll land on all these fuckers dead he's not gonna make it yeah it was enough to just let me just realize like you don't even know what an earthquake is stupid like my idea of an earthquake was like like a cartoon movie like Oh weird an earthquake but a real earthquake is just the earth shifting it actually moves and apparently the people that were here during the big one of 1993 was at 93 something like that the earth moved almost like water like the you could see the earth just bucking and moving and you could see like chunks of it like lifting up and then settling down the people that were there when you talk to them it's like there's I mean it's not PTSD like soldiers PTSD or like rape survivors or anything but there's there's absolutely some PTSD that comes from natural disasters yes this trauma to seeing how fucking meager you are in comparison to the earth itself as the earth is moving like fuck I got to get out of here and then a mass exodus like a bunch of people move to Colorado and people moved all over the fucking place Corrado's nice thought here run it's gorgeous yeah I'm surprised that the now with the the wildfires are people leaving California or no I'm sure some are yeah the problem is the weather's so good it's so nice because it never rains it never does anything you just you'd be just a lazy bitch just do you never have to deal with Mother Nature like where you guys live yeah you're a Montreal right yeah that's no joke nice they're having a snowstorm right now yeah it's that cold do you guys get up there as ruthless I'm gonna be in Toronto in December okay cool I'm there for the UFC yeah I know it's gonna be cold as fuck yeah December it's gonna and plus this year's is generally the winner starts later than now and it's it's super cold you know what happened at global warming man global warming man that's the first thing like those fucking hardcore righties want to do yeah doesn't exist it's warming weird where's your global warming like okay that simple bitch it's burning the fucking houses in Malibu yeah that's what something is yeah and that was really funny as the chemtrail people they've been convinced this whole time that the government's trying to make it rain like if ever there was time to utilize chemtrails would it be now yeah you know fuck man the whole thing is uh it's very disconcerting because you realize how fragile the whole system is and these you know these people that work so hard to save everybody they can only save so much you know they can only save so many buildings you'll only save so many people it's a real wake-up call man shaky get ugly hey Joe this off topic off topic of the fires but because uh yesterday we're talking a red band at the store and I didn't know that when the whole Mencia thing happened you were band the whole crew for like seven years like a long time oh I talked about this too many times okay the only thing I wouldn't thought was cuz you took a bullet for like the seven years kinda like he took a bullet for everyone else who's gonna have to deal that shit but you didn't know at the time yeah sorta looking back I was just like fuck them yeah you could say it was taking a bullet but and think of it that way but um yeah it's the subjects beaten down too much you know we're going through it now that's why ice on our end now we have the the people who are making money by stealing jokes you have that going on in France it was not with a French comedy oh yeah yeah it's not in in Canada but it's in France and there there was a I own a club in Montreal I banned a guy this summer he's uh he had stolen a bunch of material he there's a thing called the Jamel comedy club that it's basically like how even when you say comedy club when you're saying something in French first you have to see comedy club yeah yeah yes sir okay because that's the way you say that this guy he had stolen pretty much everything from def Comedy Jam and they did it there in France and just didn't with French yeah and not even with black dudes like if you're gonna steal def Comedy Jam give it to French black dudes like there are black dudes and France but it was all these Arab guys so whenever you see like for ten years in France whenever you saw an Arab comic they were all like like Dave Chappelle so it was silly yeah there was something very fucked up and this summer that there was that the guy was in my club and then I found out and I fucking lost my mind I just I tweeted my door guy and I was like get him the fuck out everyone he's with you throw him out I don't want him in the club it's dangerous thing yeah with comedy yeah you're trying to create things and some a basically criminal can Niq in the middle of an artist colony and just start profiting off of your work yeah and intimidating you and making you work for them essentially there's something that sucks that people don't know and that's what you went through with what when you called out Carlos no one cares no one cares like they do now they do see the thing is about your situation up there is different but the only reason they do now because it looks good but the if if you didn't like like like banning Carlos now like Carlos Mencia can't work anymore that they it makes them look like we respect comedians but they don't really respect comedians I don't think who's they and well you sound like your conspiracy theory don't respect us man nobody what whenever whenever I've called out joke thieves to festivals or networks they're like okay yeah yeah we're gonna we're gonna do something about this and then as soon as it blows over they don't do anything about it yeah well you're talking about festivals right you know I think clubs would be much more likely to ban people especially if someone who they're stealing from also works there that's that's more likely to happen especially if the you know when in best case scenario the person who's getting stolen from is already established and successful so they could say something about it the worst case scenario someone who's established steals from open mike earth which fucking does happen and you know if there's anything that could get someone to quit comedy that might be one of them well you know there might be one that might be especially in the beginning having like only good jokes stolen by a person who does it on television and then you have to watch it on Comedy Central a couple days later you're like what and you remember that that guy had been in the back of the room a couple weeks ago and watched your act and yet you're like what like you can't even believe it there's a comic and France named Goodell male who's he's in New York now and he's he works a lot in English he did he has these rumors and I'm gonna say allegedly because I don't want to he I know that he's taken a couple at first he took a couple bits from American comics then he got caught so he started stealing from out french-canadian comics and the last thing I heard he did was he had this contest for open mic errs and he was like my next comedy tour send me your three best minutes on tape and the best comic I'm gonna book to open for me and then he started stealing from those open my kurz which is a that's such a garbage move it's a wacky that's a yeah well a good person yeah I don't like that's what I heard I'm not sure it's true but I saw him do his show once in in France and he was a like he's a rich dude he's got his own private plane and yeah he's got his own private plane he was he was married to the Princess of Monaco so he's got a lot of money and he was he doing he was doing a bit about like he's just so calm he was doing a bit about how he can't afford Erica an air conditioner in his apartment and I was like motherfucker you have a kid with the Princess of Monaco I can afford like multiple air conditioners fuck you well you know it's not good you think that the people care like yeah people do care some people care here's the thing the problem is saying they don't get it sounds like and all white people are racist yeah it's it's you can't say it yeah like I know the whole thing in France a lot the new generation of French French comics are really angry about this and there's a guy there's this YouTube channel that you talked about here when you had I think it was a Tom papa that was on it's called coffee comic and they take like bits that they'll take a bit from a comic from here and then they just to show that what's going on with someone's friends yeah just to educate the people yes yeah I've talked to quite a few comics from countries that are bilingual they'd say this you know that is Montreal was very bilingual yeah in fact almost everybody speaks French right yeah yeah and also everybody speaks English yeah yeah it's like probably one of the most bilingual places and definitely in Canada but there's nothing like that in America there's no place like that North American oh yeah even thinking North American terms United States like there's no place it's kind of universally speaks Spanish and English yeah you know it's like some people speak English some people speak Spanish but very few people I mean you can't this the numbers it's never up like Montreal like probably probably 80% speak both languages right yeah that's crazy yeah it's a beautiful city man it's amazing but your fucking freedom of speech laws are dog shit yes fuck they don't exist well that's you're gonna create shitty art when you have that you know the way that you punish someone who you think is doing something awful with their speech as long as they're not calling for someone to be murdered or something right the way you do it is you don't go to their show you say I don't want to support you and then that's it you don't find them if enough people don't like you and you have a message of hate and won't come out you won't make money you're gonna stop doing it that no that's how you kill that I definitely don't think you should have a message of hate yeah but I don't think that certain people should be able to decide what's hateful yeah because they keep pushing that boundary the same way they push all the other boundaries they push the boundaries of what what what is what's the definition of prejudice what's the definition of entitlement what's the definitional you are you always coming from a place of privilege so are you always entitled are you always racist do you mean you know like they they have those they have they do this with corporations and there's no evidence that it works at all they do unconscious bias like counseling whether they sit down with their employees and they talked to them about perhaps this unconscious racism they might have and so that everybody's like fuck of my raises and they go huh that's so shitty so crazy yeah but what's crazy about it is that all it is is like they needed a response to a perceived situation which I'm sure as a situation in many many places don't I'm not trying to minimize that but they needed a response so their response to something totally unscientific not bored but at least they can say they're doing something they have you know racism bias training and they have these people sit down and they talk to you about like this is what you do you know if a person of color walks in this is like you know everybody's like shit I don't want to be racist but I don't think it works man and I don't think it's a it's not the weight the racism sucks and the way to stop racism is be a good person yeah like the more good people we have they'll inspire more good people we will all realize that racism is fucking stupid and we should treat people as individuals always whether it's by gender and sexual preferences origin of your your ancestors I don't care I mean I care in terms of like sexual preference I care in terms of like whether I think you're attractive or not I care in terms of like whether I decide you know the - you know there's some people that want to hang out with really loud people there's some people that want to hang out with people that are like more demure or some people that are more introspective everybody likes different shit you're allowed to like different shit but you're not allowed to discriminate against someone and keep them from occupation or keep them from please to live and if we all thought that way and just treated people on the merits of their own individual personality and character we'd have a way better world I think we could all agree to that as soon as you get in these groups of all white people or all Asians are all like fucking come on man that's too small that's such a gross generalization it's too small of a common denominator it's too weird the what what you are like how much of what you are is where the fuck you're from and shit you can't control it how much melanin you have in your skin that's ridiculous what you are is all the things you've experienced and all the life you've lived and all the lessons you've learned where you are at this moment you know and if I like you at thirty I might not have liked you when you're 18 you might have been fucking annoying yeah but I mean you want in your 30 and I'm like hey you're cool you know and everything's great yeah and that should be okay too it's like we have to distinguish between people just being not interested in talking to any one individual and what is wrong with with gross generalizations and then tribal ideas are like sticking to only people of European ethnicity and these are the good folks of European descent like you're fucking crazy civilizations been down that road stupid you can't do that shit again you can't do it for Asians either you can't do it for black people you can't do it for anything you can't say everybody's great in this group because it's nonsense it's so simplistic it's not just simplistic it's dangerous and it also makes people scared to say anything about it I don't want you thinking that I hate the thing I like like the thing I like about not censoring hate speech is if you let hateful people say their hateful things you know where the dangerous people are yeah so if you're censoring like you can't use this or you can't say this you can't say that you don't know who the fucking weirdos are that hate black people they hate gay people that hate the trans the because everyone's acting exactly the same like everything's cool and then when they're with their friends or whoever the people that they think like them then they're spewing all their fucking hate and shit and garbage but whenever people can't express themselves freely there's going to be some sort of suppression and if there's some sort of suppression there's a resentment that's oppression and then there's just like this anxiety and this tension you know it's like when but it's essentially what we're saying is when you think about people in business meetings how they're forced to communicate how there's forced to dress how they're forced to communicate they go into this very professional building all the women are dressed professional all the men are dressed professional they all get together in these conference tables and everyone is agreeing even though these are sexual beings who may be like cocaine you know and they've been a fucking you know this they've been to music festivals and they've maybe been to Burning Man and but they're contained that contained in this room and they're talking about statistics they talking about probabilities and then someone brings up diversity yes diversity all very important and everyone is behaving and this super weird world where you can't you can't move outside the box even remotely it if you move outside the box even a little if you say you know about the guy from Netflix I got fired because he used the n-word in a descriptive he was he was talking about Tom Segura special where Tom Segura was talked about changes in language I was talking about some words you can't say anymore he says like you can't say retarded he says this just because he said that just because he said that people were getting angry at him and protesting and groups were trying to boycott Netflix I remember you right so this guy I don't remember his name but he was one of the bigwigs at Netflix and he said he was like it's like saying the word nigger to an african-american person that's what it's like to say retarded to a family where someone has someone who's down since so he was defending he was talking about how offensive that word is to people so I was like this is the issue that we're dealing with so you just talked about it in a very matter-of-fact way they report him for saying the word and he gets fired and apparently he did this twice that's what I've read in the same context yes the same exact contract so he's repeating this thought it's he's basically having we're doing an intellectual exercise like is this is it the same to you and he's saying it around african-american people but in saying it around african-american people just the fact that he said the word uttered it like abracadabra just saying it was enough for him to lose his very high-profile job at Netflix was apparently well-liked and it really do you think do you think we're becoming like this because our lives are too easy that like if we had to struggle to get food and and protect our families we wouldn't be worried about this word or that word or my feelings 100% yeah I think we're we're seeking out altercations when we cuz I think we're programmed for a certain amount of interaction with people that's unpleasant we're certain we were programmed for a certain amount of competition whether it's verbal or physical we're programmed for it I think it's what got us to 2018 in terms of the crazy history of the human species is it marched across the world just imagine leave in Africa I mean fucking what do you got animal skins on your feet and you walking out like what who are the fuck were those people and what kind of people did they encounter that's our ancestors yeah you know our ancestors have just been dealing with bullshit forever and when there's no bullshit there's some bullshit over there there's 78 different gender pronouns motherfucker and the reason why you don't think so is cuz you're a cisgendered white privilege piece of shit and all white people are racist and then you start tweeting up a storm does if you go to those people's pages one of the things that I've I'll find a person who says like preposterous shit and if I'm not blocked by them from some gigantic auto blocker which sometimes they do these block everybody but if someone I'm not blocked by them I will bookmark them so instead of like following them so they know I'm found I would just bookmark them so I'll just go back so I have a file my computer called crazy motherfuckers and I will go to this crazy motherfuckers page and I'll see them go through these manic depressive States and freak out about the world and then every now and then something will get tossed in there about relationships you know I mean yeah because I know I know it is it is harder for someone of color like a black or Arab or you know Asian Brown some people around some people yeah but saying white privilege like there are a lot of white homeless men and whenever I see a white homeless dude I always want to give money and go wipe white privilege dude there's no doubt there's an advantage in this current climate and world to being white the problem is the white people are not guilty of doing anything just because they're privileged so instead of calling it white privilege but we need to concentrate on is the people that are racist that's the only real problem yeah only problem is racist people and even though why people get discriminated against less the problem was saying things like black people can't be racist because racism is a power thing and white people are power people that's it's a it's a fucking intellectual forest they know it is when they're saying it and it's just one thing they just repeat and you're supposed to accept it and it's a part of what we were talking about earlier where there's a game that's going on and the game is I want you to say the 78 different gender pronouns I want you to say that I want you to do that I want you to refer to me as that I want you to refer to me as this I want you to do what I want you to do it once you stop using certain language I want you to start saying certain things because that means I win yeah that's counterproductive because you're not teaching anyone how stupid it is to just discriminate based on race all you're doing is blocking out that being honest I think that it doesn't even work anyway I think what really works is leading by example I think that's the only thing that works what I think we learn from as we learn from people better than us you see someone who's amazing and she's super smart and she's really kind to people her god damn it I gotta be more like her yeah I think that's where we're missing that aspect of it that the chastising see this is the problem with what goes on with the left in particular the brutal mean assaults on people these Twitter gangs and Facebook gangs they target someone and attack them you are not changing anything and in fact you are going to get people who see this horrible shit and they're gonna go fuck those people I'm going that way and they go the other way and you recruit people to be on the right and this is literally how Donald Trump became president one of the one of the major factors as people were noticing a trend and the trend was towards these crybaby preposterous liberals that call it everything is racist everything is sexist everything is homophobic everything and everything falls into this blanket of transgression where there's no innocent and everyone's guilty and then when they find they run out of targets they go after each other for not being aggressive enough they start calling each other out then find jealousy in the movement that's something that really makes me happy that when I see people that have been calling people out for years and then they get called that I'm like fucking finally well you know I've seen it happen you know I've seen it I've seen it happen with with people I've seen I've seen them become like Jaime kill Steen is a friend of mine and Jaime kill Steen was at one point in his life this really progressive activist guy who is like everything he said had to be like super male feminists and super trans positive and I mean he was like trying so hard to be exciting but but he's super honest about it too he's done a podcast about it and you know he'd call people out really mean and really vicious and then he realized he's getting all this anxiety from any check his Twitter all day he like to be walking the street just couldn't stop like checking his Twitter see with her replies where he was really he was caught in this weird fucking hate spiral you know even though he was purporting like he was acting on the premise that he was a good person he was gonna call out all these bad people but he was like addicted to this weirdness and then it turned on him it turned on him like some girls accused him of being creepy and it was a really super minor like trying to go on dates with people I think just but that was enough that all you need is like one in that world every in that world everyone is so hyper progressive and looking for any sort of deviation from the pattern they can attack yeah and they just decided that this guy even though it he had been like this model Ally for for male you know as a male feminist and for people of of color and we stood for everything that they wanted but he's a piece of garbage because he's heterosexual yeah you know and you know apparently he lik work with this girl or something like that but what it whatever it was I mean it was the most minor of transgressions it was a rape no touching none no meanness no it's like and so after all this is done he came out of the other end and then he just came clean about like how he felt while I was doing it why I did it was a great very brave that he did that but it gives you insight to a lot of like what is one of the problems of this unnavigable media is that it's very compelling to engage constantly and consistently with people in this this really anxiety-ridden wave of animosity that's gonna run back and forth between the two of you for no reason that's the time for almost no reason was free the nipple a big thing here there was more in New York in New York like a lot of gals were they decided they were gonna protest that men could be topless but they can't be a topless and they passed that right I I had a friend that she was telling me and we had this conversation and she was like no but like a female female breasts aren't sexual so I should be allowed to show him and I was like look you know that I know that my penis doesn't know that I'm sorry if I see tits my dick is gonna get hard I'm sorry it's not like I'm Irish - but if if you fucking pull your tits out my dick is gonna get hard yes we only get the work we do we do for you we're animals but you know it's also that we're just not used to seeing tits yeah if tits were out all the time they would eventually get used to it the problem is changing gear look at those people in the fucking done island dad dev weird tits they need nice West Coast to West Coast yeah I don't know man I I think they should be able to do it though they want to walk around topless but the problem is there's too many dickheads you're running into a river of dickheads you're gonna try it go upstream through that with your tits hanging out that's fucking true go to a bar if you want to go to a bar topless like look that is chaos yeah yeah let's go to the rails yeah you definitely should be able to do it but I don't think you should yeah if you are my friend like I say if in an ideal world she should be able to yes yeah you should definitely be able to but do I think you should do it no no don't do that people gonna try to suck them the interim it's like it's if someone's gonna touch your tits it's it's so rare you have to be in like the perfect bar in Asheville North Carolina you can be there from 10:00 to 2:00 and nobody'll touch your tits like one place someone's gonna touch your tits people are gross like even even when girls ariana grande sang at Aretha Franklin's funeral even that preacher tried to touch her - yeah it wasn't a camera he was gonna grip yeah so imagine if she had freed the nipple fuckin crazy I would have gotten he woulda got her pregnant yeah but there's there's no argument and saying they shouldn't do that like right it shouldn't be a law yeah this is almost like I mean you can make parallels to compelled speech cuz I don't think that you should be naked and just walk down the street if you're a girl but you should be allowed yeah I don't think you should if you're my friend because I would say listen you're gonna get harassed it's it's is way more likely that you'll get raped yeah I would think I mean I'd like to know what the student want to do a study but I would like to know what the statistic I mean I would not like just that we make make these people get raped like just walk around try four of our subjects got raped yeah you don't why don't want to do that study but I think if you live in a tribe like that uncontacted tribe outside of India they probably super accustomed to seeing people naked and it's they probably act normal it's probably not that big a deal we're weird you know it's like what's in the box man what's in the box and we would cover everything up but that size are all covered up or feet are covered up member remember when we were young like I'd see just a Sears catalog a woman in a bra and I might jerk off and now yeah like it desensitizes you start watching porn then you're like oh fuck if someone yeah mascara running it's not gagging there isn't at least one murder in this how can I get hard yeah watch an action movie nobody dies in a bitch ass movie is this but we are weirdos and everybody has their own weird quirk you know and I think a lot of times we don't admit it or we Ori then you see someone who's an extreme and you're like oh fuck at least I'm out that like we have an intern for our podcast and he's heart of gold right but he has a crippling addiction of prostitutes and he's just a weird guy like when you meet him he's just a fucking over-the-top weird I was crippling because he can't afford it he's a weird but he's just a bad judge of character yeah so he picks all hookers that'll steal money from here he got robbed the other day we've been here for two days he was robbed in pepper spray bro on this motherfucker you get that party rolling yeah that's what you do you blur out faces and watch what's his name Poseidon Poseidon gets his ass kicked the documentary gonna be your version of the naked woman walking around trying to knock it right yeah and the way he told the story like he was like he talked to this woman and we were like but that's not a real picture you're in the shit you're gonna get she's gonna steal she's gonna steal all your shit he was like no no I she's real I think she's real we're like she's not real and then she came over to the house when we were doing a spot at the at the store and now she she told them it's 300 he gave her 300 then he tried to touch her and she was like no no it's 300 just to me we need more money and then they went out to like an ATM he got more money gave her the money she brought the she went back to the the apartment and then he pulled the dick and she was like now what we're not having sex I said and then he was like what and then she she ran away and pepper sprayed her like she ran and he was still naked so he said I tried to chase her but she was fast even the heels and there's two flights of stairs and he slipped on the last ones cuz he has his boxer short and as soon as he stood up from the slip she sprayed him in the face she ran out he ran three floors up to get dressed and then he went out looking for her but he's not gonna find her and he shows up at the store belligerent and was he naked when she pepper sprayed him yeah yeah well from what he told us his boxers were stuck on his foot when he told us a story we were like I get I get why she pepper sprayed you because you're like he's a like he's a big dude and Poseidon is like fucking like three hundred pounds six five and she's chasing her she's got a guy that's like 350 pounds with the rock-hard dick going so he definitely said that and we were worried because the the Airbnb the the owner lives right behind and she's very nosy she's a nosy bitch she keeps looking at what we're doing so what the fuck she's hearing this and she said be quiet no glitter in the house like weird rules later and I think we broke every environmental person yeah saying he shouldn't use glitter anymore it gets to the fish oh is that why she said motion cuz we didn't know why it was I was like what no glitter I said like who asked that like why I was like you watch you let her off glitter goes into the drain but glitter eventually gets into the water why would like I told her we're gonna be three dudes renting the apartment why would we bring winter or maybe this this is LA no man you were going on before about you not it's impossible for you to be a gay guy you definitely could if you would like a gay burlesque but even if I was a gay guy like I wouldn't I wouldn't be a gay glitter guy I don't think would bro you think yeah man high heels you nuts glitter you'd go hard yeah you'd have like some old-timey clothes on too like a Charlie Chaplin gay guy you look like shock Holmes yeah man old-timey Charles Charlie Chaplin gay stuff you know how hard it must have been in those days to be gay like coming out of the closet now it's still hard in small towns but it's already even in big cities man depends on you depends on your parents you know yeah but man Charlie Chaplin days imagine fuck but there's probably a lot of game chant going on like I don't think there's any difference in the number I bet the numbers probably sound like this it's exactly the same I'm sure yeah cuz even now people are saying now they're more they're more trans in the world there but there are more that are getting operations but in the old days it was the same thing I'm sure mmm yeah I bet the numbers consistent probably the percentage it's probably more numbers now because it's more people you know there were probably a bunch of gay dudes from the 50s there were actually trans women but just because that you couldn't get mmm you know you couldn't change anything so you just suck dick you know in private or whatever this is science yeah so you guys are on compound media it's called its contra to drink minimum we do shows do you have two drinks in every show what more than this yeah you always have to drink minimum yeah and and we do I've done a one drink show no but we do we do one shots which are we do free episodes like just on iTunes once a week there 30 minutes show and then on Fridays we do the two-hour show on compound media and it's just awesome how meteors which is an anthony KU mia's yeah thing and anthony he's so fucking funny he's a genius yeah he most people know him from Wildman - so close bein Anthony if you're wasn't open Anthony it wasn't for open anthony podcast wouldn't exist like the format podcasting yeah every like and now they're really good podcast but the first couple years of podcast like the two thousand six seven whatever most podcasts sounded like shitty versions of Opie and Anthony and now like like there was ones that we're trying to do like an hour-long interview style podcast it was more like you know some NPR type da or something like that and then we started doing them where there would be like a lot of comics just hanging around hanging out and when we started doing those which was like 2009 ish that was clearly influenced by Opie and Anthony and also influenced even more so by Anthony ku Mia's internet show that he's doing this compound show yeah yeah because I watched that and this is one of the big things that hit me because I realized I could do it because he just set it up in his basement I mean he had some money and he decided to make a green screen and he got these like professional cameras and I thought about it while I was watching the most like why don't I do that I'm like why am I not doing that like he's got this whole setup in his basement and then there was just one time where he was drunk doing karaoke with a machine gun so he's got a machine gun a sink and he's doing karaoke and and I remember thinking like this crazy motherfucker I need to I need to do a show now I need to cuz like you know I'm saying this would be a lot of fun and I always enjoyed doing radio shows when I did them I mean I would do them like I would do Opie and Anthony even if I didn't have like tickets to sell like even if it was all sold out yeah I would still show up and go hang out with those guys because felt like a comics table like it was exactly hanging out just freaking balls hey like this yeah I mean like we're doing right now and that's that's how it happen you know I'm doing it with those guys and watching Anthony do it on his own and becoming friends with Jimmy you know and then seeing how it's fun to just hang out with comics and you did you did Anthony show a couple weeks yeah couple weeks ago but it has an area I don't think I'm holding on to it to next week when he's he's actually gonna be here his new sidekick Dave Landau is fuckin insanely funny yeah he was really really really funny easy comic yeah he's a comic from Detroit who now lives in in New York and I didn't know him and like every all of the Opie and Anthony fans were like fuck oh why doesn't he have Jimmy why doesn't he have Jimmy why doesn't he have why doesn't why doesn't own ain't get back together but Dave Landau and Grantha nee you go okay this works this is a really good show yeah he's super nice guy to first mark dude and their setup is great you know the green behind him just turns it into whatever the fuck he wants it to be and he's got a little stadium seating so yeah all the weird of something fun though about when his show like the first couple of times I did his show when it was in the basement of his house there's something I like about doing those shows when you're you're you go into someone's house like I did steven crowder show like a month ago and there was something cool about going in the suburbs of Dallas in his garage to do his she's supposed to say where he lives man the guy's hiding no but yeah but jealous bitch I'm sorry steven crowder dies is my father was getting blamed yeah yeah no I know yeah yeah that's true but remember he did that thing that Bob Ross paints Mohammed yeah yeah - but that took balls yeah you know I mean it's literally something that they're allowed to kill you if you do and he did that allowed yeah I mean it's strange time I mean this is also a time where that criticizing that criticizing anything that's Islamic is very dangerous because people call you Islamophobic and because people want to kill you we got two different things going on at the same time but those same people will have no problem mocking Christians I know yeah yeah I'm not even like I'm not a right-wing guy I consider myself a little more to the left but there's something I like about right-wing media especially like the funny type of right-wing media that they take fucking crazy risks you mean like ooh Mia like ooh Mia like Crowder like Steven Crowder's really funny text like Gavin McInnes I think is fucking hilarious Gavin's in the crossfire right now he's the Eye of Sauron is upon him he's said too much tupid shit about like inciting violence and now that there's some article saying that the FBI considers him that the proud boys are hain't group but then qu Mia sent me something that he sent him and I'll sent it to you he's saying it's bullshit the first time I heard about the proud boys I was doing Gavin show New York I know he was with Dante narrow which is a black comic in New York and he was like hey uh me and him are in the proud boys and I was like boy let's explain what it what it actually is there's a joke at first it was like we don't jerk off so that we'll want to fuck our wives and then like four months later I was like oh yeah I'm against quit the proud boys today well you know oh is it today I thought he'd quit that years ago though this just got posted I think maybe Jamie I'm sending you an article to where he's realizing at how dramatic it is yeah he connected with these people and you know look it's one of those fucking things you want to have a group you can't control everyone in the group so yeah a buddy in the group that does something horrible I just sent you something pull this up this is Gavin's response to all this cuz so many people got mad at me that I had Gavin on in the first place first of all I had Gavin on because he used to be one of the founders advice also because I had Gavin on before that and he was fun to hang out with then when I had him on did he become with when I had him on the last time one of the things that he was talking about was the proud boys I don't even know what the fuck that was I think maybe I had heard of it but I thought it was a joke turned out he used to be a joke it started off as a joke on compound media and Anthony will get into it better he knows the history of it but they were making fun of something and they decided to make a fake mock group crawled the proud boys now the problem with this is when you have a group that's supposed to be fighting and Tifa and I actually tried to express this to him when he was on the show because he was talking about kicking people's ass we're gonna punch him in the face I'm telling them to punch people in the face I'm like okay that's not how reality works like I don't know if you have been punched in the face or if you've been around people that like to punch people in the face but you don't just punch someone in the face what happens is you punch them in the face they come back with a bat somebody gets a knife people get guns it always escalates it's gonna keep going you don't just get away with punching people in the face you know and yeah it's not good that these antique apeople bring by clocks and smack people the heads with them and that's kind of the point in that in the first place those people don't understand what happens when you start the chain of violence when you start that domino chain they don't understand what happens they think that they live it in some fucking book that they love about some revolutionary liberal character that you know reaches out and and and smashes all these oppressors of social justice that's not reality in reality you just hit a guy with a lock who's talking to you you assaulted them with a deadly weapon and the next thing you know they're gonna kill you are they gonna beat you they're gonna punch you so when a guy like Gavin says something like you should punch them in the face I understand why he said that because they were inciting violence these these nt4 people would hit people with things that were in masks they some of them some of them were doing it non-violently some of them just wanted what they thought was the right things to happen but like all groups you get a fucking big group you can't control everybody in the nude and that happened with the proud boys too I think I think he decided to have this thing that was gonna you know mockingly oppose and Tifa then it became real and then it became violence and this this is this is just one of the problems that people have when there's a fucking group of people opposed to another group of people and you know him quitting the proud boys is definitely smart but I don't think it's gonna help because now people are there's they're saying he's a white supremacist and what the perception that people have of you is almost important almost as important what as what you actually do it's probably even more important almost yeah because if not for you and not for me not for people that are gonna actually read into it but for people on the outside the perception of who you are is is there's too many things to learn okay he's a racist oh fuck that racist that's all people hear that's all they say and then they keep moving meanwhile you got a guy who's Gavin who first of all he's not even American he's Canadian second of all he's married to a Native American woman he is not a racist he says he's a provocateur a hunter sent unquestionably he says ridiculous shit cuz he thinks it's funny but he's in a very bad situation it's almost a troll or like yes I didn't even think like I know him I'd like we're not good good friends but I like him a lot and I'm pretty sure he's not even right-wing like I think he's just fucking yeah he's definitely fucking with people and he definitely has some right-wing ideas but more than that he doesn't like some of the ridiculous aspects of the left so it's more in its again like he's a more opposed to some of the more preposterous notions over left then he is really right yeah but he's right on some things to a right-wing on some things but look he came onto the show dressed like fucking Michael Douglas from falling down as a goof he brought us real taste and everything we're a tie and the white short sleeve button-up shirt he did it as a goof like that's him he said he's a weird guy and it's funny he says funny shit but he but in this when you here's there's two different ways you can go through life right he could pretend put on an act or you'd be yourself what he's chosen to do is a little bit of both he's chosen to pretend a little bit but also be himself so it's hard for people to know where the line is yeah that's fun that's fun if you're getting away with it it's not fun when it turns on you yeah and then you go no that part I was joking around about people like says who like who's right who's wrong like it it gets it gets real slippery when people don't actually know who you are where you stand yeah and I think he was Joe he thought it was fun to fuck with people a little bit on with certain things and in this climate man that can be fucking dangerous yeah he's Andy Kaufman of 2018 no he's not he's different thing he's Gavin McInnes you know and I really I'm sad that all this shit is going down and I hope it passes over and and people get to understand me is not perfect person but no one is but what he is is an interesting guy who's weird says funny shit didn't he take a shit on the air once on his show he stuck his finger up his ass and shit he's done some ways he's not a bad guy he's a maniac yeah there's something weird right now going on like in 2018 that the left hates a right the right hates the left and we're all exactly the same or you know the difference between it's what you said it yes stupidly in the group just yeah the whole group I'm gonna hate exactly like it worst comment in honor the worst common denominator the worst actors in any group define that group so whether it's you know people that are on the right Lou there's a lot of people who are on the right who are fiscally conservative but they're socially liberal yeah and they just know they just don't think that you should spend money like crazy they believe in discipline and they believe and you know having intelligent financial planning you know there's there's that as well as people who are socially democratic and you know the Socialists that think you spend all the rich people's money on all those other things it's just as many people there's like there's a way broader spectrum but you have to pick a side I think most of us are like ninety percent in the middle and then there's the five five on each side to that like you're like no I'm more left-leaning and then you see like extreme laughs and you're like let that fuck's wrong with these people okay I'm more right then you see the fucking weirdos on the right you're like what that fuck like that there's there's something very scary on both sides yeah and when you see that scary thing you want to pose that thing so you become what it's the OP you know you become a left-wing person you decide well we've got to stop Trump no matter what whatever is never Trump I mean there was a lot of that going on I think the only reason why I went more to the right side is because of the free speech thing cuz I think pretty much everything I'm more left-leaning except the free speech thing that I'm more right leaning it's insane and that shouldn't be a right or left thing well it's insane to me that's the left that's having a problem with free speech that's what's insane to me because I always thought the left was all about free expression and intelligent education and it used to be yeah it also used to be more about peaceful behavior like the hippies in the you know the 70s where everything really changed in the 60s which really did launch a revolution and changed a lot of America during the 60s and the 70s a lot of it inspired psychedelic drugs right all those people man were nonviolent that was a big part of that whole movement was all love you know and the hippies movement of today is not the same it's like a feeble small subset of the overall aggressive liberal group you know that thinks that you know they've got to stomp out sexism and racism and transphobia and all these things and like this is like really aggressive front running you know the ones who want to change policy and change culture and change society so when you get an teeth involved and you get people screaming in people's faces and people going to lectures and blocking lectures and you know and threatening violence and like wow this is a very different kind of vibe than what changed the world yes sixties in the seven I used to have a bit about how the best way to deal with hate is with love and that that's I truly believe that if someone like what and I try to do that like it was weird when I was going through my weird face but now whenever people say I fucking hate you because you did this you did this I try to understand why they hate me too and I generally do understand like I'm not a fucking idiot so I know okay yeah I'm a guy that made fun of a disabled boy I get I get how you can hate that but then I try I try to you know instead of going fuck you I'm allowed doing this I I show him respect I show him love and then after like three minutes they're always like I know yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry if I told you you shouldn't do that no you shouldn't it's so easy to change people's minds just by listening and people thumb like no it's it's also you know you probably like these people don't know you they're just engaging with you to get a reaction on all people one it's not just some people or what is some people but most people if you're one-on-one in real life on the internet on Facebook on Twitter it's it's really hard to change how people think but if you talk to people and you realize okay this guy's not a monster and this guy's not an asshole and that because whenever Porto wanted realize like if if if you some guy that doesn't like you on the internet that goes a Joe Rogan's a fucking asshole if if you met him he wouldn't say that and and if he did think you were an asshole he'd explain this is what I think and then you talk to him and he'd be like Joe Rogan's a great guy listen there's definitely a limited amount that you could get through when you're expressing yourself on Twitter on Instagram or something yeah and people like to get reactions out of people so they want to get Mike Ward's goat they're gonna fuck with you and say mean shit to you and they're doing it because they want to get a reaction and some of them don't even think of you as a person no and they also think of you as an easy target because you did something mean and because you're a guy in the public eye and you're a professional comedian and maybe they hate their job and like fuck this guy and why is he living his dream when I have to do this shitty job yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of it so I won it's a shitty it's a shitty but B you don't really because there's like though the whole the whole interaction sucks like he's wrong you're wrong everybody's wrong though the whole thing is stupid and interacting with people like that going back and forth with them I've done it before it's stupid to do but it's just a complete waste of energy did you get a lot of shit your last special well no shit no that's fuck one article from vegans but the misquoted really yeah because I said they totally took me out of context cuz it you're vegan because because what they said he calls vegans dip shits that's not what I said what I said was that the majority of vegans I think are good people who are just trying to live their lives without something dying they just made this moral choice and then I say and those people pay for it with their health they're always sick the fucking I'm thinkin if I do you look like ya know I know the other joke the other part of the truth the other part of the joke was he used to like them joke was in the rest of the people that are vegan they're really only vegan cuz Scientology didn't find him first I go there fucking dip shits they they could have you know they would have joined the Taliban if they took the wrong exit it's just so he took out he calls vegans dip shits no no yes it's not what I said yeah but that's the title of the fucking article that's the only thing you know what your specialty sure this other thing thing about vegans I spent like four hours looking at pictures of people that have vegan cats that was it like went like I don't eat meat or I don't eat meat products but my dogs and my cats do cuz like why am I gonna decide like I I feel guilty if I eat steak but my fuckin dog doesn't care and my dog if I left my dog out of the house without me he'd fucking kill everything so why am I gonna be like no no young man you're gonna eat carrots and dogs can be vegan without sighing China but cats can die like in a month and a half yeah that's why I wrote that yeah yeah and but I didn't even know that people were that stupid that they they made their cats vegan and then just looking at the pictures there's something weird that like I think all vegetarians of vegans if you look at animal cruelty you're always sad but when I was looking at vegan cats it made me laugh I was like what the fuck it's so stupid because it's such a fucking glaringly ridiculous proposition you decide that a cat is no longer a carnivore they all looked like Freddie Mercury the last month of his life I don't know what Freddie Mercury last month it was like Google a vegan cat I'll need to see yeah you need to see that on his deathbed don't you see it I get it yeah damn you made me feel like shit good joke and I was like oh I'm a bad person I thought maybe there was a real photo go around yeah there probably is though I bet there is what yeah it's some I don't know man if you if you can explain your comedy well today you can still get away with a lot but you just have to you have to take a lot of time to craft your bits yeah and you got to think about what you're saying and how other people not just whether or not it works sometimes things work but you're saying things like oh I got away with the same exact thought and I would have been I've been in more people's brains it would've gotten smoother I did a I heard a thing I loved nor McDonald look Norman Donald's my favorite comic of all time and he when I was going through my thing I saw a thing about him that he said that when he was doing Weekend Update he'd done a joke about someone that had just died and then he got an email from the the people's family about her it was before email so I guess he got a letter of facts or whatever about the how they felt about that joke and he was like that made me realize that oh shit when I make fun of someone there's an actual person behind that joke there's and that what it's weird that my whole court thing like like when I was this was before I went to court I read norms thing and I was like fuck I never got that because I was doing jokes about this this kid that was famous so in my mind it was like making fun of Justin Bieber was like making fun of whoever whoever but that then I realized oh fuck there's there's someone behind you know someone that feels what you're saying is exactly what people experience when they hate on you online yeah it's exactly the same thing they don't think of you as being a person that's the same way you don't think of Justin Bieber as being a person exactly it's the same thing exactly yeah we're all guilty of it I think I mean I hope ultimately we were getting get past this I think a lot of what's happening with this is that this has only been around for like 20 years this internet way of communicating with each other and only been around the way it is really the way it is now for like less than 10 yeah you know and I think that we don't know what we're doing with it yet we don't know how to do it yet and we fuck it up and I think to like for comedy for a while when I was going through my thing everyone was telling me they're like do you think this is the death of like dark humor and and I don't think it is but I think we're gonna just be smarter but no you got to get the fuck out of Canada bro to where but also I mean this is what everybody always says this is the end this is the end of this I mean there's one of the things that I've read about the Nannette special this is the end of comedy right like this she was gonna kill comics she's never gonna be the end there but it's so silly like why would someone not want to laugh it doesn't mean it's not a good piece of art why would someone not want to laugh yeah and there was another weird thing that she got interviewed and she said that she was gonna retire unless louis c.k comes back and he come in he comes back she realize oh she's at work is not done yet oh god all right flat out that's a real quote but she might have been tongue-in-cheek and she even said here's the thing right you like you you say things turn again I do yeah she might have very well she's kidding and we didn't get it she might have been joking around like they might been laughs and she might have been done I guess my work is not done you know but then you see it for yeah in two dimensions and who knows I got a I think I was angry at her because she didn't she said she didn't know who Norman Donald was so I was like fuck you you know who Norm Macdonald Ian tin the comedy I mean she's not from around here like even though those people in that country that left Africa the worse they can know who don't norms definitely a genius I miss the best I can't get he was supposed to be on the podcast and someone put the kibosh on him talking to people anymore she mentioned Louisa Kagan and possibly that he might mount a comeback I don't want to stop him she said it's worth just to see if he does have an audience course he will there was 18 seconds left the interview tape it didn't expect to take a turn miss Gadsby of course had other ideas if he does have an audience then I won't be quitting stand-up miss Gatsby said quote me on that if louis c.k finds his audience i will definitely not quit stand-up because my work here is not done okay but then also could you could say okay say I said that with a cheeky smile she added and left the table oh so she was she was fucking around why does the New York Times still use tape to record I don't know but I like that she said that say that I said it with a cheeky smile so it was a little joke yes we suspected she was tongue-in-cheek like literally she's saying cheeky smile so that's exactly what tongue-in-cheek is the same thing yeah so good for her yeah man she'd do anything wrong so stealing who cares anything transcribed not only that her act all of it like the the animosity the fucking tension who cares I heard so unnecessary I have a couple of friends cuz there there are a lot of Canadian comics and I'm gonna buy saved by saying that I mean against her that's what I mean I don't mean like her animosity towards anybody else Canadian comics generally they used to come here to the states but like ten years ago they start going to England or Australia and I know a lot of Canadian comics that knew her and they were like she used to be really funny and I think it was just this show there was like a more serious show so maybe in the interviews she's just fucking around contending like she doesn't know no one could be this is what she wants to do now - you know just because you were really funny for a long time I mean I think that is something that the fuck is her name someone is doing that now - she just did something where she did an interview about that god dammit the fuck is her name I got woken up real early this morning I'm super foggy my kid climbed into bed this morning at 5 a.m. go back to see and she was she's a constant she's a regular in the Howard Stern Show she used to be really big she lost a lot of weight got her stomach stapled very funny so he's she called it scholarship the queen of mean oh she used to do the rowing so Lisa Lampanelli is not doing stand-up anymore yeah yeah she's because she's tired of hurting people's feelings and she's gonna tell stories now yeah no but she loved him kind of she heard her talk about her she said yeah so she she'd changed what she does which is fine like you should be allowed to change what you do yeah yeah like you always make me feel bad and from my reaction because my reaction to that was like fuck and then what you said it's so right that was like fuck all my my reactions are always welcome to instant about it you got it you have a brain if you gotta know who the real enemies are otherwise you're waste all your venom on the fake ones you don't want they want to save your venom for the real so that everybody else you can make like this you could make peace with it you don't need this there she is BAM storyteller so she calling her what does it say shrink that shit down so I could read her heading should get down storyteller yeah there is workshop leader inspiration to millions oh well he got a little crazy there I think she's just gone crazy yeah she's lost her fucking mind or she's enjoying herself yeah you know free expression she's got a lot of fans yeah she's not for anyone she's happy Hansen it's right a hoodie yeah I don't want to hear that she looks very different it's strange it's called pills son with the pharmaceutical on man good for her yeah good sir show like and a storyteller show it's it's probably really I don't think it's gonna be that different to what she used to do cousin you know people evolve people change and that's normal like there's nothing sadder than seeing a comic you saw 20 years ago and then you see him again this year and it's the same fucking shit so it's good that she of the same act it's really sad that's really sad yeah healer guy from like the 90s around and they literally haven't written a joke yeah there's those guys are real why we see them yes guys are scary there was some movies last night the Jen Rose battle before there was a Jeremiah Watkins did a thing about 80's comic that it was the best yeah it was so funny his thing on the internet that when you did a kill Tony that he's a funny dude yeah I did his show last night that stand up on the spot okay oh it's yeah it's his show yeah he used to call it Thunder pussy for a little while I don't know why I think that was Brian I think Brian decided to call it thunder pussy voted on name I believe democracy is a better name I should stick with that name that's what thunder pussies were way better name stand up on the spot you're so literal okay you know but the problem with thunderpussy is people might not know what it is but they should why don't they know figure it out Thunder yeah Thunder pussies the way to do it yeah Jeremiah listen to me Jeremiah Thunder pussy yeah he should bring thyn thunderpussy back yeah what is up stand along the spot Brandin son how about call it stand-up comedy right on the spot no no stand up on the spot a stand-up comedy right on the spot right now that's name of the title no thunderpussy BAM yeah we're done here right but he did do a good impression we know guys like that who these comics did not even hate it's just I don't want to call them comics it's just been the same thing for 20 years and they're open mic restore 20 years almost right and they'll go around doing maybe an opening spot somewhere and it's the same act so they'll have references in there of stores that don't exist anymore yeah it's so weird when you watch them do it you're like what am I see this is a train wreck is this sadness we get person at those in like in smaller markets like Montreal is a fairly small market on the other side because if there's so many French people and even like the end there's no money to be made in Canada so there are a lot of fucking hacks and yeah comics in my name in Montreal is the comedy work still around yeah it burnt down like a couple months ago fucking amazing Club that was that wasn't down yeah that would happen it was suspicious apparently I don't know the details yeah but from what I understand they're gonna rebuild the building they're gonna break its legs Jimbo fucking took off Jimbo he he he sold it his mom died and then he sold it or he just closed it down he had he yeah he closed it down then someone reopened it a few months later under the same name a couple of people that bought it that'll of the club and they reopened it up until when it burnt down Ian do you remember Ian the he was a bartender dancer Ian got a partner he opened it up and Jimbo Jimbo was such a good guy fucking love Jimbo but he closed that club like a fucking piece of garbage he didn't tell anyone he didn't tell his staff he just fucking they showed up one night and they were like okay oh the club fucking everything's taken out of the club he just left Wow yeah I must be drunk yeah cuz you you used to I remember the first time I saw you was there yeah all the time what and you were like and this wasn't like in fucking like 19 84 or whatever I'm sorry going back that late but uh like you were you were you were doing like big big big big big fucking rooms but you were there just to do a show for you know for the clubs I worked for Jimbo forever so I come back and work for free I did did we get for him for free once I just said just pay for my hotel I girl let's just have some fun I just I always loved being he's just he was such a great guy I'm sure sure he's alive if he hears this yes but he's a great guy and I just enjoyed being around him and I was he struggled it was a small room and what didn't have that many seats and he had two floors he a nice little bar downstairs with a pool table then upstairs yeah real intimate room this is a great place and to me it was if that place helped me it was in the time when I started doing it was right when my career went from being like middle act who was kind of going on the road and doing these weird little gigs to becoming a headliner and getting on television okay all that happened a lot of it happened while I knew him and during that time and so I've taken quite a few trips up to Montreal for the Comedy Festival to work at Jimbo's place and to go back and forth and do a bunch of gigs up there it just was a it was an important spot for me you know like like Jimbo was one of those guys that he had a real eye for like he he booked everyone before they were famous yeah and this is for people listening this like a 85 maybe 90 seat room like it's super small yeah probably maybe habeus 200 yeah dumped him in there but remember I saw Richard Jeni there dude yeah did you ever see Jenni there I saw Chris Rock there I saw a Ray Romano there I saw Chris Rock there as well I saw Richard Jeni once just level that place it was during the time where I was I might have been like four years in the comedy I was I was pretty new in the comedy and I was up there were you doing the festival you're just there I was doing the festival okay yeah maybe I 80 and maybe five years maybe was five years in a comedy and Richard Jeni was a monster man he he is the one guy that I just repeat this over and over again cuz I don't think people appreciate how fucking funny he was cuz he was he was kind of an odd guy who just it was a hard to find like a category where you fit it in but he was so fucking funny and he just lit that place on fire I remember leaving his set going god dammit why am i doing I was terrible yes but I absorbed something from it oh and one thing was that that guy exhausted subjects like he would take a premise and exhaust that premise and smash it to the point where when he was on like this third wave of observation and punchlines you were just like bah you were as in awe of the fact that he was continuing to beat down the subject as you were the writing in the punch lines it was also like like the mastery his ability just master a premise and just dump just just dominate all the vert and take you off-guard catch you off-guard but you also agreed while he was saying it he was a wizard man it means just sweet tight jokes man he was so goddamn good that's how I am with Ralphie May like when I remember Ralphie I've never seen anyone get laughs like Ralphie got like he I get a series of shows with him like a year or two before he died and the walls felt like they were fucking shaking mmm like I could an egg I don't like I was hosting this show and he was he was closing it and he wasn't supposed to close at first but then he was like it was going to good they they had to make him cum I was closing before though it was I forget who was there was uh I forget who was America know this was in Montreal and the the nasty show at Just for Laughs I forget if it was Jimmy Carr or it was Brad Williams one or the other but they and whoever was weather was Brad or Jimmy said the first night there were like he should fucking close like he's gotta close and every night I go in the room just to feel the energy of that room and since I'm from like a like I've been living in Montreal for 20 years I know that fucking room I've seen like Marilyn Manson in that room I know it's a metropolis so like I've been in that room yeah I didn't know room and that and it felt like the fucking walls were shaking it felt like the way when you were describing the earthquake that's how fucking Ralphie Fowler seen Diaz kill bears in Joey Diaz kill I've never I've never been seen Joey life oh dude how long you in town for uh we're leaving tomorrow Wow if Joey goes up tonight at the store I don't know if he's up there's night that's a life-changing thing he's the funniest guy I've ever seen yeah I've never seen anybody kill harder than Joey Diaz never I gotta get you have to see it okay if you think I mean Ralph is a funny guy Joey Diaz is a force of nature it's a different thing and this is not taking anything away from Ralphie wrong shit on Ralphie I'll fuck you up Joey Joey Joey Diaz a different thing man he'll he'll make you just go whoa look okay that's comedy to shit I fucking love listening Joey like I've never met him but I love listening to him he sounds like he sounds like him like that's what I loved about him when I met him the first time I was like you sound like like a like an old gangster like you sound like I I love guys that sound like they should be in Goodfellas yeah he definitely sounds like that yeah well he's he's like legitimately seen more life and more chaos than probably any random thousand people yeah he says do stories man he brings up new I've known the guy forever and I have him on the podcast you know every few months and he has a new story I'm like how the fuck is this possible man and he's not a liar people who make show up though Dory's no he doesn't I've met people they verify the stories he just lived a fucking insane life you know and you can tell when people make up their salaries fuck yeah he's not a bullshitter yeah no no he's not hilarious though it's um you know it's beautiful job man we get lucky get to meet some really fascinating people we do yeah so when did you guys start doing this show on compound media we started doing it about a year ago and we started doing the free show about four months ago because we like we want to get people to listen to the compound media how does compound media work cuz compound media you need to be a subscriber to the whole to the whole network much does it cost it costs 895 895 them on us and yet how many shows you get Anthony ku Mia show Monday to Thursday you get in hot water that's an amazing show it's a Arenberg Gino biscotti four days a week you get about like 30 or 40 shows yeah there's quite a few shows I met one of the hosts she was on Johanna yeah it was yeah she was on morning with Bill Schulz Joanna she's she's the only female host that we have on yeah this is his new book yet there's something amazing about Anthony come--as like he like in the old days with Opie and Anthony he was like he helped out a bunch of young comics and he's trying to I think he's that that's kind of what he's doing with compound media and I'm calling myself a young comic even though like young 45 and I'm gonna die in four months but well you mean people that are unestablished yeah yeah thanks people that are and he said he started doing things like like I'm still based out of Montreal and we were the only show that all the shows they do him in his studio in Manhattan and then he he asked me do you want to do this and I didn't want to move to like I got my wife I got my life in Montreal I liked Montreal right so I was like now I'm gonna Montreal but then he was like you if you do the show you can do it from Montreal and plus I how'd you do it how do you have it set up he we have a studio in a know like Park X which is a neighborhood with where he's from don't tell people where you are bro ya know so he's a but he has a studio and we do this show every week and it's it's a lot of fun yeah cool so you just do they download it you send it uploaded tuition we send it to them it doesn't stream live no we weren't the only show that isn't live and we we never pretended less advantaged that and do like weird splices where you go back in time and change clothes don't say a word about isn't happening here just change your t-shirt cuz I just like cams and gentleman just shows a hundred percent line that should be your joke call you should call your show a hundred percent live I think the thing that people like because what all of our fans are like old ona fans and I think what people like is our show is like not political at all and that like a lot of the stuff on compound media is is is political and like people that like Polly even people that like political see after a while they're like okay I get it I get it Hillary's a cunt supposed to compete he is like very right-wing right yeah there's no is there any left-wing like we know in the background yeah we should get a we should get it like a trans third Mike yeah well we've whole trans show yeah no okay we've know it but it's not as right-wing as people think it is well you know Anthony's right-wing but he's intelligent he's got sensible arguments and whether you agree with him or not you know I'm not necessarily right-wing at all and I like talking to him and he's super funny that's one thing that people it's almost like in 2018 people have forgotten like what and I see this on the right to like people on the Left will shit on Anthony are people on the right I'll shit on like like comics and I'll be like that's funny that's funny like even if that's not how you think that's funny right like Sarah Silverman a lot of people on the right shit on Sarah soem Sarah Silverman is fucking funny she's hilarious very very real in common yeah but you know what man they only did what they're shitting on is only her political opinions it's just it's a nonsense war to get into you know what do you want everybody to think the way you think you know it's it's and again it goes back to what we're talking about earlier people just get on these teams they want to hate everybody's on the other team and she's on team left so fuck that bitch and that's what happens probably though why we got to the top of the food chain and we we group together and collaboration yeah and then we just okay well it's us versus them so we're gonna win yeah 100% yeah William von Hippel guy was on my show last week wrote a book called the social leap yeah I listened to that episode yeah the book is essentially all about how human beings really succeeded by figuring out once we were some sort of weird primate thing that was close to us by banding together and working in cooperation and that performing teams and loyalty to the teams always rewarded I mean this is what you're seeing in politics you see in social circles even when you know with like these crazy and Tifa people and and and and proud boys it's all the same thing it's just tribal behavior you're seeing tribal behavior on the right from the proud boys tribal behavior on the left from antifa and everybody else is the enemy and they lash out and you know most of it is just completely misguided most of all the aggression and the violence and the hate is so stupid and so misguided and counterproductive and even though they think because in the moment it's such an impulsive childish thing to do to lash out and hit someone with a bike lock or punch someone's sucker punch them but you all you're doing is feeding this fucking machine it's never gonna run out of fuel it's just gonna keep chewing up our culture it's gonna just keep going it's you're not gonna end it you know and I'm gonna if you start punching people it keeps get you're feeding the beast yeah they're gonna punch back they're not gonna just gonna punch back when they're gonna kill you there's a thing I used to do a lot of shows for like I'm uh I'm um the people that like me are generally men like most of my fans are more men than women so I used to whenever I do corporate gigs the only corporate gigs I'd ever do were shows for military police officers or the Hells Angels and now and every time and the thing I realized is when you talk to a group of cops or you talk to a group of Hells Angels they're the same fucking guys they're the same guys because they got the same exact fucking mentality they're third group they're guys that are like okay it's us versus them we do this I read Braille we're doing this we're doing this we're going in there yeah and only difference is you can call the cops and they'll come help you can help me well your motorcycle take care your problem I got into this thing about 15 years ago back home I did a joke about I did a joke on one of the Gala's for the festival and a reporter talked shit about me and it was a joke all my jokes are about little kids so it was now but it was a joke I dented joke that I'd mentioned the little girl that got kidnapped in my joke and and but the joke is good yeah I'm gonna give up comedy I fucking went out Joe Rogan to give up comedy sorry I should commit suicide tell me the hilarious joke about the little girl victim it about the little girl but it was about and the joke is gonna suck now because when you have to explain a joke but it was a because I owed money did the government the IRS the Canadian IRS and they seized all my accounts and I had this little story and uh they and I was the the punchline was like they're fucking crazy if you owe them eight dollars they're gonna kidnap your kids they're the one that they're the ones that have blah blah blah name the little girl and I got it got a nice laugh and then it ended ended my set with uh I got a standing ovation and Ogawa got good reviews everything was good then like three weeks later this reporter guy writes an article about how the audience was shocked and offended and I was like they were shocked and offended I got a standing ovation and they were shocked and offended and then there was this a french-canadian guy that's like a like a Larry King type guy he started his show he was like mike Ward made fun of this little girl let's call her grandfather to see what he thinks about that joke so he called the grandfather during the show during the show he didn't tell the guy whose so he was like hey do you know Mike Ward and the guy was like yeah he made fun of your granddaughter and this girl fucking got kidnapped like he was like what what do you think about that he was like well that's not cool yeah no I'm not isn't cool and then people's shit lost her and then people were calling go like a fucking asshole what a piece of garbage and then people you've got an issue people lost I'd like make them fun a little kids yeah so people lost their fucking minds and then people were sending like messages to my manager that they knew where I live they were gonna murder me and then I look outside the house and my manager calls me he's like there are people that are gonna kill you and I was like they're not gonna kill me I look at it's on my house I see fucking people lined up outside my house I'm like fuck I'm gonna get murdered but like I was looking at them and they weren't attacking the house they were just like in front of my house looking at my house and I was I'm not a brave dude like I can't like like I'm not fucking you like I don't know how to fight so but I was like I'm just gonna go talk to them to see what the what the fuck's up so I went out and then they acted like they were just regular guys just hanging out outside my house I was what the fuck and then I found out like two or three years ago that I had done a couple shows for Hells Angels and the Hells Angels had parked they told their dudes like mike Ward they're people that want to kill Mike Ward so so watch the people to want to kill Mike Ward so that there were the Hells Angels like on my house is is like in the middle of the street people the other side the street and on each corner there were Hells Angels watching the people and I was like fuck the Hells Angels protected me it's yeah wacky yeah a lot of Hells Angels are probably good guys there they're like you're saying they're probably the same as the guys are the cops if you like and this is the same with mafia guys if you don't owe them money well they're good guys he's here with the message that like they're all like like whenever whenever I meet anyone like in the Mafia or whatever I'm like that doesn't seem like he's in the Mafia is a good guy but I don't own like $19,000 right right yeah well I'm sure a lot of organized crime and a lot of organized business they probably behave pretty similar yeah because it's things they can get away with and things that they can't yeah you Kiki if you just go around go around breaking legs and killing kill you yeah and they'll kill your kids god damn it's a goddamn business goddamn business alright gents let's wrap this bitch up in this forever but when do you think this thing's gonna get resolved uh with the thing that's weird like when I went to court this have fucking stupid I am I thought it'd be like Oh Jay that at the end of my my trial they'd be like K stand up and we go we vote for you but in Canada they we get the the verdict like four or six or eight months later so I'm going back to court early January and then I'll probably get the verdict in a year or two like it's really like I'm gonna be 97 by the time I get them much money is this costing you so far it's gonna cost me like like I said Bruce from like it's gonna cost probably two hundred thousand two hundred them and this is the thing I want to start I'm gonna spade off twenty I got a paid off what I could have paid off ten ten if I wanted to but here's the thing what I want to do I was really lucky that an I'm a guy that always sees a glass half-full but uh I was lucky that I had the money to pay this because if I was a guy like there was three or four years into comedy and someone like sent me a letter to say hey you were a eighty I would have fucking either committed suicide quit comedy and wonder for years in the comedy you probably be more inclined to say something inappropriate because you think it was funny yeah be shocking Yeah right like you get rewarded especially when you do open mic nights and you're just starting out you get rewarded in taking chances that aren't necessarily funny but they're shocking yeah you're risky yeah because it might be the best reaction of your set it's not might not even be necessarily good but that's the best reaction of your set because frankly your set is mostly dogshit yeah right when you're two or three years in right yeah so imagine that gets on the internet so year old comic it's barely get off stage legs under him droppin bombs yeah just saying something stupid that you think you're gonna be funny yeah I wanna I want to start a thing though I haven't started yet cuz I was gone through depressed and I've been talking about this for years but now since I'm not in my depression I'm gonna start a fund for whoever the next guy or next girl next woman is gonna go broke son they're gonna be his girl not his storm of them but I think cuz cuz like like I was lucky I think of myself as lucky for real cuz like I don't have a lot of money but I had enough money to defend myself and I didn't even have to go like fuck it in any way a raise your profile to help you it would have helped me if I didn't spend all my days in the bathtub crying drinking wine mmm like like if I if I had used this I could have I could have I don't know if I would have become like super famous but I could have used this but I was like I didn't want to use this I didn't want to be I didn't want to be the guy that made fun of disabled children too late I know yeah I get it man I mean I think that's a real noble idea too to start off fun for the next guy and especially because Canada has such a wonky system yeah it's just Canada you're you're basically connected we're all together we you guys are right here basically Vermont with as you are 11 Human Rights Commission's because there's the Canadian Human Rights Commission and every Canadian province has their Human Rights Commission and there in the world there are 12 Human Rights Commission's so there's the one at The Hague that they go after evil like more criminals and shit and then there are 11 in Canada that go after open mic errs and Jordan Peterson they go after me I think this is we can make comparisons to what they're doing with free speech to what we deemed to be the real issues with controlling free speech on the Internet I think there's real similarities yeah I think having these human rights councils committees people getting together and decide and they don't want to come off callous or ruthless or you know and so they can decide well that's gone - fun this is wrong you shouldn't be able to say that that is the number one problem with controlling free speech yeah like you should be able to say whatever you want and then if people don't like you then they don't watch you or they don't go see you and you let the free market decide it's not about you know we're not talking about inciting hate or saying you should go kill people one of the things that a lot of people had a problem with with Gavin was Gavin was actually saying punch them hit yeah that's fucking crazy cuz he's not used to being punched and hit yeah that's what it is people that are around violence a lot don't just willy-nilly advocate violence you know and yeah I think he realizes that's probably why he stepped down from this whole thing now because he realizes like it's probably hard to see how you're perceived when you're in that fucking polarizing a position as he is that he just was at one point in time the guy was one of the cofounders of ice it's really kind of weird interesting provocateur guys very smart yeah I enjoy talking to him to this guy who's like all right and you know the leader of a hate group like what that shit sticks to you man yeah I mean that shit sticks to you like Krazy Glue yeah I'm always gonna do but I think what we're saying earlier so that perceptions some sometimes almost as important as a reality and in your case may prove to be it's a war off right yeah like now I'm people forgotten and people seek the thing that like I said when we were starting out the podcast the thing that kind of pissed me off is like in America I like that and in Quebec which is French Canada they saw me as a guy that that would I do jokes but I'm offensive I'm a fucking dirty comic and I do what I do and I think I'd do a well hope you enjoy that kind of comedy and they do same where they enjoyed gangsta rap same where they enjoy and violent movies I'm not like some shitty like fucking open mic are doing rape jokes that that don't work if I do rape jokes my rape jokes fucking murder my up jokes kill like I've won like fuckin like 15 local wards yeah every rifle with rape joke of the year more than my weight but people people like a lot of the media instead of going there's something weird about the government because the government judging my case is exactly like judging a movie it's like like saying fucking why are they driving so fast and fast in the Furious why there's good point they forgot that what I do even if you don't like what I do is art yeah and you you might not think stand up is art but it is it's a fucking expression and I were talking about this earlier that it just seems too much like you're just talking cuz cuz and here's the thing whenever you see a comic that that's good it looks easy and when it looks easy it looks like they just it's off the top of their head and that's what they think and that's a thing I think of Jim Jeffries had said this that he said there are things that I think and they're what I soundstage are things that I think are funny and that's what we do on stage like it's not a chant that was me too those are my okay that special is exactly same that was probably you alright so Jim Jefferies though it was but it's everybody says that he had a fucking good bet about vegan cancer when can people watch your show they can see it I'm on Amazon Prime in the US and UK the stand-up show yeah it's called it's called it's called mike Ward infamous and my the first 15 minutes are above my court case it's a really good special I'm super happy with this special it's the exact opposite of Nanette so Amazon Prime is on prime and a lot of stand-up right it's like the retarded version of Netflix mm-hmm we'll let you say retarded yeah they like on the phone right now what are you saying so in three weeks I'm gonna be I'm gonna be on Hulu no any loose very liberal they have Handmaid's Tale you're fucked yeah if not we were we're a Friday Friday at four to six on compound media doesn't Gavin still have a show on like CRT TV or some shit RTC our TV yet what does I still hasn't I think he still has it I already talked to Gavin in like over a year like and the last time he wrote me he wrote a funny lekha I thought it was he wrote this weird fucking thing that I could tell that he was drunk and I was like no way he wrote me like a 4:00 in the morning some fucking random thing and I was like I'm happy to see you're drinking again and then he wrote something stop drinking for a while he had stopped drinking for a while and then he wrote something at like almost insulting me and I wrote hahaha and then he wrote ah you're too hard - you're too hard to piss off I'm gonna write someone else so he was just he was unpleasantly since my name's Ward like I was probably like at the end of the list so he had to call some guy named Semenko or so he's going through all of his different fucking contacts 9000 contacts and that's funny yeah alright gentlemen thank you germs thanks for being here man fight thank you and Canada get your goddamn shit together when it comes to freedom of expression this is nonsense you silly goose geese you should be the most amazing country other than that so nice up there it is get your fucking free speech in line bitch alright bye everybody [Applause] [Music] [Music]
