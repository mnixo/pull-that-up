good we never know how to start these things this is never like never feels like it state has think podcasts like a conversation it has to get a ball rolling sound like a song they could kick off with a good jam they need we need momentum this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast brought to you by Squarespace calm squarespace.com is it's a website that we highly recommend if you want to make a website you don't have to go to someone and get your website made anymore it used to be you did I've had every single one of my websites made by someone who knows what the fuck they're doing but you don't have to do that now I've actually messed around with this and created a website it's easy to do brian is created a shitload of them why we've done the actual show itself it shows you how to do everything and you don't even have to enter your credit card to try it if you like this thing gonna work just give it a shot fuck around with it online and if you're not into it just close the browser but if you're into it you enter in your credit card information and you can just take it live and you can also start your own store online stores are stupid easy to do and the way it's set up it's basically point-and-click if you know how to use normal normal programs like if you can open Microsoft Word if you can go to a website and navigate your way around you can figure out how to use Squarespace it's stupid easy choose from over 20 badass designs they have 24 24/7 super fast email support and live online chat support it also works with everything if you make a website or work on an iPhone or to work on droid it work on all the different browsers on computers so go to Squarespace comm and if you use the code word Joe and the number-9 all one word Joe 9 you will save 20% for a limited time I think that's just till the end of this month which is like tomorrow or something right so if you hear this today is September 30th no this that that that probably only works for a couple days yeah maybe well hopefully though well it will be that but I don't know if they get the 20% off because it's normally 19 10% off they doubled it up anyway that's it go there do that if you want or don't doesn't matter it's all gonna be good we're also brought to you by that's it beautiful thing about high numbers rooms no no high-pressure here folks there's plenty of us out there some of us actually need to make a website but here's something we could all use because let's be honest most of us are dumb as fuck and there's a website that tries to help you with that it's called Lumosity and the idea behind Lumosity is the same idea behind exercise is use your mind and use your mind in very specific ways if you use exercise like a knucklehead you don't know what you're doing you're not gonna get any results the best way to get results out of exercise is to engage in a program that's specifically designed to make your body work better and that's what they've done with the human brain they've created a bunch of games and these games are so specific that you actually can enter in different parameters like you get started and they ask you okay like what what out of your memory are you trying to improve whether you were trying to recall certain certain names whether you're trying to learn new things whether you're trying to keep track of several ideas at the same time so you enter in which one of those things applies and then the next step attention and you can it says improve productivity concentrate and based on one of these things you check like maybe you don't give a fuck about maintaining focus maybe you're just one of those dudes gangster about that or maybe you don't give a fuck about reacting quickly you're so laid-back guy if you do though they have it set up for speed speed of the mind speed of decision-making and it all comes out in games and what they've done is essentially set up a bunch of fun games that you can play and these games actually increase your memory make your focus your your your your mental speed better make your your focus more in tune better problem solving it's really kind of interesting I just started fucking around with it and I feel exactly the same I'm not gonna lie to you but it's early I mean I'm a thick-headed dude it's gonna take some time to to make me smarter but but I'm into it and it's interesting and if you go there say that you heard it from me Joe Rogan and I don't know what happens they hook you up or something maybe they say thanks for men and one for women I don't think so I do not think so I think it's entirely but which is probably a good idea right because men and women's minds have been proving scientifically to function better and who would know better than you both sides of the coin you could tell us exactly the fuck's going on so go there go to Lumosity check it out and tell them to chill Rogen sent you and you'll enjoy it it's it's interesting I'm using it like I told you guys that I would update you along the way and like I said I'm not any smarter look exactly the same least I don't think I think would take time maybe I am maybe you think I am maybe you're going Brook Joe you're being hard on yourself you feel smarter already this show if so thank you alright we're also brought to you by Donna calm that's onn I team this would be the last commercial I feel like what the fuck dude you're some sort of a capitalist just trying to get paid son go to audit calm and check out all the things we have to offer the way we best describe on it is is a human optimization website we try to make available for you everything that we enjoy me by me and we I mean Aubrey and myself and all the folks that that own on it the way we have it set up is anything we find it's good whether it's the best hemp protein powder we can find whether it's the the best Himalayan salt or killer bee honey or MCT oil use like we sell the bulletproof stuff because I think I think his stuff is the best I think he has the best coffee and I think he has the best MCT oil I've listened to his philosophy on acquiring products and I believe in it so we just sell his shit you know we try to find the best stuff that we can get online as far as strength and conditioning equipment whether it's battle ropes we and we try to sell them to as reasonably as possible we're not trying to rip anybody off and improving of that all the supplements on on accom like shrimp tank and alpha brain they all have a 30 pill 90 day money-back guarantee which means if you try out for brain and you go you know what this thing didn't do shit for me you get your money back you don't even have to send the pills back in like the idea behind it is to make sure that nobody feels ripped off the last thing I want is anybody feeling like they get fucked unless you want to get fucked you know what I'm saying people go to audit comm use the code name Brogan and save 10% off any and all supplements we got a lot of cool shit including the the new primal bells which are all kettle bells by John Shubin juniors at the same right some mr. szubin mr. Shubert I presume yeah they're pretty badass well they're made by a real artist Stevens Shubin Steven Shubin I wanna say it Steven terrible names yeah the gorilla is too pooed which is a Russian measurement of weight for kettlebells at 72 pounds then the orangutan 54 and the chimp is 35 these are all balanced out too so you can use them they're actually functional not just cool-looking they should put them with your head on it maybe maybe I could be like 60 pounds for people who don't want to commit to the gorilla but they have big fat handles so they're the enhancer grips Frank we made them as good as we can for actual use I use that chimp all the time and I use the gorilla too for power movements power movements alright ladies and gentlemen that's at the end on accom codeword rogue and bloody fuckin blah blah blah this weekend I'm at the Ontario improv that's in Ontario California don't be freaking out if you live in an Ontario Canada because I was just there we're just in Toronto your fucks but that's this weekend I beat the Ontario Improv then October 18th I'm at the Bayou Music Center in Houston Texas it's almost sold out there's only I think there's like a hundred

that's it that's that's all we got going on fuck angels here we're gonna we're gonna party cutie music Jamie the Joe Rogan experience what Sun and Sirius like stuff you have to talk about like your sponsorship is there serious I mean you know you have so much sponsorship it's awesome yeah there's a lot of sponsorship too much probably we're probably whoring it out right now probably hitting the whore threshold well it helps you know it helps to get it motivates you to do things too but it's all for it yeah it's all good stuff we make sure that I've definitely turned down more things than I'm accepted for podcast sponsors because it's a lot of them know it's sketchy or well you believe yeah yeah everything that we have I use right and that's the point yeah or if I wouldn't use I believe that I would use it if I had situation like stamps calm I don't use it but if it came up I'd use it the website well hey man thanks for doing this I really appreciate it appreciate you coming by really cool it for you to have me on you know that is it try not to try not to be aware how cool anything is just a smell as possible some people are very scared so they won't go there ah man do you know what I think people are more scared of themselves than they are of other things especially on a minute yeah well there's a lot of that going on right that's a weird thing with humans it's we're all first of all we're all afraid of the great beyond we're afraid of the abyss at the end of this journey which we were all faced everybody's fucking terrified of that and and and in being terrified of that you also open yourself up to a series of other terrors do you accept because you have the primary terror that's always tick tocking and you don't want to think about that primary terror so you ignore that primary terror with a series of other terrors whether it's you're worried about homos or immigrants or blacks or Mexicans or Canadians or Russians always is them it's always someone who wants to take my guns or someone who has guns you know it's there's a it's either someone who's moving into the neighborhood there's always that wallet I mean is there's also the problem of there's too much information coming at us on a daily basis you know there's fuckin 7 billion people on this planet and we're just inundated with horror stories like all throughout the globe constantly every day you get the the grossest shit is this shit that we're gonna pay attention to the most the most horrifying stories in the news the ones that we're gonna they're gonna get the most clicks so you know the old adage if it bleeds it leads but I think people are interested in that that's why they didn't do that because people get excited to hear like that crazy bad news or else it wouldn't be the number one news well I think it's because it's a part of our past you know and it's also like what got us to to be in 2013 the first place it's by being scared of everything and staying alive you know breeding keeping moving staying alive being terrified of anything that can hurt you but these things can really hurt us think it hurt us if we're there but we're not there we're not we're not right next to the volcano as it goes off on the other side of the planet yeah but they're touching on that fear mm-hmm and then that fear comes up with whatever you just said any of those above-mentioned things and then all of a sudden you're like ah yeah right I mean I kind of did that when I moved out of the United States I'll be honest boy I would imagine so yeah I was gonna ask you if we could talk about that cuz I don't know if you wanted us oh yeah you live in a Mexico now I live in the Yucatan in Mexico that's pretty dope what happened well I mean I was living in New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina hit remember yeah and I was really disappointed with the way that things were going and I really just saw like do I live in this country don't get me wrong I I'm an American I'm totally cool with that I like being American but I was really having a hard time with the government and just everything that was happened that really kind of set me off and I was like what is going on in this country and I just started looking for other places to live because I just saw a future that was not gonna be positive for me and what did you see that was positive about Mexico well the Yucatan what I felt was that I could go live there and nobody really I felt first off my work and the adult entertainment business was being attacked by the Bush administration right not a lot of people really know that situation yeah did you freak out when like max hardcore got a jail that was that was scary to me and I'm not a pornographer yeah exactly thank you for saying that because even though you're not a pornographer that's still something that could affect you in the long run well not only that it's like I don't like what he does I don't like I've seen some of the videos and Sharons mean yes nasty cruel weird tortured type shit I've seen he opened up this girl's I have some piston and it stuck a straw on it made a drink out of it's like it was so it's so gone yeah I don't like it you know I mean I think it's creepy and the guy's a creep for doing it but whatever but there's a here you have to understand yeah businessman right so he's like feeding the customer mm-hmm III agree with you in the fact that it's not my finger right but I'm not gonna judge right I don't like to judge so I don't like to judge either man it's like I was having this conversation with a friend of mine about about bondage and like women who would like to get tied up and I'm like look you can't deny that people like that like you're a strong woman and you are you you're kind of a control freak and you run a business and you can imagine anybody ever fucking tying you up that's okay but that's just you totally like there's somebody out there that loves it there's rival that love it live for it they like they take pictures on Twitter of their rope marks on their resume floor yeah they love it but I can't tied up they're like getting abused there's people that in actually enjoy it and you know I guess maybe it's a fantasy thing for some of our it's consensual that's the key that people need to understand is that it's consenting between two adults yeah so when you get to that weird area where someone is sort of like deciding what's moral and immoral it's so subjective clearly it is I mean it's not I I have played those kind of games I'm very into that this leather scene and playing certain kinds of games but you have to understand it's me and that other adult saying this is what we want most of the time it's negotiated right I would never do something that you didn't want me to do to you yeah it seems twisted but it's twisted in our own kind of fun way yeah and what the fuck is wrong with that what side that's that's a weird thing to decide that there's something wrong with two people doing what they want to do doesn't even involve you thanks for saying but it's weird that that there's a certain group of people that will just openly do that that will openly try to stop people I'll stop people from marrying each other just cuz you don't think that has a lot to do with religion in this country it's sort of organized religion I need to say it certainly does and what does that embrace that embraces the fear now the great answer of the fear the fear at the great end of the abyss and if you don't do what we're gonna do we're tell you to do rather you're gonna burn an internal inferno I'm already there an internal Ephrem infernal eternal Inferno are you though no it's impossible actually they're there they're there while they promote it that's the real strange thing to do to people I really think that fear and that like if you don't listen to what we have to do but the fact that so many millions of people get sucked into it what's that I have theories okay my big one is that religion is a sin in language itself is essentially like a pit stop on the way to the unification of the human minds and that we still can lie and that's a real issue and we also understand what what is convincing and we understand like when words come across well so because you can tell me a true story and it can move me and you can get a very powerful reaction out of me you can fabricate a story and say it as if it was true and get that exact same reaction because we can't read minds yet so because of this this weird sort of adolescent stage that we have right now that we exist in where we're not quite evolved enough we could read each other's minds but we share a form of telepathy communication with our non you know verbal telepathy it's basically you if we're honest you're explaining to me and I'm kind of getting a sense through the words and the definitions that I've got in my head of those words I'm kind of getting a sense of what you're saying some reading and you can tell me stories about your past you can express to me how you feel about things currently I'm gonna see it from your point of view as long as you're being honest but when you start all of a sudden realizing that you don't have to be honest and then realizing that you can kind of manipulate things and well what is the quintessential preacher it's a fire brimstone man who speaks like no one you know someone who speaks from the Word of God and stands on that stage and knows looks you in the eye and the Spirit of the Lord moves me and they talk like a way that you never talked and it's so enforced and powerful that it just it's just a power thing it just becomes a power thing it becomes the ability to manipulate and to move people with these lies and so that kind of person yes that's because I don't get manipulated by it neither do you right but I could have I did when I was young when I was really young I mean I was I went to Catholic school when I was in first grade and that's what cured me of it an evil Catholic school nun and the school was just so dark and just a void of happiness there was no happy it was empty it was just a depressing I mean it made me worry about the future of life like before I went to that school I was like a happy kid I thought the life was gonna be fun and just one year with that cunt and all the other evil fucks that were running that school and just seeing kids get beat no six and you first never felt that at six years old you remember that very clearly Wow very clearly that religion was horseshit Wow right away I was like oh this is all bullshit like this isn't real these are all crazy people because I could tell being six that these were all just a bunch of maniacs is evil lady who liked to yell and scream at kids she just liked to scare the shit out of you tell you that she's gonna make you sit on a nail sitting like she's gonna make you sit in the closet on a nail and you know make you bring you better bring your pillow because you're gonna sleep here you're not you're never going home like she knew you wanted to get out of there so she would torch you and tell you you're never going home that cunt that's like on see that is weird weirdness that is like unconsented yeah that's a good way of looking at yeah yeah but I think it started out with that it started out they probably you know it probably started out if you if you really think about how much is good in Christianity love your brother or treat others as if they were yourself the the core tenants of Christianity about just the the the work of Jesus how he always was with the dregs xiety and he didn't judge people at all and he tried to heal the sick all the things that are positive about it you got to think that there's some some basis and religion is like things that people learn that really connect you to the happy life to the good life which is the life of love the life of caring for each other so they figured these things out but then in writing them down back then especially like it wasn't until like the 1500s that people read the Bible on a regular basis most people couldn't read it there was you have to be like a scholar or you had to be someone who understood Latin or somebody could read Greek the the the people of the common folks of the 1500s they you know that was what the the big Martin Luther thing was about it was Martin Luther was the first guy to create like a phonetic Bible that people could actually read and they were like wait a minute this is not what we thought it was and that's what spawned Luther ISM like that the their view of the Bible was completely different than what they had been taught and it made a huge issue because the church was trying to control who had access to that information because if you had access to that information you could tell people hey this is what God wants you to do and you have to listen right and now all the sudden people were able to read it for themselves and so that took one layer of power away so we're we're dealing with today is the most enlightened version of religion the world has ever known it's still a fucking crippled mess it's a total mess it's scary yeah it is good it's what runs most of the world really yep this is because most the world hasn't caught up yet just like there was no cell phones in most of the world two decades ago I think two decades from now the idea of religion is going to be way way less common way less common oh I'm almost positive it's not the idea of God the idea of God will probably be more common yeah because people will kind of understand that the word God is real slippery you know but you think as a dude in the clouds that's running everything but if you took that word away and what do you you know just express it not a person not a thing but is there an energy is there an idea is there an ideal ideal way of living the world what would be the godly way the gondola would be almost exactly they say in the Bible it's supposed to be like yeah they manipulated it yeah because why did they do that though I think because they wanted to start controlling the masses so they made it a different thing that really what it is what's also how the fuck do you regulate people you know I'm sure if you're especially if you're a dumb person living a few hundred years ago it's too hard to regulate people's too hard to get you get a thousand people in a room and every one of them wants to be the king right you know like who the fuck is gonna what if you have some information they're not gonna listen now I got my own information I'm starting my Scientology it's the new one I got over here we got Mormonism as the shit what you guys are doing you're trash Jesus wrote some new shit you know and there's always gonna be a new ego that wants a step to the center of the line and control the room and because of that it's almost like it was impossible to not have bullshit but if it wasn't for that religion if it wasn't for a bunch of people that were put in line and scared this is a terrible idea but I think it's probably true I don't think we would have made it this far hmm I think people would have been way more barbaric like you have control unless there's only two ways around it one is mushrooms if you gave people mushrooms very young from from like an early day on and then that would probably eliminate a lot of the need for well like look at certain cultures in the world like the Mayan people they used all of that kind of stuff and you don't think that they were like freaking out on each other or had to do like some major obviously they freaked out each other a lot the Mayan yes human sacrifice both well yeah but I mean we're judging that right you probably should you should do it now they killed the Mayan or the Aztecs when they built the the pyramid of tio2 akan I think goes they killed 80,000 people over a period of a few days Oh for you days yeah yeah it's some insane amount of people so much information the Aztecs they killed all the people and when they had the upon the completion of the pyramid they kill all the slaves all the prisoners that were that we're helping them I mean build these awesome buildings they just cut their hearts out and fucking tossed him to the crowds I mean that's kind of hardcore but yeah the mines where our oh yeah they were yeah they have dad if you ever go to Chichen itzá there's actually like an hour from geez yeah you've been to the one where you go to the temple and there's there's a fucking big table where they cut people's hearts out on it's like this this demon God looking thing and they cease holding up this table and that's whether it would cool carve people's fucking hearts out big quartz knives I don't know what the fuck they did with it and there's also a lot of thought that the Mayans much like almost every civilization from ancient Egypt on they start out really good and then everything just fucking crumbles apart as you get several generations in so is that human nature it could be right it's also I think what we're saying earlier I think it could be a part of this this inability to completely understand each other because the the ability to lie through language and then also the the people that develop these ideas and work so hard to create this culture and not the people that are born into it and enjoy it from the get-go sort of like kids that are born rich they developed it's like really spoiled like have you ever met someone who is like really intense and like super focus like some banker type character but his son it's just a complete waste broad of cars yeah always always even in Mexico there's that really bad in Mexico kids are out of control it's like they're all from Beverly Hills like no nothing they have to think they don't have to do anything so they have this attitude that everyone is their waiter or everyone is their you know serving they have that attitude there Wow yeah have nots are much greater than it's much the difference between money and no money is insane there yeah how does something I had to get used to actually how did you choose the Yucatan because we looked around where we wanted to live and then we realize it's only an hour-and-a-half flight from Houston it's like right across the water close to the United States and cuz I work so much in the u.s. mmm it's just like I can commute to the you know my work really easy and it wasn't difficult situation do you ever feel like in danger there do you know Yucatan is completely different than the rest of Mexico it's like its own like country really actually wanted to separate from Mexico at one time and become their own country but Mexico said don't even try it really yeah so it's really much different they're much more chilled out less there's no murderers there's nothing there there's no violent yeah I live in a safest city in all of Mexico it's like we have no no violence or anything no yeah it's unbelievable I saw one thing in the news about some someone lit up a building on fire yeah that's very rare yeah it must be rare because it was the only time I ever heard of it exactly I mean it happens all the time in the rest of Mexico because it's completely out of control if they legalize marijuana we would you know I'm sure you know Mexico quietly decriminalized all drugs yes I do yeah it's kind of interesting yes it is very interesting and they're smart yeah very smart very smart country the government there is actually a little ahead of ours I think really yes in a lot of ways I mean they already gay marriage was way legal a long time ago way before us I don't know how you feel about that but you know it's like so stupid that we're fighting about who cares who gets married it's a distraction I think it's a beach ball completely I think it's a beach ball they toss up and you sort of have to swat yeah it comes away whether you argue pro or con the important thing is to never resolve it yes exactly I told the story in the podcast before but I I lived in San Francisco from age 7 to 11 and my next-door neighbors were these crazy gay guys used to get naked with my on they smoke weed and play bongos so I was around you know young people at a very early age and then when I was 11 we moved to Florida which is like the polar opposite of San Francisco and all of a sudden I had this friend of his friend my friend kandi and his dad was going crazy his dad at a newspapers I can't fucking believe this shit he slams a paper down and we were like what's going on he's like these fucking queers want to get married right and it was to him it was it was like it was something like that was infuriating it was really infuriating and I remember thinking at 11 I'm like you fucking baby doesn't make any sense that you would get angry like how does that even affect you how does it affect how does it affect people it affects people because it's it's a germ that gets planted into the culture the idea that it's a problem gets planted in the culture and then it just becomes something that people bring up and they want to think about their own real problem here we go again right it's the same kind of same thing everything is everybody else yeah otherwise it doesn't make any sense I mean the reality of gay dudes is just like the reality of dudes there are nice dudes and there's dudes who will lie to you and try to fuck you clearly and that's I used to work out at Gold's Gym when I was on Newsradio and I've always said that I felt like a tasty morsel hey Stu did you ever use the toilet I bet you did but it's it's all gay guys like it's probably 80% gay guys and they're grunting and sweating and it's a very sexual environment lately you know and for a lot of people that's a that's a horrifying place to go you know but a lot of gyms are like that though and there's if you're a girl there grunting even if they're straight dudes yeah it's still very sexual in this kind of way we don't really talk about and by the way you should use straight in air quotes I bodybuild to do to be happy to suck a cock if you're sure you keep a secret oh I see him all the time on it yeah my friend Rodney's gay who's always telling me about how many she would do straight how many straight guys would let him blow them yeah because that's not gay barely whatever whatever he doesn't come in your mouth that's not cool yeah as long as you come in his mouth it's like it's a wash it's a push yeah dudes or creepers dudes period look I'm telling you I used to be a woman and I became a man and I'm telling you I think differently I react differently my sexual like fantasies are differently and I get it now I get why man are pigs it's totally testosterone yeah testosterone what created rape tests osteology everything all the above everything and and you know this is like this thing I'm doing in my act right now about how the greatest warriors like throughout history we're gay well a lot of people don't realize in today's day and age where there's a separation between you know gay and straight people that there's you know there's the the sick gay people and then there's these straight people that are just living by God's Way and that you know we got to keep these gay people from Mary and like everything that happened that got us into the 21st century involve gay warrior right like awesome Spartan Romans Athenians samurais everyone was gay and that's one of those we regardless of you with if you're gay or not like you like if you hate gay people you you literally have to hate I mean not saying that you know a lot of the shit of the Romans the Spartans they did some horrible birthless evil fucking murderous shit however that's what sort of got people into the 21st century right I mean that's they were gay people that's a fact but it's so weird to me that people are so concerned it's it's a it's their sexual preference it that's all it's based on so like I don't really care who you fuck why do you care what exactly that really and that's what it should be right but I think more men are weirded out by it than women are scares with you yeah scared guys scared because they might be attractive might you know I mean and so when I came along and I you know I I have a pussy so guys were like attracted to me but not sure straight guys and gay guys and they're confused like what does that mean am i gay or no I'm not gay because he has a pussy so that doesn't make me damn like do it it doesn't make it anything about horny just relax there's not anything a big fucking deal but guys are like they're always thinking how can I not if I'm attracted to that am i gay or am i straight well even that statement it doesn't make anything relax that's a guy statement it's a guy statement : ever say no they would go well you know you have to think about your emotion what do you have invested in this I read something I read something I tried to read it I blacked out from irony and and logic halfway into it but it was a male feminist guide to dating woman some guy wrote this fucking TL DR too long didn't read massive multi fuckin step way to be a male feminist and date women and how to approach each and every scenario like the biggest pussy-whipped just and not even that's not cool because not all women are the same some women like to actually be like dudes and just go have sex and it's not really a big deal and we have to be emotional some girls are like that but there's a lot of girls yeah they don't really want to have all that emotional stuff though you know whatever it was but it was so specific it was so specific as to how you should D deal with each and every situation and you know how you should call after sex and make sure that it was okay and we're where we're standing and I want to let you know how I feel and like do you know that is like the easiest way to get a chick to fucking never go like you need bitch and I guarantee the guy who wrote that has no fucking it's like to keep a girl in his life why does he think he knows that from cuz he probably has some dominant female voice in his life that he's trying to placate some she-demon that controls his testicle strings and he wants to write to pees her I've written something I can attribute to your vagina I'm the most sensitive man who's ever live I'm more sensitive than a woman I see your sensitivity coming and I check it with double sensitivity I totally know those guys well the internet mocks them they're called white knights and they should be they should be mark are they called white and yes just because you can write a blog doesn't mean it's right right box you crazy ass that's the internet electricity goes off you will starve to death you will not make it right I was married to a dominatrix it's those guys I know them it's whole nother world and what's that like very strange like really strong like you can't even imagine the guys that you know it's all good it's consensual it's a trip yeah it's a lot of those kind of guys that are very into them well I have a buddy my buddy Jim Norton loves that shit and we were at a restaurant once Austin Texas and went this nice gal came over to the table started talking to us because she knew that he was into that and she's a dominatrix so she started talking dominatrix talk she was very friendly so she was telling us like what you know kind of clients she has and without revealing their names of course but she's saying she deals with a lot of like really powerful businessmen they get a grunt shit all day but then at the end of the day it's you know yeah what do you what do you want me to do mommy yes mommy yes mommy the car mommy that's the one boundary I have is the baby play everything else like baby can't steal I can't deal with the adult baby I don't even think they were going with baby I think they were going with like complete weak man who lives at home with his mom screams at him all the time and tells him what to do like it was like he wanted to be humiliate ona Li yeah piss in his mouth Oh completely yeah all that and also like financial domination that's also a big one really where they like bring she'll be like bring three thousand dollars with you in cash all 20s three thousand dollars all 20s and she goes give it to me and she takes it from him and that's like the scene Wow like I'm like that's a good job you know what it makes sense it makes sense there's there's it takes everything to make this thing work there's like there's yin and yang there's plus and minus there's every fucking little puzzle piece fits in together yes and imagine if you have the job of a you know corporate CEO and you have to stress out all day long that's hardcore yeah you want to just go have a spanking after that I couldn't even imagine and to have millions and millions of dollars on the line every decision the Ilia every day yeah I couldn't imagine I mean I've tried you know running a television show and it's fuckin mind that's just entertainment yeah silly and in temporary you know six episodes and you know it's over at the end and still you're free stress is like oh it breaks your brain yeah Hika I feel way different when I'm stressed my decision-making is not so good I'm not too too edgy I'll like bark when I shouldn't I don't think things through it's like it's just you're constantly keep yourself calm and how do you keep yourself calm and focused furious exercise that's the only thing that gets it out of me it has to be heavy bag like just beat the shit out of a bag do some kettlebell workouts run up a hill sprint up hills right for me it has to be something where I'm fighting life or death because I think that those feelings of stress that you get those are life death struggle tighten things because it's incredibly stressful you know and I think those even if it's like something as silly as a television show if it's important to you you're gonna get an intense amount of like energy focused on that I don't at least my body doesn't know what the fuck is going on right and that those scenario we're gonna have to fucking fight with swords or run from dragons or we got to do some shit man right and so unless I blow it out unless I just blow it out to the point my heart feels like it's gonna rip out of my chest right then I don't I don't ever calm down yeah I know I think I can relate to that totally I feel so much more calm after I had a hardcore workout er yeah but your body is designed you know our bodies the DNA of our bodies is from an animal that was running from Jaguars a hundred thousand years ago two hundred thousand years ago a million years ago there's this the same echoes of that primal time when we were so vulnerable and surrounded by predators at all times including human predators you know I think that shit is just it's in our system still and - what about 10 it's not women gonna run to women how to fight - women had to stay alive women had to protect their babies I mean they didn't have to do it as much or often and of course the the plus and the minus of testosterone is the - is I mean they're actually proven that men with larger testicles make shittier fathers oh yeah I did read that recently some credit yes incredible it's incredible it's so it's so they've also proven that men with larger testicles are around women who are more promiscuous and the more promiscuous the women the larger the testicles the men the community will have oh because they produce more testosterone so they'll be more crazy exactly and they'll be less likely to stick around and raise their children whereas women who have much less testosterone they will raise the children it's almost like nature sets you up if you're gonna be nurture you got to be understanding and peaceful you want to be a calm thing you want to be a thing that doesn't have this fucking right all the eyes ready to go you know and men in that high-pressure high-stress situation like you know in the jungle or something like that are ready to go you got to protect you got to defend you got a hunt together the things have to be done at a split second notice right and that's all the testosterone can see this is weird yin and yang of the life really is and I noticed for myself though I calmed I used to be very much like that before I started taking testosterone and when I took the testosterone I like became a much calmer more focused more happy person than I did when I just had estrogen in my body that's fascinating yeah completely where people you know use that roid rage which is all complete total bullshit well it isn't it isn't I've seen it I've seen it yeah I've seen it I've without a doubt 100% when men huge amount of tests on cz to do though if you're around men who want to be great big bodybuilder right there's only one way to do that you you have to Jack yourself out way above the limits right you know and you've seen people just completely lose their mind where they're like animals they're like it's like being around a gorilla because they're just juiced up to the gills they just they must be taking like an extraordinary amount yeah I'm sure like fifty million tons of whatever it is only it's that much yeah I know you're saying yeah well that's if you see like that's the dirt it's not the dirty little secret it's the dirty obvious secret of bodybuilding right if you see one of those guys those enormous guys that doesn't make any sense the reason why it doesn't make any sense is because you know in your head you have like a spectrum in your head okay well if you're just if you're a man and you have testosterone you lift weights like a crazy fiend right you can get about that big maybe that big if you got super special genetics but what's this this around the circle four or five times like you know member those things at the carnival you hit and the bell goes up Dean it rings the bell these motherfuckers shot it to the moon like they're so big it doesn't even make sense like this it's not possible to get there without drugs the big the sport literally cannot exist but don't they like it doesn't make sense to me the whole the whole professional bodybuilding thing because people are denying taking yeah steroids they have to though for those sponsor companies like they get their money they test you probably do but guys can get around it if they even if they do test if they test you it's ridiculous they be you know that's the reason why the NBA doesn't test for weed the NBA doesn't no no they you know I think people have been popped for it somehow and but very rarely and the reason is the the the players union knows that a giant percentage of those dudes are unwi cuz smoking weed makes you sensitive to space right and distances and stuff like a lot of pool players smoke weed a lot of basketball players love to smoke weed it helps your size right before they play yeah like in here yeah oh yeah but you could though I bet you could giant black dude it's awesome isn't it coffee when did you know that you like the the concept of gender identity to someone who doesn't struggle with it is it's one of those things where you try to wrap your head around it you try to understand it but you never it's like well I always say that a man and woman never really understand each other they just sort of they get this thing where they accept that this is how you are and this is our but I never understand what it's like to want a baby you know in my body I never understand what it's like to have my period I'm never I'll never get it I'll never understand what it's like in any way now you want and being a woman and then feeling like you're in the wrong sex yeah what is that like and have energy when did you realize it it's all imagine if you felt all of a sudden one day you started saying I feel like a girl it would freak you out yeah it would be well Oh without a doubt without a doubt I really most I mean I can just tell you most of my life I felt that way but my parents did raise me like a boy even though I was a little girl they completely raised me like a boy cuz I was very much of a tomboy you know little tomboy boys are okay a girl who looks like a little boy and you know you're ten and you dress like a little boy that's okay in this country nobody freaks out on that it's when you start reaching you know puberty and then you start I started growing breasts and then I started you know getting my period that's when everything shifted it was totally okay my childhood but then people are like uh you need to start treating her like her not like he my parents were a completely freaked out because they always just it was like okay was an issue because I was just like a tomboy and then when that happened I think that's when all like basically everything all hell broke loose you know it wasn't your folks that have the issue or the community that had the issue your new community heard their friends kept saying you gotta stop calling her he named it's a girl there is such a freaky weird thing for people in our in the world basically a man is this and a woman is that but your your penis makes you a man and your vagina makes you a woman that's just black and white for most people in the whole wide world that's just how it works and so basically that's not true because it's really how you feel inside your outer presence is just the shell of your soul and your being really I mean it's to me it's that simple but of course people don't get it because people always take things at face value they don't tend to get to know you or I mean I'm sitting right in front of you now would you say that I am a woman no no no thank you I appreciate you know what I'm saying like the minute someone finds out that I have a pussy it's like no you're you're right well you know what I think one day we're gonna have a pill and you're just gonna be able to be a giraffe red really I I really think that I think that they're gonna be able to manipulate the human body to an extent where it'll be unrecognizable I think we're gonna be able to manipulate our genes to be look like dr. Manhattan or something totally I don't think it's I think the human frame is right now is something that we feel like is completely outside of the realm of control but I think that's really temporary just as temporary as we didn't think we were ever gonna be able to communicate with somebody in real time in Australia 150,000 years ago right you know but today it's nothing and that's exactly what it's gonna be like whether it's 150 years from now and whatever your body's no longer gonna define you you gonna be able to be whatever you want exactly people gonna be able to switch back and forth which really sucks yeah like this month I'm a girl rights month I'm a guy I want to be happening you know already doing the genderqueer thing where they're not saying I'm male or female and then there's like this new kind of thing called VAE where they don't want to identify as male or female and they're just VAE they're just awesome I have a friend who's a Bay so every time I see her she used to be a her but now she's a VAE I chose has to correct me because I'm always like saying her she and so how do you what is the pronoun for that it's very it's day hmm I know it doesn't make any sense hmm because it's not them right so so you don't ever say he you know ever say she you say they as individuals are they yeah Wow try it rather going out I just need too much work they need so much goddamn attention well it's all like all these labels and things that people are so obsessed with right that's a real problem it's a real problem because now it's not LGBTQ it's you know now it's q.i a queer intersexed and they and we have to add a TT yeah what is queer what's the difference queer is more based on your I think your sexuality and and actually it kind of can encompass your gender so it's more of an all-encompassing fluid fluidity with your gender and sexuality where you you're not necessarily saying I'm a he and I'm gay you might be a she and straight this day but tomorrow you want to be a man and gay I'm even getting all even me I'm just a man dude so specific that's what I'm saying is getting a little bit okay here's the deal with my education that's why I always just sort of try to make it as easy as possible for people because I don't really go to that level at this point I want you first to understand that gender is complex but at the same time it's not it's really how you feel as a person and that people are understanding that you know I can be whoever I want to be and you and it's okay doesn't matter what the world think people are starting to be more open minded about it they are and it's really important that people understand that it's going to evolve whether you like it or not yeah well genders complex but for some people they don't want it to ever be complex because one of the thing it's admirable about a man as a man who doesn't worry what's a girl about a man as a man who's just like fuckin silent Clint Eastwood and the movies type doesn't give a fuck never thinking about sucking dicks just out there trying to shoot people you know like without a care in the world and keeps his heartbeat as steady 60 you know never really freaks out that's that's a part of being a man as being sure of your sight and if you're unsure of your sexuality you know you're a vulnerable animal but also I've learned to be very vulnerable and you know I do a lot of public speaking and I talk about my childhood in my life and I had a lot of stuff happened to me you know I committed tried to commit suicide many times and I just hated my life and I was a total nightmare and I I get vulnerable when I speak and I have cried in public like that and actually it feels really good to go there sometimes because and it doesn't make me feel any less of a man I'm a very very confident very sure of myself man but to be vulnerable sometimes lets people understand your story a lot more and lets them come into your life nothing yeah there's nothing wrong with being vulnerable silly idea well you specially for men really I'm telling you especially for men a lot of us men really feel like we're not allowed to go there because it's not you're not a man if you let yourself be and that's totally bullshit well it isn't it isn't it isn't if you're being a bitch okay no fucking reason but that's the problem there's some people that cry for no reason like to get shit okay okay choose that and expressing love about your childhood moments or feelings yeah if you crying over your bitch yeah I'm driving by there's a lot of that though it's like it's important to differentiate right the difference between a person who's vulnerable because they're honest about their emotions and passionate you know if you're passionate like do I cry easy and I cry I'll cry it a good commercial I'll cry in certain songs their songs it hit me and I start crying you know movies I hate depressing movies because I cry like a little bitch you know cuz I'm a very passionate person that I get locked into anything like if I'm involved in anyone's art whether it's a song or a movie or anything where your your your painting this picture of torture or torment I can relate to that character it's hard you know you feel it that's not not all guys go there and you know that there's a weak Darlie those are actually the weak I think I think you're right yeah they're scared yes they're fake scared yes and if you don't understand what real fear is when you actually face it if you're constantly like hiding from like like your actual emotions and pretending you're not scared when you actually are vulnerable then when you really are in danger you're not gonna know what the fuck to do right cuz you don't know yourself right you don't know what you really are capable of you don't know who you really are so when the chips pile up you're gonna just piss your pants and fall apart but men are taught that we're taught that from an early age men are not alright I really think so I know why though why bitches for dads there's a lot of dudes out there that are just bitches they just fuck some chick get her pregnant and then they have a kid and that kid grows up with a bitch right for a dad that's that's super common yeah it is really cause I had a friend who had a fucking tremendous bitch for a dad his dad would whine so much I would want to smack him in front of my friend I would go over and then the guy would he was always so confused like I don't know what to do you forgot a list stop listen you're fucking down alright that's the first thing I do look at that guy if you didn't know that guy you think that guy's a fucking idiot okay he cries over nothing he's constantly whining he's always negative that guy's a bitch you need to get the fuck out of that toxic environment the first chance you get right you know and that kind of shit growing up this guy had no confidence about anything Wow it was just everything he didn't know what he liked he didn't know what to do gotta ask everybody before he did anything and ask your opinion he didn't even know who the fuck he was right he was never he was never shown that it was possible to know who the fuck you were he was imitating the scared terrified thing in his house and it took until he separated from him and started having some milestones of his own graduating high school graduating college getting a degree following love having a relationship going into business that he started becoming a man right but he had to break away from this bitch mold that he grew up in well I think again parenting is also a very difficult situation right people are just thrown into parenting and there is no book real I mean there are books but you know still a lot of times people are just thrown into it yeah there's no skill how to raise my child or how to teach you learned that from your own parents and your own parents in your you know what I mean it's just like this long I was lucky my dad actually was very really hardcore he was a professional athlete he was very focused he was very much like that old-school kind of guy you but I think it actually helped me to become a really good man because I really learned how to focus and be the person that I wanted to be from well sure of course I mean that's exactly what we're saying if you want to be a man and you follow someone who's a man I don't wanted to be a man total I mean it's it's a perfect example it's really difficult because life you do not start out in a neutral point no one starts out at zero right some of us start out at minus thirty of the other of us some of us start out at plus 100 and sometimes the plus 100 people are fucked because everything is too goddamn easy right the minus 30 people and not saying meme I was probably like minus five the minus thirty people that come from a dark background a lot of times have this massive amount of expression inside of them because of that and if they can sort it out it's almost like they have more horsepower right you know their passion like like some of the great artists as far as music that tortured background tortured childhoods and you know it allows them to express themselves this intense powerful way that someone who grew up in bel-air isn't capable of doing exactly like when you remember that song Friday Friday remember that the reason why people are so mad at that is because they knew that this bitch hadn't suffered at all like you're not allowed to sing you know when you listen to like you listen to some old school blues and Robert Johnson you listen to you like this motherfucker was hot they didn't have air conditioning they were sitting out there on the porch he was constantly and persecuted by white people he was women were trying to have his babies trying to get the fuck out of town and stay on the road like you felt everything in that guy's voice that's the appeal of blues in the first photo kind of in New Orleans but isn't that fucked it's almost like you have to like have a shit childhood to become an interesting person well I didn't have a shit childhood I had a shit middle part of my life which actually did help me I always look at that part and I always remember being homeless doing prostitution on the streets like all of that really made me be the person as well but what time is this shit that was like later like in my mid-20s you know I was a professional model at one time I was a woman and I travelled around Europe and then I just couldn't do it anymore because I was doing so much cocaine drinking and partying like mad dude like crazy mad and I just crashed do you said though that when you were just getting your period and you were young yeah that's when people started giving you a hard time yeah that wasn't a bad time in your life though well yeah I was in high school still and so then you know I started having to deal with the high school thing and like you know a girl I'm becoming a girl and I didn't and I'm attracted to girls you know and I was a lesbian I guess but I would felt like a guy and this was you know 30 or so more years ago right and they didn't even talk about that kind of stuff when I was going to high school so a lot of stuff was going on for me I started smoking weed not that that's a bad thing but when you're not focused and you start doing those kind of things it just continues to escalate to hardcore drinking in the cocaine then everything just started escalating for me and I got totally out of control for like since 16 to like maybe 28 I was completely out of control well you were self-medicating completely yeah this is a big difference right between that and enjoying a little whiskey with a must-read completely I'm totally cool with all of that like I don't drink but for me it's just that I don't drink yeah not that I'm sober or do that I just don't drink right it doesn't work for me you don't like it doesn't work yeah there's nothing wrong with that either right that thing though about self-medicating so common amongst kids that don't feel comfortable with who they are they just they just decide to just plunge themselves into a bottle or into it's sad pill bottle or because we also reinforced that in each Society saying yeah you're right you can't be gay it's completely not okay or it's weird that you feel like a girl or it's a weird that you feel like a boy so we as a society reinforce those negative feelings constantly you're just feel shitty about yourself and you're like there is no out for me there is no out what am I gonna do I cannot live as a woman anymore the next option is to kill myself that's why so many kids try to commit suicide now because they just feel no way out of the situation you felt like you needed to add hormones to your life in order to complete your vision of who you are I didn't even know I could do that I have my change over 21 years ago when there was no internet really there was no doctors I was the first trans man a doctor in Los Angeles he'd never even met a guy like me before same with my my chest surgery all of that these guys were like okay but you're basically gonna be our guinea pig I mean who didn't even exist but I knew I needed to change and so I was willing to take that always in the back of my head is we didn't work I'm just gonna kill myself I mean really think about how crazy that is that's was always my option I'm gonna try this if it doesn't work I'm just gonna kill myself because that's how life-threatening it was it was like I had to do it it was life or death for me and this was something that built up over time or was this totally so you had reached a point when you were in your 20s when you're out of control and partying and drinking you were trying to avoid yourself completely and then once you finally face yourself you're like okay I either have to do something about this yes or let's see what's not done or I'm dumb you know I'm done I can't continue to have people confront me as a woman you know she and I was like her I was like Dyke you know like you know short hair and then people you know say she had throw stuff at me on the street yeah Dyke we're gonna kick your ass like people used to follow me and try to fight I was a total fighter dude but you know like that was my life and it was like you get tired of that you get really tired of constantly having to fight people's negativity towards you constantly and you're like I don't want to be this way anymore was it men that would would make aggressive oh and man never woman never women always men following me throwing shit at me trying to fight me like you know jumping me three or four guys jumping me like it's the same I don't know where did where was this at La West Hollywood those kind of things like gay bashing basically I didn't know that women face it that often Oh totally especially when you look like a little boy but they could tell you're a girl you know what I mean it was like yeah as a nightmare for me I was like I'm really lucky to be where I am today because really I should be dead so I really should be dead and so many aspects of my life I should just not be here so you went to a doctor and you had this idea in your head like look there's got to be a way yeah totally I had seen a documentary with a woman who changed to a man it was from Europe or something and I'm like how come nobody told me this is possible like nobody even therapist or psychologist or psychiatrist I feel like a man and she was like well you're just a very male identified female but she didn't even have the lingo to like come back me up you know what buck you can have a sex change like never did anybody say that to me so how do you find like if someone doesn't gender identify with being a male and they're you know but what do you do say if you're a man and you want to become a woman or a woman you want to become a man what's the steps now you fucking Google now then I had to go to a bookstore and find this old book and find a doctor in the back that was like for transgender for women for men becoming women they didn't even have anything for guys like me and I found this book I mean I was like determined to figure out how to do this and I called this doctor in Hollywood here and he's like well I never worked with a woman who wants to become a man but why don't you come in and he saved my life and he's like oh you'll be my guinea pig we'll figure out that's fascinating that there were so many women that came women from men but no that became men who yeah it's it's a new movement now there's a lot more happening but you did you kick-started no it's been happening but I think so you went to this doctor and then so he says you're gonna be his guinea pig yeah and how does he starts and he starts giving me very small doses of testosterone very you would laugh like right and then he just fought checks me out make sure everything's cool within six months he asked me after one cc of testosterone teaches me how to inject it myself and cease a whole C single CC a week every two weeks Jesus Christ that's a lot you think so yeah and then we just six months later he's like I want to teach you how to do it yourself so that you can go on with your life and what an amazing man really it was amazing he taught me and then I went on and it was like I was like reborn I was reborn like literally chained like physically and mentally changed my life do you get testosterone in Mexico yes now do you worried that it might be bullshit no no it's cooking oil or some use this system on right now so you like like cuz Mexican pharmaceutical drugs you can basically get whatever the fuck you want what I have or you want that's kind of cool no I'm not happy about the way Mexico like the drug war is chaos and it's it's really sad you see all the violence over there and it's very depressing however there's a certain amount of freedom that comes to having a shit government call the pharmacy and then they deliver it to your house for free they deliver itself Medicaid 21 years into it I completely know what I'm doing now it's not that I that's fascinating yeah I inject myself and my life just started to change and then I decided I needed to get my breasts removed even though they weren't big I needed to have a male chest I mean that was always my ultimate thing was to be able to take my shirt off I mean that's like such a guy thing going around with your shirt off and I found a doctor who never worked with a guy like me and he did it yeah I thought that was fascinating about Chaz Bono is that there was photographs of Chaz walking on the beach after she became Chaz and he has these big scars right under his breasts but because the fact that now he identifies as a man in regular publications that showing him topless right and I'm like that was really interesting yes because you really can't have a problem with it but if he was still a woman before the sex changed then it would be a real issue the same nipple I know it you're right on to it shows you how fucking stupid yeah well it's also the internet has really flipped the script on what we're used to seeing what we can see what we can accept I had never seen a man that had become a woman until you so on my message board I have a message board filled with freaks and savage and they fucking they knew about you back in the 90s my website has been around since 98 I mean I don't know when I was introduced to you on the website years and years but that you are just a like a new piece in this new vision of the world you know this new thing that exists that didn't exist when father knows best was on the air and you know the Twilight Zone was shocking what I mean about everything now is there's the the amount of information is so much larger this the scope of the canvas the size of the canvas of reality is so much larger and you're a part of that you're you're a part of that I think so well because really what it comes down to is my genitals and when I went to the world and said you know what I don't need to have a penis to be a man I just went to the world and said fuck you yeah I did well this is a really interesting photo of you that's on my message board I'm this there's a thread that someone put up about this particular conversation and it's you like lounging back completely naked smoking a cigar and it's like for half your body it's like the manliest shit possible this yoked up dude smoking a cigar with a beard covered in tattoos and there's a vagina it's like right it's like whoa yeah your your identity you know you love you know your idea of what a man is like is immediately challenged yes and then it's always like how do you feel about this because what what exactly you're seeing here you know what is this what what bothers you does it is this change your view of reality you know awesome I mean I I really feel honored to be able to do that to the world it is an honor in a way to like shock to really push the thought of what what is this yeah what is male and female and gay and straight what it what is you what are you right and what are the problems why why do they exist do they exist because someone is threatening you do they exist because you're threatened by it right is what what exactly is the issue what is your because now you have to look at yourself because you before looked at me like a man and I was sudden you see my vagina and you're like holy and mostly it's males because you know men are pretty pretty attached to their penis yeah I mean you know that understandably so but that that's just so now I'm saying to you don't have to have that to be a man it's really challenging your own identity in a way yeah it's it gets slippery but it's although the slippery thing is not even that that's a man - it's like what what is the controversy like not that he's unusual not that he's unique but what bothers people what gets them angry what is what it must get so much-- want to kill me I have to like have security sometimes when I go speak because oh yeah they tell me they're gonna kill me if I show up what kind of people can you imagine what kind of people Oh for example Yale University Yale University they were going to find they were said if you show up here we will kill you who said the students students and alumni and of course I had to report it I mean I didn't want to be like that bitch right I was like bring it on and then you know before like you better chill out dude you know no they might be there so I had a reporter to the people who brought me in and they had 24-hour security the whole time I was there well you always have to be worried about that one fucking we totally know yeah I never know you never know that's the broad spectrum but I deal with that all the time I don't deal with it as much as I used to I have to tell you that people have become much more understanding I'm much more supportive my fanbase has grown tremendously in the last I would say five years just crazy what do you attribute that to I think listening to me and seeing that I'm just like a normal guy it's not really a big deal and telling you how amazing my life is and then I'm a positive person and that all I want really is for people to be able to be themselves whatever that means do you think that it reflects the change in society as a whole clearly it has to be people are opening up their minds and understanding that yeah you know it manaphy so why am i angry about it right right I face that the progressive ideas are way more mainstream than they've ever been in the past way more and I think it's because of the internet because the open dialog the internet presents you realize like you know there's a lot of these people they don't they're not really much different than you or I this they're they're just like you or I there not evil there's nothing wrong with them they're just they're a different thing they're this you're that you know they like this kind of music you think it sucks but you like that kind of music and then but there's so many commonalities that we sort of inform each other of because the Internet you kind of go we'll meet a minute what's our real problem here like is it sexuality is it gender identification or are we just distracting ourselves with this nonsense well that's a very specific kind of person now because as you know I mean that was full of trolls for days and those ones really are the ones who react and do huge neg and continue to make it very negative on the internet yeah you know what I mean so of course we have the people like you and your fans and the people are willing to listen and talk about these kind of things but then we have the other side that's so incredibly hateful and and never wants this kind of thing to be accepted in the world yeah the trolls issue because really all it is a huge sea of unhappy people saying shitty mean things oh they're crazy yeah they're great those are the ones that say I'm going to kill you yeah of course I have no life well they're sitting at home moulton again most of them don't mean a word they're saying no I always say that totally but there's a few that might there's a few broken ones yeah you know and you you have to protect yourself in those situations yeah you have windows after you you must I'm a friendly guy you are but so am I they don't even know what I have I'm in the funk the whole time I think that the angry thing is also because of the lack of real interaction because the fact they're able to do it over the Internet there's no there's no like social repercussions right when you look at someone you say something mean like you have to be a psychopath if someone's never done anything to you and you look at them you say something mean and you see them react and you see it hurt their feelings it doesn't bother you you you or your broken person your sociopath there's something wrong with you but when you do it on the internet it's like you can just let go just say something shitty yeah you're removed yeah I mean you're completely removed from it yeah the lack of but I think that this is temporary I really think this is like this crazy chaos before the Age of Enlightenment I mean I'm and I'm a big believer in progress and I'm a big believer in utopia utopian ideas to the point where it's unrealistic like I have some pretty unrealistic views of the possibilities of humanity but those are important views to have because I'm very much the same way I believe that if we have I'm a believer of energy's first off if I give off positive energy I only have that positive energy back I agree I think that's huge if you give if I came into this room right now with a attitude that was not like cool no it's just sitting here waiting for you to talk shit to me me and you were gonna have not as good as a situation going on between us I don't think right now I think it would be much because I'm coming in with that energy yeah that negative go ahead and say it to me dude energy which a lot of people in my situation tend to have because they don't understand that you have dinner people do not understand us and when I can't when I come to explain to you the situation I have to understand that you don't get it and you already have a preconceived notion about it and you're already judging me and that's okay it's because you don't get it so I have to come to it with an understanding of that and an understanding that I need to now teach you and the best way to teach somebody is to be happy about it and to let you have your feelings and then hopefully I can win you over with the fact that I'm just a happy dude and it's bright and you can say things to me it doesn't hurt me because it's you don't understand right they're not going to define you they're gonna change who you are with their words but if I'm angry at you and you're calling me like a freak or dude that's totally freaky and weird no I understand that you think it's freaking weird cuz it kind of is freaking weird right I totally get it I'm not I'm not totally out of bounds with that I completely understand that the man with the pussy is kind of weird and funny well you know the anger thing where people want to kill you and the troll thing whether they're hating and I think all that is just misuse potential that's what I think I think the human mind is incredibly complex but it doesn't come with an instruction manual it doesn't come with a you imagine if the human body was a vehicle that you had to learn how to use and how long you'd have to go to school before they would give you a license to operate a human body I mean Jesus Christ if you were an inferior being if you were something that existed in thought only and the only way to manifest yourself in the real world was get a license to use a body you know if the the human body was just like like a car you you Jesus Christ you have to learn loss you have to learn you have to like well we have to find out how you're going to interact with the other humans right so you got to understand cause and effect you got to understand action reaction you got to understand the powerful benefits of positive energy you got to understand love you got to understand in security you got to understand jealousy you got to understand all these waters that need to be navigated before we let you in the stream of humanity right and we don't we just fucking take these all this potential and just go get out of the fucking house and we push them out into the river and I think that's why a lot of those self-help books are people who teach those way of thinking pots are so huge because really and I think people want to learn to be like that really an underlying part of it people want to learn how to be calm and happy and how does that person have that energy yeah how do I get that it's turned to be a big benefit of this podcast that's one of the big benefits that people always cite is that they have a chance to see a perspective other than the one they've been told is the one that's supposed to follow right and then also know like oh yeah like oh I don't have to be a dick oh I can like take personal responsibility I can be nice to be boys can look at this as some sort of a weird temporary situation and the best-case scenario is you have as many friends and loved ones and you share great moments during this time period that you're conscious and that's a huge thing that you're doing really because you're changing the way you're changing that way and that way people think and then those people go to other people yes and then they say the same thing so you're sort of like moving that positive energy along that totally long line of people and it's yeah and it's only positive possible for me because I've got those ideas and that vibe and those those good thoughts from other people online exactly and it spreads and you just got to learn what to focus on and what not to and if you if I wanted to go online and just pay attention to all the people who are trolling I I can run my head through a wall I would if I only concentrated on them and exactly everywhere if you have any sort of an internet presence whatsoever or say anything controversial which I have both you're gonna have a massive amount of people that want to just push your button complain 8:00 and just just potential they're just potential that's a misused almost universally because there's some people that disagree with me on a bunch of different ideas and there's that's totally cool and it's totally what I mean and I expect it of course and it's and like one of the things that I always make sure the the point out in most situations there's not a right or wrong in most situations there's you think this and I may agree with you but I might disagree with you and neither one of us is right right it's just this is my perspective and this is your perspective and when people start approaching things like that then you can kind of learn from other people's points of view right you go I see why he thinks it sucks because of this or I see why he loves that because of that right but the the real problem is is when people want you to feel how they feel right they feel like shit they're hurting they they're hateful they're they're they're just a mess and they just want to just throw up shit all over you and just turn your life and the same kind of shit that they have no I totally get that and I get a lot of those haters to court and they turn my words around and they say buck said this about trans women should do this never said that read the interview but y'all had to learn how to block them because I did it I'll be honest I did take it personally at one time okay I totally like and then I was like okay well wait a minute it's not me it's not my agenda it's their agenda it's not about what I do and so then I just had to learn to completely remove myself from their situation I always say that people like that are like snake venom you know you get a little bit of in your system and then you get immune and then when the snake bites you you don't die right you know you go oh I know what you're doing exactly a snake poison you totally get it it's really just like that and it's both on the side of the assholes but also on the side of the progressives I see progressives going after he other with snake venom you know accusing each other of crazy because what you said before it's there your you want to put your agenda on someone else and they have to if they don't get it and if they're not on board with you then they're the bad person yeah I don't understand people who don't understand what you just said you have an opinion about it and I have an opinion about it and it's totally cool I respect your opinion and you respect my opinion and then why can't we just leave it at that there's a lot of people that use the vehicle of discourse to try to hurt other people's opinions hurt other people's feelings and to score points they're like shit on people to score for themselves and I see it a lot and I'm not talking about someone making fun or using humor or like a Kanye West Jimmy Kimmel type situation which is totally warranted and I think in Jimmy Kimmel's defense he's doing Kanye West a favor needs to see how fucking ridiculous he looks yeah because he's not being cool about is totally he's he was being completely uncool in that interview and even less cool afterwards right it reaffirmed why Jimmy Kimmel should have done exactly so I'm not talking about that but I get so disturbed when I go online and people who are whether whether they're feminists or whether they're skeptics or atheist attacking each other attacking people in the community like coming out with reasons why this person's our rapist because he had sex with someone when they were drunk right and everyone it does that's a rapist and they're also taking this weird moral high ground when they do that they're getting brownie points right is getting social brownie points while they're doing it right you see it it's it's it's transparent and disgusting and it works it works it totally works you see it you see them like people praising them thank you so much for that's why they do it exactly it's exactly why they do its little Josie Myers is you know this whole thing with Michael Shermer no it's fascinating shit he's accusing this guy who's very famous skeptic Michael Shermer of not even rape the woman saying that Michael Shermer put her in a position where she could not have conceived not consent and was very ambiguous the the assumption is she was drunk okay because he uses as corroborating evidence another woman's tale where she met him at a party and he made sure her glass was always full and she got drunker than she normally okay and she's literally using this to corroborate what he said meaning that he got her drunk like completely removing herself from any personal responsibility from actually drinking being an adult and getting drunk and somehow or another like corroborating the the story of the other person that he got her into a position where she couldn't consent it's weird sort of there's this weird sort of feminist skeptic language they use like these privileged a lot yeah that's the new language dude privilege is a weird one right revel is aware when I had to really learn that I get checked on that all the time dude I'm a now a privileged white man you checked on that all the male privilege white yeah and they use it to defuse your argument oh yes they use it to defuse your viewpoint they use it to in it's it's this weird fucking so are they saying he has a male white privilege yes and that that you discount the fact she doesn't have to take any responsibility whatsoever yeah I'm gonna I have to tell you that I disagree with well everyone who you have so now people talk shit about me for days on the internet and definitely fun care because the situation is this it takes two fucking people yeah it does well the so what they've taken they've taken a hard stance the other way saying that everyone who has sex with anyone who's drunk is raping them include including women who have sex with drunk men if you have sex with a drug arrest oh man you're raping the man yes no man would ever admit that it's so preposterous and it's so gross because it's a bunch of social retards that's the reality the reality is its social retail yes and there first of all you're ignoring the broad spectrum of alcoholic and eBay exactly there's tipsy and then there's fucking unconscious unconscious that's rape just before wise enough three quarters before unconscious halfway down conscious pretty much rape I mean it gets it gets less rapey as you get more sober but the reality of you know I'm not laughing about rape I just want everybody know but it is true I mean I think the genius of the feminine agenda in this respect is almost like a it's almost a side effect and that genius is it forces the conversation because which is important it is important yes and people who get people fucked up and do things to the body fucking assholes whether it's a man or whether it's a woman hair yes and I think that there's there's a good in that that this argument yes discussed but I don't buy the delivery man I don't buy that PZ Myers guy I think he's a creeper he and I think what the way he released that information with that first of all he's supposed to be a skeptic and the word skeptic if you're a skeptic if you understand that the worst piece of evidence that you can possibly receive right it's personal experience right someone telling you what happened right you don't know what they're saying you don't know how much of what they're sayin only that he didn't even get it secondhand didn't get it from the person he got it secondhand Wow he got it from another person who told him so it's nonsense now it's getting totally blown out yeah Oh totally blown it yeah totally this is why I could prove he's a creeper Jamie pull this up pull up PZ Myers isn't a feminist there's a video of him at this conference making all this jokes with this woman saying that she's gonna she would have to have sex with him if she got these this card game wrong she got the wrong card it's so gross and so transparent that I kind of love when you find a jewel like this right because you get to see well oh this is a social retard sucked with women his whole lives and now he's in this position of power being a professor so he decides that he's a male feminist and so they say that yes he is and so he bathes in the warm milk of the adulation of all the people that are super progressive to go along with him yet he stifles dissent in a very radical way in its forums if you disagree even if you disagree in a very polite and civil way with him outing this Michael Shermer guys suppose it rapist for having sex with an intoxicated woman even if you disagree in a civil way he bans you from the forum well in he's an idiot because now he's not open for discussion and it's all about him and his idea massive censorship so wait so he outed the guy who raped the girl well he outed the guy who he says was told had sex with a woman who could not consent no one ever says rape but he used the word rape liberally after that and it's it's a weird thing he doesn't say the guys are rapists but in other posts I talk about rape and that is rape and having sex with someone who's intoxicated rape but that the the broad black the black and white scale of that yes so that's also why are you responsible when you drive but you're not responsible when you fuck right no that's a great point man you don't know that you're too drunk to fart right you don't get yourself in that position and I'm not saying rape is okay again I need to yeah I need to say that right but what is wrong actually a lot of times women put themselves in these weird and I'm not saying they should be raped but really the world is fucked up you're getting drunk in a situation that could turn bad is not a smart choice yeah but I don't think you should ever blame the woman I'm not lighting away I don't even want to think that way because they have to be as a woman here too yes I'm telling you you I'm telling you I can say that because I used to be a woman you cannot put yourself in that situation I'm totally on the same page with you however I don't think that it's not okay to rape so I know it's a double I'm kind of saying something really kind of roundabout but really be conscious of these things yes don't put yourself in an environment it's almost unrelated to this this guy there's no excuse if he did fuck get someone fucked up and do something to their body there's no excuse for that right whether or not this woman shouldn't have been there because she should have known better it doesn't matter but we don't know what who don't know what happened exactly we don't know what happened just call yourself a skeptic yes and to put that's not a skeptic not what they're doing what they're doing is getting social brownie points yes they are bathing and the warm glow of the adulation of their father that's the thing is you can't say anything anymore without people taking it and saying you're saying one thing did you find that video plate plate Elizabeth this is fascinating put it up so we could see it this is the guy this is the guy with the beard who apparently is a very brilliant man and a professor biology at University listen us she made me keep my clothes on Jesus let it yeah I this is where this this video some guys anointed him for all these different things get off my stage I got work to do so he's just joking around here everything's cool you know just being silly with someone now this is him dealing with this other woman some card thing they're doing okay you right there purple shirt yes you'll do so he does not know more very clearly does not know her pulling her out of the audience I don't know what that says we can't see it because we're thing turns on the charm okay of course there could also be higher stakes we could say you know for instance if I win this hand I get to kill and eat you they're playing or at the plane cards here another thing is you know if you win the hand okay he's just joking around I guess but it's very awkward imagine if that was your wife okay okay the brush-off well sorta it says no take the cards with you I'm I got to call you back for the sex part later so hang on okay okay let's just we don't need to play the rest of it but that guy needs to shut the fuck up I'm like my brain is kind of getting yeah it affirms what I would my suspicions were my suspicions were social retard right and that is that's the those are the words of a social retard yeah that's an awkward person tries to make a joke about having sex with the woman yeah if there was a feminist yes exactly if that was your wife or girlfriend and he did that you would be horrified anyways I don't care if it was my wife or a girlfriend he he's not a feminist you don't talk like that as a feminist first off that's just really inappropriate behavior he's a hypocrite oh no clearly and but but what I was saying before was that even people in the progressive movement do shitty douchey things like that like this guy with this Michael Sherman thing right it's this it's it all comes from the same place it doesn't come from a place of love it doesn't come from a place of peace now even in reaching out to try to supposedly elevate those who are in trouble or who are depressed or who are or repressed or who are who were shit on by society you are doing it to prop yourself up a and to hurt someone else B yeah you're not doing it in a loving way no way that's an agenda clearly an agenda and he found his found his people that he could totally work his agenda to exact fucking dangerous and that's just it just like religion yeah we were talking about earlier today it's the same thing it's coming from a place of fear it's coming from a place of control it's the same goddamn thing and control it's super obvious when you see the fucking suppression of free speech that he puts on his own blogs the fact that on his own blogs he censors anybody that disagrees even if they disagree sell a piece of shit like he doesn't even know what he's doing and that's the thing is with communities a lot of times they censor our speech and they tell us we can't say and I'm using myself as an example here I'm not allowed to say certain things because they don't reflect our community problem but I'm like but I'm a person first and it is the way I believe and I think it is important for me to speak my mind about certain things we all can't think the same way like we talked about earlier we all have different ways we think things should be or things and it's only from my own personal experience but within my specific community I'm not allowed to say certain words or react to certain things I'm not like well I think for a lot of folks that do feel marginalized or have been marginalized like they've fucking they've hit that like the guy from network I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take many more it's like these are the parameters this is what we'll accept this is what we won't accept in that way I understand I do but I'm telling you right now I wouldn't be where I am right now if I had that anger I wouldn't be because you wouldn't get in the wouldn't get in the doors people wouldn't want to listen to me because I was wrong and I really have to tell you a lot of the communities are really angry and they alienate people like myself I want to further our acceptance in the world obviously I want to yeah but because I don't use the same way driving angry force then I'm the bad person I'm actually not for that and I don't believe in that I believe like I said earlier really getting people to understand you have to educate the people who don't understand that and this is that funny that like what we're talking about earlier like weird acronyms that people you write and and categories that are very specific and then language like privilege that gets used almost as it's like you know like you let them know you're speaking the lingo you sort of Noam Chomsky actually addressed this because he's a linguist right and he was talking about how they're sort of pretending like in like a lot of radical progressives pretending that this is almost scientific because they hear quantum theorists talk and this like really strange ethereal language that no one really understands so they sort of use the same kind of jargon in regards to psychology and sociology in regards to like progressive exactly and so they're not trying to be understood they're trying to be outside of the realm of understanding so that you can't question them but you are going to question them but they in their mind you can't you don't even get it it's lbgtq dari and I don't use it so like I don't know if you know what cisgender it is no what does it mean I heard that I don't know basically a biological pert like you were born in the body that you have chosen to be in what is system for so sis you have to look it up on the Internet I don't use it and I'll tell you why it's gender CIS yeah so I don't use it so it's fine they use it I use it because I want to educate now I have to educate you on cisgendered when I just used the word biological you get biological do you not yes right that's better that's better cisgender in Wikipedia according to Wikipedia oftens really abbreviated to simply sis described related types of gender identity where an individual self perception of their gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth so meaning biological biological yeah but they felt a need and I'm not being a rude or disrespectful but if they felt a need to make their own word yeah because you have you as a biological person or the straight world has made have made words for us so it's sort of like we now have our own word for you so I'm like that's cool go right ahead but that's not you know for me I need to educate you and if I keep getting watered down you lose you lose it no do you know about the case where there was a man who became a female and started MMA fighting my friend she's your friend of course what do you think about that situation what do you think about the first of all the fact that she didn't tell people that she used to be a man right and gun it and again it and fought a bunch of women and out of them I get it and then now that she wants to compete as a woman well okay I she's a woman to me she's a woman she completely change Enif eyes as a woman she identifies as a woman well again we're gonna come back to what makes you a man in a woman right now with fighting with fighting it's not my profession it's not my thing I don't but she wrote me so can I show you what she wrote me sure and I want you to read it sure that you can see what she said because of course I knew you were gonna bring this up and I think it's very important that you get it from her okay because for me I can't speak for her because she's a trans woman I'm a trans man well you can't I think for her because it's not you and also it's not me and also I I'm not I'm not versed enough in that world of this of that sport so I can't tell you what the rules but if you're just gonna ask me generally what I feel about it I do feel that she has a woman and I do feel that she has the right to fight as a woman it's like saying that I can't use the men's restroom because I'm not really a man well why don't you read what she had to say for you because I think it is super important that I think it's a completely valid argument a hundred and ten percent don't get me wrong but I have any service in here what a bummer powerful ett your agency no I have team although because I have how dare you I was unlocked phones if you step outside that door that you can go oh yeah yeah yeah we have it yeah Jamie can you give him password so I want let me since while you're looking for while we're here's to issues with it one that I have is the mail frame the mechanics of the mail frame it is different ok you know it's different like if you a person who has large man hands and man shoulders that doesn't go away if you take estrogen and the mechanics of the mail frame or a significant advantage there's also a significant advantage in reaction speed that men enjoy 10% it's a massive amount that's across the board pretty much when athletes there's a massive reaction time difference between men and females there's also learning the skills as a man being up to 30 years of being a man and then becoming a woman these are all completely unfair advantages that a man would have entering into female combat sports but your so every man is the same no mati I'm not saying that ok what I'm also I we will go into that but here's the big one the big one is she didn't say that she's to be a man she never told everyone no not until it came out and then when it came out the last fight was sanctioned as her being a trans woman but the fights before that her opponents I've spoken to them they were furious they were upset and they were told that they were bigots by people online they were attacked this one girl who emailed me and thanked me she was telling me that she was getting attacked left and right by so-called progressives because they were calling her a bigot because a trans woman that she didn't know used to be a man fought her and she was pissed off about it because the guy rag-dolled her well I mean there's so much more involved in this you know that right it's not black and white like anything I'm talking nothing is black and white it's just not it's not and I shouldn't say the guys shouldn't she rag-dolled her she she beat the shit out of them like a guy would be the shit out of women it's it's hard to watch because if you watch the physical advantages that she has over these women she's not that good I know what when I look at someone who's good texture professional I totally I understand what I'm seeing as someone ragdoll people I'm seeing her smashed these girls and you think it's because of her frame look at my hands suicides in my hands yeah no matter how many female hormones that we still have look at my hands our hands that's a massive advantage there's a massive advantage in the shape of the hips there's a massive advantage in the width of the shoulders like there's my illogical women that are her size right there are there are a few but it's still not exactly the same this to the mechanical advantages of the male by still exist if you have a man and a woman and they're the same way and they're the same sort of muscularity there's still a difference in the frame this is difference in the shape of the hips there's a difference in carries right the reaction time - my frame is still female yeah I totally understand that but that said I think I think you have to realize that because again I think it's important there are variables though and there's there's Serena Williams who's like this alpha female totally and then there's girls who like there's a woman who's fighting on the Ultimate Fighter right now is a very skilled Roxane modifier she's but she's very feminine she's very feminine have that fast-twitch explosive muscle fiber that you know some women have more fallen lost a lot of that when she started to take anything she doesn't have the testosterone in her body I am down with almost everything except combat sports the reason being is that the combat sports because of the frame the hands the mechanical advantage the reaction time and the consequences your physical health the consequences of fighting you're getting hurt badly and if there's an unfair advantage and that person uses that unfair advantage whether it's taking steroids and cheating by Kate or taking blood enhancers like EPO those are all illegal because they change the field now there are people that are born with more testosterone it's a natural advantage you can choose to and not to fight them right but in this situation we're not dealing with we're dealing with a man-made variable and I think it needs to be a addressed before you ever fight for sure and I think fighting for x or however many times she fought in secret like that as a trans woman is very dangerous try understand your point I completely do I completely do and it's a very difficult like I'm saying very difficult I'm I know as a trans person I guess for me yeah okay so I'm gonna give you the example of this let's say I was gonna go home with somebody and have sex with them okay I'm a huge huge advocate for disclosure so I'm not gonna if we're just date we're like hanging out in the barn drinking I don't need to tell you that I'm a man with a pussy right but let's say we're gonna go home and fuck right I need to tell you right now dude you see you're not gonna get a cock right now you're gonna get a pussy right and like that is so important to me that people understand that you cannot put that other person in that position you know what I'm saying like you cannot put somebody in a position of uncomfortability when you bring them home and they think one thing and you do another so what gets big on disclosure good for you um I think I don't I can't speak for this woman but I think in her case she wanted to be a woman and then exactly a woman had to make that choice in her own mind what was more important and would people how did people find out somebody told on really got in trouble yeah but she's legally a female is she not know well some commissions will accept that and you know it was changed she's legally a female I don't know if that happened with her or whatever I don't know I think you still it's a medical thing a disclosure thing I think in some athletic commissions being a trans woman is a medical disclosure saying so let's say I were to go start fighting MMA yeah what I have to disclose that I was at rant that I'm a trans man yeah I think you probably would I would imagine it depends on the Commission because I I understand I don't think people are gonna make a big deal out of it as me going in right no then as a woman I think it's totally different for trans women I'm telling you they have to deal with this all across the board for the restroom but if that's forgotten with the advantage we just discussed like your small hands right and my giant right exactly if I just became a woman and we had a cage fight right I would I would have a big advantage just right just because of the frame of your friend that's a big advantage I know it's an advantage I know as a martial arts expert my whole life right what what how much that plays a factor plays a big factor so it's oh yeah I know it's it's a it's a fascinating discussion and of course I I do understand both saw I do don't don't get me wrong yeah read her statement I've been taking estrogen for around ten years now I had my GRS sex reassignment six years ago after GRS MTFs male to females have a lower testosterone count than even cisgendered females this is regardless of if we take estrogen or not it's harder for me to keep off fat it affects my cardio my bone density in decreased female range at first he you said muscles would be stronger but he backtracked from that when he found out he was wrong did you say that no he said my bone density was a theme in female range he backtracked from that okay he found out he found that out what he had been left with his bone structure which he just said to me that's what I last heard him clinging on to he was trunk don't she's obviously upset about it because you know she she just anyway he was trying to say that I have a great advantage because of my reach but my reach is great I was only one inch longer and reach on my last opponent my next opponent is taller than me by about one and a half know by one and a half yeah is it one or half or eleven and a half inches it's likely that her reach is longer or same as mine so she so that shoots that out of the sky her name is Ashlee evans-smith wait sir no sir okay so then she had me search this video right here with the last this woman my last opponent thought was Veronica Rothen Hauser she is about six feet she knocked out my ash Lee the girl I'm about to fight in five seconds there was like a five-second knock out it was the quickest knockout in women's MMA history her bone structure is greater than like 90% of the fighter female fighters out there yet nobody is complaining about it the key thing is they will probably bring up safety the safety of female fighters if safety is the issue then why not bar cisgendered females over 511 or have reach restriction okay first of all there's a lot of stuff going a bullshit there at first I never said anything about inconsequential you will be way in you know it certainly helps to have a long reach but you know it also helps be shorter and stockier if you use certain techniques right use some more Paul Harris right here's the thing about bone density okay estrogen is what actually causes bone density right causes bone growth it's not testosterone then convert testosterone peripherally to estrogen this is all coming from a doctor who responded as dr. Ramona Kreutz it MD and as my friend Steph Steph Daniels aka Crooklyn put this article on Bloody Elbow which is an MMA website about this where the this doctor was detailing advantages that a male to female transgender would have okay because the information that is available online is very biased in a lot of ways and the information is coming from people that are supporting transgender women competing against against sis women as you will so so here you have a man who is on a hormonal blockers to block testosterone but it's now taking estrogen which is going to prevent osteoporosis osteopenia right so there wouldn't be a great percentage of bone density loss per se males have a higher bone density and higher massive skeletons than females and it takes a long time for that to diminish typically you're looking at fifteen years after androgens such suppression and SRS to really start to see significant changes in bone density so right there this doctor saying that she has a male bone structure so we have to cite his research on that somehow yeah right you're right but what we should but we are showing at least is one person who's an expert in the field a board-certified injure technologist who's telling you that no you this is not true and that this bone density issue it takes more than 15 15 years and it's a significant advantage that he would enjoy our male to female would enjoy once she became a she right over other sis females her testosterone levels are more than likely in the normal female range since adrenals are the primary source for it now without seeing her labs it's hard to say for certain how are they maintaining her levels are they keeping them at a very high end or the low end right and are her normal ranges for those value there are huge normal ranges for those values right so it's since you're dealing with endogenous or exogenous that we say how do you say when it's a artificial hormones that you in your system whatever your your engineering your hormone levels instead of letting your endocrine system do that right so it's very debatable like how what it's telling what are the levels and and how how would how come nobody asked for her levels have they they do especially now yeah she developed fully into a male with the normal musculature and bone structure she didn't undergo hormone therapy and surgery until she was fully developed as compared to someone who completes therapy and surgery in their adolescence and or early adulthood men are completely developed by the age of 22 and she didn't start a therapy until several years later than that right so there's also other things that she goes over and different reasons several different and we don't have to continue going into it but it's a very difficult because of course I'm coming to it from I'm a man so I should be treated like a man whether you like it or not but you're also coming to it as someone who's supporting transgender and supporting the idea of gender in my life yes right so it's like of course I have to understand that you know I I personally don't understand why she didn't disclose because I would have so I don't I think probably for the same reason why she was deceptive in that letter that she wrote to you about the things that I said I didn't say the thing that I didn't just about bone structure writing I think she has a higher bone structure than female right I didn't disagree about the strength of her muscles I don't know what she's I look at her she's that's a big woman it's a big strong woman and she man handles girls in the case she beats the shit out of them right and when I found out that she used to be a man I go well that's what I'm seeing that's what I'm seeing I'm seeing I'm seeing a ridiculous strength advantage right and the others girls are strong as shit no doubt and there's probably girls that could beat her ass no doubt there's girls like cyborg that you know shit a lot of guys wouldn't want to fuck with their professional fighters would want to fuck with cyborg right but then there's also that cyborg got popped doing steroids or so you know she actually inserted some mail or her own system right my point is if you do want to do something like this first of all a disclosure is fucking huge and B you need to be tested and you need to be tested like across the board on everything you can't just be saying I have low bone density and saying I have low testosterone we need to know what the fuck is really going on right and and it has to be disclosed if people want to compete against you and I'm sure cyborg would have no problem beating the shit out of that check well the thing is I think Fallon comes to it with no she's like the first person to ever do this so there's a lot of stuff going on there right so you know it is it is it's a very touchy situation because me she just feels like a woman so she feels like I'm a woman I don't need to discuss this right but she started fighting asthma but now it's different I tell you obviously it's out in the open people know about it she has a huge opportunity right now to actually open it up for lots more transgender fighters and figure out how we can change it how do we change this so it's cool for you to fight and everybody feels cool about it right yeah how do we do that now that's a real good question yeah well least now it's out in the open so now I have no problem with anybody who chooses to compete against right now just I don't have to compete against men but that's awesome that you just said that that's like huge for trans people but for you to say I don't have a problem with it but how do we do it then it's fair because Sports is all about fair it is it's all about their ID okay what's not but this is not just a regular sport this is the sport puts your health right I understand that sir realities she's giving these girls concussions yes and the the reality of combat sports is not like losing a soccer game it's a totally different sport and again it that's why I get so adamant about right the reason why she's so defensive about it is she's got to realize that she hurt those girls she knows that she actually physically locked them up fucked four or five of them up in the first round and on the first yes real quick beat downs brutal beat downs she didn't take any damage at all in those fights she was one fight which one girl hit her with a couple of punches boxing just did pretty good and she's got her on the ground and put her fucking ain't getting any credit for oh I'm giving you credit for her fighting skills though there okay yeah I know what good fighting skills our client and she's a decent competitor so you're saying basically that's all come she's manhandling them that comes from manhandling it doesn't come from her that's what I'm seeing what I'm seeing is a huge strength advantage I'm not and that happens with men and that happens with women too there's women that can fucking ragdoll chicks and kick their ass Oh sis women as you were wear it I get that but but that's natural when you're your engineering it of course people are gonna be upset when your engineering and designing your especially when you listen to this doctor say it takes 15 fucking years before there's any change at all and that you will have the bone density of a man I'm this is a board-certified endocrinologist who has no stake in the game not someone who's a gender reassignment doctor which is what I've read all across the board positive in defense of this it's all been people who are working in that industry yeah all them people who who have a vested interest in supporting the idea that transgender female has no advantages of course they do but you can't that's fucked up and your I agree with you on that it's about facts yes you have to always look at the facts and if you have actual medical stuff there that says that this person has an advantage over that week you cannot ignore it it's not being anti transgender it's not do you know who the the you know in renee Richards is yeah for folks who don't know renee Richards was you know basically just a regular tennis player right not that good as a man became a woman who kicked and was a mother fucker okay she was so good this is way back in the day women trans women had a massive head start on people like you she was actually barred from playing as a woman in the US Open in 1976 76 unless she submitted to chromosomal testing right she sued the United States Tennis Association in 77 she won the right to play as a woman without submitting to any testing and she played between 77 and 81 she was ranked as high as 20th overall and her highest ranking was the end of her last year in 77 was 20 second she was a twentieth and twenty seconds pretty fucking good I mean it's linear yeah she dominated bitches but you know what like we got a breakthrough shit dude we got a breakthrough shit but no we're on barrage listen she wasn't fucking hurting anybody right I see your point I totally got your point my it's valid my anger about it my my distrust in there's a several one the lack of disclosure initially right two in reading her very thing where she's deceptive in her email and she says a bunch of things that I didn't say right that's that that shows me the way her mind works that's a problem that's not a good representative of a trans woman right and then there's also the issue of what the sport entails it entails doing violence as quickly as possible that one tenth of a second advantage in reaction time is goddamn gigant right sure it's goddamn gigantic and you know there needs to be studies done as to whether you become a transgender woman when does that advice or where exactly does it ever go is it imprinted right because the issue of imprinting skills as a man and then transitioning to a transgender woman huh there's this is not a cut and dry issue there's no it's very very complex issue but what's important is it has nothing to do with heart and love and there's nothing to do with being nice to people there's nothing to do my thing mom coming from it purely as a a martial arts expert and be a defender of real women a defender of real women who gets stuck in a situation where someone might have a real fucking mechanical physical bone structure advantage bone density advantage testosterone event is a lot of variables that could really lead to them getting concussed well not real and it's this gender when I'm by the way I remember okay uses real women freaks people out just to let you know I'm here but really what it comes down to I think is safety let's get us to the real issue very unsafe in a sport that you could kill somebody yes and so that is a valid that is a valid point I think coming from you and I'm not saying that I say it's right you what you're saying or it's wrong what you're saying I think it's valid what you're saying and I think we need to figure out how to make this work for everybody is it possible I don't know I have the reach make a difference it's not a reach she said that shit it's the upper bone to see they could be the same height the same it doesn't matter because you're weighing in right what about the pot it's all about the punch the contact it's about the mechanical structure of the mail frame it's about the the advantage in reaction time it's about the imprinting of skills as a male for you know 20-plus years and then transitioning to a female there's a lot of issues but what what is huge for me to relay is that I am very sensitive to whatever anyone's gender identity is yeah and I make no judgments on that if it had nothing to do with sport and especially my sport of martial arts and where I'm an expert right I understand I've taught it I know I've done it my whole life I understand the advantages and they're giant you know I've trained with world champion women right you know and you you could tell the difference she's a world champion man in a world champion women I'm sure if they're really high level there's just a freak advantage that a man has right and it doesn't go away that easy man it just does it right and some women can counteract that like a woman like Ronda Rousey she's as woman as you again she'll fuck man up right legit you know like world champion man she can armbar that she's legit but it doesn't mean that it's it's okay people I'm trying to make a political statement at this point it's a political statement clearly which is not actually a fair to do in a sport that could kill someone and what's fucked is I support the political statements I of course you do that's I know that about that's what's really fun your fucking show dude you're very cool with shit like that but I can't support that I can't support that because this women are gonna fuck I mean that's they are not all of them yeah everyone's getting fucked up anyway you know not all of them obviously but do I've Reese okay so I was question to every single one of the cisgender women fighters have a problem with fallen a huge percentage I don't know if everyone I couldn't I haven't spoke to every one of them but I've spoke to several and I was in private who don't even want to discuss it all right who with a chain of expletives fuck that and one of the things that they always use is man hands they use the size of hands if you have a ball-peen hammer and a big nail it's really hard to drive that nail in if you had a fucking sledgehammer right in the same size nail you boom and it goes right in there's a weight advantage to the size of a hand that makes a big difference but she was always Jenner did it be she's not I know but that's the problem the problem is she's not getting re a George Foreman if you gave George Foreman female hormones and put him in a dress man he would fuck up every woman on the planet his hands like don't change your date and your hands don't change your jaw which is your ability to take a punch but I mean changing from male to okay right you're right yeah well you're with your man with a beard that's you know and when in expressing something whether it's on a podcast or expressing something in a tweet or a blog something the full ideas sometimes always don't get across you know and I've been accused across the board about this of being transphobic transphobic you're not actually well I think it's really it's it's it's normal its natural for someone who immediately point the finger and say that yes but it's not fair to the subject because the subject is very intense but you're not transpose I'm not I say it on air right yeah you're not transphobic well I'm not anything phobic yeah you're not racist I'm not a you're not homophobic I'm but but I'll call people on their shit that's totally different yeah and I do the same thing it's completely different well I like I said I'm friends with one of the girls that she fought this this gendered female got the fuck beat out of her and you know she was like Jesus Christ I'm getting manhandled here I mean that's how she described it she didn't even feel like it was ragdoll fight scrags or rag dolls when you just like fucking look just pull it across yeah somebody right when someone gets ragdoll means that you know like if you fight five.hoorah Klausner I get rag-dolled right you just watch ass yeah I mean and I'm not saying that the difference between her and if you know it's probably far less than me and Brock Lesnar he probably ragdoll me easier than shoes rag dolling these women who write in her same weight class but there's an advantage and it needs to be discussed and it needs to be something that's fully explored and maybe she's the pioneer of this session gracious and maybe they you know we'll figure out a way to add something that alleviates a certain amount of bone density maybe they'll figure out how to do something that changes the mechanical advantage that a man has maybe we have to understand that she has to fight the people that want to fight her oh yeah I don't want to fight her they have that they have that option right now to say yeah I want a fighter or I don't want to fight her and then we have to figure out how that's gonna play into this situation and you know what there also can be a transgender Division I know that's very transgender women there's plenty of transphobia yes that's a great idea that's a super awesome bad idea that leaves no controversy at all I don't think anybody would have a problem with an answer now you wouldn't hear a peep out of me I would have no problem with now because it's a fair fight now yes exactly and I don't think you know I don't think there's anything wrong with the idea if it's vetted out and found to be 100% safe right but I have looked at it objectively I've looked at the research and I've been told by all these progressive people that are like you know hey there's real science been done on this I looked at that real science and it's horseshit there's no there's not real science it's it's real science that's set up to give confirmation bias to the idea that as soon as if someone is attains sexual reassignment surgery then they're immediately they not just identifies that sex but are that sex right physiologic right and it's simply not true it's not true I'll be the first to tell you that I have female frame still you cannot change your DNA what's that is there my frame is still female it is I can put as much bulk as I want to put on my body I still have and you know when I used to be a lot bigger I was like all getting into the whole bodybuilding thing and then all I I hurt all the time my little frame underneath it's like fuck you what is that what's the heaviest you ever got I got 185 and I was just like my shoulders were like this I had no neck dude I was like all oh and I was like I'm over this shit man and I travel like mad so I couldn't go to the gym all the time I'm a eating sock and so like I wasn't comfortable my frame underneath my woman frame was going you fucking baby how much did you weigh as a woman oh I was small dude I was a hundred and ten put on 75 or tons of mustard on there think of 75 steaks when you look at it that way it's pretty gross that's a lot of meat Rose what do you weigh now not I weigh about 160 you feel like that's like oh I'm at my way 25 pounds yeah what were you doing you know a lot of powerlifting yeah totally just wasted like every kind of heavy weight you could imagine yeah dead lives like bench fret like all of them big heavy weight that I'm sure changed your frame a little bit you think yeah not just your bone structure - I bet that made your bone structure a lot denser but that's also record a lot of what how your head got thicker oh my gosh my nose grew powerlifting and especially powerlifting under the influence of testosterone hey that's that's a big one for just everything denser they say a certain amount of it is actually really important for old people to avoid loss of bone density men and women I believe that totally yeah those powerlifting movements like deadlifts and I think they're awesome I still do that but more like CrossFit gone away not so much like that going to the gym right right right well CrossFit II they get a little wacky - now they're telling those bananas yeah I have a buddy he's got a blown back now from CrossFit I was trying to warn them you know it's like chill out my trainer says that when you do all those reps with those powerless eyes it's kind of dangerous you think the WOD totally in her she opened a CrossFit gym and like totally obsessed with her CrossFit and I go every once in a while and it's all cool that's sexy insane I think those chicks are sexy yeah their bodies look phenomenal yeah phenomenal really strong powerful chicks that look like chocolate no they totally are amazing like the squatters I should do a porn with CrossFit chicks oh yeah people would love the CrossFit horn yeah CrossFit will kick you out every fucking gym in the country so as soon as it goes natural as soon as it goes national and big we got a bunch of people that get the total wrong impression right now thing is a sex club yeah you go and squat and then just fucking babies oh I like those squats are really good for sex actually they are though right nobody wants to have sex with frail people you don't wanna have sex with someone worried about breaking things yeah so hopefully fallen is gonna be cool about what we just listen I I want Fallon to know that I don't have no disrespect to her as a human and if I knew her only as a trans woman we would be friendly as all fuck I swear to God I believe it my issue relies only on the lack of disclosure and what I saw in those fights so how can she fix that do you think is there a way that she could sort of you know what's the word I'm looking for it like sort of bring herself back and and and people start having a little bit more respect for her in in the MMA stuff well now they already lost her disc I don't know is credited herself from that or I don't think anybody ever discredits themselves forever I mean I think right and the biggest fuck-ups you know one can come back from right if you're honest as well if you're honest but sometimes people aren't willing a lot of times in the community not willing to sort of give you yeah well she's gonna certainly face some resistance yeah she's certainly gonna face resistance as far as opponents but at least now it's willing resistance as people understand not resistance post you know post fight where they they go wait a minute that used to be a guy what the fuck like the fun and then they get mad like Jesus Christ you have a concussion because that's what they're hearing that used to be a guy of course that brings up all kinds of red flags you're like I'm not fighting a dude I mean this is woman's fighting but now that it's revealed I'm for anybody who wants to fight her I just think that if the Commission's are gonna be responsible about it there should be some sort of real protocol sent all right it should really be examined bone density the whole nine yards everything should be examined and you should have more opinions than these extremely biased gender reassignment doctors who are providing a lot of the information that I've been reading online right people have been pointing to in support of gender reassignment people being immediately recognized as cisgender the same the right Riemann category would write I think the once it's out there it's out there now that it's out there hey you know if you choose to compete against her and you're a syst woman and you have no problem with it it's cool I'm free with you trying to ride bulls too I think that's way more ridiculous I'm free with you trying to fucking do flips on a BMX bike do whatever the fuck you want but any kind of contact sport my back rugby or something like that what do you what do you think about if you want to do it as long as you know other and also as long as the other teammates or people know that you are a transgender yes and it really needs to be studied objectively and scientifically without any sort of bias so we can really look at the actual numbers not just in one person but on several people look like on that sorry yeah pre-surgery post-surgery in the middle five years and I get a real database to work because we don't have one right now I think though I there's women when I when I skate box there used to be this chick that used to come in the gym and fucking slug it out with dudes right and everybody supported her on that you you know you want to go in there do that and I know girls that are pro MMA fighters to this day that go in the gym and Duke it out with dudes and they do it because it makes them better and I am fucking 100% but they know what they're doing when I'm going in there they choose that and just like riding a bull or going BMX riding or anything else is dangerous as long as you are fully aware of the parameters of the competition that you're getting involved in and the risks that they might entail right I'm cool with it yeah I mean you know I just said earlier I'm all about disclosure young for me and Vinnie and in every part of your life as a trans person we're different than the rest of the world and we have to understand that mm-hmm face value I look like a guy but it doesn't mean that I that I that it's okay that you might think that way about me as well well what's beautiful about today is you may be different than me or you may be different than Jamie you might be different but you're not different than everybody and you can reach each other the communities now that can be established through the internet it's there's so much broader and there's so much more varied there's so much more room for everybody you can find those folks totally and I think that's a lot of that enthusiasm about finding that is what creates all these you know weird acronyms and secret languages and these weird inside talk it's like inside chatter it is our secret life your inside you know it's I think that's sort of you know what that kind of fosters that kind because I think that's a natural aspect of human interaction I'm sure especially when finally you belong tonal you know you like involving and engross yourself in it and just really get super in depth in it yeah because you can buddy up and we all know how we each feel about each other ya know how how our lives were we all have the same story in different ways yeah we all come to it and I think it's also super important that a guy like you comes out and explains how much bullshit you had to deal with before that happened and your your your point of view and how depressed and how depressed you were and how gross it was to have to fucking fight people because they didn't like who you were and people can hear that and it'll change people's opinions I totally think so fuck yeah well but you know like I said people like you putting me on their show I totally give you props for that dude because your fan base doesn't know guys like me and of course they're gonna say stuff I totally get it but hope I know that many of the guys are gonna walk away going actually Punky's totally it is you'd be surprising my fan base I'm the I'm the bridge between the meatheads and the planet I took but that's my point that's important because those guys are the ones that are like oh well um they're just they just don't understand they don't want to yeah and they don't understand also that there's actual strength in not judging there's strength in a building yes strengthen being cool with everybody there's strength is personal stress there is in being open to to other and not being insecure about that and that closed off Ness is actually a weakness so clearly and it also provides you and gives you conflict in your life it's unnecessary and enemies in your life that are unnecessary they easily could be allies I know that's what I was saying not having the positive energy and discussing those things and understanding yeah remember what we said your opinion about felon is your opinion and I appreciate that opinion and she should too my opinion also happens to be the exact same opinion of every single martial arts expert that I've talked to interesting I have not talked to what Haddad if that was one trainer not one person involved in deeply in the business not one fighter male fighter not one not one set it mates everyone was like what because it's new she's it's not I don't want well and also the man that understand the advantages right there's there's there's critical advantages right even like great female fighters they like Miesha Tate is a great female fighter she moves like a woman though there's a difference there's a difference in the way the body moves yeah I see that you know yeah people have there's there's a real like a consensus opinion about that across the board in the mixed martial arts community and it's almost you Nana unanimously against someone doing that without disclosure right because it's not it's not fair that's the idea yeah because the facts show it's not fair but the fact is Serena Williams I think correct bitches total sister Nina Williams in an MMA gym she would just listen to me Serena but falling in her against each other what do you think well found would probably kick her ass you think yeah you need to stop some skills if a person doesn't have any know now but after you after your trainer and what do you think about that they would have to have a commensurate skill level before you could even judge and I would have to like actually see Fallon like hit a bag and see like what what she can actually do right now in person right you know Serena Williams I'm sure doesn't have any MMA training meet to be that fucking good at tennis you're eating breathing sleeping all clear live Tass tell but she's a super athlete super yeah if she just listened to me in the right gym give me a couple of years I'll get you the right trainers just listen to me I'm gonna judge you I'm gonna fucking I'm gonna write journals every day we're gonna take which she would dominate female but she kills it and look at that body Jesus Louise's oh yeah look at her fucking body god damn I love her yeah if you were in a fight to the death with that chick you got a fight you're dead you can't take it easy on her man look at that arm my goodness if that arm got around your neck you're gonna sleep you going that night if someone taught her how to do a triangle properly you ever see her legs Jamie pull up a picture of her legs the legs of the gods yeah the tightness of her vagina must be a thing of legend if she clamped down on you it's probably like sorry you know dogs like the male dog locks into the female and the female wants to get away well they do something physiological that happens to the male's penis where they actually lock in there somehow in order to make sure look at her fucking legs Jesus quieter ass dude or you can't oh my god amazing that looks like her ass is pregnant with basketballs she looks like she could just jump over a building she's superwoman she could just share launched herself over the entire fucking tennis arena Wow look at that her ass is insanity it's a Photoshop it looks like a Photoshop guys make sure that's not a Photoshop find other corroborating pieces of that yeah that's so ridiculous but I've seen I've seen enough that I think it is what her ass really yeah that's power god damn you ain't kidding that girl Jesus Christ that girl's got some fucking genetics super whoa like I said the amount pull there's our aspirin it's insane yeah that's on the beach it shit's real and that's not even like in the middle of training yeah smiling the sunglasses always with ultra half trailing behind her that's like three acid she has like three small white girl asses packed in together yeah that's you can't yeah you can't get that every day if every woman look like that we have it we'd be a totally different species of human I'll complain if that was the fucking body if that was the genetics of every woman we all bred we would have warrior children we would we would make like every woman look like 300 after they did the CGI on their bodies everyone's body would look like 300 he'll be insane yeah I mean there's that's Indiana is also the gray area when you're talking about transgenders like that a woman a cisgender woman like her exists and then you know what is that that's a freak yeah end of the spectrum and that's a cisgender woman yeah like maybe we should look at what her bone density is and all of the things that she has in her musculature and then look at mean but also the weight class to she would be clearly a heavyweight know for how much she weighs but I gotta think she's a buck 65 bucks at least at least and think about the the full spectrum go Molly Ringwald pasty redhead it just looks like she bruises every time she runs into a corner of a table oh Sh in bruises and hangnails are swollen poor Molly I can't no she's soft and white yeah yeah take her outside and the bright side she turns pink fucking vampire yeah I mean and that's the same with males as well that's a real issue with men's athletics in mixed martial arts as well and that has nothing to do with steroids there's people that are just natural super athletes and then there's other folks that just have really slow twitch muscle fibers that you know wouldn't be bad if they're triathletes but in an MMA fight they just can't generate speed and power and then they fight someone just boom they can just blast them and it's sad to watch because you know that fighter a will never beat fighter be right you know there's fighters why are they in the ring in the first place cuz they're good they're just not good enough they're good they get good like there's certain guys I wanted to mention any names but I'll mention the positive side there's certain guys that they're never gonna beat a guy like Jacare Souza there's a guy pull up this picture of Jacare J AC ara Souza against you Shinto kami there's photos of him beating the fuck out of this badass Japanese dude you should know calm you know you should know economy is a bad motherfucker and this Jacare guy is such a physical freak that he just crushed this guy I mean cry there's certain guys that just have this very unique physical ability and no matter what you do you're never gonna beat that as long as he's training as long as he's learning skills as long as he's dedicating himself he has certain inherent advantages that he was blessed with right that you can't overcome right because if a guy is not just a physical not just has the physical ability but also puts in the dedication and has the intelligence and the mental strength right if he has all those those factors down it's not fair something yeah right because if you don't have those if you're just super tough and you're really technical but your fucking body sucks a fat dick right you just got some old school slowpoke DNA and you just can't get over that physical hump that guy can crack you at will and you can't reach him right you can't get ahold of them you can't hit them when you want to he's too fast right there's nothing you get a pull-up you give me is there any photos of Jacare you do jump well just if you find an impressive photo of him look at all that guy is a fucking super stud it's hard to tell from that picture if you see there's a picture of him beating the shit out of Okami if you see Jacare vs. Okami look at Jacare yes okay am i Brazil he was a world jiu-jitsu champion multiple time world jiu-jitsu champion and now he's fighting in MMA it just and he you know and he is the the argument towards Fallon Fox aside that there's a broad spectrum in as is swimming a Williams yeah right so then yeah so does that so that's actually a really good question and yeah because then you have that is that fair but it is natural yeah see if you can find the picture of him beating this shit out of a commie because there's some photos of him smashing okami where you look at his body just like jesus fucking christ if you see a move it's even spookier because he moves like a cat he moves like a big giant cat just spring getting the shit beat out of them in a fight do they like stop it at a certain yes yeah it looks like you're gonna die they see them they're teeing off on him but if you see him actually moving it's even spookier yeah they stop it if if a guy can't defend themselves not defending himself or if the referee thinks he's taking too much punishment right the referee is free to stop it at any time if he feels like it's not competitive anymore the guys in danger and that's the most important job the referee has rescuing people from danger from danger yeah well that's the worst thing that ever happened in a ring is someone ever died in there no not in the UFC a guy died this week in Brazil from weight cutting actually what's that weight cutting is these guys they want to there's a fork and some dudes arm up jujitsu is nasty too he's he's he's a fucking beast a guy weight cutting is like say if you're gonna compete at 155 pounds you want all the advantages that you can get and one of the best advantages is you dehydrate yourself so you make 155 pounds and then you rehydrate yourself up to like 170 ish and then you go into the ring they use IV so you go in the ring fully hydrated and you feel great but you weighed in at 155 and now you weigh 170 so you're really big for the weight class and there's a point of diminishing returns where you cut too much weight and it weakens your body so much that you can't perform well the next day right and then there's way past that point where this guy went to where he died this is the first date cut because he crest cut too much weight this is the first known case that I'm aware of an MMA of someone dying but it's been a problem with college wrestling for a long time and high school wrestling either even rather to the point where they've started to monitor athletes weights and how much they cut and how much they put back on and they make sure that they don't get below a certain amount of body fat there there make sure that they don't cut too much water wow that's scary it's very scary and it's even more scary in combat sports because in combat sports you're also dealing with the effects of the concussive impacts on the dehydrated brain right much more dangerous is a little-known fact but all of the deaths in professional boxing that have occurred inside the ring at least almost all of them have been under the heavy weight division it's all in the divisions where people how to cut weight so then you weigh in it that way uh-huh then you read me hard right is that is that legal yes oh it is yes that doesn't make sense to me exactly you know why because you're looking at it as an objective observer that's intelligent and has an already like decided that that's just a part of the landscape when you're looking at it normally you like this is crazy crazy shouldn't let people do that about the weight so that's all you're focused on yes there's two different fights there's the fight that happens in the gym and or the in the the cage there's the fight that happens to get to the scale there's two different complete and you can't buy it on this year that exact way yeah so for the the 24 to 48 hours before weigh-in is horrific like a nightmare they dehydrate themselves it's radically harden they don't need to fucking eat shit they lead very little food they're starving by the time they get on their bodybuilders do the same thing right after like yeah but they don't they don't have to like smack each other around fucking Chin's bounce off their domes that's weird do they talk about listen yes are they planning on like fixing this there's not much they can do one thing that they've done is they've moved the weight cuz you can't stop people from doing that if they want to do that I'm talking about the actual like laws of the UFC like maybe they should you know make the weight in a variable there of 5 pounds or something no we wouldn't do that because then they would people would just get heavier they would make sure that they were heavy like and then very the same right see if you varied it if you said like you don't have to weigh in in 155 you can be as heavy as 160 right and they would go to get up to 180 down to 160 name it still but they'd say they've had bigger yeah they'd be even bigger because they've got it down to a science like there's some guys like the best guy is this Brazilian guys name is glace and Tebow he will cut 30 pounds and he will weigh in at 155 but fight closer to 180 he will put most of it back on 8 pounds pull up this guy gia T Bao GL man try spelling that you found him how do you besides this motherfucker if you saw how big this guy is in person he's 5 foot 10 and he weighs in at 155 and he's yeah he's gigantic when he gets in the cage I mean he's a fucking monster he's the very best in the world at counting weight no one cuts way by how yeah they have it down to a science yeah after it's also bio specific like you might be better at weight cutting than I am and I might be better than he is some people can dehydrate the share of themselves andreat and bounce back easy and cut a lot of weight other guys can't do it and it affects people very differently and no one understands why they don't know if it's a genetic issue if it's you know they don't know but some guys can kind of fuckload away and you know how do they do that how do they get the weight there's a bunch of different ways some they don't they try not to do that anymore that's the old-school way to do it and some guys still do it that way but that's actually dangerous the way they do it now is through distilled water they take massive amounts of water up till the weigh-in up to the week of the weigh-in and then on several days before the weigh-in they drink only distilled water and they drink quite a bit of it so your body is used to just pissing out this water distilled water has no minerals in it at all so you're just the water's going in you and now you in you now you're right through your not retaining it and so then leading up to the fight they stop drinking water at all and they piss everything out so they get down to like nothing then they step on the scale they weigh in at whatever it is and then they slowly rehydrate first of all with Pedialyte which is an electrolyte supplement and then they go to IVs they take an IV bag and they take it yeah it's no joke man and the IV bag is apparently the best way to rehydrate your noggin because that's the brain yeah the brain fluid is the real issue yeah and doing it through the digestive tract apparently takes much more time for sure than it does like that right into your blood I'm gonna rehydrate much quicker right this is the size this guy the glassing Tebow yeah I think I don't know which one is pre weigh-in that's that's the the one on the right is when he's dried out he just looks like the same muscular guy just a little smaller it looks like yeah and then on the left he just bore with the white shorts on see the size of that motherfucker he's a tank too he's a strong motherfucker and he's also black belt in jujitsu and he's got like you know 30 fucking plus MMA fights he's a beast but he's the best at doing that but it's a dangerous game way it's really not cool for your brain to do that I've seen guys walk up to that scale where they look like they're dead they struggle to get the weigh-ins are on the top of a platform and they have to go up this platform go up the stairs to get to this platform I've seen guys who are gonna fight in a cage in 24 hours and they can barely walk up those stairs barely make it oh yeah real dangerous nothing they can do about it the best thing they've done is move the weigh-ins from the day of the fights to 24 hours before boxing did that and then what does that do gives a more time more time right so they're not so out of it to get into the ring because they used to do it the day of these to do in the morning of the fights guys used to weigh in and then they would go and fight that night and weight cutting it has existed forever in boxing and wrestling and you know and soon as MMA had weight classes people started wait how to air it's always it's you know cuz especially with MMA because MMA they came into it with a wrestlers mentality and a lot of MMA fighters their bases in wrestling and in fact it's the best base for MMA and those guys that came into it are used to cutting weight right they're really good at it and they don't know how to do it well the issue of course is that their sport doesn't have head trauma or much head trauma whereas MMA is all about it's all about that yeah and head trauma with dehydration's I'm surprised it hasn't been more death they're on the ball the doctors are excellent the referees are excellent the Commission's they keep a close eye on fighters and they test the shit out of it before they actually get into the cage they make them do MRIs full blood scan they make sure that these people that go in there are healthy and they've actually found a lot of like real issues with people because of these scans that have you know like people didn't know the like an aneurysm ready to have any brain if they got hit anything's out my friend Dan Hardy who was a top-level MMA fighter I found out he had an extra heartbeat some weird aberration of his heart ways got his primary heartbeat and he's got this weird sort of extra beat that goes on and the worry is that this extra beat can overcome him and he could possibly have a heart attack I don't understand the medical aspect of it but he can't fight now unless he has this operation where they go into his chest and remove this extra heartbeat yeah he can't fight now and he's a top-level pro and it's just the concern by these athletic commissions and the doctors have kept him from from competing so he hasn't fought in the couple years it's a real issue why doesn't he get an operation well for him he doesn't feel like he needs it he doesn't feel like it's very inviting it's also he underwent and I hate using these terms but in his case it's actually the correct term he underwent a spiritual transformation he went to the Amazon and took ayahuasca and sort of his reassessed his entire life since then and it's really not totally had an awakening yeah he's totally fine it's all wingnut II like Zen but it's it happens if you take it and also I think those things happen oh yeah I really believe that it happened have you ever done ayahuasca no but I would be pretty awesome to do you need to do it I think so yeah yeah well I've done the the strongest version of it which is this the pure dimethyltryptamine oh my god I was the earth doesn't give a fuck where you are one of the things you realize when you do DMT is the earth gives zero fucks where you are while this is happening you do not need to be in the desert is way bigger than that it's the whole universe no totally Wow dimethyltryptamine is the the pure version of what the ayahuasca experience is ayahuasca is the orally active version of dimethyltryptamine and these shamans in the Amazon figured many many thousands of years ago we don't even know when they figured out how to combine these ingredients in order to make DMT orally active because DMT normally is not orally active because it exists in so many different plants haha so many you would you would be tripping all the time right salad right really no bullshit so your your body produces something called mono amine oxidase and mono AMI and oxidase breaks down dimethyltryptamine in the gut so what they've done with ayahuasca is it's a combinatory drug where they've taken the root of one plant in the leaves of the other and the leaves are or the root one of them is a natural MAO inhibitor and it's called harmine and they they boil this stuff down together and they create this thing where the MAO inhibitor and the DMT are all together so that as you drink it it goes into your gut but the mono a mean oxidase gets killed by the harmine and the DMT goes right into the bloodstream what yeah it's like a slow release version go to the spirit world it's for real the idea the spirit world sounds like everything that everybody thinks about when you think of like if you took a pill and you went to a magic place where there's dragons and demons and aliens and spaceships and fractals all around you it's that times a million Wow plus it's way more real than reality itself and yeah and well Dan Hardy went down there and did this and he's like why futile it's like kind of like what am i doing like what is the what's the necessary evil here what is the what what is really being done here what is what am I really pursuing and he realized that what he was basically on a Vision Quest his life was like a Vision Quest and to to find himself to seek truth he did it through combat you know he did it through physical one-on-one competition in the most dangerous sport in the world and then in having this I was really speaking out of turn to put these words into his mouth but I think what I got out of it from speaking to him was that he now that he understands that this whole world exists and that it exists existed always and it was behind curtain and he couldn't see the little man behind the curtain pulling the cords and then all suddeniy saw and he sees everything he saw the whole thing that he's just his perspective was altered so radically and it also coincided with when he was diagnosed with this condition so it's almost like the universe is giving him a new totally eyes yeah it totally is I'm a big believer of that it's possible I mean it's it's possible you created all yourself inside your imagination as well that's so there's many things there that are possible yeah if you're open to it oh yeah I have to be open to it fuck yeah the imagination itself scariest fuck that's why people aren't open to it when I look at that it can just freak you out imaginations madness just what it is I mean everybody thinks of the imagination is being oh you know he thinks about things that aren't really there sort of but the imagination is also what made cities that also what made laptops it made every physical object that has ever been created had to be invented and it had to be invented through the imagination even it was done in steps like first came the tire and then came the wheel and then came the engine all those things combined created a car that gets you to Vegas right that's a real thing you know all those created a plane that gets you in the air all those created a fucking spaceship that launches a satellite into orbit all those created a phone that allows you to text someone who's in Australia all those created light bulbs I mean all that shit is imagination imagination has reshaped the entire surface of the fucking planet like no other thing entity I don't know other power more so than fucking volcanoes so after he had that trip and he doesn't fight anymore to define that he found a different that he was a different calling for him right now or I don't I haven't talked to him in a while and we need get it back on here I don't know what he's very interested to know like did he feel like with that his fighting was over and it was time for him to go to a new path and that's why he wasn't really worried about having the surgery and going there yeah I don't know I mean look I think he probably would still like to compete every now and then if he could get it worked out but I also believe that what he was saying was that that's not the most important thing in the world why now and he also realizes how much of the goals that he wanted to achieve were ego bait we go centered sure and one of the things that gets crushed when you have a really intense psychedelic experience is the ego you go it always bounced back bounces back a little I fight with my ego all the time as every man does of course it's it's part of like it's a product that's also part of the testosterone thing it's part of it yeah X Y chromosome yeah it's part of the dick thing it's part of the the male identity thing they you know there's a constant need to feel special you know to justify while you're doing what you're doing to reward yourself for what you've done encourage further progress but that progress I mean that's that's what sort of like sort of pushes forth almost everything that men do in this world and there's that weird balance where you're trying to you know be a sort of enlightened person but also you're a man you know and so fighting against energy it's it's fighting yes but I prefer the term struggle okay more not even struggle but like it cuz it's you constantly have to be aware of it you constantly have to be on alert make sure that the ego never pops up you got it constantly because you know if you're under stress or if you're not diligent with your exercise and meditation you can allow your thoughts to get away from the totally and take over and then my other question was gonna be so I find it really fascinating that you're saying that because I know women and men think totally differently yeah and I can tell you that right sure my thought process changed the way I interact and people don't tend to realize that why I think men and women always have problems with each other in relationships men's needs are different than women's needs and it's a reality that people don't want to talk about yeah it's true it's like this do you think that that is true oh for sure yeah I mean I assume it's true but you know it's true you know any true and I think a lot of problems could be solved in the world as well as a relationship if people just are okay with that and they don't fight against it like the woman needs these son things necessary for me to be happy in this and then the man needs this and it causes this huge conflict with the relationship whatever if it's friendship or a marriage or whatever that's also with friendships too I mean some people require a lot a lot yeah and some people don't and the people that require a lot don't hang out with them they're not worth it there never was so now you're totally right they're never worth I don't care if they have golden pussy or magic dick whatever after a while you're gonna get both weight you have to feel like you're both getting yeah and the people that require an exorbitant amount of attention absorbent money they're out there never worth it I dated this girl once and she was so fucking dramatic everything was a struggle and everything was against her and everything was about her everything that went well for someone had to be turned around to highlight how bad her life was great including things that would go well for me it would immediately turn into woe is me because I don't have anything good going on of mine it was so brutal and we broke up and then I started dating this other girl who was really nice and it was like I got on a balloon and I was flying around the city and this the other girl was like friendly and she cracked jokes all the time and everything was funny to her and I was like Oh criminy there's Elliot there's hope in the world it's like my soul was on a balloon like up up and away beautiful beautiful but she connected with you though wasn't just her being a woman I think there was a connection yeah the crazy one was bad and people crazy wild bitch wanted to fuck like like a dog and she wanted to just distract yourself from her miserable mind she wanted to talk wild crazy fucking hair pulling madness she just wanted a growl that's pretty awesome the other one was just a sweetie you know and then again it's the balance of the fucking crazy world with the the other problem is not just the men who you know who think that they understand how women think and the women who think they understand how men think is the people the other problem is the people who pretend to be someone else to placate the opposite my god that's so huge issue happens all the time yeah those are the white knights yes male male bitches of the world well those guys who get together with like for example I have obviously stripper friends obviously because I work in the sex industry of course they have stripper friends and then like the guys get with the girls and they don't want them to strip anymore that's hilarious happens all the time porn stars - right - no can't do that anymore I'm like what the fuck is that all about yeah or they make weird rules like you're allowed to fuck other people or you only I felt loud if girls in front of me oh yeah only girls can find me or you can only fuck like a short list of guys that I'm friends with exactly and they can't come in your face [Laughter] no double penetration on my woman bro it's really that's ego stuff it is but you know they say if you if you really pay attention to the heavy-duty psychedelic heads they say that at one point in time when people regularly consumed psychedelics we were much more like chimpanzees we had this orgiastic community small group you know fifty to a hundred people and we all shared right in fact one of the guys we have on the podcast all the times a guy named dr. Chris Ryan and he wrote a book called sex at dawn and it's a fascinating book about the origins of human sexual interaction and his his take on is really first of all it's really well studied and secondly the the just the origin of words like promiscuous the original origin of promiscuous doesn't mean like having sex with random people like that never happened it means mixed much sexuality like having sex with several partners right that was promiscuous but it was always people in the community it was always people that knew each other right cuz there was only 50 of you and you're hanging out in the Amazon you know when you're shooting darts and monkeys and trying to stay alive and keep that fire lit right it wasn't like going to a club and picking some strange guy and letting him come inside you that didn't happen right they didn't allow strangers in the camp you know they didn't they didn't just go meet people and fuck right it's like polyamory ORS yes fucking what do they know it's also the idea exists in fighter pilots it was another really fascinating aspect of this guys books that fighter pilots and people in intense high-risk high death rate jobs would often wife swap and the idea the psychology behind it was the wife swapping was to ensure that they're the one that they loved so dearly it's not that they didn't want to have this connection only with them but they wanted other people to love them too because they probably wouldn't be around Wow really fascinating yes and it's very common amongst fighter pilots like this is a switch that goes off when you're in this intense you know the odds of me dying or very hot right the odds you die no probably 30% or something right you like right so I just made that done I know but that they they do that on a regular basis that's it's a super common thing among soldiers some blasts officers a lot of cops wound up doing there now they totally do yeah that's what it is that's what it's about it's about this there is a primal need to have your loved ones loved by others so that they'll be safe when you're gone wow that's really fascinating yeah yeah the human human sexuality morphs so much depend upon circumstance it's you know something people don't they just think oh that's why people want guys especially need to go out it's part of your DNA it's part of you need to spread your seed it's very normal I think that guys go out and need to have sex with lots of different people I think it's try explaining that to my wife or anybody's playing it I'm just kidding but you can't but what you're white okay with that if you did that I would she not be okay I think she's probably pretty sad really yeah don't want you to go fuck other guys or other girls no you can't be fuck you can't yeah well you don't want them to fuck other guys and rides they don't want you to fuck on the right even if your DNA is telling you to go do it you know I know some people who are totally okay with that I know a bunch of strippers and freaks look very established this I know all the polyamory people who fuck each other I think every man would certainly want that if it was a one-way street but I think most men will we you'll be okay with your wife fucking someone else that would be nice yeah what if you want well my question for you though is because you were a woman and now you're a man right it's how has your thoughts on that changed oh you were always a lesbian though yeah I identified as a gay woman from lawyers because I that was the only thing I knew how I could identify though I felt like a man then when I told my lesbian community well I kind of feel like a man and I'm gonna have this change they all dumped me I lost all my friends they were like you're a traitor basically they said I'm a traitor going to the bad side oh yeah they actually said you're going to the other side totally dude and I was like dumped do you would wouldn't you think that people who have been marginalized yes you would think that forced to just face all sorts of prejudice and hurtful things that they would be more accepting you would think that that's a very good point what is wrong with well I get I was 20 years ago I don't know if so many lesbians feel the way but I think that there is this whole thing going on in the gay woman's community where they feel sort of I don't know I actually I can't say anything about that I've always wondered why they don't take up real estate the way that gay men do like gay men can fuck and dominate an entire community to male and it's a male and female thing of course is only those the the the the building of male communities like gay communities yeah it's like they're like you who it is like it says men need to do it women are really much more you know passive and they're fine with that and they're fine with their situation they're they don't need to be making a big deal out of it they're I mean I know that you experienced prejudice and hate as a woman who's a gay woman but I think it's less so than gay men experience yeah because they're less out there right like I just said the gay men are out there ranking that statement where the gay women are very comfortable being in their environment and not really making a big deal but it's also like if gay women moved next door it wouldn't freak a lot of people out but if a gay man next door they would start doing all he's gonna try to fuck me that's what it is right there totally oh man don't want to feel like a sex object they treat women but I think some men to other men right they were actually if you're a straight man yeah no that's not totally cool and you're not if you're not affected by the gay women because you might want to watch the gate women have sex yeah the game women are no problem you know it's not a matter of fact you try to be friendly as fight it over I'm just quiet and sit over here buds but listen man this is a great conversation it's really really fun I'm glad we had it and I'm glad we covered you know so many of the various aspects of the the the world of transgender and gender identity and I think a lot of people got a lot out of this at least I'd hoped I think so yeah I think it was a good one I think is a it's a super important subject and it's also super important that people can understand that you know it doesn't matter man it's people are people whatever the fuck they want to do whether it's be a man be a woman you know get all tattooed up like you and I or not or shave your head or not or fucking whatever man just what what kind of interacts are you having with that person in my interaction with you was very pleasant I enjoyed it very much friends with buck angel there you go bitches all right that's
