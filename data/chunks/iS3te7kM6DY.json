yeehaw hey hanging in there fella great man I think these things are gonna annoy a lot of people if you're listening we're wearing a luminol we're wearing spacesuits yeah god they're so crunchy there's not many left for me to get this is the yeah this is my favorite one I like the orange one for some strange reason the white one just seems like I'm a cleanup person you know like you're doing some NASA cleanup like this alien body - trying to get rid of but this feels like we're about to do something special yeah but we're protected yeah I just hope it doesn't start making us sweat and we lose like a hundred pounds well this is the same shit that's on the outside of the lunar module land that cheap looking aluminum foil oh yeah looks like it was stuck on there with gum yeah the heat shield whatever it is yeah what did that fucking fake stuff is or the alien you ever see the alien where he had to put that big sheet that was made out of this material at the very end you ever see that movie was a predator or alien no no the alien the one with Matt Damon and he's like lost in space no Martha Mars well they have these four people that get like lost hiking like their blankets they'll keep you alive you won't be cozy they'll keep you alive they're like these real thin aluminum foil looking blankets yeah I guess they just retain heat pretty good right pretty good you know like you're not getting a good night's sleep but you might stay alive yeah how are you holding up I'm all right yeah yeah you know um look these people that got rough the people that got it rough our number one medical workers anybody you know much love to anybody that's working in hospitals right now doctors nurses everybody interns everybody everybody people working the desk goddamn you guys have it rough you know those are the people number one number two ha anybody in the hospitality industry people serving food restaurants grocery store work oh yeah they have a rough bit they have jobs you know it's rough but their jobs are still open the thing drives me crazy is there's so many restaurants where these people you know employed 5060 people and you know restaurants are hard it's hard to stay open when things are great you know restaurants are a fucking but what does it say it's one of the number one businesses that fails like that what is the see if you could find a statistic but it's something crazy like 70% of all restaurants fail within the first year does this fuck ha imagine running a restaurant especially what can't like a chicken restaurant you're like everyone says chicken that was that great restaurant that was right next to the ice house we used to go there all the time yeah it was good in the place that just replaced it just closed down Leah says they have a high failure rate but knowing why can help the prospective owners around 60% of new restaurants fail within the first year and nearly 80% shudder before their fifth anniversary Wow 80% in five years so if you get a restaurant like Dan Tana's that's been open since like the 60s or something like when do you ever eat at Dan Tana's Jamie have you do you know where Dan Tana's s oh my god dude we need to do at dinner at Dan Tana's anytime post or dinner at Dan Tana's because Dan Tana's is open the kitchen's open till I came it'd night it's phenomenal some of the best Italian food in all of LA and it's on Santa Monica Boulevard like on the border of Boys Town it's next to the troubadour hey hey yeah the troubadour where I saw I saw Everlast recently and Sturgill turtle Simpson played the troubadour to troubadours dope I hope Everlast is doing okay with his daughter his daughter has he's being real smart and staying the fuck away from everybody and they're holed up and everybody's healthy last I spoke to him yeah bro that place is the shit they have phenomenal pasta they have excellent steaks it's a really good old-school restaurant if you go in there like it looks like they haven't done shit to that place since 1970 everything's perfect like that that's what it looks like inside I have seen it's amazing dude it's so good it's so good I love that old-school Italian look you know it the red tablecloth I ate there with Suzanne Suzanne and I went to see Sturgill and then afterwards we ate at Dan Tana's also dude I feel like we're real Hollywood she got hold you know some Suzanne from honey honey she got hold up in North Carolina oh gosh yeah you know her folks are down there so she went down there and she's holed up I know so many people are hope nick swardson he's holed up in michigan you know or Minnesota for rather where he's from you know one of them M warrants right my friend David kill Tony he was stuck in New York and he got out like the day before they just banned it like all travel out of New York right now no hanging out with David a little bit yeah even 14 days hey man got take your temperature Jamie's got somebody in this building checkpoints they're showing videos of in Florida blocking people coming in from like New York yeah so many people flew down there to bail and they brought that shit down there yeah there was a read an article I think it was in the Atlantic about people who are on the Cape like Cape Cod in Boston and they're mad that people who own summer houses out there gonna stay in their summer house like hey you fuck this is where we live don't bring your cooties over here yeah but they live there two men they just down two houses they still own the house you know just if you own too hot like how does that work you know like people want their isolation right cuz they live in their town but if somebody bought that house this is still America that's their fucking house yeah I get it you don't want a bunch people coughing around you but they don't want a bunch of people coughing around them either which is why they went to the Cape in the first place yeah I'm just everyone's scared Burbank had like two cases and then yesterday just a retirement home right next to my house somebody got it and gave it just like 17 people so we just went up with like a ton in Burbank oh it just makes me wonder like any of those people went to my grocery store cuz now I'm thinking about that now I'm like over thinking like I got to the over thing where like now I'm thinking about postmates sigh postmates so much what if the driver sneezes on my food or Amazon box like the cardboard box what if the yeah you got to think if you post me that guy's going all over the place right they have to yeah I have to and I doubt post mates us giving them like spray and gloves and all that this is like the craziest way to try to stop something from spreading in massive cities where everybody travels where everybody's connected to everybody so even when you have everybody on lockdown it just it's like you got fingers in the dike you know like trying to hold up the holes in the dam but water still squirting through for sure it's not like you open up the whole dam but you got to think of all the different people that have to work just hospital workers them alone man they have to work the other thing I was reading Atlantic is another up and reading Atlantic lately apparently another another article was they were talking about these doctors they can't even test people they can't use the tests on them unless they meet certain criteria and the doctor was like he said when these people come they have a fever they're coughing and if they didn't have coronavirus before they got here they probably do now I was like oh my god Jesus Christ and we're not even today supposedly the middle part of it on this yeah and it's also um like whose fault is it is it anybody's fault it seems like no one has any idea what's going on and to blame anybody definitely bad decisions were made whoever ate the first bag Asya uh whoever did it that's for a long time they're just like the Bee Gees down there trying to stay alive I read the article bot they said the lady who was patient zero that got it first she thinks she got it from being in a stall next to it somehow she didn't say she ate like a bat hello she was in that market and like she was selling something else in there and like being near it oh man she's breathing bat air all day when the other people got up to around her oh that's what their explanation I read you she weeks like is there any reason for a bat to be a lot a species still like can't we just wipe out bats well they were talking about doing that with mosquitoes but when you play God with an ecosystem you don't know what the unintended consequences are some good examples of that like you can't just do that like we even bring in a new species to a place where there's you know it seems like the species gonna be fine has disastrous results most of the time but does it's not a part of the system like it's weird man like systems they they're they exist in nature and there's like all these strengths and weaknesses that balance each other out these animals that eat other animals and those animals animals eat certain plants and those certain plants they shit those plants out and helps fertilize other plants and they got it down they know what they're doing and you throw a Buffalo into that and everybody everything gets fucked up I mean that's that's what happened Australia you know Australia and New Zealand are both crazy examples of that are Australia in particular because so many people live there I mean is many almost as many people as live in LA live in Australia which doesn't seem like a lot isn't Australia like they're not letting anyone leave yeah I think they got I don't know is that true I thought I read that they were probably should but anyway Australia has wild cats like house cats that they put out to kill some other thing that they put out to live over they they did a bunch of stupid shit like that like they have all these animals just roaming around they have to kill them they have to chase them down and kill them all these deer and all these different stags and these different animals they say sometimes they have to do with helicopters they fly over and just gone them down because they don't have any predators so these things just get to these preposterous proportions look at Japanese beetles you know they came from Japan and they they fuck up our country what every seven years they come in town and just you guys ever had beetles in LA I don't know like where you have you know mess well they get those bark beetles that fucked up Big Bear yeah those about you know those bark beetle trees yeah they kill a certain large number of those trees and because we're scared of fire for good reasons we never let fires happen so those trees in nature they're supposed to burn down and it's supposed to like them everything's supposed to recover and the burn actually helps the trees grow you know again it's a system that's been in place for a million years but we're we're like we're better than this we're smarter we know what we're gonna do we're just gonna yeah some beetles got over there on a boat who gives a shit some plants got in someone's boot the seeds we're in the cracks of someone's boot and wound up in the forest and this new invasive species cropped up and chokes out all the native plants it happens all the time what's that stuff that's in the south we talked about it one time it covers everything some crazy growth that I believe it's from Asia originally and it made it down someone was explaining it to me and I remember I was blown away because I've never never heard it's like a mold they can know it's like a like a vine it covers everything it's like trees that cover other trees they choke out all the life they take away all the oxygen and Sun oxygen trees don't even breathe oxygen yeah that's the stuff pull up a picture that shit takes over a whole forest Jesus yeah it's weird I never even heard about it until like three or four years ago some on the podcast brought it up and I was like whacked look at that dude that's just that stuff just takes over so it's growing over trees grows over everything well it's like it's a ghost yeah it's like it's like an alien thing that decides it's gonna like overcome everything in its environment and completely take over other trees at least it looks okay it looks it looks dope but he's it's weird dude it's things like that are weird because if that was an animal doing that to other animals we'd be freaked out if we like let these rats loose and the rats were like chasing down you know people's cows and killing all these people's cows you'd be like what the fuck is going on oh these rats just live around cows and consume them but we see trees getting consumed like if you've never seen these photos the stuff spelled que UD zu and it's that what was that in the Mississippi it was out of the photo was from that last photo I think somewhere in the south and I don't know when this shit sefa see see if you could find the history when it was introduced oh it's in Portland Oregon - yeah well that name sounds like it came from Asia brought over here with that stuff is just dominating wherever it is it's weird it's when especially when something like this is going on like we're dealing with coronavirus and you stop and think about the things that get 1876 sent 10 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia that's when kuzu was introduced from Japan at the United States at the Japanese Pavilion 1876 so from 1876 that shit took the fuck off there anything you could do like eat it or smoke oh good question that picture that Jamie had the last picture about Portland was talking about an eradication they're trying to eradicate it but how do you eradicate all that stuff there's so much of it he just says cammo to cover up tanks and shit in World War two that makes sense yeah oh my god you'd hide that stuff perfect you never you'll see what the fuck anything is there we go yeah you can kind of eat it as it contains a starch and the flowers can be made into a jelly whoa it's been used as a food ingredient in East Asia and Vietnam the starts called say that bot Sande what do you think Maxon guy bot Sunday its flavored with pop mellow and then use it as a drink in the summer yeah there you go but it's a life form that's killing another life-form taking over a massive swaths of land and it makes me think about this coronavirus you know this is that's that's that's another different I mean it's not a life-form it's a virus technically but it's obviously a thing that grows and wants life and kills and consumes bodies takes over and it's so easily it pass I get like people are talking about how like if you let somebody pet your dog like if you're walking your dog and somebody goes oh no and pet your dog is on the dog it's on your dog Jesus Christ or like these jewels you put your jewel down on a table you don't even think about it maybe right in your mouth you live in a dirty straw the other day exactly your desert straw-rick East you have that dirty straw in your pocket all the time so he's rubbing up against you Linton right your common yeah luckily these things are that the ends are replaceable so you're kind of rode away every five minutes have a giant gym bag my girlfriend just got one of those phone cleaners where you put your phone in the UV light so now I'm putting everything in and put Jules car keys it's a good move it's a good move I had heard about those before I didn't know there was a thing that I found out about called ass Terry stick and they use it when they go back country hiking and stuff and camping and it purifies water with a stick like it's an electrolyte band and you stick it in into this you it's UV light and you stick it into this elect the it's like a straw looking thing the LifeStraw yeah like a lightsaber no those kids lifesaver right that's what it looks like with the clear on the outside and you just see if you find one of those fucking things I went and apparently the light kills all the bacteria but it doesn't filter the taste still tastes like donkey piss yeah you still get a little great so yeah I mean if you get lucky you get a clean stream you just run that through it and it doesn't alter the taste of the water which is nice I don't know how it's working yeah there's other ones the life straws where you can just sit there drink urine through a straw and it cleans it as it goes yeah I would trust that more than just a light well those get clogged up man and sometimes they leak sometimes people get Giardia from those filters they don't clean them good enough and they get clogged up with poo which is what Giardia is you're basically getting a disease that comes out of go for shit they call it beaver fever yeah I wonder if this Coronas gonna kill joint circles because like now that seems insane to just go out in the back of the Comi store with twenty continuity comics yeah sure so that fucking thing oh that little lightsaber thing Sterry stick that can see what does it say it as far as how how quick it doesn't this is an article about this first test draw like this SteriPEN a small pen like electronic device that emits an ultraviolet light purifies either half a liter or one full liter of water at a time the device operates on batteries and works with clean water by killing the DNA of harmful microbes and bacteria but how weird is that how long it takes up because I know that the phone cleaner takes like ten minutes one minute later that doesn't seem right well so once the water is safe to drink about one minute later the light turns off and flashes green one minute that's insane I wonder if they tested it they should test it yeah there was this one executive and he was talking about how safe glyphosate is that's roundup that that stuff that they're now proving causes cancer proving and lawsuits have been settled and you know it's it's it's not good for you to consume this guy had a glass of it he's like you could drink it I said the guy's like go ahead drink it he wouldn't drink a glass of it like bitch drink it did you see the guy that they just arrested for selling the coronavirus pill that supposedly kills the current virus he reminds me of that old bodybuilding guy what's it dan or whatever that used to sell fake yeah but if you look at this guy he looks like he's selling well there was some preachers that were selling it like Jim Baker was telling a corona virus a virus cure they straight up for rested this guy though yeah he looks like I mean what they say there's nothing but the the chloroquine there's no studies right there's no definitive test but they're still letting people try it is that what's going on with that I think so like the couple that died took the wrong shit yeah they took that could poison yeah you took algae yeah bacteria killer it's that's for fucking koi ponds yeah it's poison they took poison yeah they died from taking points they misread or misunderstood or something dude the media today is kind of spooky with their hatred of Trump is getting in the way of the accuracy of some people's reporting of the news and that's a perfect example by resorting to clickbait and saying that they heard it from Trump but he that's not what he said what he's talking about is a different kind of chloroquine there's more than one different kind of it right right but if they just said real simply that these people died please be careful there is more than one different kind of chloroquine and chloroquine hasn't been shown to to work yet and it's not necessarily safe to take if they said that that would be great but instead they had to say the president told people to take it but that's not what he said what he said is that there's hope and we're hoping that this could be a cure or this could be a treatment that's what he said but that's what everybody's saying like if you go and read articles about that when doctors are talking about potential treatments there's a bunch of different ones there's IV vitamin C there's chloroquine there's uh the so it's this core quench which is like an old-school malaria medication and then Z packs they're talking about what does that call death-row Mathison how do you say that I you know but at that antibiotic they're saying that that may have some effect but these are main you know that's what they're saying like it's people who are scrambling for an answer we're trying to help people not not sure if this is you know definitely gonna work or not gonna work but it shows some promise that's what Trump talked about like you can't give him a hard time for talking about what doctors are talking about because legitimate people are talking about that combination of things just because you hate Trump you can't distort this and make it seem like Trump did something irresponsible by talking about this hopeful disease medication and these people took the wrong version of it and died like that's a cautionary tale it's not a chance to shit on Trump but everything's a chance to shit on Trump it's so exhausting it's just it's it's fucking weird man well I did see news ratings I don't know he's silly there's no doubt he does silly shit but he's gotten a lot better at handling confrontational conversations with reporters you know I was watching this one yesterday and this reporter was asking him questions about a few things but she asked about people dying because of the economy failing and him talking about like and is there anyone that could speak to this she says it's in this playing a game right the game as she knows there's no real data that shows if they do that this will happen if the economy crash is the way they anticipated crashing and all these people are out of work for extended period of time X amount of people will kill themselves but we for sure know that economic despair is is a reason why some people go into depression depression is a reason why some people kill themselves these are all facts that we all know like maybe you can't pull that out of your ass when you're standing in front of a podium and you're addressing people and they're calling you out on this and what she was saying correctly is we can't put money ahead of people's lives so the correct thing by most people's account is for at least some period of time separating everybody maintaining this this distance and putting a stop to the the number of disease you know viruses are number of people to get infected but what he's saying is there's also a factor that we have to consider that all these people out of work could lead to suicide it could lead to drug addiction and he's right and you know he's right we all know he's right that's not that's irrefutable when people's lives fall apart through the unexpected circumstances some people are hanging on by a fucking thread and that comes along and it doesn't man that does happen to people we all know that to be true just because you hate Trump you can't pretend that this isn't going to be rough for people or you can't pretend that him saying that this can cause a loss of life too I think the problem might have been he might have said maybe more life there's no evidence of that that's true there's no evidence that it might cause more loss of life I think also we grew up always listening when a at a stressful time when the president came on he felt comforted like like his tone of voice how he how he acted he always kind of felt safer and I think when when it comes to Trump you're just like he does kind of remind me of like you know like you know like a New York or New Jersey guy like you know cocks well yeah he's a New York real estate mogul you know you have to have a certain amount of that to thrive in New York City yeah in New York people are a unique breed brother who got hit harder than them they've already lost more than a foul and people as of this morning yeah that's that place has got it bad cuz they're all stacked on top of each other you know it's one of the things unfortunately it makes New York awesome New York you're just immersed you know you're immersed in people you know you walk down the street in New York and this is fuckin people are everywhere man they're coming at you you're coming at them it's wild it's a different kind of way of living I get it all the people that love it you know my friend Jeff he's lived there forever since I met him he's my manager and he fuckin loves it loves New York just loves it loves knowing all the good spots you know loves knowing how to get around the subway he doesn't even need a man loves it he loves it I go there I'm like Jesus Christ I just I just go and I go wow yeah that's how I feel about New York too ah but it's great it's great and I get it that you would want to live there I get it if you especially like creative types but Judah Friedlander was telling us it's like all bankers now he says because he goes it's so fucking expensive to live in Manhattan it's not like this you know this giant artists community anymore it goes everybody's sort of been pushed out to Brooklyn and pushed out to the other boroughs it's so expensive I looked up somebody like a celebrity accidentally put out his address the other day I'm like oh I want to know what he lists you know he lives in that little two-bedroom apartment 3.7 million dollars and I was just what yeah he's been blogging from it and just looks like a basic apartment 40 minutes out of Nashville 2.7 3.7 that what you said how much 3.7 3.7 million dollars will buy you a goddamn farm I'm gonna have a giant ass farm with like 400 acres of land and a beautiful house with a view maybe I have a Creek in your backyard that's what you get for 3.7 million dollars yeah you're not supposed to get a fucking apartment no basic apartment is it that Chelsea district so I think that's a good spot I guess I don't know anything about New York yeah I know that one spot that was really good that everybody's trying to convince me I should move to flooded what's that one spot down in the under the base of New York what's that one place where they all love it financial district down there yeah there's like but there's an area down there that's like real ritzy Meatpacking District yeah but they don't call it's got another name Hell's Kitchen no no I don't know Chelsea no it's not that I know people in New Yorker scream there's some I'll remember later but it flooded like real bad like my friends elevator had seven feet of water in it yeah like your Lobby you go into the lobby was filled with water starts with a tea god damn it's driving me crazy [Laughter] so we went there to visit once back in the dizzay when my older daughter was going to college and when we drove around like to see what it'd be like to live in New York we were like you guys are high educated you park there's no way to park if you want a parking spot it cost you like 2,000 bucks like that kind of it like maybe if because you if you don't like cars you'd like New York better but like if you have a car yeah well there's freedom that we have there's a freedom of just being able to get in your car and just you know drive down to a deli at 1:00 in the morning and park and get out with your friends and does that freedom that you have to just go wherever you want with cars once you get used to that and you get used to not being on top of people like the subway you get just like you get spoiled you get spoiled but there's a benefit to being on top of people - New York is way more diverse in terms of the way people interact with each other like their you your walk like rich people or walking down the street with poor people or walking up the street and everybody's together there's no everybody together in LA you know so no time where everybody just intermingles it's like people stay in their neighborhoods or they go out to bars and restaurants and they go back to their neighborhoods they're not walking past each other for prolonged periods of time to and from work you know in the neighborhood going from place to place just walking around it's kind of ironic that the most urban place is the place where the people walk the most kind of ironic right yeah I mean any place any place that's less urban everybody just drives everywhere because it's easy you just get in your car and drive somewhere but there it's so hard to park everybody just walks no imagine if everybody in New York had a car that would be the most ridiculous thing ever you you actually couldn't do it right no how many million people are in New York in Manhattan just Manhattan that lived there yeah what do you think like seven no it's less than that because like Brooklyn's way bigger really yeah most people driving into the city okay better the day when they leave let's let's take a bet I bet it's more than that it's five he's five I just heard a discussion about the other day Oh would you hear it on that like some guys talking about Brooklyn if it was on its own not part of the boroughs it would be like the fifth largest city in the country is this guy just someone hanging out with you or no no there's a podcast discussion Oh live in New York that's the problem I heard this I heard shit let's google it I say five million what do you say 3.7 oh that's a good hedge your bet news and you say to Manhattan yeah yeah a million Wow Wow holy shit hmm that doesn't seem right mmm Manhattan like the borough or all of New York City no just me just banana yeah yeah I bet it's bigger than that so it's like a Burbank at night one leaves there's no one actually there's no way it's a million there's so many people that live there 1.6 Wow oh my god that's bonkers does that in the 30s 31.6 and how many visit there to work every day that's that's gotta be fuckin it stupendous what do you guess every day 3.7 I'm saying 5 5 million visitors how many 65.2 main tourist in a year oh but that's tourists I mean commuters like you out there yeah how many people didn't commute there every day 3.7 it's uh it's an interesting life man and those people that love it when they go somewhere else it says Oden 0.62 3.12 commute every day so doubles oh that's it huh 3.1 Wow I would have guessed it would be I would have guessed that Manhattan was like 7 million people what is like the hole all over New York City all the borough's today at all it's like close like 10 or 11 12 get everything all together but but Manhattan itself yeah what's a lot of fucking rich people you see some of the places that are for sale in Manhattan I I don't know what happened but I got on a YouTube thing where I started watching these ridiculous apartment buildings in New York City that they build where they build them specifically for like you know some crazy Arab oil dude who's got a shit ton of money wants the dopest fucking house on the planet earth or some hedge fund guys about to get busted before he one thing what's go out with a bang ray spend all his money but they have elevators and fucking theaters and huge home spas and they have some of them actually have garages you can actually park in a garage in New York City it shows like the crowning jewel of this building a garage you actually can park your car and do York City Wow what is wrong what did you do yeah it's it's weird being on Facebook my friends are realtor and he'll just post like : here here's a 8 bedroom unit in Texas two hundred thousand dollars and you're just looking at like that Scarface's house like I want to buy that yeah you'd have to if you lived in Texas would you go Austin there's two moves no this 3mo is really hard there's Austin if you're like you know what a hand tattoo was yeah I love craft beer and uh I like I like going to see live bands or your Houston where it's like you really love oil money or Dallas I would definitely not do Houston because of the weather too funky yeah it's too humid it's hot and it's too much to drown like flooding lately in control right like my ex-girlfriends house her parents house got flooded like four times they rebuilt it and then it got flood rebuilt it one time when we were we were at the laugh stop and after we left the entire city went underwater like the hotel where we were staying that doesn't exist anymore because it went underwater yeah it's the laugh stop yeah Dallas is my favor because you could always drive to Austin then you can get out before anybody just annoys you in Dallas is pretty close to Los Angeles it's got a lot of money and it's very rich and so everywhere you go it feels very la and they have less healers per capita yeah fucking love Austin I love Austin but there's there's a high percentage of knuckleheads that are like wrapped up in the spiritual sort of aspects of nonsense takes one Rock story death ruin that oh my god one person who's a channeler who's doing seances at their house picking up right now no protecting you know people need money people need money they're not gonna spend their fuckin money on some nonsense that in the back of their head they know it was nonsense you hearing way way way way way less people complain about nonsense right now you know you know you don't hear the the standard outrage at stupid shit what you're hearing now is people really concerned about people's lives you know and I'm I'm hoping that this is gonna last that this feeling of understanding that we are really vulnerable we're all we're in this together we really are you know and sometimes it takes something like this to happen where you go oh shit but no we really are we're in this together we just didn't realize it cuz it was easy it was easy to get by it's really cool seeing the neighborhood aspect of it like I've been I don't know if you're on next door I how you're on next door it'll be hilarious but next door it's like you know like it's a reddit thread for your neighborhood and just hearing people like hey does anyone have toilet paper and sometimes I'll drop off lemons my lemon tree you know and just like helping each other out it's like it's pretty pretty beautiful it didn't happen before this you know it's very cool it's funny saying lemons my next-door neighbor she was handing out lemons yesterday she had a bucket free lemons come take some lemons just set it out in front of the house yeah it's some there's good parts to being scared you realize you know people get cocky man it's one of the reasons why I like weed one of the lick I've talked about this and people think I'm kidding but one of the reasons why I like weed is it makes me paranoid I like it I can get cocky people get cocky you get confused you know you can you can start believing some pretty stupid things about just life in general if you're not humbled by a little fear sometimes just a little nervousness just a little anxiety just a little lookup it's the sky what would we do if an asteroid shower just came down unannounced and just completely wiped out the power grid you want to talk about death and disease what we're experiencing now is this is a fucking dry run for a real apocalyptic event this is nothing this is nothing in comparison stuff that could happen we got cocky we didn't think it could happen because nothing had happened so long and we'd find these craters and we like look we found a spot where everybody died and you know 200,000 years ago oh look here's a spot where the dinosaurs were killed 65 million years ago there's all these spots where they keep finding these gigantic fucking craters there's where Noah's Ark crashed people that are really just looking for Noah's Ark you missed the point remember that guy from a long time ago and made the video Noah's Ark oh yeah only what happened to that guy didn't that guy want us to go look at it yeah no you're like what are you gonna show me a big boat I'm like bro but if you're coming to me you already fucked up you know you're coming to me to release your Noah's Ark information I don't think this is real sir but I think the Noah's Ark story is look you just have to put it through the filter of time right we're talking about thousands and thousands of years ago and we're talking about people likely telling a story for hundreds if not thousands of years before it ever gets written down and all these different versions of it get tossed around but the heart of the Noah's Ark story is the cataclysmic event happens and this one guy collects a bunch of animals and he restarts civilization that is you could easily put that through the filter of interpretation and say I bet what happened was there was a small group of people survived some sort of massive cataclysmic event and one guy convinced someone or they made it up that he knew it was coming and that God had been talking to him so that's why he was able to to lead everybody and then after they tell the story 3,000 different times it gets all wacked out and you know God comes down and tells him no you got to build a boat so he builds this boat and everybody laughs at him he brings on two of each animal you know it's a dumbest story ever it's a but it's a story that clearly it's not a real story right because I you know had that bit about if you told that to a five-year-old kid with mental handicap he would be like there's a lot of holes in that story that bit was but the accuracy of his like animals eat other animals you can't just have two of each animal on a boat that's ridiculous that doesn't make any sense that makes zero sense like what are you doing why are you lying to me something else happened but what they're trying to say is some animals survived and civilization restarted they didn't know how big the world was back then people 4,000 years ago whatever it was when they first wrote these stories down or even had these ideas those people had no idea how big the world was they were in their spot if some shit went down in your spot you thought the world was ending you know q imagine if you're living near Pompeii when that Mount Vesuvius blows and the whole fucking town gets covered in ash and everybody dies imagine if you live in anywhere near there you would think that hell just broke out in in the world you wouldn't think Oh in you know Thailand right now they're just chilling on the beach you wouldn't think that you would think it's over like this for everyone everywhere meanwhile on the other side of the world in fucking New Zealand they didn't even know what happened you have no idea they're just hanging out meanwhile these people are dead as fuck covered in ash over New Zealand they're just hanging out you know like that's how the world is the world's been huge and if some shit goes down in one part back then you didn't know so if you one of the people survived when some shit went down you would write about it and then people would talk and they'd tell that story and they pass it on to other people and they pass it on to other people and somewhere through these stories they've figured out it's like a framework in here for telling people that shit could go down and that we have to work together and that we have to believe in a higher power and that if you believe in a higher power and you believe is something else it's bigger and better than you you'll do better things while you're here you know that's it's so obvious obviously I could be wrong too but my that's that's my take on it and I think we've just had this giant stretch where none of those things happened you know we've had a couple of hundred years of pretty easy life in terms of natural disasters you know you got your occasional hurricane again if you were there you would think it's hell if you were where the tornado hits when we're chilling here in LA and the tornado hits Louisiana we feel bad you see all 36 people died in a tornado we feel bad but you don't feel it you know you don't know the sky monsters coming to take your loved ones but if you're there that sky monster is a real thing it's a sky monster just cuz it doesn't have fangs just cuz it doesn't laugh at you oh it's ripping your family apart and throwing fuckin bait bathtubs in the air and you ever seen well there's one video of a semi like a semi truck spinning in the sky was it twist it hit a parking area for semi trucks and these semi trucks were literally getting flown around the air yeah yeah we found this before dude it might be twister oh my god just like twist it's just like twister but it's real and it's metal tip this is a fucking it's probably several thousand pounds and they're just getting flown through the air by the sky monster now imagine if a huge dinosaur came through town and did the exact same amount of damage killed the exact same amount of people like fucking Godzilla's real oh shit it's a fucking lizard monster but we're not scared to the sky monster the way we are of the lizard monster you would never live in the land with the lizard monster car and he just disappears this goes back up in the class over there mountains you know he's coming like fuck we got to get out of here that's just like the sky monster but he doesn't chase you sky monsters blind he just whatever is in his path if he gets lucky and catches a town and just rips that fucker apart but if he just goes through the swamp and sends alligators into the area that he doesn't give a fuck sky monsters just doing sky monster type shit he's not targeting specific individuals but the lizard monster would that's the only difference like if Godzilla's real yes if God's it was real and he only went to Louisiana who the fuck is gonna live live in Louisiana imagine if Godzilla's proven Godzilla's never gone outside the boundaries of Louisiana everybody's running from Godzilla no one in the movies leaves Tokyo they stay there they just like Godzilla's back still there Godzilla into all these tornados this virus I've been saying this about all viruses that diseases are like demons you know and we just if we were losing like have you seen the numbers - this is something that my friend Steve who's a doctor sent me and this is a fucking cricket a series of crazy statistics but the crazy statistics about how many people died like it puts it into perspective I mean and all life lost is valuable all life lost is a tragedy I'm not saying anything other than that but what I'm just I'm not diminishing anyone's loss of life but what I am saying is I was stunned when I saw the actual numbers so 2017 - tooth - 2018 h2 n3 pandemic killed 61 thousand Americans did you know that I didn't know that I know that did you know that Jam I've heard numbers like that recently yeah but not before 2017 - 2018 hospitalized thirty thousand four hundred fifty three an estimated effected was eight hundred and ninety four thousand seven hundred people buy that flu that's crazy overall death rate was seven point five with a peak in January 2018 of ten point eight again I'm a moron not a doctor reading you a text message maybe I shouldn't be doing that maybe someone should look into this 2009 pandemic no this is the one that Burt said he had he said that h1n1 it killed eighty three thousand three hundred Americans death rates range from 4 percent to 33 percent for pediatric zero to 22 percent for 18 is 64 for 0 to 4 percent for those over 65 man this is crazy us case is 60 point eight million two hundred seventy four thousand hospitalized twelve thousand four hundred and sixty nine deaths in the u.s. like I'm just going over all these different ones that happen flu of the year of 2020 cases reported 45 million hospitals hospitalizations four and a 15,000 deaths forty-eight thousand that's for the 2020 flu this flu season there's so many people that die of the flu but obviously this says when you see health care workers freaking out you know this is different so what is different about it that's it's all at the same time yeah it's all at the same time it's new it's a new virus people don't they don't have immunity for it they don't really know how to cure it and it attacks the respiratory system and it seems to have a real quick turnaround from I'm not feeling so good too I'm dead you know it's it happens very quickly for some people shockingly so some of these were in and it seems to affect different people in different ways but there's a lot going on with this one that has smart people going we need to fucking stay home for a bit just everybody chill no large gatherings just chill do you ever get the flu shot every year I mean like I feel like I get the flu almost every year but I never did the flu shot like it seems you should do the other thing I don't know like I didn't get last year I don't get the flu shot yeah yeah yeah it seems like it said I've survived and been healthy but just eating well and not getting the flu shot and then making sure I'm in the sauna and I exercise well and sleep well and I've been able to shake it off but it's a good move it's probably I probably should get the flu shot and if I got the flu again maybe I'd be like fuck man I should've got the flu shot let me just get that flu shot but I mean whether it's diet or whether it's um all that shit I'm on all the different vitamins and hormones and the fact that I'm in the fucking sauna for 25 minutes every day but I rarely get sick it seems like you would get it more just because you're around like you know gyms and saunas and my places where there's a lot of sweat and the only cooties I've gotten in the gym and scare me is staff yeah I've gotten staff a couple of times that scares me if you're get ringworm yeah I got that a bunch of times I got that twice at least maybe three times which is not that bad you put lamisil on it stay off the mat for a little bit and then the products that I started using prevented or saved me from that a company called defense soap yeah that's the shit because it's all-natural stuff it's all tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil and it's it's not antibiotic in that it doesn't kill off all the good bacteria it just coats your body with this soap and it's all like natural it it kills the bad bacteria but it doesn't kill good bacteria I don't understand how that works folks but people have known that forever the tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil are good for infections and preventing infection I use exam I like a yeasty boy I'm very yeasty are you yeah mmm used infections I give it I give them you give them out you're lucky if you like awards yeah but I've been lucky with diseases knock on wood but it's uh you know this is a weird one if you're if you're compromised you know people that have lung issues or people that have had like vaping yeah I think cigarettes and vaping and I want a weed smoker so because I know it's always like well you know it's not good right right yeah it's like how bad is it for you Tommy Chong still going I mean I'm gonna he's my canary in a coal mine or hey cuz Willie Nelson's out of the game Willie Nelson moved over to the Edible game 100% yes he did take the smoking anymore Wow yeah smoking was fucking him up so he moved over to the edible game still fuck's your lungs and you skipped off making psychedelic songs at night yeah how many times not to sing right it's true singsong so yeah and the just the just a smoke just a hot smoke apparently the number of you know joints that that guy can put away it's supposed to be terrifying Toby Keith wrote a song about it I'll never smoke wolf weakness Willie again he wrote a song about gettin high with Willie like everybody says that you get high with Willie snip verses Willie hit he got I got a COO I go with Snoop all day yeah out of respect but Snoop is such a G he might lay down he might take a dive just for Willie so it really feels better you know it's like true I can win another day this is Willie Nelson you know Snoop Dogg might he might take a dive in that one but if they really wanted to go head-to-head snoops gonna be awake for days just still smoking blunts time not that he can't but I think he does like snoop fucking tears down blunts yeah I don't know what what Willie used to smoke cigarettes right so I bet he avoids blunts or he loves him I know a lot of people that quit smoking they're like no I'm a blunt guy okay we know what's going on here exactly I know a guy who used cigars to get off of cigarettes started smoking cigars and got his nicotine fix but you know was felt better because it wasn't inhaling and just you know you just keep it in your mouth so your breath stinks and smell up the place wherever you're at yeah you don't like cigars no I don't mind um it I just like when you go to a place like they say you're the comedy store front patio and five people are smoking cigars it's kind of like get me the fuck out of here yeah that's a little little dick swing yeah you know yeah because you're pretty much just getting younger yeah are you making people smell you like if you go to what the best place to go is wallow cigar bars yeah cuz there's a bunch of other cigar dorks in there and you guys can all get together and apparently is this true our cigar bars essential is that one of those essential businesses that are open I mean pot shops are can imagine yeah cuz here's the thing people do get addicted to tobacco so what do you do about that do you say hey now's the time to quit right sorry you can't you can't go anywhere or do you let them if that's how they get their tobacco fix do you let them what do you think I would say they're non-essential but I mean look at gun shops man I my studio in Burbank spy three gun shops I did had no idea but there's three right next door to me and there's lines going down the street like a mile long just to get a gun yeah we have a 10-day waiting great yeah but still ten days later you got a gun right lot of liberals change their fucking tune I have quite a few friends who would never consider having a gun I had a conversation with one of them yesterday he's like I've never had a gun in my life never considered a gun I have a gun now I'm like yeah that's probably smart yeah yeah better to have it not to need it than to need it not to have it right and you know I'm hoping people come together I'm not hoping this turns into some crazy shootout in the streets but I am I'm happy that people understand why people wanted guns in the first place you know because these things can happen and right now nothing nothing has happened nothing really bad but we're in a state of chaos and states of chaos deteriorate or they go away they don't you know it's not like this is the new normal I don't think if it's just like this then great we don't need any more guns basically you know it's like you've got a good amount of guns it's not like everybody needs to go out and get a gun and never considered it before but if it gets crazy then you should have a gun right look if you don't want to have a gun I don't think you should have to have a gun but what are you gonna do if the whole thing completely falls apart imagine this scenario how would you feel if there's only a few people in your neighborhood with guns and there was people that were coming in and robbing killing people because we had gone all Walking Dead because the power had been off from the asteroid shower for six months there's no way to even tell these people are coming but there's only two people in your block with guns but there's thirty houses well what the fuck are you gonna do you only have two guns and there's 38 that's not good see that's what we were scared of what people were scared of and maybe they're wrong but the peppers right now the ones laughing their asses off the people with you know fucking jarred peaches and shit those people that you see on TV with their own well they're laughing right now they're laughing they're hoping it deteriorates even further cuz they could take over they could be the king yeah I I wish I had a gun right now like I I have like a bunch of fake guns and I think you know yeah I mean I I'm one of those guys though that you know I didn't grow up with guns so they're kind of intimidating and I feel like I'm somebody that one night would be wasted like I make a funny youtube video do that flash guns on Twitch when I'm shooting yourself you know it's like it's just you you know the problem is you could just buy a gun if you're not a criminal right if you want to drive a car you gotta take a test but a car is not specifically designed to kill someone it can kill someone accidentally it's not specifically designed to kill someone a gun it's specifically designed to kill and you don't even have to fucking show you know how to use it right that's that worries me too because that line by my house was a lot of middle aged Karen's you know like like oh god did they train you they're like I don't even know the the process it seems like a should go through like a training gun course you definitely should and better not pull a prank on Karen alright Tara might be locked and loaded on a teen you know pissing in her carpet because she's too scared to get up and she's sure that sound is a serial killer making its way up her stairs he wants her cousin coming to check in on that kind of stuff happens yeah people are nuts man and you just get a gun if you're not a criminal you know you'll have mental health problems you could just get a gun and you definitely should know how to use it and it's just there's two schools of thought the Texas School thought is a well armed society as a polite society and guess what they're right in a lot of ways that's right to another school taught is wouldn't it be great if no one had a gun and you never had to worry about getting shot yup yup that's good too also wouldn't it be great if the government was awesome and he knew they would never turn tyrannical on you yeah that'd be good yeah they'll be good but that's not true right because the government's made it a people and look at China you know what what's happening in China happening here right we all agree to that we don't want to live another military dictatorship I don't care how good it looks that sounds terrible for us we don't want that so we know that's real it's happening right now other people trapped in a country they can't even use a real internet right they can't even they can't even get on Twitter they can't get on Facebook Bryan Callen did a movie there they took his phone away they gave him a new phone with Chinese social media on it like you could use this is it they wouldn't let him on Twitter you couldn't go on Instagram yeah it needs a VPN you can't work it doesn't work the blocking do they block everything over there apparently was some VPNs work in Hong Kong but Hong Kong's not you know it's sort of a different situation than mainland China bro it's it's weird that people can live the way those Chinese people are under the fist of a government that like pulls people out of stir did you see those people that got dragged away cuz they tested positive for Corona where's where are those people going you know landfill yeah that's happening at the same time as us as we have so much freedom the people are like looking for shit to get upset about you know like taking some of Trump and Trump no doubt has said ridiculous shit that's not my point is not it's not that he's infallible and he's always right it's that you're wasting time playing gotcha with the President of the United States in the middle of a pandemic like why you know yeah he's gonna say dumb shit get used to it but don't don't harp on that let's figure out what the fuck needs to be done that's what we need to figure out and I don't think anybody knows you know they're waiting in New York for it to peak and so that's why they wanted all those ventilators and they're gonna set up they're gonna set up some things in parks and shit in the Javits Center apparently they're going to set up some sort of a temporary hospital unit this is crazy it's really cool saying all the manufacturing plans like Tesla and stuff making ventilators and converting their factories to make handsome yes and stuff like that people who know how to make masks and shit yeah training Marisa I Shorty's like brother a friend or D from calmly said yeah yeah I think was Jordi his brother is one printing out the mass there's quite a few companies that are doing that that's very cool yeah yeah it's um ooh bro weird times to put it mildly right yeah nothing feels normal you wake up in the morning like how am I supposed to feel wake up in the morning we talk I mean I think now it's like I go tomorrow Mike okay nothing to do tomorrow at all well I guess I could just stay up all night and you know go to sleep when I want to leo now you I went to bed at like 9:00 in the morning it's like fer all night and ate mushrooms like right now eating mushrooms is a little too crazy though I wish like halfway through I was like this is like I'm that where you're going and thinking you know it was a little rough we just have to know that this now we know that this can happen now we know we didn't know we we weren't getting all the information but just the things that also are deadly that also affect so many people like that list that I read off is that right saying that shit I read right what do you think it seems like it would be I mean nowadays like you get all these like doctor lists on Facebook you never know what's real and what this is from a friend of mine who's a legitimate doctor is that correct those numbers correct we should probably say let's uh let's google the numbers again so what did I say would start off with the first one the first one was Michael yell apparently put out a video today oh yeah he's back okay let's look at this one the 2017 to 2018 H two and three virus pandemic that killed 61 thousand looking that up the hardest part with that right now is those numbers have been accumulated over a year plus and we only have had a month sure every day yeah I mean that even says 2017 2018 over a year it killed 61 thousand people now the other one was the big one at the end the flu for this year for 20 20 cases reported 45 million hospitalizations 415 thousand deaths 48,000 that's worldwide no it's the United States oh really yeah Wow I know that's what I'm saying I haven't even heard about the flu this year but that's the thing it's like it's not sexy because it happens every right you know it's like the sky monster if this guy monster never appeared before and then one day the first tornado hit and tore apart Nashville we'd be like what in the fuck is God's mad at us right that's how they used to feel back in this just one person's case I read rumor last week I read someone that got tested for the flu and they tested positive and then weeks later got tested for the Cova 19 and then tested positive for that but they weren't tested for kovat at the time they're tested for the flu because they didn't have a test Brian so there could be a lot of people that tested positive for the flu maybe that sure never had a kovat 19 test yeah could be yeah I mean do they mean I guess it depends on whether or not they have the test available in different places - right I'm just not reading - there's a new test I just got just made today that's good faster results oh yeah yeah there's a five-minute test like it's like a Easy Bake Oven of testing Jamie what are we gonna do if you test positive oh yeah I don't know yeah you're in contact bro I already have it then I mean I could because I'm testing positive doesn't mean right could be yes it means you're out there spreading it carrier get out of here don't pet my dog fuck oh oh that's too late I didn't even think of that I don't did they set the email out what was yesterday Saturday I guess so like it's too late did that when the fuck did they get it right when they got it to the hospital and called them are moving instead hey you might wanna let everybody know you washing your hands a lot you guys doing the whole thing oh yeah I'm washing the shit out of my hands my hands are anointed me to ride like I'm lucky I got some hand sanitizer like Oh before the yeah the grapes right before it happened to crash I was opening up for Tom Green in San Diego and Tom Green was the first person that I knew that was kind of like panicking a little like he looks like I just bought a crate of Lysol mini Lysol and he was spraying the microphone down onstage and like and I was like he's taking a little overboard literally like a week later everyone's doing that Tom Green ahead of the curve yeah yeah fuck it's a it's spooky dude who was it that had a friend was it Tom papa whose friend was warning him long in advance no it wasn't Tom papa it was Bert Kreischer Bert Kreischer had a friend who was warning him way in advance listen you need to isolate you need to get your family out he was like what was Bert right yeah sure doc you're just you need to isolate quickly get away from everybody because it's gonna spread right through America it was like what and this was apparently in February he was like this lady's crazy Wow and then he texted her like in the beginning of March when it was on and poppin he's like you're right my point about showing those numbers was not to diminish the impact of this current pandemic it was just to highlight the fact that we live in a war zone we live in a virus war zone that takes out thousands of people every year in this country and I don't think most of us are really keeping our eye on that you know like you hear about deaths by the flu and you know they're never there never shocking deaths by some new thing for some reason even if it's the same number of deaths or less even right so far less freaked us the fuck out you think it's happening more though like if you go on TMZ is like somebody dies every day like this old you know philosopher or this old poet or this whole musician and it's like you never heard that in the past like oh he died of the flu that guy died of flu that guy died of flu here we go Jimmy just pulled some up a total of 19 thousand 543 laboratory confirmed influenza associated hospitalizations were reported blah by flu serve - net sites between October 2019 and March 21 20 2014 one hundred seventy two point one percent were associated with info a virus what's that it's like 14,000 14,000 what did I say 41 oh whoops one of my dyslexic influence okay five thousand three hundred thirty-five 27.3% with influenza B that's true too right if you get an influenza a shot and yet it's influenza B you might catch it anyway that's annoying so that's a lot of people right so we got nineteen thousand five hundred and five thousand three hundred and four thousand fourteen thousand one hundred you know my theory is that you're you you're born sucking your thumb you're supposed to suck your thumb your whole life and it was supposed to keep your immune system strong so that it would fight all this look at the hospitalization rate was sixty seven point three percent per no 67.3% seasons except for the 2017-2018 season rates in children zero to four years old in adults 18 to 49 are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups surpassing the rate reported during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic hospitalization rates for school-aged children are higher than any recent regular season but lower than rates during the pandemic what so what happened in 2009 when the h1n1 kicked in and killed all those people they didn't shut anything down when I think what I've been hearing is like after a thousand people died is when things started changing and I don't I don't really remember what was changing back then I don't either do you remember know if you talk to bird again it's bird had it he had the h1n1 he did yeah he did yeah he said there's the sickest he's ever been in his life and it was 2009 when it was all going down and he said he couldn't sleep he was so uncomfortable he was in just constant pain and aching said never never felt sicker ever in his life and that killed a lot of people I had a flu like that before where you know you're just puking shit and you can't hold anything in you're sweating you're waking up you know does that 2009 I don't think it was I feel like it was like five years ago or something like six years ago get you they can get you I hope another thing that comes out of here is people take their fucking immune system more severe seriously support your immune system you know I mean if this makes a bit just a little shift in the number of people that get healthy little shift the number a number of people that start taking vitamins and exercising and you know just do something man something put a heavy backpack on go for a walk do something listen to a podcast oh I'm listening to this Aaron Hernandez podcast oh wondering has this podcast called gladiator about Aaron Hernandez holy shit first of all it's a great podcast you ever listen to wondering mm-hm they know what they're doing man they it's like really good editing and sound editing and they they put depth to it with all these different sound effects and stuff and different just different people's interviews and discussions people that knew Aaron Hernandez what holy fuck what a crazy story did you like you watched the tiger thing RV's i have only watched one part of one episode okay I'm saving the fries I know I went through all episodes in one sitting last night and I have gone down so many Tiger rabbit holes I'm terrified to start another one you remember I have that whole bit that I had about Texas and tigers from triggered dude I went on a rabbit hole of tiger owners and people that owned tigers in their backyard loved it like you loved the Wild West it's like yeah I know no but you got to see this it's every person and there's so many twists and turns you're like this is not real life this is not didn't happen like but it did yeah yeah listen I have all the faith in the world that white trash people could be unbelievable yeah but so much more to it that's like insane that we haven't heard of this guy before like I don't like I know right okay he also had an internet show for during all this like an Alex Jones type internet show I feel like I would have seen it cuz they snail it was like Joe TV and I'm like of course back in the show exotic to you yeah yeah now did he have it on YouTube or they don't have it on Ustream back in the day like we did that's what I'm saying like how did we not see this nicely wrong but uh yeah I didn't care that much back then about people living with tires shakeela Niles an 11 Louis you might have already seen some of the stuff and not know it's the room he did a documentary with Joe exotic Oh did Joe exotic have his legs back then or no Joe had his legs the whole time I was one of the guys that worked for ya lost his legs but yeah oh he does the whole hour long like old documentary with him oh no shit yeah I'd like to see that yeah I got obsessed with him last night I just you know added him on Instagram looking back at all the photos and Louie throws that shit his documentaries are so good he's absolutely one of my favorite because he's got this style of talking to people that eventually annoys them in to yell at him whether it's whether it's the Westboro Baptist Church or my favorite one was this he was at this wild game park in Africa where people go over there and like shoot rhinos and you know they pay X amount for that and why I'm out for this and he interviews these people in these wild game parks and he stays there for like three weeks and eventually just annoys this guy to the point where the guy snaps and his just ran about Africa about the only way that these animals are ever gonna survive is if they're worth something he's like Africa he's fucked the way we saying it to him was like this really intense speech that he gave to through like all the Roos annoying him for all those days and standing by him this so you were about to feed the tiger it wasn't Tigers but he had lions and they were throwing they like a dead cow and they threw it over whether it was throwing these chunks over the fence and these lions would just tear it apart and I'm like oh my god and he's there standing there watching us through like two fences with then there's a pickup truck and you look in these things eyes they look fucking ferocious and so angry they look so angry that during that cage and so angry that they they have to get their food this way and he was just the pastor in this dude pastoring them it's it's great it's one of my favorite documentaries ever on how perplexing that situation is in Africa they have more animals there than ever like all their different animals that were on the verge of extinction are now thriving but the driving because they're valuable and people go over there shoot them so it's like Oh whoo what do you make of that that's people that's people we're so messy like we never do anything like like these animals were on the verge of extinction but now due to the generous donations of the millions of people in the world these animals are healthy and they're they're thriving and numbers greater than we've ever seen before we could just go out in a car and watch these lions take out these gazelles there's no way they'd pay for it that way for if you want if you want to make real money you got to make it valuable for people to go over there and shoot those things and eat them that's just focus it's kind of crazy because it's the only way that it works like we're so selfish but on the other hand I heard kudu meat is delicious really yeah I heard it's the best if you want to go shoot a kudu you go over there with your friends enjoy a nice hump nice cooked meals it's cool ooh everywhere you go out you shoot one take a picture with it anyway - good time in Africa you eat it yeah we hate it was awesome brought a bunch of it back froze it I mean you're eating burgers anyway isn't it better to just go out there and shoot a kudu with a rifle and have a crazy story behind it and a memory that you'll never forget and also a respect but we don't think about it that way we think god damn it they're only worth something if you shoot at them it would be nice it was both maybe there's competing conservation efforts like one conservation effort like the people that want no animals getting shot look you guys can have this ranch let's see how you do and then the people that want to pay to shoot animals have the other ranch now that ranch has a fuckload of money how one's gonna do better the one that operates on donations are the one where people fly from Cincinnati to shoot a COO oh I bet the one where they fly and they pay to shoot a kudu I bet that one does better live similarities with this tiger maybe man well Texas doesn't mean it's another place where Texas is like they don't give a fuck that's a that's a whole different kind of America remember Ohio when we they had to change that law and I think with Zanesville where the guy yeah he let all his animals out and sighs yeah yeah we watched that we watched clips of that in the Joe exotic that the tiger king when you see the beginning of it that's really disturbing you see all those animals those cops had a shoot yeah virtual reality hunting it's probably gonna be the future act did you ever see Tyson when he's explaining to me what why he got a tiger yeah I love Tyson man have you been listening to his podcast he's great he's he's great he's so genuine he's so genuine look that's what we all want you know whether we agree with you or not agree with you we want you to be there for real like maybe you're making mistakes maybe you're looking at things the wrong way but I want you to I can't listen unless I know that you're really there Mike Tyson is really there when he's talking about anything he's not bullshitting you he's not an actor putting on a facade he's he's Mike Tyson and there's something about that man that especially in like these fucked up times where everything is confusing it's very refreshing to see someone's authentic take on the world and be honest about their journey in life and whose journey in life has been more strange and out of the ordinary and spectacular than Mike fucking Tyson I mean Mike Tyson has had one of the most extraordinary lives a human being has ever had ever you know some people they might try to diminish that in some way because he's had some run-ins with the law or because of the nature of the way he became famous by being the most violent man on the planet the the you know the best heavyweight boxer of his era but he to get to be someone like he is you have to have some extraordinary horsepower inside your will like your will is a supercharged engine there's something about that guys will in his mind he might not be the the most articulate most well-read most studied man on earth he's not that but he's extraordinary he you have to be extraordinary to do what he did there's no way around it he it was so much better than anybody else when he was coming up and you could only maintain that kind of power and that that kind of ferocity for a certain amount of time I feel like a person at that kind of pace that he was at you can't really maintain that very long he was such a destroyer but he go back and watch him knocking out Michael Spinks and knocking out Marvis Frazier and just smashing Larry Holmes when Larry Holmes was still I think Larry Holmes was in 30 s he was still I mean wasn't in his prime but he was still Larry fucking Holmes he smashed everybody and missed those days of like watching TV they old Tyson fights I was like a Super Bowl every time like you know just getting right it was a family affair you know the family I know everyone would get together so you'd get mad if he was gonna fight someone who's gonna be like 15 seconds like fucking Bruce Seldon come on man you get mad just a little clip of them before the fury wild or fight meet Chad Johnson in the back of the arena oh no shit and all right watch what the interaction with why this win it big is because the interaction when you notice is the cameraman behind Chad Johnson yeah we gonna get pulled I'm not gonna play the whole thing on it's only like 10 seconds okay it went pretty viral what went viral about watch here we go would you deal with that phone Oh how would you not shit your pants yeah Mike Tyson is tired of people filming him I I found him to be very sincere I really enjoy his company like I enjoyed talking to him before the show it was it's kind of surreal I met him at the common excuse me at the UFC I met him at UFC a few years back I got a photo with him and he's like you that dude who smokes all that weed man Mike Tyson knowing who I was was just strange him wearing that bikers jacket the old black classic yeah like that looks cool back yeah he's an interesting guy man for sure I like I love that he's got his podcasts he was gonna he'd they asked me to be on it through Skype I'm just gonna wait I want to be their person man where's he recorded wait till that shit blows over and then I'll go visit he's ok he's great man yeah he's um he's he's getting really good at this him and Eminem oh shit yeah yeah yeah very interesting mm get a black beard what happened he died everything his face hair I don't think he had face no I think he bleached his hair when it was blond right is that what it is yeah so that's his real hair color yeah dad are you okay he probably does it I do put a little just four men on it and the beard yeah that shit can fuck your face up man I did a rabbit hole one day on the just for men and I saw this guy that his face burned yeah a like burns like chemical burns on his face from maybe it wasn't just remember some kind of hair dye proud well find out you gotta wash it out yeah just for men well he wanted it really dark oh yeah he wanted to really freak people out see but Google like hair dye face burn shaming it's fucking chemical man shave my head last night because it George Greg Fitzsimmons Mannion like Greg when he got rid of the sides I needed a haircut I might there's gonna be a month till I get a haircut yeah there's something about the sides that hold you back if you're bald male besides I was she doing a lot of ass and I just sort of thinking about this you're supposed to like test hair dye on your skin just to make sure you don't have any sort of bad reactions to bro who's reading that dude's all read when I bleached my hair you know I used to bleach my hair like once a year it would there be burns there'd be scabs in my hair I would just peel scales because it just fried my head well they said that there's a link that they're exploring between women dyeing their hair and breast cancer have you read this yeah there's always a link that's a scary link though man but if you think about if a woman is dying or hair on a regular basis how often the chicks dye their hair every two months it's gray imagine if you take in poison every two months because your skin is you know the dermis of your skin the epidermis your skin absorbs all kinds of stuff I mean your skin absorbs magnesium through the float tank this one says it's for permanent hair dye and chemical hair straighteners so it's not quite the same as like what most people use most people use like a sim what is what is for permanent hair dye the researchers say women use permanent hair dye and chemical have a chemical hair straighteners have a higher risk for breast oh okay so it's not the temporary hair dye that most gals get right so all these chicks going great need to cut it out I'd like it if you pretend you're not aging please yeah go back what would you rather have though woman had long gray hair or just shaved her head I don't listen man answers question however experts say women shouldn't give up hair products based on this study alone what experts say will fucking I hate when they say that experts say who experts in what well I'm really good at Parcheesi yeah I don't know anybody man I'm going Eddie Bravo on this bitch they're all lying liars they're all in bed with the fucking dye company um for chicks the head shave is a scary move yeah it's a scary move that off this I'm gangster gals have done that during isolation they've they've shaved their fucking heads gone with the crew cuts are wearing wigs girls can wear wigs man yeah yeah girls wear wigs nope nope I got a pretty good girls can do whatever they want we'll still fuck them imagine if guys at fake tits girls be like what are you doing cuz he didn't even real muscles they're way more picky than we are you know if they have fake boobs were like awesome we don't even care if they're fake we know they're fake it means nothing it's not like we need to be tricked we're so stupid we like the fact that they look fake as fuck it's like there's a shape burned into our DNA and that shape is plumped tits and whatever you need to do to get to that but if a guy had some plastic rod in his cock that that stretched it out and made it harder if women found out about that they'd be like mmhmm yeah dudes are not allowed to have fake hogs today like any did what a woman prefer anything fake on a guy hmm do they like anything that anything at all I'm sure some women yeah tensions BAM they want you to pretend they want you to pretend you give a fuck about their dumb stories you gotta sit there oh and then she said that huh that's what some women like not and some women don't even like that see can't generalize don't be a sexist pig Jaime you say something so sexist that's there's dudes that'll do that let's go you're right under the bus be very careful of those people very careful of those gender traitors those guys who they know you're fucking around they'll throw you in front of the bus right in front of the ladies why will they do that because they're weak cunts and there's a lot of them out there and those are the ones that don't have guns I bet right now those are the ones those are the ones that aren't 13th in line the gun store and it's 10:00 to 5:00 and they know they're not gonna make it fuck did they close them does it say another 24 hours to give away guns they drop them out of helicopters through the roof and then they just distribute them evenly they were supposed to close them and then they didn't in Burbank and then they said they were going to just raid the place if they don't close them and then I think Trump just decided yes sir two days ago that it's consensual yes yeah essential essential can I have a piece stole up but Burbank Police are like we're not even going to like mess with this we don't we don't care anybody for anything yeah we're over here just let us know if shit gets really crazy Mad Max you play the new doom yet oh my god it's scary I was a little disappointed that they didn't have deathmatch they didn't have one-on-one deathmatch no no they don't have like you versus a bunch of people in a room just killing each other I thought they had that no right they don't right you have to it's like to working again I hope they'll come to their senses okay could be a downloadable content Lee I just got the new half-life and you were a big and a half life back in the day right yeah herds in VR now Mike shit you go to VR I got in VR and I got the hand finger tracking all my so I can sit there and pick out like a singer single bullet and put it you know like type shit it is he it it's so gloves you have gloves it's no it's just like these slip over the controllers yeah it's yeah and what's weird is that it's I got the vibe index which is like the highest end one you can get I and it's so real that it's like the first time where I felt like I was in a room before it's always like I'm in a room in VR now this was like this is too realistic like there was a part where I had to open this old elevator I'm like I'm not walking I mean it's it's it's amazing both nodding very vigorous no it's it's like it's so real that I couldn't it was too scared to walk in the elevators elevators well I'm hoping that doom does that and then look at the did what we did see a doom looks fucking amazing it looks amazing I mean the fucking graphics are off the chart the gameplay looks really cool the weapons look fucking totally badass but if they did that in VR oh my god do you have it dude they did doom eternal in VR and you you put it you put that bitch in a warehouse mhm and you run through the game in a couple hours too much towers you would burn the world would be ripped we get people in such good shape because you had something like doom right and you're in a warehouse like like I told you they do with sandbox sandbox has a bunch of dope games like that but they don't have anything that goes on for like three hours all right look if there was a place where you could go we could get blocks at time like a reserved you know warehouse for from nine to twelve and it's you and like five friends and you have three fucking hours three hours with fake guns and resources and you drink real water and you're wandering around this warehouse do you got to try half light but if they had a virtual toilet you don't even take your VR off to piss you walk up to it so it's a real toilet they have these suits now you can see yeah that bee suits now you could buy that you put on that vibrate so you feel things and like it could be like in a game and you could feel water like like water drops hit you and stuff and they have all these trackers now that you could put and you do that with do I mean with you could almost do to any game if you know what you're doing that's a promise it's a lot of PC shit involved with having VR you know like I wanted like the the vibe I think it's called words you don't have any PC you just put it on you know that's the future because you know but right now you still have to hook it up to a nice PC dude we got oculus and on one of the oculus ones it's the the one that's really dope because it's just a headset and it works off of an iPad right and the one will you walk the plank but this the the new stuff like I've unfortunately still have cameras everywhere tracking but like you go lay down in it and my kid knows it like if you see something to lean in pick something out your your you know it's room scale so you're walking yeah this is future the future is you're not gonna have a life you're gonna get sucked into those things and you're gonna be playing them all day long cuz it's gonna be way better than life you're gonna be working your shit job at the Amazon warehouse can't wait to go home and you're gonna get home strap that fuckin headset on and party when you're trapped inside it gives you more space to explore what it is like probably a little bit of a mental escape well I think this is also gonna open up a lot true I think in the future a lot more people are going to be using like video conferencing and stuff instead of meetings because we realize how wait better this is the instead of meeting and getting you know going to this business and working you can just sit there and talk nowadays I don't know why people don't Skype more or use this you know technology that's well I think people want to go outside and experience life and still want to meet in a building to work together I think people still like that you think this is going to change anything like that yeah how long is it gonna be before you can just hug a stranger college is gonna change because like oh man they're learning right now they're like wow what the fuck was I going down everyone's gonna be so scared concerts but meanwhile the last big concert that I saw was um who the fuck was it in Denver they got in trouble always tired this weed is too strong I just had four extra hits for some strange reason he did a show in Denver he was like one of the last ones to do and I was looking out it was like you know 18,000 people or some shit the Pepsi Center I looked out there my wow it's a lot of people that could get it mm-hmm all those spring breakers stacked on top of each other after that like awesome one made they use some computer program to track cell phone data and they showed all these people like on a little teeny part of Fort Lauderdale Beach over like a two-day period and then watched their cell phones dispersed across the country and see where the fucking took off everywhere not about everyone there had a disease they're all stupid they're all young they're all infected with young yeah I didn't see that but I'm not surprised what's weird like April 1st is like you know when this first shit's first started happening I think II like the comedy story like we're gonna be closed until around April 1st you know now that's not gonna happen it might be May I think the governor said he wants two months right yeah do you say two months from now or two months total I don't know two months from now I think it's from now from now yeah so June fuck I don't understand like if you were like a waiter I know when I was a waiter for 10 years I went paycheck to paycheck you know if I real problem is unemployment yeah they were I mean they have to be honest too about the tips and these are all their cell phones yes this is a zooming in on up like they combined two datasets to show like this is like what companies actually used for tracking advertising stuff normally but this companies tried to show how fast shit can spread so they're showing a little heat map of cellphones on a little piece of beach here in Florida and then they take all of those data points and then he he makes the time line go ahead a couple days and you just watch them spread from there so it's not even that many of them it's probably a couple thousand they had said was 6,000 of them are 5500 of them maybe and then he just flips maislos timeline go ahead a little bit and those that want to see this you can look up a twitter account called tectonics GE o half the country Wow you know what's also crazy it really is a cell phone because the cell phones so dirty who cleans their cell phone you touch your ass you touch your cell phone you touch your dick you touch your cell phone you touch your nose you touch yourself all you put yourself on the table or someone else's cell phone was you put yourself only in your pocket you fart on it P cell phone in your car your car's disgusting I mean and even what's dirty I know that like if I have something crunchy on my screen it's not like I'm clean I'm just like out he's my annoying scratch it off there I'm not washing my cell phone but I'm gonna start washing it one thing good is I got iPhone 11 its IP 68 mmm-hmm so if you don't have a phone do you have the green one I'll bring them in I have three Windex specifically for electronics wipes to get that phone cleaner I got man yeah maybe that's a move everybody puts their phone in a heater from microwave ur what is it what kind of light is it ultraviolet it's like same as that thing yeah yeah where does that kill their DNA that seems really malicious why don't we just want to replace our light bulbs with these lights and dude well some guy was saying that we should carry around these ozone things if you there's a thing that deer hunters have been using forever and it's a ozone spray so you stand there and this ozone bath washes over you so even if deer are coming up wind alright so they're walking into the wind and your smell is blowing in their face your smell is covered by this ozone ozone spray that's what stoners we used to buy from water beds and stuff and sprayed and they like rental cars after exact that was real zone but that was the name yeah but real ozone it actually does on some levels mask your scent so you can see a deer smell it they get confused like because if a deer smell you they just get the fuck out we stink - deer that's the number one tool that they have to get away from humans is smell because they don't see you from like 500 yards away they don't pay they're not you're not an immediate threat you're all the way over there you move in they might what does that leave the fuck out of here but they're they're generally confident that at five hundred yards away from you they can kind of get away from you quick enough but if you're close to them and they smell you they fucking run they run dude they're run like if you're in that close meaning realistically they could smell you a couple hundred yards three hundred yards the wind comes to them it catches them they see it they just start bouncing away they run away we stink we smell like meat we smell like something that eats meat and we smell like a predator we smoke grouse so they're like fuck imagine someone you can smell the way you smell skunk have you smelled a person like over the top of the hill like a wind gust you smell that fuck we got to get out of here that's what it's like to them it's like if skunks were murderous animals looking to shoot at you or being in India in India why is that you could smell it people in India [Laughter] it's you see in India where they're attacking them if you're in the streets they're just like beating the shit out of it like the police there's a bunch of different countries that are gonna do that yeah the Chinaman was the scariest when the dragon those people away I was like what is going on I guess there's photos of like outside of our hospitals here in Los Angeles of just semis filled with bodies I somebody posted the other day well how many people have died in Los Angeles uh not that much so I don't know I'm sure they weren't caskets I think it's because they're they have to because they have the virus and they died of the virus they have to keep them like separate from like regular what's your take on this give me the Brian Redman take when do we get out of this I think it's we're in it for a lot longer than we think I think like a good two more months maybe Max and I think we are okay I think this is just fucking weird do you think I think there's a lot of depression issues I know a lot of people if I was single right now I would not just take this disturbing video shows dead bodies loaded onto truck outside New York City hospitals yeah but here's here's my question are they gone what if the flu next year is particularly vicious are we gonna do this all over again this is the question like this could come back in the fall that dr. Fauci guys saying yeah and how long are they saying on the cure well they don't even think they can come up with a vaccine for 16 to 18 months right as I said cuz of how they do the tests I think they said 18 months it's like they're hopeful for a year and a half can't they do like what China did when they built those hospitals get like every single person in the world together and be like let's all figure this out in a month I don't know if they can I know everyone's donating their computer processing power right now to get try to find a cure for it I've never you saw that there's a where you know where you could install that thing on your computer and so when you're not using it it's using your computer to help you know cloud which is like find a thing and I want you know wonder if everyone did that well I mean if they they need to do clinical trials have clinical trials take time so if they do this chloroquine stuff or some other things that they come up with they have to try them on animals they have to figure out whether or not would work on people and then they have to try it on people well this is a whole process that they have to go through it's not like there's some miracle that they're holding back on that's what's so scary about this shit when we were at the CDC in Galveston Texas Duncan and I went down there and I think it's the Center for Disease Control he knows what's called this building where they house everything that would kill you Ebola all kinds of shit it'll just kill everybody in this big-ass building with super thick walls and vacuum they were explaining how they suck all the air out of the room with they have vacuum hoses and these guys are built like you know they have these suits they're built like astronaut suits like they're on the moon and it's crazy protection that they have and then they're working with these viruses and these deadly diseases I'm like oh my god so terrifying talking to him me and Duncan both freaked out because at first we were thinking what if Russia came up with some kind of crazy disease and turned it on the world you know we were scared of that like what about weaponized viruses what about that and they were like yeah yeah that can happen but you know what's happening all the time new viruses they're like we're what we're really scared of is shit like the Spanish flu or h1n1 or all these different flus that just show up and wipe out people in a different way like the Spanish flu particularly killed young men like really healthy men with really good immune systems for whatever reason those are the ones that got jacked a lot of them it was a good weird like this one kind of for it's not as bad for young people but it's much worse for old people right some some of them very some of them are really bad for young be a some of it's random yeah and those he was really scared of that he was like this is what we're concerned about we're concerned about nature itself we're not concerned about people making some sort of a weaponized virus he's like that would be terrible but what we're concerned with is what's happening all the time these viruses are mutating and morphing and changing and becoming more powerful and resistant to antibiotics and like whoa burrow he scared the shit out of both of us we walked out of there more like man just made us realize like oh this just hasn't happened in our lifetime like you know in a way that's we're confronted with it until now you know now it's happening there's some new thing that we don't have a cure for you know and then you add Internet and social media to that and then it's just panic oh no you're not just seeing the news and there's value in it if you freak people out they'll click on links if they click on the links you get all the ad revenue if you're writing some sensationalist story that's real click Beatty with a click Beatty title people jump to it and then you get those ad click so you're encouraged to make these sensationalist stories that are interesting to read and I'm as guilty as anybody if I see something ridiculous I'm like what what are you saying what what did she do where'd she get that money uh-huh and I'll go click on 2 and then when I'm disappointed I'm like oh how many people read the whole thing you know yeah I've read something the other day it was I think what's clickbait and not real about how math might mean that he probably is always joke about how there's no one there's like a math proponent like a weed proponent because this fucking people try to evangelize with weed right yeah Oh tons yeah and mushrooms oh yeah all of us do but you have something that you you think it's spectacular you want other people to try it we were like does anybody do with that with meth do you know it's like dude you want to clean your fucking apartment yeah there's cokeheads that that doesn't seem as bad in that case there is medical purposes for cocaine but yet there's nothing for Beth what well there is I was pretty close if you'd called meth adderall then definitely have dude adderall is real close to meth and I know multiple people that have a real issue with that stuff some of them would have completely lost their mind the adderall is like any other thing where your perturbing your natural state all the time like your balance gets off you don't know where you are you don't know what you're doing you don't know what you're saying you're saying things and realizing that you said them after you set them you're talking constantly like you know what happens to those fucking adderall heads they get real weird they get real weird they get angry at people that did nothing to them they think there's conspiracies you think there's helicopters flying around looking for him they get messy they get real messy especially if they're abusing it and most most are it seems taking off label a lot of them are just taking it recreationally they're just taking it because they they want to one a little juice and cooties probably don't reach your hands in there it's a pretty good dose oh the shit twenty-five milligrams of CBD and each one of them super addicting go Tango kill cliff yeah this is the new this is the new flavor the Mango Tango flavor sweet new ones I like mango and things but you don't like raw mango did I always get feels it feels like like new carpet like chemical taste see that's just cuz you smoke is that why murdered your taste buds mangoes delicious mmm how often you smoke cigarettes though not much I mean this jewel is my favorite thing ever don't put that back your glass I might drink that oh shit he's like no like these jewels I mean I got I got really into the jewels and it seems you know I used to when I smoked I would wake up in the morning and like breathe like I could just feel the cigarette in my lungs and like I don't have that anymore but I also notice I suck on this thing all day like it's a lollipop you know and that cannot be good well I found out from Adam Curry what the fucking lowdown is Adam Curry you know the original guy who came up with podcasting yes he's the the Mac the og he's like our Lucy like Lucy that that was that was that fake was Lucy faked Lucy do you know what I'm talking about Lucy's the first fossil of mankind humankind a woman that they found who's like one of the the first recognizable Homo sapiens I think or one of our ancestors one of the first recognizable ancestors but someone said that there's something faked about it that there was a recent controversy and I didn't look into it but I'm remembering it right now was Adam before Leo remembered Leo well he was on that show well Leo was on that show I fucking love that show no that was my super nerd days to when I was those the days when I was actually making computers you know I would go and buy all the parts and put computers together and shit I loved that show but Adam started his shit I mean he gave us the whole timeline on the show but it's super clear he's the first he if he wasn't the first he's there for the first that survived it's still around today for sure right he preceded us by many years yeah but he was he had an idea to do this shit back when he was on MTV he just happened to be beautiful he's like a super long flirty guy who just happened to be beautiful when he was young you know because you could kind of dismiss him as being a pretty boy but he's a genius brilliant guy and a really really Doug talking to him like he's really cool you would like him to man yes super cool and super fucking smart and super tuned in to all aspects of privacy in the internet and you know he's telling us about phones that are that are they're making these new phones they're Linux based phones that are completely private they don't send any data to anywhere he's into that kind of shit he's into those laptops that Snowden uses that have kill switches on them so you can kill the microphone and kill the like with an actual physical switch kill the webcam yeah I like all those hold MTV like Matt Pinfield remember him the guy did headbangers ball oh yeah that bald guy and like all those old MTV get we grew up with it those were our DJ's our video DJ's you know remember Kennedy yeah she's a Fox News Republican shit yeah sexy glass looks great she looks really good considering how long she's been on television for you know I mean she's got to be at least my definitely looks better than puck right I haven't seen that before he had a rough go of it yeah what Kennedy is on she's still on MTV right I mean on I mean on Fox News right was she's not anymore she get in trouble no no virus programming it's oh it's all webcams and shit they're all gonna just give up and start doing podcast they're gonna realize you fucked up that all that Fox News stuff and with all that all that being in a studio come on news is so stupid like I love how they're sitting farther apart but they're like sitting like 10 feet away like you're all right come on you're not social distance and responsibly their local NBC channel like they're all over at somebody's house and you could tell us the same house because it's the same lighting and they're obviously not gonna have a cameraman at three different houses you know so they they they have one guy in the living room one cut in the dining room and then like the B reporter guy he's like sitting in front of like a garbage can in the kitchen a badge of the corona vice of the coronavirus forced everyone into doing podcast and all regular television died I hope it's close but people still rely on those big names to like I want to hear what the BBC has to say about it you know I want to see I want to see what NBC says it's pretty amazing how much I I watch YouTube more than I watch TV nowadays like everything related to now I subscribe to people I like every day I'm like oh I want to see the latest episode oh yeah for sure I waste a lot of fucking time on it too looking at car videos yeah like what looking at old hot rod videos and stuff um rich rebuilds what were we just talking about shit I was gonna ask you a question is everything is going on podcast Kennedy gone in and out is it out of my brain it had something to do with with these shows what they're oh I can't see if we're doing podcast now it's switching everything that sorry you're not helping I got week two I but I needed that like a day like this it's just too weird I don't want to be sober right now mm-hmm yeah watching car videos though I love watching of car videos yeah oh I'll never own I don't even want them I like watching them some dude driving an old Fiat the other day on a mountain road I was like oh look at that looks cool I don't want to do that I just think there's something about mechanical things that people create and work on that's probably my favorite part about it I like these new car or these cars these companies are taking like old classic cars and been gutting a Tesla and putting all the Tesla stuff inside of it there's a Russian car company that's doing that now with a 1967 Mustang Wow but they're building the Mustang out of pure carbon fiber yeah so it's gonna be really light and they estimated a 0 to 60 of 2.2 seconds see who's find this it's like it's a really new company that's coming out with this what do you have to do when you get one if you buy that you need to get it fixed you have to take it back to them you have a senator rich Benoit yeah so it's a rich rebuilds yeah it's the electric garage Massachusetts where's this place give him a shout-out I mean we're in Massachusetts he's great right he just put a video up about nipples and this little kid did he where did you get this that he gave this to me yeah he added to the collection I love his videos he's he keeps Tesla honest he keeps everybody honest he hates a lot though on the Model X and that kind of drives me crazy New Hampshire no he doesn't live in New Hampshire I mean the electrified garage it's in New Hampshire huh weird he was in Matt maybe open the garage in New Hampshire he's on this thing lately where he's talking about superchargers Seabrook New Hampshire Seabrook New Hampshire is that that near the the Bay the border to Massachusetts because a lot of people did that they like got places I had friends who got houses in New Hampshire because it was cheaper and you can get like a fucking yard filled with bears yeah New Hampshire's the woods bro is it I did a girlfriend Hampshire it's just over the border from Massachusetts yeah woods people it's people real woods people remain people there was one store that I was reading about where these fucking guys were working during construction in Maine and they rented a house and the neighbors had decided that these people might have the corona and so they've been there since September they had they been in the fucking town since September working on construction site say they chopped a tree down and blocked their fucking driveway and threatened them with guns they they have to quarantine them they're forcing them to quarantine look at this group of local vigilantes tried to forcibly quarantine out-of-towners that's Maine for you that's fucked that's Maine for you dude Maine is a strange place it's a strange place you ain't never seen drunk good you never seen drunk T seen like a bar in Bangor those people could throw down and they're all in that you know they're in that brutal brutal brutal cold brutal cold for a long time they went to the mainland were targeted because of license plate when they arrived back in VIN now Haven Vanille Haven an exchange between roommates and some local residents apparently didn't go well she said adding that a group of local vigilantes decided to take matters into their own hands and barricade these guys into their rental property mrs. MacDonald called the commotion a tremendous waste of resources noting that he had drawn a response from several officials so silly but that's Maine there's a lot of dummies up there a lot of nice people don't get me wrong but you know there's log dummies up there they call maniacs and they get real mad if you make me guys screaming at me I was telling Maine jokes in Maine and he would scream and he would stand it up and he was old dude - pointing at me screaming like he really identified with Maine and I was trying to understand I go I go do you identify with Maine do you think I'm talking about you what's going on here man why men I was making fun of the number of people that were shot by deer in Maine a sharp idea or shot hunting and mistaken for a deer sorry shot by a deer that's hilarious and I was making this joke about it like I mean how many fucking people live here and this guy god I fucking they were here at Sakura screaming at me and I was like whoa buddy these are just jokes it doesn't make this a lot better but this thing in main it's a very it's a small island town Oh even worse they're fucking trying to keep it that's why they're saying get back to the mainland I was like why are they saying mainland cuz they think if someone came over there with the cooties yeah but those guys have been there so September she these people are just idiots dude Islands are weird man I did a gig once on Block Island Block Island is like outside of Rhode Island I believe it was the worst gig I ever did I mean even to this day I think back I'm like you can't get worse you only get different the place was they were sedated what I mean City I mean like everyone in the bar was plastered like at a level where they couldn't even communicate Wow it was the it was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen me and this kid Scott Papac Yuri he booked it me and him went there and he was opener and I was a closer we both sucked and it was like 1989 and we were sleeping in a storage area like where these containers of like fucking green beans and cans of peas right storage right there wow so there's like racks and on the ground there was like these beds and we had to sleep in these beds that were in a storage unit I'm not bullshit was no hotel room there was a toilet you could take a shit you wash your hands there's no bathroom no shower I was like this is the craziest gig ever and they were mad at us because I forget what he had said but by the time he had gotten off stage the show was basically over they'd shut the show down I don't even remember if I got to tell a joke wow I don't even think I did I think I might I might have like started my act and they stopped everything like right as he was getting offstage and I didn't realize what was going on but they didn't like his language or subject matter or what it was for sure mocking the drunks because they were like this josè dogs I mean they were so drunk dude like no one could sit up straight everyone was like sedated oh and there was only maybe 20 people in the whole in the whole bar I hate Barcia we came over there out of Faerie to do this terrible comedy show I was gonna ask this seems like a place like put-in-bay putting bad yeah yeah we got stock man we couldn't go back we had stock we couldn't go back until the morning then we went back in the morning I was like whoa that was a that was a rough one but that's an island like you get those people that just live on this little island and they just get hammered together yeah there's a few of those islands it's not a happy island you think of island life you think of like Kauai you know we're Laird Hamilton Kai why it's like Cuba is surfing why I know cold islands are not this thing no cold islands are different you don't get no Gabby Reece on them cold islands I heard why then have any any coronavirus and they closed off Hawaii is that true they should good move for them shut it down if you can afford it because people coming over they're gonna bring it the question is what if they bring just you know what if they bring it and it doesn't affect them the way it affects everybody else yeah they have a few cases in 275 we heard about Germany now exceptionally low mortality rates like less than somewhere in the neighborhood of 1/10 of 1% less than everywhere else really yeah and then there's I believe Sweden and Sweden in an experiment they're not shutting down anything they're not shutting down yeah they're not shutting down restaurants or schools or anything or not yeah how are they doing right now maybe they're looking at it the same way Germany's looking at it yeah but the whole thing is over filling the hospitals all at once and not being able to treat people right and that's why they die because they don't get the right treatment right yeah yeah a hundred percent I mean it's there's no fucking real answer of this thing it's it affects people so differently some people get it and it's all mo nothing and and some people apparently in Wuhan are testing positive again so they test negative they get it they get over it they test negative and then they test positive again but they're asymptomatic they're asymptomatic but it's it's still active that's what people are scared of that it's gonna be a certain percentage of the population for whatever reason aren't going to show any signs of this virus and those people going to spread it to everyone around them and not even know they're doing it but in a sense we kind of all are doing that if you were around any people that go anywhere other than at your house like if you go to the store like if you're going to the store and we're all going to store it for oh you don't know what you're running into you're going to the store I mean you hopefully are not gonna catch anything at the store but this stuff lives in the air people are breathing if you just I don't know how much it takes how much particulate matter has to be in the air before it can get into your mouth a mask you wear that when you fuck don't lie I was lucky I bought these things like before the virus because of allergies and those good well this has like the the filters in it the charcoal filters and all that I don't know if it does anything I'm sure the charcoal filters do a lot yeah has a replaceable filters good but it makes me feel better when I'm in public just like the other day I was at the grocery store and of all people an old Chinese lady starts coughing ridiculous and the whole grocery store was quiet all looked over at once just stared at her but she was not even like covering her face she was just coughing up in the air and I was like thank God I had this I pulled out at least makes me feel better like it but I think the particles fog directly to the ground like there are thicker water so it doesn't even matter I was trying to get my family to watch World War Z or 28 days later they passed on both of them you guys like War Z is rated PG is pg-13 yes Shonda the deads a good one yeah but World War Z is ferocious remember that that scared the shit out of me I was listening to a podcast we were talking about this guy that got bit by a mountain lion that was rabid and any animal that's rabbit will be like real aggressive and they'll go after you like just think about that because it's kind of like what it is to be a 28 days later zombie type of character right you just want to bite people to give them a disease and that's kind of like a rat who has rabies it's trying to chasing a cat yeah or you know are you something like a raccoon trying to bite these people that I was reading about like that and turned out the raccoon had rabies like oh they once they only have rabies they want to give it away they want to get that's what the virus is doing where the disease is doing it's trying to get in another host so it makes you go get him on and jump into him imagine if something like that rage shit from 28 days later gets out it's so much scarier than what we're dealing with now folks again we have a good in comparison to how it could be asteroid showers and rage all at once rage gets out of lab the chimp bites the trainer the trainer bites the doctor the doctor bites the nurse the nurse bites our friends and everybody starts biting everybody on way that's 28 days later bro that's rabies that could happen why couldn't it happen it can happen no power asteroid shower grid goes down no internet people start lying again and then rabies I want you to feel good about today right now we're doing good man we can still get gas we could still get food yeah but like there's our Internet's already stressed they have to take down all the Netflix and video games are going down like 720p and there's a thing called books I want you to look into though once you start reading come on bro internet went out for a half hour last night and I almost freaked out I've set some good fitness goals that's where I started to I set like a real good schedule shit that I need to do but I'm definitely gonna do X amount of days per week and I've been on that and I fuckin love not traveling you know I mean yes I'm sorry for everyone that's out of work don't get me wrong I'm not being insensitive here I'm just telling you my my life the the positive thing about not javelin is you feel way better your body's not getting beat up all the time yeah your body gets beat the fuck up when you travel every weekend you fly on a plane every weekend that's positive because like I we had to cancel obviously a bunch of shows and just being at home you know I love it no stress no stress it's nice petting your dog yeah going for a walk in your neighborhood oh that shit's important for people and you um you know you don't realize because we have this crazy life we're always flying around you don't realize how unsettling that is until you're home for a period of time we should do residency's in LA the way they do residency's in Vegas just I guess we kind of do already at the Comedy Store like set up shop at a small theater and just like I'm not going anywhere anymore you want to come yeah or travel we're doing shows in Burbank no buy a 500 seat theater in Burbank do shows there every week there's one right across the street from Bob's Big Boy because you can travel I don't have to travel to you you can travel I'll make the tickets cheaper airlines are gonna be so cheap when we get back and running everyone's gonna like please fly please we're hanging on by a thread last night the cheapest shit cheapest shit right like flying neck this weekend you could buy first-class 400 500 bucks sounds crazy son trip to China was $400 I mean that round ship should be $400 in your bank account they should pay you they should give you foot massage the whole way and say they're sorry do you think that's gonna come though they might shut down the airlines because yes that's what I was saying I mean look it's if you look at that cellphone map I mean we're doing a better job than those fucking kids are those kids on the beach are doing the worst job because they're 17 and they're horny and they're drunk and they have a phone but if you just look at people that are traveling for business or people that are going to supermarkets you just if you just look at it honestly there's there's so much room for it getting out I definitely think it's a good move to stay in as long as possible and get as many people that are tested negative as possible so that we can save as many people as we can don't get me wrong but I am saying they're not really stopping it they're stopping some of it you're not a hundred percent stopping it and there going to be able to either you know they were talking about quarantine in New York City and Cuomo had an interesting quote who's like it's almost like the federal government declaring war on States and war on cities I was like whoa like if the federal government comes in says no eating leaves and nobody goes in like Oh fuckin Christ are we really doing that and Cuomo was like look that's not this is not a good thing to do would you bring in the military and have tanks and shit everybody's freaking out about next step right what is next level when you say quarantine and now Trump is giving in to this idea that it's going to take until April 30th so he's given up on his Easter idea and now he's saying you know that doesn't look realistic it's looks more like April 30 just for the personal space guidelines June 1st right after that it's like June looks like a great it would be a great time like what about May yeah what about yeah I think I think it's June 1st sounds like a way more realistic thing then dude if you imagine everybody's out of work for three months do you know how nuts that's gonna be all these people that had thriving businesses and through no fault of their own they lost all that they worked for for decades all these people that are taking care of their families all these people that are raising kids putting kids in school you know put kids in daycare and while they're at work all that shit there's so much of a disruption here and no one knows what to do no one has a solution and but people are blaming Trump like look man what if he was right what if what if we were on the bright side of this thing and they caught it early and his rosy predictions proved true that would be great they weren't but no ones were no one knew means some people had a better idea than him for sure but no one really knew what was gonna go on and we're really still puzzled by some places like I was talking this guy that was saying there's a real issue with Italy because Italy's numbers are so out of whack you look at Germany and you look at Italy Italy just crazy numbers and they're trying to think lifestyle they're trying to think close proximity to family members they're always on top of each other they live a lot of people to a place and the social gather all the time and then they're smoking they smoke a lot of cigarettes yeah and then there's a very also very high population old people so they look at Germany and this is why I always tell you if you have a choice chin Italian car and a German car you get a fucking German car all day because Germans are very very fucking disciplined and they're structured and they think things out and they engineer things well and for whatever reason whatever it's because their hospital system is better whether it's because it's a genetic thing whether it's because more people over there have better health care and they get treated quicker their mortality rate is really low hmm it's weird we read about Sweden did you find the thing about Sweden what are they saying about it they have closed colleges and universities they've limited restaurants like 50 people but they are saying like people can eat in them schools for kids under 16 or closed but they haven't it's like voluntary for everything else they volunteer in lockdown yeah are you expecting people to make the right decision that's their take on it where's a little thing you got there fella just charger oh I thought that was maybe one of them weird phones you know how they have those baby ones well do you have those foldables ones so bad you know I do I went the not the razor but the Samsung one that that one looks cool well they did they have to Samsung's one that folds out a clamshell yeah move right yeah but you think you could be okay with Android I think it would be good as a second phone the thing about Android man is those iMessage group chats and FaceTime and airdrop airdrops huge they're so wise they like Apple did such a clever move and sucking us into the net like you can't get out like this where the spider's web because I have a samsung phone I have a Galaxy Note 10 I like to use that for looking at stuff like watching YouTube videos and stuff like it's a huge screen it's got no bezels basically yeah and one little tiny hole punch in it you know it's killer and the 5 G's nice it's nice but it's never I've never used it once it's nice it's there right but the thing about it is it doesn't get air drop if someone send me a picture they have to text it to me I might not even get it the Samsung does her mean Android does have like their version to airdrop I could never get it to work and you can I don't think you could do it to Apple and Apple can't you can't do it to them yeah it's fuck off now I like you know I have no problems with the eye but it's just interesting that they figured out a way to do that to rope us into their net because if they didn't rope us into their net then it's like you could get a really good Android phone now you know like right now they have that Samsung Galaxy S 20 altra yeah that looks great that thing is a tablet you're carrying around an iPad it's huge camera doh oh my god this is a hundred and eight megapixel something like that yeah that is so ridiculous and then has a hundred X zoom if you go to digital zoom it's like 3x optical and a hundred x digital I don't even think it's 3 X octal I think it's something like 10 bird here something like that yeah cuz it uses a like a periscope not periscope Oh telescoping lens yeah it's a Lincoln but it's so big I don't like I switch to the little iPhone I want that's something I think in the future I'm going to start cuz I bought my girlfriend the smaller version of the 11pro or whatever but yeah it doesn't it doesn't like sit weird in my pocket that was the other thing like the big one in my front pocket and it was like first of all what kind of radiation am I getting on my deck yeah lots yeah making some weird fucking doctor strange kids but the other thing is like this thing fits it's big enough like if I'm looking at shit it's fucking big enough but it fits perfectly in your hand you know it's not too heavy I've been wearing my watch a lot lately and just leaving my phone at home because because the number is connected so if somebody calls me or text me I get it on my watch except Android people you're fucked oh yeah they probably can call you yeah they can text you but they can't iMessage you or does it get SMS as well okay I guess it does work on SMS yeah what am I thinking my sister sends me these voice 2 texts checks and I guess she does it while she's driving and I'm I'm like do you read these words interpretation of what you said there's no periods in any of it and I looked through it I'm like what are you saying she just rambles into her phone and then sends her this text message it's hilarious yeah she's busy she doesn't have time to read it I get it I'm not mad at her but I'm like why in the hell and then I said to I go did you read this and see she laughs at me but it's it's so bad you know like you can't yet leave a whole conversation with somebody you can say a thing pretty close pretty close you can leave a note but when you want to make like a long story as well my sisters from Boston ranch the bus heavy Boston accent you know when I was 19 I hurt myself on television yeah when I was 19 I I fought in the Bay State Games and this local news station interviewed me and I had this terrible accent I was like oh my god listen to me I'm a moron I wish I don't have any more there's a bunch of my old Taekwondo day stuff that I used to have that I just wanted to shed when I was moving on with my life the only reason was a video of me fighting at all even online even though I had videos was cuz this guy that I knew from back in the day he was on another team we knew each other back we were both young and competing sent me this stuff so this one the one video of me sending some guy flying through the air that's he that's from him he caught that in nineteen I want to say 87 US Cup in Connecticut yeah so I don't I have the medals I have a bunch of medals just sitting around I look at him every now and then and it seems like I'm lying fake they seem fake like I think about the Taekwondo days and I look at those things so I was like those mine so really mine's a planted memory Joe that didn't happen I don't have real video of it other than that one video the only time I know it's real is that when ia like kick the bag like I'm like oh yeah I can do this like it's some weird thing that I can still do you know I keep like you ever seen Chapelle do backflips how Lacey Dave Chappelle is like three Dave Chappelle's in the same height if you like took Dave's body and and packed in through me he's a fucking Savage he's so jacked and he's got ridiculous athletic ability because of years of being a cheerleader he's a world champion cheerleader dude he throws himself through the air and you cannot believe it cuz he's he's a tank he's probably 230 somewhere in that range solid rock and flips through the air throws himself through the air just backflips in the back earth look at this watch this this is him okay no replay watch this watch what oh that's him watch this watch this this is ridiculous dude but if you're tiny if you're a hundred and thirty-five pound person that's one thing he's I mean a no-bullshit a solid 235 240 built like a brick shithouse will get any throws this girl up in the air and catches her over his head look at that that's ridiculous ridiculous he's a cheerleader he was a prophetic by me was uh not there's no real professional he was a competitive world champion cheering what we just talked about wanted to bring him up but before the backflip dave chappelle no before that god dammit we're talking about people based eight games no no it's past that we're talking about people who can do crazy things physically that's probably what it is that you wouldn't expect like what how do you do that but it's the same thing with him like he started doing that when he was really young so his body developed throwing itself through the air but a normal person his size it's so hard to get air when you're that heavy those guys who get air if you see them at like a like a gymnastics event they're like 160 hundred seventy but watch this that's crazy dude I mean he flies through the air it's like you're kicking a bag you know it's for kind of like that in that he's doing this because he developed his body while doing this and when he was real little by himself he used to practice like doing backflips and shit so by the time he got into cheerleading he was already like physically capable doing that he he grew up doing it and when your body grows up doing something we used to say that about strikers some strikers some people learn how to strike they can learn our strike later in life they still pick it up pretty well just cuz they're real fast and explosive but there's a thing that like guys have when they start out striking at a very early age like Floyd Mayweather there's a perfect example there the really elite of the elite seemed to all start out when they're young and sort of develop into fighting as their body matures like Tyson like Sugar Ray Leonard like a lot of these guys had extensive amateur backgrounds and then you know developed into a male professional with you know some of them 100-plus fights in the amateurs like Vasily lomachenko had hundreds and hundreds of fights in the amateurs and one I think two Olympic gold medals before he ever became professional and those guys that they they're they're just head and shoulders above everybody else because like developing as your body's maturing and you're being coached by world-class coaches like Floyd Mayweather was like you just get this sense of this sport that other people are never gonna get they're never gonna get to your level you're just on this crazy level the only way they're gonna beat use if they catch with like a perfectly placed punch with anybody can get hit with you get knocked out but other than that if it's just like boxing for boxing fully mayweather is like he's a Zen master he's got this sense of the sport that most guys just will never have like when you see if you watch him fight a lot of people like they hate on him because he talks a lot of shit he's got a lot of money and he wants everybody to know it but that's also he sells pay-per-views dummy like he talks a lot of shit you get mad you want to see and get beep and nobody could beat him when he fought Canelo Alvarez that was a real wake-up call for people because Canelo is a monster he's a terrifying boxer and for Mayweather just peaced him up pieced him up just pieced him up just put on a show put on a boxing clinic and you watch me like wow that's he has a space show understanding of that sport but I don't think you get if you start when you're 30 I don't think you ever get there I think you need to be already elite in your 20s if you want to get to your peak as a 30 32 year old athlete somewhere in that range at the top of the game at the apex you kind of need to learn as you're a baby you know it's a fucking weird thing man when we get old we suck at learning things you know it's Nature's Way of telling you bitch pick a lane yeah pick something tick-tock get out of here you boys lost time you tried to learn a new thing like a new skill well or a language reading learning PC are you relearning pcs yeah games virtual reality I mean it's I tell you it's frustrating as fuck like just had to download a program the other day just to put a 3d model and just so I could upload it into a game and like it's like just the you know it's so not like Mac it's it's it's it's you have to actually dig in and like do code stuff and do you have to enter dos you wanted I was doing turn whatever their terminal yeah I think it is - yeah what did that I did something like that yeah did the communiques or whatever it's called UNIX is uh that's blood program apples based on is it yeah apples based on UNIX right Mac OS used to be honest but windows isn't Unix right you know about different programming download a program just put this 3d model in and I think it's so you can download the UNIX program on yeah windows yeah in Mac I don't do shit with my windows computer other than right right it's my writing great that's your writing computer house yeah it's so it's to me it's you know it's so much floppy there's so many windows popping up still there's so many like dumb things like why are you asking me this you know what's update all the time yeah and when it updates it'll take like 20 minutes Mike you fucker you didn't tell me how long it's gonna take now I'm sitting here my dick in my hand trying to write I've heard a lot of people complain about the Apple update thing - cuz most people don't hit the update now and was like no tomorrow no tomorrow it keeps getting after yeah well those people are stupid Hey it's a different animal we're talking about morons yeah I always but it's but for writing man you cannot if you want to just have a laptop you can't beat those thinkpads those Lenovo ThinkPad the keyboards are so much better it makes such a big difference it's the whole difference it's the whole difference because if I looked at it in terms of like the quality of the screen and the the with the Mac ecosystem once you're in that ecosystem like everything's sort of connected to your laptop but the the keyboard on those lenovo's it's like telepathic like you know where every key is your fingers fit in that little groove and when you push them down there's like the satisfying amount of travel and you know where you know what you're doing I make so fewer errors that I do even with the new when I got that 16 inch one the new it still sucks yeah it still sucks it's better for sure than the last keyboard it's way better than way better way better but it still sucks why wouldn't you make the best keyboard ever why why would you make a keyboard that still sucks when you know that those lenovo keyboards are out there you know they're out there somebody must have told you somebody must have told you that there's a ThinkPad keyboard that's literally 500 times better than your shitty keyboard or just the one they had two years ago like I could my exes - or my girlfriend yeah I get my girlfriend my old computer and and I was playing on that keyboard like this is way better than the the 16 inch like why aren't we using a wise key travel yeah back then you had more key travel yeah that does every furbished load yes has a fuck load of key travel I know where every key is and I press them they took the guts out and put a new guns yes but when you press those keys man there's a satisfying amount of travel that lets you know you're pressing it and that's more feedback for your fingers so you're more confident when you're typing when everything's flat the same surface like you yeah yeah like how good do you pop type on an iPad when you have to open it up as a keyboard and you do that new iPad keyboard have you seen all those different looks sick but then what is that is that an iPad or a fucking computer right what is that well it's faster than their their Mac Aires or whatever yeah it's I guess it because it's I this is my thought when you're gonna use a computer shouldn't it be comfortable and shouldn't it be most effective to use like aren't those two you think about the amount of time you spend entering things into a keyboard shouldn't it be the most comfortable keyboard you can get and the keyboard that responds the best should it be okay well how is that not a giant priority for you you want everything to look pretty but you want to feel like shit and so even when you know that more travel is better for people to type especially for touch typists and people who write a lot and creative people you know that why don't you do that well I think that's kind of what the why people like iPads cuz you can bring your own keyboard and you could do that with a laptop too yeah for sure but it's still why not do it right like lenovo does right you fucks and by the way metal doesn't feel good like why is it metal why am I putting my hand on metal why is it cold metal digging into my wrists why is it aluminium why you want to make it pretty like why don't you make it have like a softer plastic with curved edges so it doesn't suck yeah so it doesn't feel weird on your skin like no sir whatever we want everything white you laughing you're so deep down like the design discussion meeting I'm like picturing of like I'm like what do you want you want to be thinner what do you do I want it to be a ThinkPad ThinkPad x1 carbon it weighs nothing that one curve you're the old 17 inches curve present what is when they made that unibody design edge when you're typing the edge of the bottom that cuts you up it's stupid the first thing I would cut if I was just like hey we need to make a new design I would just shave the keys in half cuz they're probably taking up making this bit the double you know when you closed it I think that's what they're trying to shrink down right you close it share the keys in half oh yeah what do you mean like the piece of plastic that they are that you're saying that made them so much better when you're shrinking the size of a laptop soprano yeah well that's what happened yeah that's so you can close it that's all I'm saying like they just probably did that first and no one give a fuck well they came out with a patent that they haven't implemented yet of a keyboard that has keys at lower or raise and this was like something that was being discussed like the everything at all that would be great if Apple had it like you can get it up to 1.5 millimeters or down to like 6 millimeters or point six motors if that's you want but it's still gonna be not as good as the Lenovo one they're not going another one is curved the nerve one over one there's like their little C shapes so your fingers fit right into them and you know where each one is it's just better like why don't you know it's better anyone who types on it knows it's better you know Lewis from unbox there but unbox therapy yeah dude as soon as you started typing my he's like what have I been do with my life you should get one of those lenovo laptops and hackintosh it ooh I don't use it for enough it's like what do I need I need Microsoft Word I need I used to use the right room a lot but now I find I can I could do all the same shit with word and then I upload you know when I share it with myself so that I have it on my other computer but that's all I'm dealing with it I'm writing you know like it's okay I know the the operating system is more clunky it's weird but I don't do anything with it you know if I was running a bunch of different programs and I'm just using it as a word processor mostly it's just way better it's way better to write on and it weighs nothing these fucks they keep giving us the same thing here's your choice aluminum or aluminium I think it's gonna get worse - I think the future is having no keyboard having it like an iPad with the haptic feedback I feel like that's probably gonna be it yeah well I think people there's still a group of people that like really want those mechanical keyboards you know and a lot of people hook up mechanical keyboards to their main desktop computer anyway you know they just feel better there's more travel you know where you know what's going on once you get accustomed to that goddammit you don't make any errors you know where each of key is your fingers sort of fall into place I mean if you're a way better type as than me and many many many people are maybe that keyboards not as bad but for me that keyboard sucks you know especially the old one the new ones better the new fifty sixteen is better than the old 15 for sure no doubt about it but it still sucks they had they have a lot of questionable design like one of the biggest design dumb things that Apple has ever done like I thought they would have fixed it by now but there might their mouse how you have to charge it on the bottom the plug to charge it is on the bottom of it so I say like you're out of battery you can't just like plug it and use it like a mouse while it's charging you know it pretty much uses it there it makes it you can't use it at all yeah so you can't use it while it's charging yeah the plug this is an old one oh it plugs under it so you have to open it up and get it no no no you have to plug it right here so to the bottom so you can't even use it like if you just need to hit in or something or whatever the dumbest design every still have it like they still have why don't they just have it at the end so you could use it like a regular Mouse when it's charging they want you to be responsible and charge your mouse they shouldn't ask you to be responsible for that what if something's important you want to enter it right away you can't do it yeah and white fox why does iPad not have multiple users like a computer so if you want to give your wife the Year iPad you could log let her log into her own account say you don't have all your shit open oh it doesn't know how did they do it laptops well that's the difference between Mac OS and iOS right I always do you think you would ever see the thing about Apple though they're way better with privacy way better with privacy than Google phones oh yeah you know like I was reading this thing about Android phones where there's some apps that send information to other apps they have agreements where apps contact other apps and let those apps know what you're doing good that new zoom software everyone's using like even if you don't sign in using Facebook or say anything about Facebook you're still getting your shit it's sold to Facebook like how is that possible that's crazy well it's commodity yeah you know it's a commodity and there was a great guest on the Sam Harris podcast which I remember it but this guy was talking about privacy and this very thing he's like there became a commodity that we didn't know was going to be a commodity and we all sold our rights away to it we all signed the user agreement yeah click agree sent it come on let me get going I just want to use it I don't I pay attention to what that fucking user me want seven eight pages of legalese you like what am i agreeing to yeah you know those end user agreements man those are one of the sneakiest things that people have ever perpetrated on folks at South Park episode by the way don't you a South Park was going on right now no okay if I was tray I would be like dude let's just do this I'll be writing yeah it's probably constantly writing anyway they'll probably have like five episodes ready to go by the time everything gets running I hope so five corona episodes most fucked up oh my god Comedy Central think they had a hard time when they were drawn Mohammed mm-hmm what kind of a hard time are they gonna get from the coronavirus yeah yeah and how bad is comedy going to be for a couple months when people comics start getting back on stage cuz you know at being no one's been working out you know this it'll be fine in a week yeah not even depending if you listen to your recorded recordings right yeah if you listening recordings you could you could get going I had a dream that I was in the middle of a bit and I forgot how to do it fuck yeah it was like a bit that I don't do anymore so was even weirder but it was in the middle of a bit I was like god dammit houses paid go I forgot but if I was gonna go up when this is all down and we're back up and running I'm gonna do short spots at the store and get the legs under you again kind of you down for a couple months yeah does it all the time every was gonna run of jokes though that's why South Park needs to come out right now comedians are gonna have the the hot take is gonna be so similar like what's the hot take gonna be mm-hmm there's gonna be hey don't need a fucking bat there's gonna be that one there's gonna be jokes about dough sekiz or Mandela is gonna be jokes about that says the real obvious one the printer yeah there's gonna be there's gonna be mean people that are gonna make jokes about headed to work fuck granny toilet paper I need to you know I need to pay my fucking rent how about you stay home granny you know there's gonna be those people that have that take on it it's gonna be fun it's gonna be interesting to see like if anybody has a perspective that you didn't think a lot of comics are hitting to like IG live right now it's it's gone awful watching I cannot stand thought it was a good idea to do stand-up with no crowd for the Laugh Factory oh do you see those yeah or flappers who's charging five dollars a person to go on their pay site or some but yeah as usual some virtual-open like five bucks to get on their virtual come on yeah that they are charts in a way I could say hey they're gonna stay open you know nobody is more willing to give you money than some crazy open mic or that wants to be seen right right especially some of the legit job like most of them have a job and then they do stand-up on you know their spare time they got a little disposable income probably cuz they're crazy and they have no friends right so not spending it on anything other than medication the next thing you know boom five bucks for flappers and they hit what if it was like one dude about the whole block oh that's a lair yeah wide open my career and behind him and so he does it he just dominates flappers website all day there was a stand up video game a few months ago it I don't know what how do you remember like you go into a place and like take take it your turn doing I think maybe if you got booed off like the Apollo you're done and the next person goes up well I think Grand Theft Auto was supposed to originally have that be the Comedy Store be a comedy club that you can go in to do that hey did you see those people singing along to Biggie in Brooklyn I was not real it wasn't real yeah thought so you know my wife is the first person who knows nobody's leaning out the window there's a crowd voice you could hear it's like from an arena god damn it sons of bitches they pretend I'm Dana White they got him yeah yeah yeah I was like that's pretty cool if they did do it if someone was blasting Biggie and everybody starts singing along but nope that's her legs fucks well it's because the Italians actually did do it I know in the apartment complex and they're all singing into the see them singing though but there's one lady came outside she was playing the recorder and her husband fucking smack there's a thing Fox Fox News something was like being broadcast live but almost all of those videos are being lip synced and whatnot well below it was real but like I was watching you could see it was fake I'll never smoke weed with Willie again yeah that's what that's gotta be a bummer man man if you went on stage did you stand up and they wanted you to lip-sync your old shit imagine if they had like a an album that you did and you had a lip-sync to the album including the ad-libs ideas they may ever tried me because they lost their voice or something and God you know like actually Simpson did it on SNL and got busted I never heard of it imagine comics doing that yeah I could imagine some crazy people doing it like some people that are really off people do some dumb shit we didn't imagine you know we have this random thing I forget I don't know if I ever told you this on kill Tony or will have Joe Rogan calling in and and it's just me on Spotify going all right what are we talking about gays all right click on gays and just go let's go 10 minutes 10 seconds into the and just press play like Joe it's good if we just randomly hit you saying thanks and when it works so you guys still do you're still doing kill Tony yeah we're doing it tonight we're doing it a lot of phone-ins and callings you know it's mostly just me Tony and Jeremiah it's a good movie to keep doing it man because these are gonna be first of all when people look back they're gonna look back at these shows where you guys were on you know downtime and you're like four these motherfuckers are committed to this show but even though they're completely quarantined you can't do any live shows they did all their shows by themselves no live show and you'll keep all your audience yeah yeah it's very cool to that when they made this stay at home order they included podcast as being as essential yeah it's very cool Oh medias media very important yeah and you know yet we're all stay for we're not high-fiving and kissing each other like normally too but and it does feel good to do like me and Holtzman still are doing the podcast and it's people like it cuz you know they're so depressed at home and you know it's seeing us not freaking out and just having a talk conversation like we're doing right now it's like oh maybe I need to chill out a little bit you know yeah they do but also some shit needs to change yeah I don't know what can change though man I mean what can't you watch that video those fucking cellphones spreading across and think about the virus is spreading across like how can you lighten things up and still keep people from getting infected that's the great question and why do some people have almost no reaction to it why are some people asymptomatic that's the scary thing about new diseases man you know when something new comes along they're all they're like what is this it's one thing I like about this I don't have to give anybody my joint I think that's the future more twice tips get your own bitch even glass tips who knows what kind of spittle is inside that fucking disgusting thing blue light flashing in through the new glass tip fuck out of here ooh how about the fucking remember that vaporizer bag we used to have the boy you know okay no oh my god will we get obliterated with that that was funny you still have that yes storage do you have that bong that was like 10 feet tall that was yeah I gave that somebody fuck did I give that to no no no I gave it to somebody maybe Tony's got or someone I get I had too many bongs and I never used any of them I think it's beautiful though oh that crazy sculpture one I used that one because it was so beautiful so ridiculous it was like a piece of art yeah but they just happen to get you high oh it's nice you know I that was like the early days of my pot smoking - I thought it was a good idea to have some ridiculous sculpture some ode to weed in my living room yeah you had that cool media room a gold Buddha such a weird time right now that I I keep thinking of what what it's gonna be like on the other end you know instead of just just living which I've never really do I never really think what's gonna be like on the other end I always just do stuff you know like whether I'm doing a Netflix special or whether I'm doing podcasts or doing stand-up I just do stuff I don't think like like do it like this one day it'll be that and then maybe people will like this and maybe I just keep doing it but now I'm like what is gonna be here like but what is society gonna be like with no restaurants what is society gonna be like with 50% unemployment what is society gonna be like if that disease kicks in again and what's gonna survive so I'm wondering about the future now I never wonder about the future I was just kind of do I'm so lucky now I realized so so lucky that I can do that that I could just concentrate on the shit I enjoy doing and that's a big advantage of that too is it helps you be good at that thing because you have less stress less things you're thinking about more sleep for everybody but now everybody's got to be a prepper everybody's got to be a little paranoid everybody's got to be a little a little wacked out by this everybody does even people like you and I they would want to just blow it off and think live in the moment now you can now you have especially if you have people you love that are relying on you like you have to have food now you have to keep food of your fucking house fine toilet paper that was a weird one it is we're glad a bidet why didn't everyone go crazy for food why everybody worried about wiping their ass why is that them the number one thing that seemed to be the issue more than water I'm like yeah water makes more sense in toilet paper water makes a ton of sense and so does food like dry food bring get oats right get oatmeal shit like that rice stuff that lasts a long last time you need pasta you need stuff that you could just make with a fire and a pan and some water you need to be able to just have stuff that'll keep you alive for X amount of days that's what you need you'll need toilet paper you need a rag and a sink and there you go you got a clean asshole tada you know or get one of them ones that we got in here squirt you up the booty hoses thing they have a new one that was a sponsor that you can attach to the back of a toilet it's like it's not expensive either oh yeah yeah what's that called your cousin touchy touchy right yeah how much is that cause it's very lift off it $79 yeah so for 80 bucks you get a clean asshole and you save a million dollars yeah on toilet paper it takes it takes like three minutes to install and it's the same water that you press your teeth perfect goes right into the sink after you clean your asshole no that was on the read and that was my favorite thing to say same thing that's cleaning your butthole warm water one that's only $30 more Oh splurge you're a hard-ass I see one of them Navy SEAL type dudes likes to suffer yeah yeah you could in if you decide to get a more expensive one you can skip the the air drying one because it just makes it do the whole plate smell like your asshole it's disgusting I don't like that I went over this person's house once and they had a bidet and inside their bidet was a bar so I was gonna take a leak there's a bar soap and a wet rag and I was like what that's I use it you get in there with that soap wash the old poop chute and that water shoots at the bidet is like the most unorganized ever it's basically if you fall and slip something happens and you got like slippery socks on or shoes you you fall that pipe is going right up your asshole that's stupid pipe it's in the mitt how do you fall people fall all the time people die trying to climb fences do you know that those spikes on fences kill people every year he's slept his slip on fall and falling the bidet and it punctures your asshole like a robot dick think about what that thing looks like that that that it looks like that like the top of a hammer when we got it doesn't come out until you hit the button it's like a robot arm so different that's different but it's not a bad day I'm talking about a bidet like a friend no no no no no that's a bidet seat these folks it was a French it was a French doctor and his wife we were over their house they were French and they had this bidet and it's uh looks like you know like if you slip like you're getting your butthole clean by this little little fucking pipe that's sticking straight up with little it sprays water and you're supposed to get up in there with soap wash it down no that's the way to do it though better than the way we do it I'll smear and everything there it is so that one's a that's a safe one I don't some of them have protrude Rance used to have one yeah Jesus Christ I'm trying to find one that sticks out more alright give up here fine look at that circle look at that that the the the the drawing to the left with the red circle click on that oh wait he's much small they're little maybe someone's a cruel person that had the house yeah maybe it was one of those douche sticks I know when he said date that porn star she snapped the anal douche that pull that's a hose Wow I was in New York once and I posted on Instagram the shitter had not one but two hoses had a hose on either side I didn't get it either until someone explained to me that some because it was a very fancy hotel and some people from other lands prefer to wash their hand wash their ass rather with their left hand it's the lefty style yeah so for you to ask them to grab a hose the right hand side and hose down there asshole they'd be offended you're not supposed to do that we write in you suppose do it your left hand yeah - and one on each side like a industrial-strength I see I think I made a YouTube video or Instagram video huh yeah it's um it's a better way to clean your ass that's for sure like the way we do it with toilet paper is really disgust oh it's fucking gross you're just smushing it around like if you had that shit on your eyebrow not your taint hair spray your eyebrow hairs how much rubbing there it is one on the left one on the right what the fuck dude look at that I like that you try it out yes with my shame with their poop juice everyone man that one that one's for a big asshole what maybe once for a pussy once for an asshole maybe you double jam right and left right hammers to clit cuz my bday has a pussy but in a Nash mode yes girls probably use that thing it feels good on me but I guess I'm not ashamed to admit it at warm water oh yeah what's up on your butt I guess it's a smaller little thing that I remembered so I don't think you have to worry though the bidet there's a bidet on the other side of the room - look if you see there over there that's a good day so there was a bidet see that's what I'm talking about see that little robot dick that's sticking up did you see it in the bidet watch see watch when they turn it around or when I turn it around whether after I grab a hold of these two things I was super confused the other side has a thing that pokes out in the middle and that's kind of what I was talking about and some of them are a little higher than others but they're these weird little yes that little robot dick is that not that part the other one the one earlier see it doesn't matter really doesn't you know the touch bar on that laptop do you touch bar is the shit cuz even an Instagram video you can back it up everyone's gonna say they need to Adam yes I can I turned all that shit off oh no no no it's great that's the only good thing about the 16 inch MacBook that I appreciate is that touch bar we're for YouTube videos you scroll back and forth it's so much better than having to keep your finger on this one area on the trackpad and hold on to the thing move it left and right or click on this clear though it's so seamless like you know exactly where your finger is it's a more effective way of navigating like YouTube videos gyro your track of landscape that you're navigating in is very defined right so you just get your finger on it you just move it back and forth it's open the ever uses them there's a bunch of keyboard shortcuts on YouTube to use which are great and helpful but I couldn't tell you what more than two of them are like I can skip frame five seconds together list of a bunch of places but you can jump to all sorts of parts in the video just by hitting certain keys I didn't know that yeah save a bunch of time but no one's gonna have remember them or use them right they should open up gems what anything is you do that well people work out its social distancing and proper cleaning it seems like they should be able to do it should only open up gems for people who never contact anyone who contacts old people to sign a contract cleans after themselves seems like it's the dirtiest place ever spit on the floor they want to go back yes what I mean what what kind of disgusting virus carrying solution is sweat from some dude who didn't shower today went straight to Gold's fuck had pumped up ready to get my PR in or PB personal best personal record PR personal record right yeah you got to know those terms bro have you thought about doing anything special it's like now that you know you have to be locked down because time to work on something well I've been really getting into broadcasting fee heart I'm learning how to do it the best way and and I'm into VR man I think that's the future and and these new at games coming out and just let me ask you has he broadcast you play in half-life yeah I do it I've done five broadcast on my YouTube page and I'm trying to get it so I could have my whole body and there maybe in the future that takes a lot of work dude broadcasting HD VR in half life in the game like that would be fucking amazing do you think about how many people play games if they could figure out a way you know you watch someone play and it's real similar like if you remember the back in the quake days we'd watch demos like if a really good player was playing oh yeah I'd watch like there's this dude named Thresh I've talked to my mom on the podcast before I watch all his demos she was just he's still around he's around yeah he he he and I exchanged the messages way back in the dick but it was obviously for this Korona know what you're saying yeah it's like step one but you could see her button in real life right you would be her yeah this is what I'm trying to get my house right now and it's hard to dig so you have to have a lot of green screen crap that's cool this is cool like that is it'll be interesting to see someone walk through in third-person but I'm talking about its first person I know I know dude that would be the shit like this is this game allows you to place a virtual camera for the purpose of doing this in there so like not doing that you can have the headset for a vision of it oh you can't yeah I did a headset yeah that's the what I'm saying is like when when people watch you play a game they're gonna want to watch you survive some crazy VR like fantasy game like half-life yeah like that would be really captivating because it's one thing to watch a guy play a game but if you could put the VR goggles on and watch with him and you're looking around and I'm seeing what you're seeing holy fuck dude what are the good where there's other good good series that are out I know amazon's that has some good series now people were saying yeah well I've you know that Tiger thing I highly recommend but I'm definitely gonna see that but I want to see something that's fake to Lulu really good one actor the guy from Parks and Rec was his name the comedian guy Offerman he's great man he does yeah he's one of the main guys like he's the steve jobs guy and that's where in Westroads back I don't have you ever gotten dude I liked Westworld but the wife got a little grossed out people's heads up I know yeah don't stay away from the spoilers they're everywhere well yeah Wes really fucks not in the West anymore though no no not west world I mean it's Ozark people people are binge-watching like instantly people are so greedy now the use of all toilet paper they sit there watching those are but oh the other ones expanse I heard the expanse is really good have you ever seen that pee a bunch of people that I respect that like sci-fi told me that the expanse which is I think that's an Amazon show see that yes four seasons in the season coming soon Amazon know anything about it no I haven't seen it at all no I've never even heard of it what hurts really good there's too many shows oh there definitely is and they never stop yeah they never stop they never go we're just gonna keep the shows we have make them better no I really watch that tiger show too because I was so annoyed if people ask me if I watch it I'm like I gotta just watch it so I could say yes and know what people are talking about I'm tired of hearing about it yeah dude I was watching regular TV and it was you couldn't for some reason fast-forward through the commercials what yeah there was something going on but you couldn't fast-forward through commercials I was going in and out of this room with the TV and I couldn't figure it out but while I was watch I just stopped and paused watching these commercials on regular TV for these upcoming shows that they have and it's like it's almost like they're trying to put you into a coma but they're trying to put you in a state of mind like like some fake-ass Norman Rockwell painting of America some we like to try it's a it's a call down easy to predict version of a drama you know we're all in this together and it's perfect perfect music and we're all about God and family and and they're all hugging and smiling and like what are you doing in here it doesn't work on me anymore I can't watch that shitting it's no you can't watch it it's it's but that's what I'm saying it's so strange when you compare that to some of the shit that we watch now like if you watch Game of Thrones or if you watch Ozark or if you watch you know the outside are all these crazy fucking shows you watch a show that's made like a 1980 CBS drama and you're like what is this and then you realize oh my god they still make them this don't make them make them just like that Grey's Anatomy has been on TV for that's still on yeah yeah is dr. dreamy still on it I don't know is he he might be are you talking about it dreamy Patrick yeah amazing yeah I like what Sports is doing now right because there's no sports or they've been doing NASCAR like video games and it looks so real like a real NASCAR race and I guess Madden in like next week is gonna have a football game but it's gonna be a video game Madden football game so that might be the future of sports but they are talking about doing like the NBA might do a hold their whole tournament in the Vegas this summer because just like they do in be a summer league they can't play any they all they're fuck they're fucked right now they've had not taken two weeks off that's all the bronsted they might have to you might need like 10 games to get warmed back up to even start going they have no preseason again all these guy there's a China league that's starting up soon all those players from America that are gonna go over there to just work out on their own just like some UFC fighters who can't fight right now they're gonna go and play in China yeah son Stephon Marbury is a big star there and he's trying to get some ass sent back to Brooklyn where he's from but he's a huge star in China now damn yeah interesting things happening to hold premier soccer league team that all over Europe they're gonna like have like a World Cup event type thing a huge TV event they're getting TV partners in place they're gonna have like warranty and everyone put them in little camps all the tea like I don't know 30 teams maybe 20 to 15 who's buying up all the stock now that the markets crashed cuz you know that shit's going on in a lot of you are still sports guy well I mean all sorts of people right that some people say that's a good thing to do I don't know it's so crashing so I don't well you got a wonder because the people that can buy the stock are the people that have the most money already crazy stories this could be a giant change and like who owns what yeah somebody could buy it they speculated that like what company I think Apple could just buy Netflix or something combined that footnote Apple could just buy Disney oh yeah they definitely could they definitely could they have so much money they're so weird like the amount of money they have is weird you know like what a amazing move but what company has that kind of cash no one Amazon's close and they're gonna probably be the first two trillion dollar company but it's a very different thing they sell everything right they sell toothpaste and fucking bubble gum and nails you know they said they'll they'll tell you everything but Apple just sells you computers phones watches sibich mm that's it it's for right now it's amazing but no no one has loyalty to like tech products where people have with Apple didn't have a store 10 years ago is it 10 years I don't know but it's not been that long there's no Apple stores you couldn't you had to go to like a Micro Center he needs more than 10 years but you're right but dude that fucking Genius Bar that was the ultimate like call it a Genius Bar like really these are just people that work here why you saying geniuses these aren't geniuses I want to believe you're making these people operate it's such a exaggerated standard right you have to be geniuses right can't just be a guy who understands batteries oh yeah man little broad test here no it has to be a genius excuse me sir what's your IQ yeah gateway we just call him text tech support it wasn't it the Geek Squad no that's like our best that's by that's yeah that's hilarious geek squad geek somehow or another is more offensive than dork to me oh yeah nerd is the top of the food chain nerd is like you could say proud but geek is like you're a little fucked up right and dork it's endearing kind of dork schoolwork cute Dirk's yeah geek isn't cute geek is like you're fucking freaking out keep it together bitch yeah yeah yeah dork is like you fucking door work yeah yeah geek is like more well geek out that's a good point you can geek out in a good way that's a good point yeah no one's complained about language right now notice ah yeah all that shit went away but so much Corona it's just tiring yeah well that's the other thing that's going on with people it's the fear man when you you have a hard time dealing young anxiety you have apprehension you just fearful of the future and fearful of the disease some people had anxiety before this this can accelerate everything that's gonna be real hard for just for mental health of people gonna be people that are gonna have a really hard time also accepting that this is just something that happened to them it's just not something that they did wrong you know when something goes bad and you did something wrong it kind of like I made a bad decision I should have done it that way I fucked up and we should have had that meeting and then you know you might know why your business fell apart but if it falls apart now it's like you didn't even do anything wrong and the government gets to tell you they have to sit back now if you were conspiracy theorists that's so many of them you would think what would be the best way to gain more control of the people the best way first of all to accelerate despair and accelerate unemployment you would do all the things that are just going to happen from that what naturally happens in a disease people are willing to give up certain civil liberties if they if they think they can get more safety and it's true we should stay home it's true it will be better for everybody it's true that we need to take precautions it's true that we need to self isolate all those things are true but it's also true that you're giving a certain amount of power to the government to lock things down and control you they're giving people tickets in New York if they catch them walking around they're given $500 tickets they're doing it in other places too I'm sure that's where it gets weird man because who are these people these people that are telling you can't go anywhere they're just the government they're just people they're people telling people that they can't go somewhere which is fine if we need to do that like right now but what if it just sort of stays that way what if it stays that way to a lesser extent with this I you know how we're gonna stop coronavirus from really taking place I want to know where you're going I want to know where you're going I want to know I want when you go through each state we're gonna have checkpoints we're gonna pull you over it's gonna be a heightened police day sir have you been tested for the corona virus and you put a fucking thing on your forehead what if what if this thing really does start coming back the way it has in wool on or people tested negative and then they later tested positive if that happens here are we gonna keep this lockdown thing going on what if it's something that we all have and it comes back like when Jon Jones had those steroids in a system and the picograms and it just kept flashing back what do that's with this stuff well if we test positive for coronavirus every couple of years what if it's like herpes what if you keep it for life what if we're assuming we got rid of it we're gonna just accept martial law we're just gonna accept tanks in the streets what are we gonna accept it's a real good question so if you were a nut right now you would be fucking going crazy because you'd be saying all the pieces are in place for like a hostile takeover and they're in place because they really truly are the best ways to save people's lives like it's all it's all smart thing to do but if you were a conspiracy theorist you'd say this is exactly what I would do if I wanted to take over and that's what we have to be really careful of we got to be careful somehow another walking that very fine balance of protecting people a disease it's invisible killer and preserving our freedom and preserving rights all those things are very important that we don't just give that up because it's it's not the way to go it's just not we have to figure out our way through this disease and then we have to figure out some way to return to normalcy and that's got to happen we can't just stay like this where no one works anymore we can't just not ever take risks we can't just not go out so once this does get rolling again it's gonna be real interesting to see how much if any control the government retains how much if any restrictions get get imposed how much of these restrictions we just absorb and they become new or new things I got a normal thing rather where'd you just go to the airport you have to take a temperature test and go to the airport they want to test you or we're gonna have to start wearing suits like kind of like Star Wars like these kind of stinking helmets and breathing apparatus in everyone that works at the grocery store is going to be robots you know and imagine that you get to the hotel yep decompress and unzip you can enjoy New York City from your balcony look so I'm pretty out there with all the murderous viruses swarming around killing people with the virus got together made virus tornadoes it started just throwing people against walls or virus babies if I'm not born listen man if a fucking if a wind can pick up a semi and make it fly through the air like we've seen why can't a virus tornado just slam you into a wall imagine like viruses accelerate billions of times and they form colonies and they become intelligent and they realize if they move quick enough they can actually like they could knock you off your feet then they go down your throat like a demon happening already it's crazy for sure but so was a regular virus so it was a regular virus they I mean just what we were reading about the h1n1 and all these other flus that kill so many countless thousands of people not countless they counted them they're actually pretty accurate right we had a double check I mean just think about the the sheer numbers of people that have died from those things if those were demons the diseases how freaky would that be if we really look we're gonna lose a certain amount of people every year to demons why is it better to lose to a virus than a demon little cuts running up into your window and killing your grandma baby god fuck god damn it you go in there and she's just bones just white bones sticking up there's a horde of little Godzilla's just chewing through her meat why would that be more horrific than a virus the silent thing that chokes you to death I need to know I've been thinking that like delirious there's been that talk when we've talked about UFOs that all the world needs to get to come together is like that alien invasion yeah is not too different than what that would be it is an alien tech yeah it is it's foreign to us Action Bronson had it right the whole time just getting high and watch in ancient aliens and try to get so high you just try to sort through what they're saying he figured it out it's interesting to think what if this did come from you know space like they're sick of us yeah imagine ya just tried something something just the real fear is that they're eventually gonna have something that you can't fix you know I had this guy on that was talking about with my friend do you remember that guy's name with Doug Doug durin the scientist Brian his scientist friend came in with my friend Doug durin from Wisconsin to talk about chronic wasting disease Brian Richards Brian Richards thank you and he explained how this is not made to jump to people but if it does it's gonna be horrific and it's like it's in Deer and it's made to jump to mice and it's spreading through the Midwest and like this is something you got to keep an eye on like this is not a this is not a safe thing like if this does make the jump to people and people get hit with this prion disease that's called chronic wasting disease in deer if that spreads to people we're fucked we're fucked it's gonna be like a zombie apocalypse if that gets into people it's like there are a hundred percent of them died beard there are a hundred percent die they don't live for very long either and it's a horrific death their body shrivels that's why they call it chronic wasting disease they waste away and they like vomiting everywhere all this like stuff is coming out of their mouths from their nose and this stuff that's coming out of their mouth and nose it's highly contagious and then other deer come along and eat the grass that they spit out this phlegm or this body fluid whatever the fuck it is and they get it from that and they get it from sharing food sources and they leave it everywhere to when the deer are dying they this this stuff comes out of them and they leave it everywhere it's like the virus knowing it's losing its host and it decides to just land on plants it's scary as fuck because it's like mad cow disease they just reported the other day read something in China where they found a guy on a bus that the guy like a version of I'm gonna Flo's Corona that usually has never traveled from rat or mouse to human it was the first time ever like said there might be a hole right he another corona that was like two days ago no I found a guy in the bus and they said don't worry that's never happened before there's patient zeros or really pissing me off yeah what the fuck jamie is one handing it let's see who gets it antivirus hantavirus damn Jamie one six days ago man who died on bus in China test positive for hantavirus motherfucker this is how many days ago six Oh make this a little larger so I could read it with my shitty eyes a passenger who died on a bus in china has tested positive for a completely different virus than co vid 19 one more fatal that often produces very similar symptoms according to state-run media the unidentified woman from u ha yunnan province died while on a chartered bus heading to his workplace in Shandong Province the state-run glow time's announced in a tweet on Monday he tested positive for hashtag hantavirus other 32 people in the bus were tested the outlet stated offering no further details oh fuck the new virus starting just as China starts lifting its strict quarantine from kovat 19 Jesus Christ okay however experts were quickly to point out that it's not a new virus and is only rarely thought to have been passed between humans oh that doesn't make me feel good yeah it's only recent that this is starting to happen yeah this is not good listen to this the hantavirus first emerged in the 1950s in American Korean War in Korea Hanten River it spreads from rat mice if humans ingest their body fluids human human transmission is rare rare is not a word I like when it comes to a disease that kills the fuck out of you please don't do do not panic unless you plan to eat rats and a billion Chinese people just want fuck yeah well these dogs are okay well how many of them rats they eat what they can eat right you those wet markets are just that whoa after exposure to fresh urine droppings or saliva of infected rodents hey symptoms may occur up to eight weeks after exposed after exposure to fresh urine droppings or saliva infected rodents okay well that that that can get a rat to a person so it can't get person-to-person yet but what if that thing morphs they're pretending like things don't morph you know like bitch they got to a person in the first place because they made a jump all these things right avian flu swine flu all these flus they they jump from an animal to a human god imagine if this starts going on god damn it well this is what I'm saying now what if it does and then they keep this level of of security and this level of restriction and it restricts your freedom man it makes you really realize how well we had it before those we just do whatever you wanted you just right now you could just drive to Vegas let's go to Vegas let's go see Britney Spears yay you go down there nice dinner that's what we do cozy Brittany really bitch you know not anymore bitch now no one's gonna know anymore if you wanted to take over the world isn't that the way you would do it I'm not saying that that's what's happening what if I was saying if you were writing a book on a takeover of the world by another nation what better way to do it than that what if North Korea was behind all this well I don't think they have the resources China since it's in China it's much more likely we'll get started from China whether it is intentional and unintentional that's beside the point I don't think it was intentional but I think that when things like this happen people do take advantage of opportunity and you got to be real careful who gets the better hand when they taking advantage of opportunity it's just it's a it's new ground it's weird for people they know where it came from they've isolated that this thing did come from this market in Wuhan they know it's just it's the way things like this can play out if there's a bunch of these is almost just like someone starting a conspiracy it's not it doesn't have to be done like it just actually naturally exists and the same people that would benefit from a conspiracy or who would engage the conspiracy to defraud people or fuck people over in the first place they're the ones are going to jump in and take advantage of it the quickest that's what's so scary about it totalitarian ideas thrive when people are scared they want someone to take over the reins they want someone to take over we got to block the streets no more travel we're gonna block this you can't go to work in a block then you're gonna be poor and broke it scared I'm not saying that that's what they're doing what I am saying is if you wanted to do something to really take over a civilization it would be this way that's how you would do it you would do it diseases I'm not saying they're doing that I don't think they are I think this is just a horrible natural disaster I wanna be really clear on that but we might come out of this different than we went in that's real there's tanks driving down the road in California tanks and like oh they're just getting supplies or something like what do you hey there's tanks rolling through New York City my friend John Joseph he sent me a video from his phone of tanks rolling down New York City like hot armed Humvees and tanks yeah freaky like military vehicles in camo like were you hiding you're in New York City what are you hiding from what kind of camo is that is that where they even when they use them in cities they came all up yeah seems so rude is so like to let you know they might hide in the bushes to bitch but they drive through the cities to lock everybody down they had those murdered-out matte black paint jobs instead it would be a little bit more intimidating me but yeah pizza slices and stuff well it's at least with camo if you have your car is all camo'd up and you're not in the military you know they're gonna have an eye on you anyway I think what are you doing right and they serve in like West Virginia dudes who have like camo'd up H ones Hummers and they're driving those real military-style Hummer around like please check that guy's house you know please please read his facebook please he's driving around with an armored vehicle all camo doubt you don't do you really need an h1 Hummer in LA there's so wide do they submit they don't still make this they don't still make them but people still have him yeah not only do people have them but people they do these mods on them because they're really slow like Hummers really slow and I pretty sure they're a diesel engine it's like a slow shitty stinky engine it's not it's not good it's not optimal so they take the engine out of those shit boxes and put like giant American engines in there and turn them into it's a company in Florida I forget what the the company is but they make custom Humvees like the real military Humvees but they deck them out inside with dope interiors and they put ridiculous like thousand horsepower turbocharged engines in them and Chet look if if there is even like if you have you know one wacky idea in your head like maybe maybe someone can do their the corona virus pandemic Hummer that they made oh shit I just uploaded it probably to what's the company predator yes that's it yeah so they made a corona virus that's what it says I don't know um V I was making a big assumption see the that's that's the shit that they make they make things like those listen they put these bonkers engines in them have you ever written in one of those they're you're real far from the person we would be like this that's how far we would be yes I was driving and you were the passenger there would be almost this much space in between us thrilled there were real weird but dude you don't worry about shit when you're in one of those things you like run me over fucker good luck bitch they just feel like like a real tank you could run over a wall and I'm right that's the thing I remember when I was over a wall yeah the whole underside is completely protected like you can scratch over all kinds of shit and everything's inside that's why there's that big hump that's because the drivetrain is all protected underneath the chassis so you get this extraordinary travel in terms of how far like or you go over a rock like you're your height what is that called there's a term for that how much travel space you have underneath the vehicle hearing clearance that's it yeah let's see if a ton of clearance and you know that's a military designed over-engineered vehicle for the streets yeah but if you're like super paranoid I like how it my car you could do the clearance that you could like to raise it yeah yeah those are the future right cyber truck yeah all those electric cars of the future there's gonna get better at charging them it's the future especially if we could really get solar down here in LA for really nail solar yeah I mean they knew the technology needs to change for sure because it would be nice to have solar on your car but right now I think I've read like if you had all solar panels on top of your car it still wouldn't do that crazy though like you have a source of power that people use to power their homes and big buildings solar but you can can't utilize it in a car which is always in the Sun yeah especially out here right I just kind of figured it out you know Fisker did they had a roof that a solar roof that powered the radio mmm yeah it only powered the radio though but that's better than nothing you think it would still be good like hey if my car's sitting out all day at least it gave me 20 miles yeah right sitting in the parking lot all day it should be sucking up some juice yeah I think that's coming to I think just the technology is just not there well they need a battery technology jump right really a big jump and how much power gets stored and how quickly you can get it in there cuz right now it's still a little clunky yeah well that we the Tesla wall the battery pack of the wall you know that's pretty badass for you it's pretty badass but what I mean is it takes too long to charge a car and then it doesn't have long enough of a range right well that's when the wireless charging on the roads were you're just driving on a wireless charger you just got to give up a microchip they put a microchip in your hand and you're fine and it's also it doubles as a corona tester so you make sure they never get mistaken for someone with Corona they just have to scan you hey you going into this bathroom can I have your hand please WOM up green go ahead and urinate with peace and harmony go ahead we're putting those UV lights I might be freaking out I mean really I'm trying not to sound like a conspiracy nut cuz I'm not accusing anyone of creating conspiracy but what I am saying is if if I was a conspiracy nut or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world this is not a bad way to do it I don't think that's happening right now I want to be real clear but it's kind of the same result that we're experiencing right now where everyone's being forced to shut down with who knows what consequences but it's also the right thing to do so we're all like whoa how do you you know it's another one of those things about being a person or the right thing to do still feels crazy still feels like all right we're just gonna sit around yeah I guess that's what you have to do no it's kind of in one way encouraging that so many people are willing to stay home and people aren't rebelling like fuck you this is my country I'm gonna go to work I'll take a chance everybody's gonna get it anyway fuck you there's way less people doing that and when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people pretty crazy almost everyone's complying with staying home there's only a few essential businesses yeah we're gonna have to I think really have spacesuits to leave the house and work they're gonna probably be like this it's the metal plastic thing now what could wash off really put socks and their spacesuits it's gonna be a mess are you worried Jamie yeah I've never seen you this word because I've everything you're sort of saying like I I look into the future and sort of see where we're headed and I don't see a I don't really see much out there because I don't know what it is but it's not anything good because there's nothing there I don't see like going to the movies again seems like that's probably close to out movies were already dying anyway they might not survive this they've already opened up the ability to like put those right into your house for 20 bucks perfect way better suite so when a movie theater isn't open again all right what's next you know concerts sporting events you know I don't know that's just those are all the fun things we used to do so like fuck it's also once everything's in place where they can treat people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators then are we gonna go back to the way things were or we're gonna have new standards in place I don't know I don't know man that they look they did an unprecedented thing they lock down the entire country to save people's lives never happened before we're in new territory and you know it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense and I'm when I'm one of the people who's talking about something like this I were just read yesterday I don't know if someone shared this is of F scott Fitzgerald wrote I think this was a letter found from 1920 when he was living in France during the Spanish flu ooh and like he was I don't know who is writing to I'll try to find it right now but he's talking about how they stocked up on a bunch of alcohol and people were being told almost like now I could you know you're told not to go anywhere but some people don't believe it forget he was talking about another writer friend of his mmm who wasn't taking it seriously and like whoa so it was like real sounded I guess that's how people always have been right especially back then when it's real hard to get information imagine people are dying and everyone's just like what's going on you got to read the newspaper but like fuck bitch what happened it's fake huh how the kitchen I just saw that this note was going viral during the pandemic and a lot of people have been falling for it son of a bitch well what a good way to end I'm glad you guys are still doing kill Tony I really do I think it's an awesome move it's a way to go just keep keep pumping out the content let people know you're there and you know they'll be psyched when everything gets back up and running again you guys back up running to your live shows I'm hope we're all on the road again in at the very least this summer I really hope so yeah it's been fun though having this podcast definitely good times the time fun times give everybody your Instagram red band hurry DBA ends what they're saying yeah red band and check
