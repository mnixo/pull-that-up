here we go 5 4 3 2 1 hello yuan hey Cho what's happening yeah good I just wish the same for we were on camera that I I've met a note to myself that says talk slow talk American because although I spent about half the year here we've British people there's a reorientation where you suddenly realize I was once in a and I hop in cactus Arizona and I was saying to the woman right like I'll have some pancakes whatever it was she kept looking at me going what literally three minutes she goes do you speak English I was like why people fucking invented it right but no one was there to laugh at my son Joker's they didn't understand what the fuck I was saying Arizona is a strange place I really love Arizona there's great parts like Phoenix is amazing Tucson is a great place to but it's a Wild West sort of a state it's one of those weird holdover states that have a lot of weird old-school laws like like I think you could just walk around with a gun yeah you can't my main experience in Phoenix was in Arizona in fact was going out with a group of women who were made to come out on a chain gang wearing t-shirts saying I was a drug addict when members of the public mocked them in Garrett that right was written this book about but it spoke about the war on drugs and i said joe arpaio yeah Sheriff Arpaio no longer Sheriff now thankfully but yeah and it was yeah Arizona is a deeply weird place it's weird a lot of really nice people but it's a hundred and fifty thousand degrees yeah well literally almost nobody lived there until air-conditioning was invented right right you see what I once made a horrendous mistake in fact in Phoenix where I had to walk somewhere and I could see on the map it was like a mile away so it's like just walk it's fine and I get like halfway there and people are literally stopping their cars going are you okay because the only reason anyone would ever walk in Phoenix was basically if your car had broken down it repaired to them I might have actually just chosen to walk right plus you're so white I am literally the meat like a tomato I used to go with a Brazilian who would literally just look at my body and laugh like you're so right how can a human be so white I don't also I never have a noise palate like I'm either this albino color or red run I never there's no rich brown hue I have none of my ancestors the Scottish and Swiss so they never saw the Sun right none of my ancestors my friend Jamie was over my house once and he's not this friend Jamie a different friend Jamie who's British as well and my daughter who was at the time I think she was like 10 or something like that she goes she goes to my watch shows mommy he's so white and she and she goes yeah she goes no no like he's white like paper Jamie became Jamie white like paper description of my lack of pigment is curly true it's funny that we how much we appreciate the English accent though the English accent is like one of the best tools for selling things to very gullible Americans whether it's people benefit from constant positive discrimination in the United States it's like having a 10-inch dick just having a British accent people oh my god you got an accent all humans have accents I've just got you know it looks like it's of a cherished one we look really it makes you feel like you're more sophisticated you're more well-read you're more aware of the world I mean I just AM sophisticated and well write anyway you know but you get this constant yeah constantly people are scribing to you much better qualities than you actually have but what does it work in Reverse like in in England what is the reaction to American accents is it's mostly discussed right no there's a mixture Americans weaker I always think like the relationship of Britain markets like one of those police mirrors because we grow up constantly looking at the United States right we're constantly staring through we are immersed in American culture but when Americans look back at us they're just seeing like a reflection of themselves I mean Americans watch Downton Abbey and know about like the Queen or whatever but I but there isn't that two-way dialogue that there is that the the you know the yeah so it's a slightly weird so I think we feel very American right I spent half the year here and I you know every now and then you come up against these deep cultural differences that you're just like Oh okay right this is really not my culture right and it's a those moments of disorientation are really strange like give me one for an example well there's a question that Americans ask all the time but I have literally never heard of European ask right that's the question what's your story every American you can go to the most crusty right-wing person coming at a moral argot or a kid in West Baltimore and you can say what's your story and they'll have an answer the only context I can imagine a British person saying what's your story would be in a police interrogation it would be an extremely hostile question what's your story right it would be you just wouldn't ever say it right we don't Americans narrative eyes their lives in a way I absolutely love and as a journalist who writes books about like depression addiction and you want people to talk about their lives it's an unbelievable gift tea right that people will tell you I've never once been on a bus in Mississippi and sitting next to a woman and within five minutes of chatting tersh you told me about like had two miscarriages how her mother hated her and I thought if we were Swiss where my dad's from you wouldn't tell me this until we got married and maybe not even then right so there's a level of candor and storytelling among Americans it's one of the best things about this this this you know fucked up an amazing place I just love in it there's something about there's a there's a kind of narrative openness that's very different about this place than Europe anywhere in Europe now when you would talk to people in England you you guys don't have the same level of social me not social media but of reality television you have some like big brother but you don't have it to the extent that we have it here right yeah it hasn't well I mean your country has literally been taken over by television right we have a reality and president no it hasn't conquered the whole culture in that way well he's a reality television president but he's sort of a game show host president like that's how I used to describe myself and I was hosting Fear Factor there like you host a reality show my sort of it's a game show it's just a fucked up game show it's like and Trump was hosting a game show essentially right it was a contest it wasn't like Keeping Up with the Kardashians that's a true reality show because there's literally nothing going on other than these people's lie and whatever orchestrated bullshit they put in to make it more interesting yeah I hadn't thought of it that way I think because but I think that's part of the thing that I was getting to about Americans always wanted to give you their narrative they always want to give you the story of their life so when someone says what's your story they're ready have it ready you know because it's almost like we feel like we're in some sort of a small television show all the time or some sort of small production it's like almost part of our who we are yeah every American thinks that the star of their own movie my yeah he said this but someone realizes you know sometimes in life you realize you're just the extra right you're in the corner of the shop right right and then yeah I think that's true and I think that's that's not as true of British people or I think there's certain how to put it like there's a certain kind of self deprecation you're taught as a British person you're taught and I had to kind of unlearn it living here so what be examples I forget where I read this story so maybe it's not true but I remember here's ago so we had these terrible subway bombs in 2005 which we remember for young British men go on to the London Underground and murder I think it was over 50 people and two weeks later another group of jihadis tried to do the same thing but they hadn't built the bombs very well so they go down into the subway and the there's a loud bang but it doesn't connect with the detonator so there's a loud bang that doesn't actually below everyone up obviously people freaked the fuck out as you can imagine right and I forget maybe this isn't and maybe this is a story that someone told that wasn't actually true but it's I think it reveals something very very something about our British character so if I remember rightly three of the Bombers escaped on the escape on the day in a caught like a few hours later and one of them's caught on at the time right and someone I think it was an off-duty fire officer in the story chases after them for ages chasing after the guy for ages while everyone else is running the fuck away and it catches the guy and he throws him to the ground and what he said to him was that the off-duty fire officer says to the attempted suicide bomber you rude rude man right and what I love about that is like the idea that suicide bombing is just like bad manners right it's like it's just impolite right or even a better example which is true it was reported that time definitely was during the riots we had in 2011 in London there was one place I forget right is where they broke into a luxury goods store and they could only make it was very strong window so they could only make a hole in the corner of the window and it was caught on the security cameras that the rioters formed a line to go in and loot the store right that's how deep the idea of like keyring and making a line is in British culture even in a riot we're like I know I think you were you were before me right there Kilian friend is about Bank hey he lives in he lives in London and she like if I've ever heard funny bug does she read that be like you fucking English you don't know how to riot this in a Roger probably a cue what's wrong with you people right you guys don't have Black Friday sales do you know what they've just started yeah it's an unfortunate business that might be the end of you million surviving Black Friday right there's something about those deals when people get that bargain and then they open that door ready go and people pile through all humanity gets tossed aside why stay get you into the fucking financial desperation of ordinary Americans right it's a little bit of that but it's also the competitive nature of those things where you're trying to grab the few remaining items that are 25% off and even saving for this TV for six months and there it is right in front of you and you charge and people are fighting left and right it's awful it's just a terrible way for people to you know they interact with each other so what do you got it for me I was reinstituted as we talked last time about my book about depression losses and one thing stresses me as we talk about the book I wrote about addiction and the war on drugs and it really was that outlast I mean yeah yes a book that came out a few sports just come out in a new edition with his loads of extra material particular about the opioid crisis and essentially because so you added to it yeah loads of new stuff because there are books about 5 years old now and although with loads of new stuff now but you know it was saying I cared about for this really like personal reason in that one of my earliest memories is her trying to wake up one of my relatives and not not being able to I didn't I don't understand why then because I was a little boy but as I got older I realized we had drug addiction in my family and it got to the point where I was writing chasing the screen my book about the drug war about I guess I started eight years ago and some of the people I loved were in a really shitty condition terrible state and I was trying to figure out what to do nothing I was doing was working nothing I was doing was helping and I decided what okay well there are lots of people all over the world are trying to deal with this problem I want to go and meet with them talk with them so I ended up going on this big journey it took three years I travelled over 30,000 miles I wanted to sit with you know people who'd been through addiction it'll actually led to a lot other aspects of the war on drugs which I think as important as the what we do about addiction I want to sit with the places that had the harshest possible policies like we mentioned Arizona where I went out with this these women were made to go out on chain gangs that are humiliated and and and tormented Vietnam where they make people with addiction problems go into literally forced labor camps and the places that had the most compassionate possible policies like Portugal where they decriminalized all drugs with incredible results Switzerland with a legalized heroin incredible results and and I guess I ended up just spending so much time it's such a crazy mixture of people from her you know transgendered crack dealer in Brooklyn who ended up actually being one of the smartest people I know - a hit man for the deadliest Mexican drug cartel and he's definitely not one of the smartest people I know and and I learned loads of things but I guess the heart of what I learned is just so much of what we've been told about this for so long it's now a hundred years since we started fighting the war on drugs in this country and it was then imposed on the rest of the world so much of what we're told is wrong drugs aren't what we think they are addiction isn't what we think it is the war on drugs isn't what we think it is and the alternatives to the war on drugs aren't what we think they are so in some ways it's kind of dawning - Rick go all over the world and realize so much of what we take for granted isn't right but that opens up this whole exciting other set of possibilities the the main reason why people assume that people do drugs is to escape reality what do you think is the the primary thing that they're running from so you've gotta separate out two things and this surprised me because my family's experience was pretty bad and catastrophic addiction but most drug use even the main drug war body in the world the UN office of Drug Control admits that 90% of all currently banned drug use is what they call non problematic so the person isn't addicted and it doesn't damage their health right so 90% so let's set that aside we'll come back to that okay there's like 90% that's recreational use where people use because it makes their lives better right then you've got the 10 Harvey sip of wine at work or C or a whole range a whole range of currently cannabis a whole range of currently illegal drugs and in most cases there are some people who have addictions to cannabis and B so that you then got got to ask well what's happening with this 10% who have got a problem right what's going on and one of the things that really blew my mind in the research were chasing The Scream was realizing I had deeply misunderstood what addiction is I had misunderstood the thing I thought I had been seeing in front of me since I was a kid right so most people let's think about heroin addiction because that was close to me most people if we stopped the next twenty people to walk past your you know your studio and we said to them what causes heroin addiction I think they'd look at us like we were stupid and they'd say well the clues in the name dipshit write heroin causes her in addiction we've been told this story for a hundred years that's become totally part of our our common sense right we think if we took the we took the next 20 people after that who walked past the studio and we injected them all with heroin every day for a month at the end of that month they'd all be heroin addicts for a simple reason there's chemical hooks in heroin that their bodies would start to desperately physically need and we think that a lot of people think that's what addiction is right is this physical hunger for the chemical hook inside the drug right and there is some reality to Chemical hooks they exist they're real but that's actually mmm a very small part of what's going on the first thing that alerted me to the fact there's something wrong with that story we've been told because when it was explained to me by loads of doctors in Britain where I'm from if you step out into the street and you get hit by a truck and you break your hip you'll be taken to hospital and you'll be giving loads of a drug called diamine diamorphine is heroin right it's the medical name for heroin it's the stuff you'll be giving the hospital is much better than the shit you buy on the street because it's medically pure it's you know not contaminated and if what we think about addiction is right that it's just caused by exposure to the drug what should be happening to all these people in British hospitals have been given loads of heroin right anyone watching this podcast who's got a British grandmother who's had a hip replacement operation your grandmother's taking a shit ton of heroin right and if what we think is right that addiction is caused primarily by exposure to the chemical hooks the lives of these people should believe in hospital and trying to score on the streets right this has been studied very carefully it virtually never happens right and when I learned that it just seems so weird to me I thought it couldn't possibly be true right how could it be you've got someone in a hospital bed who's taking loads of really potent heroin they don't become addicted and in the alleyway outside you've got someone who's using actually a weaker form of the drug who becomes addicted how can that be what's happening here and I only began to understand it when I when I went to Vancouver and met this amazing man could professor Bruce Alexander who did an experiment that's really transformed how we think about addiction all over the world it's led to a new way of thinking and loads of new evidence so professor Alexander explained to me this story that we've been told right the addiction is caused by the chemical hooks primarily comes from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century they're really simple experiments your viewers can try them at home if they're feeling a little bit shitty today right you take a rat you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles one is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine you might remember in the 1980s there's a famous partnership for drug-free America add this that shows this experiment right and the rat in this cage starts to drink there it always prefers the heroin water and almost always kills itself within a week or two right so there you go that's that's our story the you you're exposed to the drug it takes you over and then you just die right but in the 70s professor Alexander comes along and says he was working with people with addiction problems and he's like hang on a minute we put these rats alone in an empty cage they've got nothing that makes life meaningful for rats right what would happen if we did this differently so he built a cage that he called rat Park which is basically like heaven for rats right they got loads of friends they got as a cheese they got as a colored balls they could have loads of sex anything a rat finds meaningful in life is there in rat Park and they've got both the water bottles the normal water and the drug water and of course they try but if they don't know what's in them anything in rat Park they don't like the water very much none of them ever use it compulsively the heroin wash yep the heroin water none of them ever use it compulsively none of them ever overdose so you go from almost 100% compulsive use and death by overdose when their lives are shitty to none when they have the things that make life meaningful no there's loads of human examples I'm sure we'll will talk about but the the main thing I took from this is that the opposite of addiction is not sobriety the opposite of addiction is connection we have to ask ourselves what are the contexts in which people become a dated because there are some contexts where people find these drugs extremely addictive and there are some contexts where they don't become addicted at all there's something the drug plays a role chemicals are real I can talk about how we know that they play some role but they're actually a surprisingly small role of what's going small amount at what's going on we know this from there's so many examples but I give you give another one in at the same time as rat Park there was an experiment going on that everyone listen to this we've heard of the Vietnam War right in Vietnam shit loads of American troops were using heroin right it was very easy to get it out there that actually insanely they had cracked down on cannabis and so people have moved to heroin because sniffer dogs can't detect and heroin as easily as cannabis so calories was everywhere sorry heroin was everywhere loads of American troops were using it and if you look at what people said at the time the authorities the Nixon White House they were shitting themselves because they're like they believe this chemical Hookes theory of addiction so they're like fuck when this war ends we can have you know half a million heroin addicts on the streets of the United States there's a really good study that followed these these men home and it found that the vast majority of them just stopped right they didn't go into rehab most of them didn't go into horrific withdrawal some of them had an uncomfortable flu-like symptoms but and most of them just stopped now if you believe this old theory that chemical hooks take you over that makes no sense but if you understand what Professor Alexander is saying and that all the new evidence about addiction that I go through and chasing The Scream it makes it makes perfect sense right you me everyone in this area if I took any of us and put us in a horrific pestilential jungle where we don't want to be and I made you kill older people and potentially die at any moment you would find heroin much more appealing and than you do now right if we want to understand why people turn to painkillers we've got to understand why they're in pain right and and and the core of addiction it's made me I learned from these amazing experts all of the world the core of addiction it's about not wanting to be present in your life because your life is too painful a place to be and once you understand that you can see why what we've been doing is such a disaster right because the theory we have with the war on drugs think about Arizona we can talk about that more but I you know like I say I went to this nightmare prison Australia prison in in Phoenix Arizona where people are humiliated and the theory behind that part of the theory behind the war on drugs is if you've got people who are addicted you've got to inflict pain on them to you know give them an incentive to stop right but once you understand that pain is in fact the fuel of addiction it's in fact the primary cause of addiction you can see why sometimes people say that doesn't work truth is much worse right that makes addiction worse those women I went out with and spent all that time with who were you know humiliate I remember in that prison we come back from being on the chain gang where they have to sometimes they have to dig graves they weren't doing that the day I was there they had to collect garbage the day I was one of the days I was there but we come back and normally with prisons as a journalist they don't want to show you anything right you're like you have to kind of really finagle to get them to show you anything in this prison and it's like a pantomime of Cruelty they want to show it to you the whole point is to humiliate these people right so the women I've been talking to and the men were really terrified of what they called the hole right is the solitary block and so I said to the guards will you show me the hole I was sure they said no they're like yeah okay I'll show ya so go around to the the hole and these women who put it for the most like trivial infractions like having a cigarette it's literally a hole right it's like a concrete block you're on your own there's nothing in it there's a tiny window where you can see sunlight no TV nothing and I remember speaking to a woman who was in this and suddenly thinking this is the closest you could get to an exact human recreation of the cages that guaranteed addiction in rats right and this is what we're doing thinking it will stop these women being addicted it's the system we've built a doctor gave Walmart a an amazing guy said to me you know if negative consequences stopped addiction there won't be a single addict in the world Ryan what have people with addiction problems not suffered what humiliation have they not endured so we've got this I think we got to really shift our perspective on what addiction is and there are places that have done this that have led to incredible results the I love that rat experiment one because that had always been parodied as this is the proof positive that these drugs are so terrible for you but once they figured out that if you take those rats and put them in a wonderful place and they don't have addiction it really does make you step back and go okay what is exactly going on here obviously there's chemical hooks they are real like people that are on sustained prolonged use of opiates especially people with back injuries have an incredibly difficult time kicking them even really positive people who don't necessarily have awful lives but it's it's one of those things that gets in your head and then you sort of parrot it you've you've heard it you repeat it but it's the reason why I asked you the question it's like what what is what is the cause for most people you believe it's an unfulfilled life or a painful life or a painful self-image or remorse for your past or like what is it that do we have like primary reasons or primary attributes that we attach to to these people that are drug addicted yes so this was what my more recent book which is called lost connections uncovering the real causes of depression and the unexpected solutions is is about I think the core of addiction is is about trying to deal with pain right but the causes of human pain are obviously huge but what I learned is there's scientific evidence for nine causes have kind of deep despair right now if you think about depression and the very similar factors play out with addiction they're actually densely interconnected phenomena but there are real biological factors right your genes can make you more vulnerable to that just like some people find it easier to put on weight than others and there are real brain changes that happen when you become depressed or addicted that can make it harder to get out right but most of the factors that are causing this despair are not factors in our biology they're factors in the way we live and it is it kind of this doesn't cover all of the causes that I learned about philosophy nations but it covers a lot of them everyone watching your show knows they have natural physical needs obviously right you need food you need water you need shelter you need cleaner exactly if I took those things away from you you'd be fucked really quickly right but there's equally strong evidence that all human beings have natural psychological needs right you need to feel you belong you need to feel your life has meaning and purpose you need to feel that people see you and value you you need to feel you've got a future that makes sense and this culture we've built is good at lots of things that I'm really glad to be alive today but all sorts of reasons had to go to the dentist the other day I'm glad to be alive now not light hundred years ago but there's a lot of evidence that we've been getting less and less good at meeting these deep underlying psychological needs let's think about you refer to the opioid crisis for example see because I think even a lot of really good people are profoundly misunderstanding what's happening with the the opioid crisis where is the opioid crisis happening right I've been to a lot of the epicenters a bit places like Monadnock and in New Hampshire why is why are things so disastrous there why is there much higher opioid addiction in West Virginia than on the Faculty of Harvard right people in faculty Harvard have much better access to opioids right everyone there has good health insurance they have much better access what's going on the the some amazing economists at angus dayton and and case did a massive study of this and they said that we need to understand the opioid deaths mainly is what they call deaths of despair right it's not a coincidence that the places where opioid addiction is highest are also the places where suicide not with opioids is highest where antidepressant prescriptions are highest as a whole these things are clustering together for a reason right and you don't have to spend much time in those places to see people through no fault of their own have unlike the rats in that first cage right they have been deprived of the things that like meaningful it doesn't mean chemical hooks don't play some role they do play a role but I've been to the places that have solved this and it wasn't by thinking primarily about that so just talk about the reality Chemical hooks oh that's right key things very important to understand in relation to opioids this is a very strong agreement among scientists that the most powerful chemical hook we know is nicotine right you smoke cigarettes like my mother smoked 70 cigarettes a day you smokes cigarettes the thing you feel a physical craving for when you stop which my mother would never - is is nicotine right that's the chemical hook and and so in the late 80s when nicotine patches were invented there's this huge wave of optimism among scientists could they're like oh right cigarette smoking is an addiction to the chemical hook nicotine now we can give people all the chemical hook they're addicted to without any of this shitty cancer-causing smoke people are going to stop smoking right so nicotine patches are introduced and the US Surgeon General's report a couple of years later finds highly motivated people using nicotine patches 17% of them will stop smoking right that's important to say that is not nothing right that means if you meet the chemical hook for people who are addicted to cigarettes 17% of them will stop entirely that's a big deal right that saved a huge number of people's lives but obviously 17% is not 100% that leaves 83% they've got to be explained by the other things and that's really the factors that I talked about in in lost connections so I mean there's a whole range of them but you know if you are acutely lonely we are the loneliest Society there's ever been right you are much more likely to be vulnerable to despair depression addiction if you are controlled and humiliated at work which most people now are to some degree you're much more vulnerable to these things there's a whole range of go through nine of these these factors in the book but it's me the most important thing in thinking about the opioid crisis um I find it really frustrating that this is never discussed in the American debate is I've been to the place that solves an opioid crisis that had a disastrous opioid crisis and ended it right and they did something that's very different what Americans are being urged to do so I'm a Swiss citizen because my dad's from there so I Switzerland well and by the time you get to the year 2000 Switzerland is having like an opioid nightmare right people can look up videos from the time but you know people like Swiss people are obsessed with order it's not a coincidence they invented clocks and all that shit right like in their public parks people like injecting in the neck like nightmare scenes right that'd be bad anywhere but to Swiss people this is like their worst nightmare right and they try all sorts of things they try the American Way arresting people punishing people shaming people and it just keeps getting worse and worse and then one day they get this this incredible woman called Ruth Dreyfus I got to know later who becomes the Minister of Health and then the president the first ever female president of Switzerland and she explains to people I think the solution is to legalize heroin and she said I know that sounds really shocking because when you hear the word legalization what you picture is anarchy and chaos she said what we have now is anarchy and chaos right we have unknown criminals selling unknown chemicals to unknown drug users all in the dark all filled with violence disease and chaos legalization she explained is the way we restore order to this madness right so the way it works isn't spent a lot of time in these places and obviously no or maybe there's some really hardcore libertarians but almost no one believes we should legalize heroin the way alcohol or cannabis illegal right no one thinks there should be a heroin aisle in CVS that's not the pattern right well Judy Switzerland is if you had a heroin problem you were assigned to a clinic I went a lot of time in the one in Geneva the former president Ruth Dreyfus lives opposite this clinic I think that tells you something and likes across the street across the street what what what it it's the way it works is she should move well but if you see the clinic right so the way it works is you have to go to the clinic at seven o'clock in the morning cos Swiss people believe in doing things really fucking early it's constant disagreement between me and my dad you turn up you go in they give you your heroin there they give you a medically pure heroin you can't take it out with you you've got to use it there partly because they don't want you to sell it on but mainly because they want to monitor you to make sure you don't overdose you use it there and then you leave to go to your job because you're given a load of support to get housing work and therapy to figure out why you can't bear to be present in your life right so it's really important they give two things this puts bear in mind these two things gets the opposite of what we're doing the moment here give them the safest possible version of the drug and give them massive amounts of help to deal with the reasons why they need that drug now I'll be giving the drug of the injecting yeah they know they the individual injects himself or herself so if you if you were the patient I'm the nurse I give you the heroin and I give you a clean syringe and one of the things that really surprised me at first I found really weird is they will give you any dose of heroin that you want apart from one that would kill you and there is never any pressure to cut back and yeah I went there when it was 13 years after this had first started and there was almost nobody on the program from the start there were like three people who've been there the whole time almost everyone does cut back and stop overtime and I remember saying to Rita mangey who's the chief psychiatrist there well well how can that be because we're told the chemical hooks taking over you need more and more if you had a limited supply you would just carry on forever what how could how could how do you explain this and she looked to me like I was done and she said well we help them and their lives get better and as your life gets better you don't want to be anesthetized so much which once that's explained to you is so obvious right but and it's worth just explaining the results of the Swiss program in the feel it's 15 years now and the 15 years since this began according to the best scientific evidence but professor Ambrose Orton Hagen have shown that had been zero deaths overdose deaths on legal heroin not one person there's been a massive fall in overdose deaths outside the legal program because people transfer in because why would you carry on using expensive shitty street drugs when you could be getting you know help and given the drug for free and and once it was fascinating about this is Swiss people are really conservative right my Swiss relatives make Donald Trump look like Oprah and yet Swiss people after this had been in practice for five years had a referendum on whether to get rid of it and 70% of Swiss people voted to keep heroin legal not because they're so compassionate to be honest that's not but they're not they're really it was cuz crime fell so much right it's much cheaper to get a selfie crown fall I've got the statistics in the book as fear since I wrote it but there was I think something like a 50% fall in street street crime street prostitution literally ended right there was no street prostitution after that turns out women you know don't want to be on the street being fucked by random strangers but somebody if they've got like an alternative who knew but the it was an enormous fallen crime across the board and police confirmed that everyone agrees with that in switzerland and all the kind of anarchy in the streets just just stopped right but what the reason i think this is really relevant to the opioid crisis is what we're doing is the exact opposite right so they give them the safe version of the drug give them help to figure out why practical support to change their environment to get out of that isolate occasion and walk into a life that's more like rat park what do we do if your doctor in this country finds out that you are using say percocet or oxy not because you've got back pain but because you've got an addiction your doctor by law has to cut you off right they don't they can be busted as a dealer it's happened to lots of doctors and they have to cut you off so you instead of giving you the drug we stop you getting the drug most people then not most a very large number then transfer to much more dangerous street drugs like heroin secondly far from giving you help to turn your life around we give you a criminal record we shame you we stigmatize you we put barriers between you and reconnecting the opposite of addiction is connection but what do we do we put barriers between people and reconnecting this is why that's one part of it right so there's the drug policy part of it where we're doing exactly the opposite of the country that succeeded in ending its opioid epidemic but there's something i think there's even deeper than that which you really see in places like West Virginia Monadnock the kind of hearts of the opioid crisis which is we're also creating a society that it's becoming harder and harder for people to be present in especially in those in those places that there's an analogy I keep thinking of in the in the 18th century in Britain loads of people were driven out of the countryside into these disgusting urban slums in like London and Manchester and and something happened that the it's been well-documented there was so-called the gin craze right we're basically shit loads of people just became alcoholics drank gin until they died right there's a famous painting from the time called gin lane of a mother down in like a bottle of vodka while a baby like falls out the window right and things like that really were happening you look at what people said at the time very similar to what they're saying now they said look at this evil drug gin look what it's fucking done to us if only we could get rid of this evil drug gin this problem would go away right we know now when we look back at the gin craze it can have been gin that caused it because anyone in Britain who's over the age of 18 can go and buy gin right and while we still have some alcoholics to be sure we don't have mass epidemics of alcoholism we don't have babies falling out of windows what changed wasn't the amount of availability it wasn't the availability of the drug the drug is more available now than it was then what change was the amount of pain and distress in the society right we don't have a society we've brought as profoundly disorientated I mean it's going up because we're creating more disorientation so we if you create a society where people's basic psychological needs are not met right where they have a shrinking number of friends and social connections where they're taught that life is about money and buying shit and displaying it on Instagram excuse me where they spend most of their time at jobs they find unfulfilled controlling and humiliating you're going to create growing pools of people who caught any by the way that if you're constantly insecure financially insecure half of all Americans have through no fault of their own have been able to set aside $500 for if an emergency comes along she creates pervasive insecurity in the society you're gonna create very large numbers of people who are gonna want and feel a need to anesthetize themselves now that's not a good solution obviously I don't think heroin opioids these are not good solutions to these problems but but it's not a crazy solution either there's a line I think of all the time I don't quite it very Linkous people can really react against this insight but I think it's actually important you know Marianne Faithfull the great like 60s British singer she went out with Mick Jagger annoyingly that's why people remember she's much better than me Jagger and in her memoir she shot a heroine addiction in the 60 she was homeless for she has this very challenging line that I think about a lot I'm gonna phrase it slightly wrong but she said and heroin saved my life because if it wasn't for heroin I would have killed myself at that point right now Marianne Faithfull is not saying heroin was a good solution to her homelessness but we've got to understand this drug use is happening because it performs a function right one of the most important things I learned for both my books but chasing scream and lost connection is that these forms of despair depression anxiety addiction they are meaningful signals right they are telling us something the fact that they have been rising year after year after year that we're now at the point where average white male life expectancy has fallen in this country for the first time in the entire peacetime history of the United States that is a signal that is telling us something and that's because of drug addiction and and overwhelming because of drug addiction and suicide it's risen to that point there other factors going on like obesity but that the main drivers are overdosing suicide and now he's telling us something what we've been doing up to now is we've been insulting that signal we've either been saying depress people addicted people are just weak all we've been saying oh it's just a problem in their brain that there are real things going on in their brains of course all we've been saying you know it's just craziness and but in fact it is largely a response to the way we're living of course there are other things going on as well and we can talk about them and once you understand that you realize there's got to be a deeper response and I went to places that I've done that not just whistling Switzerland what is the lower the overall population five and a half million so it's a small compared a small country yeah how much money do they have to spend to keep this program going and what is the time constraint in terms of like how long is a person who's got an addiction problem allowed to stay there and and receive treatment there's no time constraint you can stay on your entire life if you want to in practice that doesn't happen bro they stay in the facility no no they live in apartments okay they just they just go every day or whenever they want to I mean I think you can go twice a day and it's free it's free it doesn't cost anything I mean some people once they have jobs then pay health insurance and the health insurance pays forever but if you don't have money then they pay for it and and one things that was fascinating is they found it wasn't and Joanne set did good research on all sites good research on this for she did research the open society foundation it's actually cheaper then the police constantly harassing people putting them in prison putting them on trial those are really expensive things to do heroin is unbelievably cheap if you buy it legally right I would think did the amount of money they would save just in street crime being radically reduced exactly it makes it makes the life of the person with addiction better it makes the life of ordinary of other citizens who were not addicted better and it saves money right which is why Swiss people were very pragmatic they're not you know the most compassionate people but they are very pragmatic people that's why it was so popular so let's think about another place that adopted really different drug policies right because I think it's some we can learn from there as well so Portugal around the time Switzerland's having its horrific heroin crisis Portugal is having a fucking nightmare right by the year 2000 one percent of the population was addicted to heroin which is incredible right and every year they would like switch then they were trying the American Way shame punishment stigma and things just kept getting worse and worse and worse and then one day the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition got together and they're like oh we can't go on like this what are we gonna what are we gonna do and they decided to do something really radical something no one had done since the drug war began in this country seventy years before they said should we like ask some scientists what the best thing to do would be so they set up a panel of scientists and doctors led by an amazing man I got to know in Portugal doctor hua ji Lao a totally strongly person and and he'd run the first of a drug treatment center in in Portugal bounded after the dictatorship and they said to them you guys just go away look at all the evidence and figure out what the hell we can do so they go away for two years they learn about rat Park they learn loads of things and they come back and they say okay a solution is we want to decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack but and this is the crucial next step take all the money we currently spend on fucking people up arresting them shaming them imprisoning them and spend all that money instead on turning their lives around and interestingly it's not really what we think of as drug treatment here in the United States right so they do some residential rehab that has some value main thing they did was a big program of job creation for people with addiction problems saying you used to be a mechanic they'd go to a garage and they said if you employed this guy for a year we'll pay half his wages again much cheaper than sending him to prison right they set up a big program of small loans so people with addiction problems could set up and run businesses the things they thought were important at the time people like this is crazy they're just going to spend it all on drugs lunacy and by the time I went to Portugal it was again 13 years since it began and the results were in addiction was down by 50% oh and there's by the figures of in the British Journal of Criminology the best scientific study of this and overdose deaths were massively down HIV was massively down every single indicator on problems related to drug use had fallen like a cliff right it wasn't perfect they still got problems of course but there was a massive improvement and one of the reasons you know it works so well is that virtually no one in Portugal wants to go back I went and interviewed a great guy called Quayle figueira who at the time of the decriminalization was the top drug cop in the whole country and he said what I'm sure those your listeners are thinking right at the time which was like if we decriminalized all drugs we can have an explosion in drug use we can have loads of kids using there's like a nightmare we can't do this and when I went to see him the audios on the tasting scream website he said saying like everything I said would happen didn't happen and everything the other side said would happen did and he talked about how he felt really ashamed that he'd spent so many years prior to the decriminalization screwing people's lives up when he could have been helping them turn their lives around and and this is something that I saw all over the world right the places that have drug policies based on shame and stigma and the fantasy that you can get rid of drug use which you can never do they have massive really terrible and rising problems the places that have policies based on okay let's restore order to the market and let's give lot liberty to drug users and love and compassion and practical help for people with addiction problems have declining drug problems right again not perfect but it such a significant improvement there's support in Portugal I mean they've got five main political parties none of them want to go back right that tells you something right yeah now when they did this in Switzerland what was the primary cause for this drug addiction and how did they deal with that so if they dealt with it in Portugal with these loans and and and and helping out businesses by paying for half of salary and all those things like that seemed like wonderful ideas what do they do in Switzerland to sort of mitigate what are the issues whatever the issues were they were causing people to be drug addicts in the first place so as a combination they gave people lots of therapy so I remember one of the people I spent some time with in that clinic had been terribly sexually abused there's a lot of evidence that giving survivors of sexual abuse safe places in which they can release their shame about that leads to a big fall in depression addiction and other problems it's a lot of evidence that that kind of abuse is is it's a big driver of a lot of addiction for a lot of people though clearly not everyone some of it was just there were people who had never been given a chance in life or I had never had stable lives it was kind of a mixture of things and and one of the things that's really good about the Swiss system is it wasn't saying in this kind of cookie cutter way that up and half often happens in drug treatment in the United States or there's plenty of good examples as well you know you don't arrive and they say this is your problem we're here to tell you your problem and how to solve your problem it's very much guided by actually the person themselves right people who are in deep pain the the core of its you have to listen to them right if we think about this addiction depression in the way that I'm arguing that we should see them as signals that are telling us something most important thing is to listen to the signal right I remember that saying I thought about a lot at this weird experience that I kept thinking about all the time I was writing my book lost connections about to press him and it sounded quite light in the late in the day that I realized why I kept thinking about it so much I was in Vietnam about five years ago now maybe a little bit less and and I did this really stupid thing I was I was in Hanoi and I was really tired I was doing research for a different book that haven't finished yet and by the side of the road I saw this big red apple woman selling it and I'm shit haggling so I paid like $5.00 for this Apple or something about and I take it back to my hotel I'm so tired I lay on the bed and I start eating and it was just gross right it was some really it's chemical taste it was like how I imagined food would taste after a nuclear war when I used to watch those films in the 80s right I was so tired even though I knew it was wrong I ate like half of it and threw it in the garbage and next like four days I was just like violently sick right like just in it like something from The Exorcist right so I'm lying there in front of CNN and occasionally projectile vomiting and it gets flight forward I'd had food poisoning before I basically lived on fried chicken in my 20s so it was not new to this rodeo and after about four days I said to Hawaiian my fixer and translator who was arranging I was there to interview survivors at the war the Vietnam War for something I'm like look I'm only here for another three days or whatever it was I've got to go meet these people always whole trip would've been a waste of time so he drives me like six or seven hours into the countryside and we get there and he's lined up these people for me to interview oh my god I think I feel so bad actually I sitting in this heart with this this woman there's an 86-year woman who was the only person from her village that survived the Vietnam War so I'm talking to her and as she's speaking that the room starts - I've never had this feeling before and I've had a thing when you're a drunk when you feel the rooms move it it literally felt like the room was moving around me like like I didn't feel like I was disorientated and then while she's talking I just like explode all over her heart from both Ed's like fucking Horror Show right and so I say to her just just take me back to put me in the car take me back to Hanoi right and he's this old woman's like saying send to him and I'm just like lying there and he says she says you've got to go to the hospital we were really sick and I'm like no no I just need to go back to the hotel and he said yeah and this is the only woman who survived the Vietnam War in this village I'm gonna listen to her health advice over yours we're going to the hospital so we go to this hospital where I'm pretty sure I was the only European I've been treated they take me in and krang's like completely lying going like this is an important West that I it will disgrace Vietnam if he dies here right and so I'm lying there and they like jabbing me with everything and I'm like what's going on and they're asking me lots of questions and I thought the most nausea so I've ever felt right and I kept saying to them give me something for the nausea through Hawaiian commit it speaking English and the doctor said to me you need your nausea it will tell us what's wrong with you right now even line though I think it was kind of interesting so everything line there and thinking they figured out was the Apple and I'm having such a ridiculous thought where I thought I'm about to die I've been killed by an apple I'm like Eve or like Snow White or like Alan Turing and then I was like you're about to die in your last thoughts that you're basically a pretentious country horrified by myself anyway they gave me all his treatment and a few days later when I leave I'm talking to the doctor and I just discuss embrace things with him and I said to him what would have happened if I'd um if I had gone back to hello if he'd written me about ten or and he said oh well what happened is my kidneys has stopped working hadn't kept any water in for four days she was like I had been in the desert for four days and the doctor said oh you would've died on the journey when I made it and so I can't think about this experience which weirdly didn't actually affect my like worldview were anything's the closest I've ever had to a near-death experience but all through researching my book about depression loss connections I kept thinking about this thing right you need your nausea it will tell us what's wrong with you and I realized all the time I had been depressed if I think about my relatives and people I loved who had addiction problems I had seen that my depression their addiction as a bit like that nausea right as like a kind of malfunction right saying that you should get rid of and actually what we need to do is hear it right because it will tell us what's wrong with us right doesn't mean it's a good feeling it's awful right depressions worst thing I've ever felt addiction is a terrible state to be in it's not saying just in some kind of you know where are we just to put up with it it's that if we hear the signal we can begin to find solutions and all the places I went the places that I've solved depression crises that I went to for lost connections places that solved addiction crises that I went to for chasing the screen our places that have said actually this means something right your pain makes sense you feel these ways for reasons and we need to get down into these these deeper reasons which is really not what we've done in the United States since the drug war began you know a century ago so did they figure out in Switzerland what was causing this rash of addiction and just by treating it seems like if there is some underlying condition that's causing this depression that's leading people to drug addiction they're just giving them free heroin it's not gonna fix the root cause so how did they find out what the root cause was and why was such an epidemic you're totally right that so the Herot the heroin is does two things so partly as you become addicted you spiral into the people who don't have huge private resources some people do right as you become addicted what happens to a lot of people is you spiral into chaotic Street use right so for a lot of women that means sex work for a lot of men that means property crime some men sex work as well but mostly not and so what happens is actually you become you know you develop an addiction because you're dealing with this pain but then you actually move into a much more chaotic we're living right which which causes deeper pain and deeper pain obviously if you're being fucked by strangers every day and treating you badly you're gonna want to be even more and ISTA tizen after that right or if you're frightened that the police all the time so what happens is that partly what happened in Switzerland was giving people the legal heroin ended the chaos of street use which in itself was making addiction worse that's clearly not the cause because you don't start out as a street user so it was partly that I think it was partly attending to people's deeper distress and it's not like there's one cookie cutter thing that was that was the answer it was listening to different people at different stages and and and looking at they'd had some problems with unemployment you don't want to overstate that they'd have some problems with child abuse you don't want to overstate that it was more like a kind of menu of things a most sophisticated menu of things that but but but the thing that they definitely showed in the Swiss model and in Portugal and in lots of other places I went to is compassionate treatment reduces addiction right and treatment understood in the broadest sense because it reduces the pain the individual is in anything that reduces the shame stigma and humiliation will over time reduce addiction for most people not everyone some people are in such internal agony they will always need anesthetics and this I think is a really important point and one that can be quite challenging to some people including people like me who have people they love with addiction problems so where I open chasing the Screamers with this story I think a lot of people think why the fuck is a book about the war on drugs starting like this and I think it tells you so much so in 1939 in a hotel in midtown Manhattan Billie Holiday the great jazz singer walked on stage as she sang for the first time a song that I'm sure all your listeners and viewers have heard it's a song called strange fruit right it's a song against lynching it's the idea that in the south the bodies of African American men hang from the trees and they're like a kind of strange fruit in the south right this is unbelievably challenging at that time there are very few popular songs like that and and to have an african-american woman doing it was quite shocking where she wasn't even allowed to walk through the front door of that hotel they made her go through the service elevator she was African American and that night Billie Holiday gets a warning from a man called Harry Anslinger from the agents of a man called Harry Anslinger that basically says stop singing this song right wait what's this got to do with the war on drugs so Harry Anslinger is a man it was government bureaucrat I think the most influential person no one's ever heard of he's affected the lives of loads of people listening to your show it's Harry Anslinger as a government bureaucrat who takes over the department of prohibition just as alcohol prohibition is ending so you've had this big war on alcohol it's been a shit show it's been a disaster and he takes it over and he wants to keep his government department going and he invents the modern war on drugs is the first person to ever use the phrase war on drugs and and he really builds this war on drugs around to intense hatred she has and Billie Holiday's the personification of both one was a really intense hatred of african-americans I mean he was regarded as a crazy racist in the 1920s which gives you a sense of how racist he was he used the n-word so often in official memos his own senator said he should have to resign that's how hardcore he was right and he also had an intense hatred of people with addiction problems and Billie Holiday she'd grown up on the streets of Baltimore a part of Baltimore called pig town when she was 10 she was horrific she was raped the man who raped her was sent to prison for a year and a half she was sent Reformatory for longer than he got right she she was tormented by the nuns there they they said she was disobedient she brought it on herself they still lock her in with dead bodies overnight to teach her a lesson she eventually ran away she tried to find her mother her mother had gone to what's now called Roosevelt Island now it wasn't called that then where she was working as a prostitute and Billie Holiday starts kind of working in inverted commas next to her mother in this brothel from when she's like 14 so she's being raped by men for money night after night after night she's you know and when they the police rescue rescue break into the brothel they arrest her right and said it to prison so Billie Holiday is trying to numb the grief and pain that comes from that right so she starts out using loads of alcohol and then she's using loads of other stuff as well mostly heroin and when she gets this warning from Harry Anslinger saying stop singing this song Billie Holiday's attitude is fuck you I'm an American citizen I'll sing what I fuckin please right and at that point Harry Anslinger resolves to destroy her the first man he sent to to track her is a man called follow her round his guy called Jimmy Fletcher Harry Anslinger hated employing white people sorry hated employing African Americans but you couldn't really send a white person into Harlem to follow Billie Holiday for it'd be kind of obvious so employed this african-american guy called Jimmy Fletcher whose job type was a bagman he was given the job followed Billie Holiday everywhere she goes befriend her document her drug use right he dances with her in nightclubs he gets to know her really well and Billie Holiday was so amazing that Jimmy Fletcher fell in love with her and his whole life he felt really ashamed of what he did he busts her they when they come in to search her she makes him she pisses in front of him and says you can look in my pussy you can see I don't have anything here and she's put on trial the trial was called the United States versus Billie Holiday and she said that's how it fucking felt she sent to prison for 18 months she doesn't say a word in prison but what happened to her next I think is the cruelest thing she gets out of prison and and at that time to sing anywhere where they served alcohol you needed what was called a cabaret performers license Anslinger makes sure she doesn't get it so one of her friends Yolanda Pavan is also a great jazz singer said to me what's the cruelest thing you can do to a person is to take away the thing they love right they take away singing from Billie Holiday so we do to people with addiction problems all over the United States right we give them criminal records that make it much harder to do the things that are meaningful to them by work for example um so in that situation obviously Billie Holiday relapses right she starts using a shit ton of heroin again one day in the early 50s she collapses not far from where she'd first sung strange fruit the first hospital won't even take her because they she's got an addiction problem this and we're not having her second hospital takes her but she says to her friend Mae Lee Duff T on the way in the Anslinger's men weren't done with her they were gonna come fair she said they're gonna kill me in there don't let them they're gonna kill me she wasn't wrong so in the hospital she's diagnosed with advanced liver cancer probably related to her severe alcoholism and in the hospital she she goes into heroin withdrawal so Mei Lee her friend manages to insist that she's given methadone and she starts to recover a bit because her McGraw is quite dangerous when you're weak rather when you're old weave and sling as men come they arrest her on her hospital bed they handcuff her to the hospital but I tend to be the last person he was still alive you've been in that rumor a man called Reverend Eugene calendar been a religious minister they handcuffed her to a hospital bed they don't know have friends in to see her they don't even have candies outside Reverend calendar led protests with signs saying let Lady Day live there were big protests they knew they were killing her right then after ten days they cut off the methadone er she'd died the next day her friend one of her friends told the BBC that she looked like she had been violently wrenched from life right there's loads of things about this story which be made into a movie and Lee Daniels is directing it but there's so many things about this story that tell us what this war on drugs is about right firstly it's about in its effect it's about shaming addicts and this effect as it makes addicts worse right he said with Billie Holiday see that everywhere secondly it's been insanely racist from the start right at the same time the Harry Anslinger found out Billie Holiday had a heroin addict he found out Judy Garland Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz had a heroin addiction to make changes he watched The Wizard of Oz when you know that um and he went to the studio and he advised he said to Judy Garland into the studio she should take longer vacations right spot the difference with a white woman Judy Garland longer vacations with Billie Holiday fucking destroy her right in fact one of the agents he sent to destroy her a man called George white who's going after in the last days of her life we now know I mean he's a literally a psychopath he was a hugely obese guy was a strange guy he infiltrated a Chinese drug gang when he wasn't training in a person to ever do that but he he boasted in his diary about murdering people about spiking women and raping them I mean these were really deranged people that were that founded the the the drug war but the reason I set in relation to what we were just talking about is because in this culture we tell only one heroic story about people with addiction problems and that's that they sometimes recover from their addiction that is indeed a heroic story everyone watching this who's been who's managed to do that is a hero and I massively loved and congratulated them but that is not the only heroic story we should tell about people with addiction problems Billie Holiday never stopped using drugs she was still a fucking hero she Amy she never let these people stop her singing that song she would go to the places where you didn't have a license she'll go to the worst parts of the deep south she sang strange fruit they people threw bottles at her they stubbed out cigarettes on her she never stopped singing that song right and I think about Billie Holiday a lot and I think about you know all over the world every day people listen to Billie Holiday and they feel stronger and all over the world every day we are still following the policies of Harry Anslinger and it makes us a weaker and this conflict that begins right at the start of the drug and I think if I'm honest I think this isn't an easy thing to say but I think one of the reasons why the debate about the drug war is so charged is because it runs through the hearts of all of us right anyone who's got someone they love who's got an addiction problem as I do there's a Harry Anslinger in your head right there's a bit of you that looks at them and thinks so much you're just fucking why are you doing this someone should stop you doing this and then for most people there's another part that's like okay that anger isn't useful in most cases actually what you're doing this for a reason we need to understand those reasons we need to help you to change your life right but that conflict is very deep in us and Harry Anslinger the war he invented and we can talk about what he did with cannabis and loads of other things but because he invented the ban on cannabis that wars is still playing it does that makes sense I know that was a long answer but sorry no it does make sense and it's a horrific story about Billie Holiday and I had no idea that Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz was also addicted munchkins a lot of them as well um now Harry why was Harry Anslinger's hate towards her so extreme so when he was a kid the book is called chasing the screen because when he was a kid he grew up in a place called Altoona in Pennsylvania and he he lived in a farmhouse his dad was actually a refugee from Sabang refugee in a bit comes immigrant from Switzerland and they grew up in this farmhouse and in the next farmhouse down there was a a farmer's wife who had in a heron addiction or a method of sorry morphine addiction would've been her in them and haryana staying had this really haunting memory of going to that house and hearing this woman scream and scream and him being sent to take the horse and cart that he was 11 or something being sent to take the horse and cart into town to go to the pharmacy to get her the morphine and then bringing it back and her scream stopping but lesson he took from that is these drugs that evil and we need to destroy them especially later on he was in Europe during the First World War and he had this very Keynes he was a diplomat I mean this very keen sense the civilization was incredibly fragile it could collapse at any moment that you only need a little bit of contamination and it will all go to shit and and so he yeah I call it chasing the screen because I think in a way what Harry nice things doing is like chasing this scream all over the world and I felt like what I was doing going to all these different places when the killing fields in Mexico to Portugal and Switzerland was like following this scream as it kind of Rick shade around and actually how he made he thinks he's stopping these screams he's actually creating far more screams in their in their in their place yeah but I'd still understand why he had this silly holiday yes so well she's an african-american woman standing up to white supremacy who has an addiction problem but the truth is what he did to Billie Holiday is not pretty it's not this is weighted to African Americans and to people with addiction problems Billie Holiday's happens to be famous so I'm telling her story but this is what he did to huge numbers of people right he wanted to destroy the whole jazz scene that what an amazing thing is spending time in his archives in Penn State was seeing all these memos from his agent so he said to them go to your local jazz club document the evil things that happening there and the things they wrote back I cut it hilarious right there's one agent who I forget where it was but he he wrote back ends like him there was a popular jazz song at the time called that ocean man and had a lyric that said when he gets the notion he thinks he can walk across the ocean and he's like there is gonna be an epidemic of drowning across the United States as people use cannabis because they're going to believe they can walk on water so he would he was a literally the hilarious we were things he said you know he believed that when you smoked cannabis time slows down so a minute seems to last a thousand years like these extraordinarily heightened crazy things that he would he would say and he actually latched so at that time when he first takes over what becomes the Federal Bureau of Narcotics you know cocaine and heroin just aren't very popular right there's just not much of a war to fight I mean they exist but they're not that popular quite that confined to small urban scenes cannabis was more popular not as popular as it is now but and and he had previously said cannabis isn't harmful not bothered about it suddenly when he Cotton's on that this is the way to big build up his department he announces that cannabis is the phrase use was the most evil drug in the world he said when Frankenstein's monster bumps into a spliff on the staircase Frankenstein's monster dies of fright like these extraordinarily heightened claims and and any any issue starts trying to get support for a ban on cannabis and he latches on to one case in particular as important cuz I think we're hearing these to get these things now so a kid in Tampa Florida called Victor like Arthur he was not so much a kid 21 killed his entire family with an axe but should them all and with the help of the Fox News of its time Hurston Hearst Newspapers Anslinger announces this is what will happen if you use cannabis literally you will kill your family with an axe right and this becomes a very famous story across the United States and cannabis is banned in its wake years later someone goes and checks the psychiatric files but Victor laconic wasn't even evidence it'll use cannabis right he had terrible problems with psychosis his family had been advised more than a year before that he should be institutionalized and they refused they kept him at home and this tragedy ensued we're hearing these these scare stories again about about cannabis there's something that Ann sling has said but I think could be like the motto for the entire drug war in the wake of the so Anslinger introduces this ban in the US he promises drugs will disappear right you will notice drugs did not disappear he starts to say well that's just because evil foreign countries like Mexico are flooding our country with drugs you'll notice that's come back as well so what we need to do is force all these other countries to ban them as well and then they'll disappear so the US in the wake of the second world war really has the power to do that world is in ruins and there's one player when he goes to the new United Nations and he's insisting this happens and they're basically threatening people they're saying it will cut off your foreign aid or you won't be allowed to sell goods to the US market if you don't do this the Ambassador from Thailand is like oh you know it doesn't seem to work very well in your country we've actually got a long pattern of established drug use in in Thailand we don't really have many problems we don't want to do this and hands thing I said to her I said to him I've made up my mind don't try to confuse me with the facts and I always feel like that's the drug war right and I made up my mind don't try to confuse me with the facts well he in conjunction with William Randolph Hearst he worked with him to try to propagate these ridiculous propaganda stories about Mexicans and blacks smoking this evil drug called marijuana which is really not even a real term for cannabis at the time it was a sadist wild yeah it was a wild Mexican tobacco right yeah but then didn't Nixon do a similar thing with the sweeping psychedelic tact of 1970 he did it so that they could infiltrate the civil rights movement because there were so many people in the civil rights movement that were using various psychedelic drugs they could use it as an excuse to crack down on them and lock them up and put them in jail and pit them against each other and you know have them inform on each other yeah this is really important you cannot enforce the drug laws against everyone who's broken them is impossible half of all Americans by conservative estimate have broken the drug laws right so what do you do everywhere in the world the drug laws are used to persecute groups the state wants to persecute there are other reasons right yeah so when one of the people I write back in in chasing scream is it a woman who really had a kind of epiphany about this right so Lee Maddox was a cop in Baltimore she used to do the i-95 she would and she would very proudly bust people who even had a single joint right she was a real Harry Anslinger dream girl she had signed up to become a cop which it amazing very interesting personally she'd signed up to come a cop for quite personal reason as a kid she'd had a best friend kiddin teenager called Alisa who was like they looked really similar they shared a fake ID they were like sisters and one day when they were in their late teens they went to Ocean City for a day out and Alisa decided to hitchhike back to New Jersey where she lived and so Lee said bye to her and the next day she gets a call saying Lisa had not arrived so she waits and waits just this terrible summer waiting to find out what happened and then they discovered that Lisa had been gang raped and murdered her body was found underneath her house what had been eaten by animals and Lee becomes became convinced at that time that that Lisa for spurious reasons that Lisa had been killed as part of a gang initiation ceremony she likes like I'm gonna destroy these gangs gonna dedicate my life to destroying these gangs she goes and applies to become a police officer and for years she's this you know hard-line cop right takes real pleasure in busting people but Lee started to notice a few things first thing was and when you're a cop and you arrest a rapist there are fewer rapes in your town the next week right when you are cop and you bust a pedophile fewer children get sexually abused but she knows when you drop Buster dealer there's no if you were dealers there's someone on the corner the next day for sure right it didn't seem to be having any effect in fact what she discovered was she began to learn about this was that there was something even worse which was finally sort reason that she realized that she was actually creating these empowering these gangs so the best way to explain this is if you imagine obviously when you when you ban drugs they don't disappear right that transfer from the people who used to control them licensed illegal businesses to armed criminal gangs right and these armed criminal gangs operate in a different way to illegal businesses if you imagine if you and me decided we want to go and steal now a bottle of vodka right we go into local liquor store and that store catches us they'll call the cops the cops will come and take us away that liquor store doesn't need to be violent it doesn't need to be intimidating they've got the power of the law to uphold their property rights okay now imagine we wanted to steal a bag of coke right if we go to the guy near here I'm sure there is someone who sells coke and and he catches us he can't call the cops obviously cops would arrest him he has to fight us now if you're a dealer you don't want to be having a fight every day right you want to establish a reputation for being so frightening that no one will dare to fuck with you right so you establish your place in that neighborhood through aggression through violence and you maintain it through aggression and violence right legal businesses compete on cost and quality of product in illegal markets people compete on how much of a frightening fucker you're prepared to be right and as a writer called Charles bad and put it and the war on drugs creates a war for drugs right it transfers it to these criminal gangs who have to operate through violence to protect their property rights so link goes in to the drug war thinking I'm the one stopping these gangs she realizes I'm the one enabling them right they control one of the biggest industries in the world because of this police action and because of this decision to prohibit these drugs and if you want to know how much of this violence is caused by I am by the fact that we've prohibited it just ask yourself where are the violent alcohol dealers right everyone knows who Al Capone was just the head of Smirnoff go and shoot the head of Budweiser in the face right does your local bar go and send a bunch of kids to go and shoot everyone in the next bar down of course not exactly that happened under alcohol prohibition when did it end it ended on the day alcohol prohibition ended because legal markets don't compete than that so at least partly having this insight right she's realizing shit I think I'm taking down these gangs I'm actually empowering them what will really disempower them is reclaiming the market and making it legal but she also has another really painful realization so early in her career as a cop Lee had done this really brave thing she'd gone undercover with the Klan to expose them she'd done a really important work in breaking up parts of the Maryland clam she really was not a racist right she'd had versatile african-american men machine that is something that most honest cops notice which is the vast majority of people they were sent to african-american areas to enforce the drug laws right one of her colleagues Matthew Fogg once went to his superior officer and said you know it's a bit weird right we only ever seem to go to african-american neighborhoods to do all our drug busts I'm fairly sure white people sometimes use drugs shall we go to like a white neighborhood as well and the supervisor said of course you're right white people use drugs but white people know journalists and lawyers and judges that's really we that's just get a whole load of shit for us just go for the low-hanging fruit so Lee who is not a racist could see the effect of what she was doing was in fact racist right and she was very uncomfortable with that and this really came to a head believed when Lee's police partner was guy called Edie totally who she loved platonically loved and he was a great champion of women police officers he was a great guy and one day she gets a call at home ed had been sent on a drug bust he was undercover and the guy had thought it was ripping him off and shot him in the head and Lee goes to see Ed's body and she's like what did he die for right there are no fewer drug dealers every time we arrest a drug dealer the supply of drugs is not disrupted for one hour we are enforcing a racist war we are empowering these gangs why are we doing this soli quit as a police officer she retrained as a lawyer she now gets the criminal records expunged wherever she can of the kind of people that she busted when she was a cop and she's a big she was part of a brilliant group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition who were cops who argue for for ending the drug war but essentially to me because it's hard to be Harriet Lee was trying to be Harry Anslinger it's hard to be Harry Anslinger if you're an honest person with a conscience right and there are police officers all over the country who are making these these realizations now and that you know obviously it's very close to my heart what we do to people with addiction problems I don't horrific in catastrophic though that is I don't actually think that's the biggest moral issue around the war on drugs the biggest moral issue is the violence created by prohibition right if I think about places I've spent time like Columbia sidled Horrors in northern Mexico that's the biggest issue right more people have died in in Latin America Central and South America in the drug war violence than have died in Syria I don't know what we can do about Syria we can end this violence there's professor at Harvard called Jeffrey Myron been trying to beat has a graph of the murder rate in the 20th century in the United States massively shoots up the day alcohol is banned and falls like a stone the day alcohol is legalized right and massively rises again when there's an intensification of the drug war later and we can end a huge amount of this violence right we can do what Switzerland did we can do what was happening so what's stopping us so I think the main thing this is because this is a logical conclusion based on facts and based on cases like Portugal and Switzerland there's obviously data so people are aware of this so people must be confronted with this data to this day people know that the prohibition on alcohol was a massive disaster and no one would ever accept it again we're slowly starting to realize that marijuana at least for some people is is safe and reasonable and should be used recreationally and has some massive benefits medically so we're starting to see legalization both for recreational use and clearly for medical uses spread I think we did we decide what was it I think it's like there's a certain amount of states where it's just fully legal recreationally and more where it's medical but I think it's more than eighteen states total soon we're gonna be half of the American population should be a hundred percent right I mean we all is in Canada and it should be yes it is in Canada as it should be for alcohol but what what is the stop what is the wall between this and legalization of all these other drugs and counseling and implementing some sort of a Switzerland like program I think on to the really important question so there's a range of things this is all public perception a big one I think you've gone to the most important right so some people say it's the vested financial interest in the existing system that's true if you look at who funds the no campaigns whenever they want to legalize marijuana you can see the interests right prison guard unions alcohol companies because they don't want a commercial competitor and religious fundamentalist groups like Mormons not all Mormons fundamentalist but the groups that funding this are and so it's partly that but I think you're right I don't think that's the main thing that's going on it's it's significant and real but it's the main thing that's going on the main thing the main block is huge majorities of Americans more than 80 percent said the war on drugs has failed and been a disaster and yet most people are afraid of the alternatives right and that's part as having as two things going on there's ignorance about what the alternatives actually mean so really one of the reasons why Jason scream is written as I went to all these places from the killing fields in northern Mexico to Switzerland is because way too often in this debate we talk like we're a philosophy seminar people go or what would legalization mean how would it work and they go to this weird abstract conversation like fuck that here's a plane ticket to Geneva he's a plane ticket to Lisbon he's a plane ticket to Colorado right it's not rocket science right I've been to the places that have tried these things we can see the results right then they're not legalization is not a poor dick remand decriminalization I can explain the difference if you want are not abstract and what are their words the key differences between legalization and decriminalization is where you stop punishing users but they still have to go to armed criminal gangs to get their drug legalization is where you open up legal route for people to get their drugs and that's varies according to the drug right so I guess the kind of headline would be decriminalization shuts down orange is the new black and legalization shuts down Breaking Bad and narcos right and of course we need to debate throughout me to decriminalize use and legalize City Mexico decriminalize a lot of drugs like fairly recently yes they had a big Supreme Court decision I spent a lot of time in Mexico and I you know I think about I think about this time I spent in Mexico really often because it was I'm gonna cover you know been to a lot of bad places I covered the war in the Congo I've been to Iraq I've been to Gaza I've never seen anything like what happened in Juarez when when I was there the you know I think it's worth explaining so when you like I was saying when you ban drugs that it disappear right the transfer to armed criminal gangs if you live in a housing project in the United States where five percent of the economy of that housing project is in the hands of armed criminal gangs that's gonna be a shitty frightening place to be right place like ciudad horrors which is on the border with mexican side of the united states border with them is the other side with our paso and by the time i went there it was seventy percent seven zero percent of the economy was in the hands of these armed criminal gangs right so i remember going to see this guy ross salió Retta interview people about him in horace but then I went to he's in prison in the United States is in Tyler County and Rosario is an interesting guy see but should all be headed about seventy people between ages of 13 and 17 I'm going into the prison actually to see him and the guard said to me on the way in but obviously I can't leave you alone with him because he's like but should all these people I was like are great things and I never heard about five but it said Tyrone Garber's fucking god but I'm sitting with Rosario talking about his life and his his story so Rosario grew up in Laredo Texas side of the board is basically the same place there's no way of a Laredo on the on the Mexican side it was very easy to cross the border at that time secret who's growing up in the late nineties naughties remember Sally I was 13 so loads get the Zetas were kind of famous drug gang that time they still are good drug cartel how the Zetas were created it's an insane story every taxpayer should know the US government decided to train an elite anti-drug force for the for the Mexican government right like kind of Navy SEALs for the anti-drug force they take them to Fort Bragg they spent something like 250 million dollars training them up they got back to Mexico six months later they all defected on mass almost all of them I created a drug cartel the Zetas great you see your tax money so the satyrs were this kind of glamorous in inverted commas drug gang right operating on that part the border drug routes move around according to where they put policing it always gets through but it moves a route they call it the balloon effect imagine a balloon half full of a pushdown one paste the air comes up somewhere else but at that time it was going through lunar Juarez and El Paso and Laredo and Nuevo Laredo and Rosario says two stories about how Rosario gets involved with a Zeta is what Rosario says is he was basically kidnapped by them and forced to start killing people I don't think that's true if you look at the evidence it's that he sort of volunteered but he's 13 so I don't hold him morally responsible for that but either way there's one night it all begins he's taken on the Mexican side of the border to a warehouse where they are torturing people burning them alive he's given a gun by a guy called Miguel Trevino who later became the head of the Zetas and he's told to shoot someone in the head and that's the moment you're in and when you're in with the Zetas you'll never get out right there no one leaves no one leaves alive and so they begin to train him he sent to us in 2005 he sent to a summer camp that's a literally account but the teachers you had to behead people and do all sorts of things and he's then sent him and his friends are then sent to murder people his with friends Jesse and Gabriel they murder huge time school that they were called within the the Zetas call these child soldiers the Expendables because there give a shit if they live or die right there they this one person said to me they prefer children because they don't understand death so well right I was the solid got a bit older he understood death better all his friends get murdered eventually he tries to get back to the US he cooperates he now lives in solitary confinement where he will live but the rest of his life because when they let him out of solitary surely before at him he was immediately stabbed in the neck and again you think about this insane violence that we created right when I went to wise it's it's this bizarre thing so at that time it wasn't you were told it wasn't quite rightly it wasn't safe to stay in horror as overnight so I would stay overnight in El Paso and I'd walk across the bridge right through 3 or show Passport however the customs people going what the fuck are you going into Juarez but go go in there it's weird on the other side of the bridge there's this sign and it says welcome to historic downtown Juarez and it used to be a tourist site Billie Holiday got married there but um now it's just at that time it was just covered with images of missing women just everywhere because this is another really important part of what this violence doesn't think it's really important we understand this is the violence caused by the system that we uphold and we imposed on Mexico Mexicans do not want this right this is another story I think this just of all the stories I wrote about for chasing the scream along with one other one I can take back if you want this was the hardest it's a woman in Juarez when the drug war violence starts to go through called Marisela Escobedo she was a nurse but Marisa was incredibly hard-working so she also would do these calm like wood carvings basically and she would sell them in the market on Saturdays and Sundays she had three kids a youngest daughter was called Ruby she was 14 at the time and they would work on this stall in the marketplace every Saturday I think maybe even Sundays as well some Sundays and one day a guy comes up to Mary seller at her store called Sergio he was a young guy he was like 21 and he's like it had a baby he needs a job Marisol I was kind of soft-hearted she gives him a job working on her market stall and a few months later she discovers to her horror that he's having sex with her fourteen-year-old daughter Ruby and she's like fires him immediately and goes to the police and says you need to go and question him right he's 21 she's 14 this is a crime police don't do anything she doesn't understand it what why are they not investigating this her daughter starts running away to be with with Sergio Marisela keeps going to get it back she keeps going to the police saying this is a crime he can't live with the 14 year old go and arrest and they would do anything right she's completely puzzled by this then Ruby gets pregnant Marcela's like fish was 15 by then but fuck I've got to keep her in my life so she she keeps going to see Ruby by this time she's kind of accepted the police on with real rage that police aren't going to do anything and one day just after the baby was born she goes to see Ruby and Sergio's there with the baby and he says Oh Ruby's run away with another man she's gone she's not coming back and Mary sellers like what I left her baby no she hasn't done I know she hasn't done that I know my daughter he's like well she's gone so marisel awaits christmas comes no message new year comes no message she starts to go to the neighborhood and hand out leaflets with pictures of her daughter loads of women are going missing in Horrors at this time I say wait a minute just saying have you seen this girl and after a few days she gets a call from a kid called and he'll who says I'm really frightened to tell you something if you drive me out into the desert I'll tell you so she drives Anne Hale out into the desert he was 14 and he says sérgio murdered your daughter Ernie made me help him dispose of the body and he told maricella where the body was it was actually a place where they dumped pig carcasses from the abattoir so she goes and she finds the body with it with her son and she goes to the police and the police finally do something in the arrest Sergio Sergio is put on trial in the witness box he breaks down admits he did it and apologizes to Mary seller and then a few weeks later he's acquitted of all charges and disappears and Mary sellers like what the fuck is going on here so she starts to look into this and she discovers and this is the work intersects with the drug war in a really important way that the Sergio was a member of the Zetas right now if you're a member of the Zetas at that time in Juarez it's different acts and other drug gangs displace them you own the state right and you have if they can trust seventy percent of the economy you have more money than the government right so the police work for them when I went to going to be Rosario he said when I would go murder people the police would would come with me they would dispose of the body right remember she's great year we're talking about this is like six years ago I remember the the I remember isn't it because one of things when you're in a dangerous place when you're when you're in a dangerous place one of things you do is you read danger from how frightened the people around you are right because you don't know the place I was I mean I was there with who Leon Cardona who it was my fixer he's an amazing it's the Reuters course but a horse when the bravest people I've ever met but it was realizing how frightened other people were for me and who Leon right and remember after I've been there for a few days who Leon kept introducing me by that time the killings were basically all being done by the police and I was saying you know who Leon this is this is important that I meet people who've been killed by the police but I should also meet people who've been killed by the cartels more recently and he said that you just laughed and said no that's not how works yeah now if the cartels want to kill someone they just pay the police to do it right so it's just real realization alright if someone comes to you there is nowhere for you to go right so Marisela refuses to accept that she lives in a country where there is no justice she decides okay they're not gonna solve this I'm gonna solve this she appealed loads of women are missing because it turns out if a bunch of criminals control the state they will just murder loads of women and get away with it right there are some men who just want to murder women and if they give them license to do it they'll do it that's why so many women were missing Maurice Alec gathers a load of those mothers she says some of them don't know where their daughters are some of them know their daughters are dead she's like I need your help we're gonna find this guy who's done this right so Marisela turns herself with these women into a detective she starts tracking Sergio all over Mexico wherever there are sightings she walks everywhere she walks over a thousand miles right she walks through the desert it becomes a media phenomenon people follow her she's like this this symbol of the loss that's happened in Mexico and incredibly with their friend Berta Alyssia Garcia who I got to know later after two years she finds Sergio she tracks him down she goes to the police she tells them where he is they tip him off and he disappears she's devastated so she decides she's going to go to the governor's mansion in Chihuahua go to the State Capitol she goes there and she sets up ten outside the governor's mansion she's like I'm not leaving here until you people go and find this man and she calls on every mother who has a daughter who's missing or who they're afraid of for to come and join her in this fight right and it gets to Christmas Eve and she's preparing to just before Christmas on Christmas Eve I'm gonna have this big Christmas dinner here people couldn't join me she gives this great speech and a man walks up turn shoots her in the head in front of all the police everyone and I thought a lot about maricella I got to know her children who live here in the United States now they got refuge here what I think about the drug war and what it does the first person I think of after Billie Holiday's maricella Escobedo right we have created an enormous amount of violence that has nothing to do with the drug right often people hear this phrase drug-related violence and what they picture when they hear that is someone using drugs losing their shit and attacking someone right there's a really good study by Keuchel professor Paul Goldstein that look to everything that was classified as drug-related violence in New York City in 1986 what it found was 3 percent of what's called drug-related violence is someone using drugs and losing their shit that's real it happens sometimes we represent 3% another 7% was people with an addiction problem like committing property crimes and getting caught or whatever and the vast majority was rival drug gangs and exactly the kind of violence we're talking about the war for drugs created by prohibition now we can reduce the problems associated with drug use by having these adjust they have in Switzerland a Portugal and and we can end the violence caused by the war photobooks there are no violent alcohol gangs Al Capone killed loads of people drunk no alcohol cellar anywhere in the United States today will kill a single other alcohol seller right that violence ended if we banned rice there will be violent rice sellers right that we have to understand that what we are doing - and there's this bullshit fucking thing that said where they'll take these deaths on the supply route right prohibitionists and they'll say look at you evil drug users you're responsible for the deaths of these people right that is so pernicious right you can have every single drug piece of drug use that happened in the United States today and none of those killings on the supply route it is the system those people have erected and imposed and lied their way to maintain that causes this violence right and we can end this violence and I think about the rosolio right the the you know I got asked once in an interview who do you feel most sorry for of all the people you met and obviously I met people with addiction problems all over the world and I surprised myself the person who came into my head was Rosario because what have we done to these people right what about snot we for sure yeah well as taxpayers we're responsible for it right I mean we don't what you know you and I do not support it but as a society we've done that and those of us who oppose it haven't done a good enough job of persuade anyone else and it goes back to a question why does it persist right the key reason I think it's two things partly people are afraid of the alternatives but understandable reasons there are real risks in pursuing the alternatives I think we can understand what those risks are and deal with them but hold on because it seems like those risks have been mitigated in Portugal and Switzerland I mean we have real evidence that those risks and that there are unfounded exactly you can understand it's not crazy to have that fear but then we can address that fear by talking about what actually happened well why don't we implement some sort of a small-scale version of this I mean how come no one has ever tried to do this you mean do it in Vermont do it in New Hampshire doing a small stay well there are loads of people who want to do that but the federal drug laws are federal right so federal law supersedes but that doesn't happen with cannabis so that was a that's a big debate technically and legally the federal government could go off yes Colorado Washington now there's a political decision to not do that because cannabis legalization is popular in those places right yes there were people Jeff sessions when he was the ag-1 Attorney General wanted wanted to do that it's just our good luck that actually he pissed off Trump over something else because because of the muna enquiring everything that Trump kind of despite Jeff Sessions doing so and the federal banking laws actually mean that you know cannabis stores are operating in this way gray area they can't have thank you my point is why is no one pushing this why the world people are pushing that's in America yeah so I think there are lots of people who are pushing this that amazing groups urge everyone to join and support the drug policy Alliance on the what I'm saying is why are no politicians ever discussing this this is never an option because those are the only ones that are gonna really change policy so we're seeing a big change in public opinion that is changed on many issues so think about when Bill Clinton stopped being president which is you know remember there's not how long ago 16% of Americans supported legalizing cannabis today 70% of Americans support legalizing cannabis is so extraordinary transformation a very short period of time likely brought on by the fact that the medical use of it was prohibited up until then I mean it was like 1994 right when it was passed and then California started doing it and he started having positive tax revenues from and he started seeing people that were suffering from a lot of ailments it's showing that they were helped substantially by cannabis and then the attitude of it changed in popular culture it changed I mean the with Sol crazies that that reefer madness preper reefer madness proposition or the propaganda rather was so effective that they did it in the 1930s and it carried on into the 90s into the 2000s there's still people alive today to believe some of that I think you put that really well as a series of things going on partly what happened one of the major one of the major factors that make it possible for the drug war to continue is the dehumanization of people at every turn right dehumanization of drug users mm-hmm yeah and soon we should talk about yeast as opposed to addiction but dehumanization of drug users dehumanization of people with addiction problems dehumanization of drug dealers there's a reason why well the most sympathetic people in my book is a transgendered crack dealer called Chino Harden is an amazing human being and dehumanization of people on the supply route countries you're hearing the way people are talking about Mexicans now a powerful people in this society and one of the reasons why chasing the scream is written as stories of people is because the solution to dehumanization is to recommen ization when I was meeting these people all over the world I kept thinking if any ordinary American could meet Chino Harden my friend the transgender crack dealer who is hilarious and amazing if they could meet Bud Osborn the homeless Street addict who started a movement in Canada if they could meet maricella they would not say that the deaths of these people mean nothing right they would not say yeah let's pursue a policy that kills them because we get some imaginary benefit further down the line right think about Lee Maddox the cop in Baltimore it was when Edie died it was when her partner - what are we losing these people for it's that moment of getting people to see everyone involved as human right we're not there yet still the ways people are talking about addiction are repellent right this little thing of people as being weak I think of people's having poor willpower poor character and that's why they're addicted there most people I would I would say it's safe to venture aren't really fully aware of what the causes what the underlying causes of people becoming addicted to drugs in the first place are and what what leads people this great sense of despair me it's really about re-engineering our entire culture I mean reengineering not just the way we treat addiction but the way we treat human beings where we treat poor neighborhoods I mean there's there's so much that needs to be done that's never addressed totally right and there's one part of this this funny really check one thing surprises me in this debate I have found is actually easier in the u.s. to make the case for compassion for people with addiction problems than to make the case for liberty for drug users who are not addicted right so like we were saying even the main drug war body in the world the UNODC UN Office of Drug Control admits 90% of all currently banned drug uses what's called a non-problematic right our friend professor Karl Hart is the head of psychology at Columbia University and the extraordinary human being has done really important work explaining this to people even with what we think of as the devil drugs like heroin crack the vast majority of people who use heroin and crack do not become addicted right which I found really Chatwin Karl first explained that to me I was like what's this guy talking about and I looked at the scientific evidence not there was very clear evidence right that actually the ratio of people who use any drug who become addicted is pretty consistently 10 to 20 percent right slightly higher for things like heroin but it's pretty consistently in that zone right mmm which is not to say that there aren't other hot heroin depresses your breathing it can cause death that way there other harms but which we met addiction right um so it's interesting there's so much I think we need to explain to people one person here in LA who really helped me to understand this and the research for the book his guy called Professor Ronald Casey go you should you should totally have on your shows a very it should go he was an advisor to four American presidents he was a WH visor to World Health Organization really serious scientist but he had a sideline for thirty years we investigated animals using drugs right and he's basically shown loads of species love getting intoxicated for the pleasure of it right for our elephants yeah elephants like who's the maize example game in Bengal of elephants who broke into an alcohol store got really drunk and just fucked up the whole village right if you give if you give hash to mice what they do is they'll they get really horny they try to male mice will try to mount women but then they basically can't get up so they just spent hours licking their own balls and they're going cock Saturday loads of examples is what a guy press a secret I remember what he told me at one point that he'd spent three years investigating grasshoppers in cannabis fields who just naturally live in cannabis fields to figure out when they eat the cannabis did they jump higher or lower and I said I right and at the end of your three years what did you discover and he said they turns out they just jump in the same height or the other grow so it was a great use of your three years of life but he also got you had an interesting time when he was in Hawaii he was investigating monkey where the Mongoose is like hallucinogens psychedelics and he is like spying on these mongooses with with binoculars and he gets he gets caught by a load of drug traffickers who the fuck even he's like oh don't worry I'm just investigating where the Mongoose is likes like it's like that is the worst fucking cover story we've ever heard they've held them hostage for like two days but what he showed is something I think is really important and there's loads of other evidence which is it is absolutely innate to other species but especially to humans the desire to get intoxicated right there has never been a human society anywhere in the world where people didn't seek out intoxicants and enjoy using them the only society where there were no naturally occurring intoxicants was the Inuit Lee what used to be called the Eskimos in the Arctic and they used to just starve themselves to get a fucked up head steak because that's how deep it isn't human beings if there is nothing in to starve yourself yeah if you starve yourself long enough you get a kind of fucked up head state basically how far how long you go for I don't know if I looked into the details of it but he writes about that bit so it's fasting yeah fasting causes an altered head state but the that I've never done it but that this this intoxication impulses is deep in human beings as the sexual impulse you even see it in small children you know when lilke it everyone will know how this memory of when you're a little kid and you realize you can spin round and round them round mm-hm even though you know it will make you sick you do it because you get an altered headspace that is one of the first expressions of the kind of intoxication impulse or a really nice example is for 2,000 years forty miles outside of Athens in ancient Greece they used to be once a year people would meet as something a place called the temple of a lusus and it was basically Burning Man they would all use a psychedelic together we now know what that psycho doctors yeah it was a kind of there's lots of different theories but I think it was a kind of fungus basically I cover the name of it but there's been some research I don't know I don't want to say it wrong it was some kind of some kind of psychedelic wash and and like people like Plato and Aristotle people say you know drug Sir William Bennett the former drug czar saying drugs are an attack on the foundations of Western civilization you're like no at the actual foundations of Western civilization the people you're holding up as the icons like Plato and Aristotle were literally getting fucked up in exactly the way you say is an attack on them right yeah it's this deep misunderstanding so this is a natural human impulse we are never going to get rid of it we want to get rid of it it gives people a lot of joy and pleasure and yet the Oscar Wilde said once I'm gonna get a quote slightly wrong he said it better than this but he said Puritanism is the deeper gnawing fear someone somewhere is enjoying themselves and there's this puritanical hatred of drug use right now some of that is understandable fears much genuine harms and that's a different thing but a lot of it is just a very deep Puritanism and you really see it in one phrase we need to get get out of the English language is the ridiculous phrase drugs and alcohol it's like saying fruit and apples right alcohol is a drug right alcohol is easily the deadliest drug in our culture well after tobacco it's a not saying you know as my friend Steve roses be campaign releases it's like saying metal and iron right it's a meaningless phrase but it's you this distinction between alcohol and other drugs is is a way of maintaining this drug war right because the reality is the same proportion of people become addicted to alcohol has become addicted to cocaine right same proportion not so not absolute numbers come off people use alcohol of sleep and risks from alcohol are very similar to risk from other drugs right actually some of them are Cod is significantly more dangerous than some drugs that are currently banned but we with alcohol and it comes back to what you're saying about why we don't change these policies with alcohol enough people well everyone knows people who drink alcohol right and one of the reasons things changed on cannabis is because more people came out and talked about it and so you had this situation where you've got Harry Anslinger saying if you use cannabis you'll you know kill your family with an axe by the time we get to the 90s enough people know enough people have used cannabis to go right well Jimmy over there ain't a hot jacket and chopping his family to death with lakhs right this is this is bullshit and I think one of things we have to do is encourage people to talk one of the weird things is that prohibition creates a distorted picture of overall drug use right because loads of your listeners might say on Facebook you know I went out on Saturday night and I had you know five vodka shots and I got hammered and had a great time you'd be pretty foolish if you put on Facebook Oh Saturday night I went out and have five lines of coke and I had a great night right you'd be never far a lot of people I far let me ask you this is there a culture where there's no demonized use of drugs or alcohol is there any culture that doesn't frown upon some drugs or have some forbidden categories for drugs what they've been those societies throughout history right I mean now well we've got to understand it in the context of the war that Harry Anslinger imposed upon the whole world right there was no country I mean if you think about habits in Mexico right so Mexico had so the 1930s Anslinger says to the Mexicans you'll notice some real parallels what's happening now you guys are responsible for our drug epidemic you've got to ban drugs and have a vicious war on drugs right and the Mexican government alike no we can see the policies don't work for you we're not going to do it they had a drugs are a drug Minister called Leopoldo Salazar Vinnie agro they should build fucking statues do no man has ever been more prescient he explained to the Americans we don't wanna ban cannabis it's not particularly harmful with other drugs we should providing people with compassionate care and if we ban drugs the countries our country is going to be taken over by drug lords right no one has ever been more right about anything the Americans the US start pressuring Mexico more and more in the end they cut off so all opiates for pain relief Houston hospitals were manufactured in the Americas in the United States at that time they cut off the supply all of them people start dying in hospitals all over Mexico in agony and the Mexicans give in they fire this guy and they begin the drug war and the whole journey that leads to Ross salia Retta the guy I know from the Zetas and Mary sellers death that that trajectory begins at that point and this is something we haven't explained I think is so important right and certainly really surprised me learning about the history of all this stuff at the birth of the drug war it was intensely resisted right think about here in LA right in Los Angeles there was a doctor called Henry Smith Williams when heroin was banned there was a deliberate loophole in the law this said ok you can't sell heroin but doctors can prescribe it to people with addiction problems just like what happened in Switzerland right so here in LA big heroin clinic prescribed Anslinger it drives him crazy he wants to shut it down so the mayor of Los Angeles stands in front of this heroin prescription clinic and says you will not shut this down this does a good job for us but Anslinger shuts it down when doctors say to the there's the biggest crackdown on doctors in American history over 12,000 doctors are arrested and rounded up and when they come to the one in Portland Oregon the doctors say but what are we meant to do with all these vulnerable addicted people and one of the agents said go and throw them in the lake they'll make good fish food right that was the attitude so this is resisted intensely at the birth of the drug war so you had a society really recently that had a much more mature exactly what you're asking about a much more mature attitude to drug use than we have now right it's not that people thought all drug use is good we should celebrate every instance of drug use no one thinks that right there were problems and they would there is some joy associated with drug use that's actually the norm there is some pain and terrible things associated with drug use which I'm mostly driven by underlying harm but there are real harms that come from some drugs as well and most societies until very recently had a mature appreciation of this right really we are the outlier that most societies have had licensed intoxicants now of course in different societies at different Tyler it was a Tsar of Russia who wanted to ban tobacco right and did terrible things to anyone who was found with tobacco different societies have had different panics at different times but we are the historical outliers right I mean to give you a sense just the United States imprisons two million people there has never been a society that imprisons this many of its citizens this higher proportion of its citizens anywhere ever it's overwhelmingly driven by the drug war right I mean the u.s. imprisons so many people and the conditions in those prisons are so terrible that the United States is almost certainly the first society ever where more men have been raped than women that's how extreme this this war is right and what we do to people in what this what this the Crippler the conditions this war creates it's and it's a total historical outlier we are in a freak experiment right and the one thing you can say in defense of the drug war and I would give one bit of credit for this is we gave it a fair shot right the United States has done it for 100 years this country has spent a trillion dollars on it we've imprisoned millions of our own citizens we've considered killed hundreds of thousands of people at a conservative estimate we've destroyed whole countries like Colombia is in the problem now that there's a gigantic business behind it all from private prisons to prison guard unions to the pharmaceutical industry that would benefit from keeping most of these drugs illegal so their profits continue to rise to law enforcement I mean down the line it's you'd be disrupting like an evil industry but an industry I think that's a real factor but I don't want to overstate it lots of policies have been a factor what's the main factor the main factor is most people asked do you think the drug war has failed say yes and most people ask do you want to legalize any drug other than cannabis say no very strong so education I think it's about I won't use the word education can I give you an example of a specific person who I think showed a way to do this so in the year 2000 in Vancouver there was a homeless street at it called but Osborn and and he lived in a notorious part of Vancouver called the Downtown Eastside people in Duncan spent kobold knew it know it it's a place particularly that time that had a really high like nightmarish open drug scene right just again people it like into it some people injecting in the streets that kind of thing and bad was living homeless and he was watching his friends die all around him at that time and there was a really big police crackdown and so people would go and like hide in dumpsters or in alleyways to shoot up but obviously if you're hiding and you overdosed no one sees you just dying right and one day bud he learns that one of his friends Judith had had died and he's like I can't just sit here and wait for all my friends to die than for me to die but as bud would have put it then he also thought I'm a homeless junkie what the fuck am I gonna do but had a really simple idea he gathered together a group of the other homeless Street addicts and he said when we're not using which is most of the time even people on the streets what we should do is just drop a timetable and go and look in the places where we know people were we shoot up right and if we see someone overdosing we'll ring an ambulance no officials nothing like that just does and loads of people had descended on the Downtown Eastside to come up with problems to solve everything and people were very skeptical but they liked Bud okay what did they start going and searching and over the next three months the downtown the death toll on the Downtown Eastside like had a significant fall and obviously that meant people who would have died were living which is a great thing but it also meant the addicts thought huh maybe we're not the pieces of shit everyone says we are right maybe we can do something like what else can we do bud went to the library he learned in Frankfurt in Germany they had open safe injection rooms but like what happened in California until they shut it down Anslinger shut it down where people could go and use their drugs and be watched by doctors and nurses and that this had massively reduced deaths in Frankfurt nothing like this had happened in the United States since Anslinger shot it all down but buds like okay we'll persuade our mayor they set up a group called van do the Vancouver area network of drug users okay the mayor was a conservative right-wing guy called Philip Owen who have been American comparison it's not Trump like Mitt Romney rich guy from a privileged family didn't know anything about addicts he'd run for office saying all the local drug addicts should be local to be taken and detained to the local military base in Chilliwack and never let out gives she since where he's coming from right people are not optimistic about persuading him Vande bad his friends they decide everywhere Philip Bowman goes they're going to follow him with a coffin and the coffin had written on it who will die next Philip Owen before you open a safe injection site every time Phillip Owen spoke in public one of the homeless people with addiction problems would stand up and say who will die next blip her him before you open a safe injection site and one day Dean Wilson one of the main people in Valdez stood up and said do you remember Julia who asked you recently he would die next it turned out to be her kiss you haven't done it right this goes on for a long time they do loads of public actions they filled up and Homer Park which big park in Vancouver with a cross more than a thousand crosses each one representing someone who had died of an overdose and they wrote the names of the people on the crosses and and one day after going on for years it only tears credit Phillip having just said the fuck are these people what is this and he went to meet loads of the addicts he sat with them it blew his mind he thought people with addiction problems people he partied too hard and dodged themselves he was completely shocked he came here to the unter states to me Milton Friedman the Nobel prize-winning economist who grown up under alcohol prohibition and muttered Freeman explains drug prohibition to Philip poet but opponent comes back to Vancouver and he holds a press conference and he had the Chief of Police the coroner and I represented with the addicts and this is thing like I'm not going to speak again without having the addicts here with me about addiction because they understand it better than me we're going to open the first safe injection site in North America we're going to have the most compassionate drug policies in North America things are going to change around here right the open safe injection site Phillip Owens right-wing party is so horrified they deselect him as their candidate and his whole political career ends but a more liberal guy wins the election and the room stays open right in the ten years that followed overdose deaths on the Downtown Eastside fell by 80% eight zero percent right average life expectancy in that neighborhood rose by ten years you just don't get figures like that very often and I remember the reason I set in relation to change it's you know a big part of what I argue in chasing The Scream any mother but lost connection says you know we you don't write people off right but I realized I would have written off Phillip Owen right wing guy runs for saying we should lock them all up in the military base right you don't write off anyone you don't know who can be persuaded by a message of love and compassion and the most unlikely one of the biggest champions of my book is a conservative evangelical Christian in Mississippi call Cristina dent who's doing incredible work with this right now and I thought a lot about Phillip Owen when I went to go see Phillip ovid on the Downtown Eastside and he said to me he would sacrifice his entire political career all over again given the chance for this course he said how often do you get to save thousands of lives at the most vulnerable people and after I got to know bud Osbourne the guy who started this movement he died he and I remember you know he's only in his early 60s but he'd been a homeless during a drug war it takes a toll on you and they sealed off the streets of the Downtown Eastside where but had lived as a homeless person and they had this incredible memorial ceremony and there were loads of people at that ceremony who knew that they were alive because of what bud had started and cuz so many other people had joined them and so many people who didn't have addiction problems that opened their hearts right and I remember thinking that day you know when you get disheartened about this sin it's easy to get this hard right this is a 100 year long drug war we're up against very powerful forces everyone watching your show listening to your show is more powerful than Budd was that day right the day he started that right just by virtue of the fact they have a device on which to listen to this right bud didn't sit there thinking someone else is going to handle this he didn't sit there thinking are where this is we're up against these forces that can't be defeated he started where he stood he appealed to the people around him and it started this circle of change that you know the Canadian Supreme Court ruled because the right-wing government at Stephen Harper tried to shut down this injection site and the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that people with addiction problems have a right to light to live and that includes a safe place to do so drugs that will never be taken away now right that static is one but you know when you have nothing else you have a voice you have a human voice that you can use to persuade other people with love and compassion you can tell them stories you can build people's love and compassion in the middle of this catastrophe that we're seeing in this country with the addiction crisis right I mean more people died last year in the opioid crisis than all the soldiers who died in the Vietnam War combined in the middle of this catastrophe we can carry on doing what we've been doing ok we can carry on doing that then we will continue to get the horrific results we are now getting we can continue to copy the places that have failed right at the end of a hundred year long drug war that's cost two trillion dollars we can even keep drugs out of our prisons where we have a wall perimeter and we pay people to walk around it the whole time so good luck keeping them out of a 3,000 mile border right that will never happen that is a ludicrous fantasy you may as well take all the money that will be spent trying to keep drugs out that way and burn it in a pile right is absurd there's never been such a society or we can start to copy the places that have succeeded right Portugal Switzerland ergh why Canada there are plenty of places that have tried the alternatives and people who were quite skeptic was one things that was most striking to me in all those places is that people who were initially skeptical and initially thought it was crazy very often changed their minds this is the consistent pattern before it happens people think it's the work of a bunch of fucking wackos they think what people who want to you know get everyone to use drugs and get children to use drugs and think it's madness and then they see that that's not at all what motivates people who want reform and that's not that's not what happens in practice when you when you adopt these policies and it's not a magic bullet and they still have problems but there's been such significant improvement in all those places that the resistance tends to I mean how many people arguing for reversing the cannabis legalization here you don't ever hear it now right it's been a little bit of a backlash and a kind of absurd but cuz it's come out repeating the kind of victaulic artists I well I actually had that guy I really tell me about yeah why I had it we had a debate between him and Alex Bernstein and dr. Mike Hart from Canada and there's some there's some reality to the dangers of cannabis used to some people that are susceptible to schizophrenia and I think that there's also some at least anecdotal evidence at the points to the fact that some people experience these psychotic breaks and these schizophrenic episodes probably directly as a result of large dose use of THC whether it's through edibles or whether it's through smoking that some people freak out I've known people I've known of people that have had real issues with it I mean had a comedian here a couple weeks ago talked about he doesn't smoke pot he's from Brazil he smoked pot of use of a pan took a bunch of hits and was fucked up for two weeks there are there are dangers and problems young people so it's really important the case for legalizing cannabis is not that there is no harm associated with cannabis right in the same way the case but legalizing alcohol is not there's no harm associated this is what Alex Bernstein is trying to go this book I don't think he did a good job for two reasons one because he's basically only making the case for it to be negative and I think there's far more evidence that cannabis has a positive influence on people it reinforces community it makes people more sensitive and kind this thought of paranoia might actually it makes people more humble it makes sex feel better and fakes food tastes better there's there's creativity aspects to it that are undeniable there's a lot of very positive aspects to it for some people it's not good but it's like saying hey some people die when they peanuts let's outlaw peanuts I think they want your children about peanuts yeah I think everything you just said is is absolutely right I think there's another layer that's going on at the same time a kind of below that which is really important people to understand so there's this thing and so very often people will say you get kind of Republican politicians like Carter mo Carly Fiorina saying it during on the Republican debates in 2016 or 2015 maybe we can't legalize cannabis because it's much stronger now than it used to be THC contents come on people smoking Scott it's really important to understand why that happened it's because of drug prohibition so the day before alcohol was banned in the US the most popular drinks by far were beer and wine right in the weeks after alcohol prohibition ended most popular drinks again where they're in wine as they are today in between you could not get hold of beer and wine the most popular drinks were whiskey and moonshine you look at you think well why would that be what's going on and it's because we're kind of slightly wonky and boring thing but I think it's worth talking about it's called the iron law of prohibition if you imagine if we had to smuggle the nearest bar to here if we had to smuggle all the alcohol for that bar in a wagon from the canadian book for the mexican border right from tijuana and in a wagon we fill our wagon with beer we're going to get drink for a hundred people if we fill it with vodka bringing it drink for thousands of people right so when you ban a drug in it has to be smuggled around you get a premium on getting the biggest possible kick into the smallest possible space right this is why mild forms of the drug disappear before an opiates were banned in the United States most popular way of consuming it was something called mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup which you would buy in the pharmacy right very low level of opiates most popular way of consuming coca based products prior to the banning was Coca Cola right that's called that for a reason when the ban happens heroin becomes uniform opiates powder cocaine becomes the only form of cocaine in fact when there's a huge crackdown on powder cocaine in the 80s the iron law kicks in even more and that's when crack is invented you can get even more of a hit into an even smaller possible space right so I think it's important to understand if you what it is not good most people who drink alcohol don't want to drink vodka and they certainly don't drink absinthe for most of the time right most people want a mild form of their drug that's true cannabis that's true of course there's some people who want to get totally fucked up either for fun or because they have addiction problems most people want a mild form of the drug it's not good that mild forms of the drug are when they might labview I don't think that's true it's definitely not true in California in California what happened was medical care cannabis got passed and once medical cannabis got passed there was an emphasis on the strongest possible stuff because people wanted it I mean it was a direct result of people having higher tolerances because marijuana was so readily available and they if you have a high tolerance and you smoked a lot of pot you want strong pot because weak pot doesn't do anything it's the number one complaint amongst cannabis enthusiasts is someone having weak pops you've got a subculture of people who are cannabis enthusiasts yeah right there's a sub just like there's a subculture of people who want book or absinthe right but I don't think it's a matter it's not the same thing I Janet obviously is more potent than whiskey or than beer rather it's easier to carry gin around you have to carry less of it with cannabis people are still buying the same quantity they're just getting more fucked up because their tolerances are so much higher they need the stronger and stronger THC so as you have a legal mark you can have a variety of options yes what you have is what would what we'll discover I think as time goes by because we notice with alcohol is different people want cannabis to do different things you're totally right there's some people who want maximum THC maximally fucked up just some people well there's still a market for for lower grade weed I mean they have it listed at all these dispensaries they have it listed you know 20% 35% they have listed so you can choose a more mild marijuana if you like to but the OG people the people that do it everyday of course they want that really potent weed it's not like I would say they're more like the people in Vegas who gamble are professional gamblers versus the people who go to Vegas for the weekend and just want to play a roulette well there's definitely a concentrated market of very dedicated users who want to get maximally fucked up you're totally right I think that's what pushed the putt I mean it's also an botanists and I'm friends with a bunch of people who breed and grow these various strains if you think about so professor David Nutt has done really interesting work on this so if I remember rightly there's 38 active components in cannabis right so cannabinoids well there's hundreds of cannabinoids so I think the if I'm a professor nuts where the the he Yogi's there's 38 kind of significant active components maybe other people yeah there's over a hundred cannabinoids I think we just discussed this right and we so one of the things he argues and I'm happy to be corrected on a specific number but one of the things he argues is you've got because you're talking mask is free air and psychosis and it's important to understand there is some evidence that very high exposure to THC in a small number of people can can leave your psychosis right and that's even a small number of people where you have a very widely used drug is is that's really problematic right but actually this is really evidence so why do people who are prone to psychosis schizophrenia one cannabis right there is a lot of them who want it it's not the people no hardly anyone wants to have a psychotic episode it's actually so THC correlates with with psychosis on people but there's a another component of cannabis called CBD cannabidiol which actually we know there's good evidence sue this psychosis in schizophrenia right it's actually given us a treatment in some places in distilled pill form so actually it's a slightly more complex picture than cannabis causes psychosis right very rich THC in some people will cause psychosis that's a real problem there are things we can do to prevent that and one of the good things about a legal market is you can regulate it so we can limit the amount of THC that is available just like we can limit you know you can't go and buy 70% profound on but also what what Professor knot has been arguing is we need to be and they exist but they need to be commercialized and promoted more or promoted in public health way not necessarily commercially CBD rich cannabis will actually be helpful to people with psychosis schizophrenia so it's a slightly more complicated pitch I know that you you're not saying that it you're not endorsing what the tell your kids guy what's it called again and the guy who did your debate our experienced yeah I know you're not endorsing the kind of simplistic view on either side but the the I think it's slightly more slightly more complicated than that the other thing I think is really worth saying though to people is there's one thing we will do agree on which is cannabis is bad for young teenagers right is he have the developing brains as one person that interview really helped me to get to think about this guy called Fred Martin's who's in I went to going to see him in Camden New Jersey and Fred was a cot he's retired now but it was a cop I was really kind of right-wing reminded me of the Clint Eastwood character and Dirty Harry he's not a liberal right and he had this he wouldn't use a fancy word like this behind epiphany about drug legalization one day he was at a car park in Wayne New Jersey in 1971 it was staking out a dealer it he's in plainclothes obviously and a kid comes up to him like an 11 year old or something and goes hey mister and I'm not allowed to buy alcohol will you go into that liquor store and buy some for me and Frank goes no get out of here so the kid walks over to the drug dealer and buy some drugs from him instead and fred has this kind of realization which is oh he wouldn't put it this way but legalization puts a regulatory barrier between kids and drugs that doesn't currently exist right this is why since they legalized cannabis in Colorado there's been a don't overstate it's not huge but there's been a significant fall in teenage cannabis use right drug dealers don't check ID license legal businesses do they really care if they're they because they've got something to lose right and so I think if sometimes it's used as the kind of protect our kids argument is used as a case for prohibition in fact if you want to protect your kids you should be putting a big premium on getting these substances out of the hands of armed criminal gangs and into the hands of licensed legal businesses yeah I don't think anybody's gonna argue that I mean I think that anybody rational I think that makes a lot of sense I think that there the number of people that have schizophrenia is fairly it's fairly stable in terms of the percentage of it across the board cannabis users or non cannabis users and so the argument against this idea that cannabis causes schizophrenic breaks is that these people already have schizophrenia and it just hasn't really manifested itself in a in a tangible sense so this is one of things professor nut says so there's this there is some evidence that cannabis in a small number of people causes psychosis as a study in Sweden that show this with schizophrenia it's much more contested so so psychosis versus schizophrenia well that was the major distinction yeah I'm not research this in depth but psychosis involves a different paranoia schizophrenia is a subset of mental illness that's very specific has a significant genetic component although there can be environmental triggers for it so it could possibly trigger both it could possibly trigger psychosis get the argument against that so professor so there is evidence with psychosis the argument were stressed it's a very small number of people but it is real and there are things we can do in a legal market to counteract that that are much harder to do in a prohibitive market but with schizophrenia the argument against that and I've not looked into this in a huge amount of detail so I don't want to this is not I don't so it sounds great confidence I've been saying the other stuff but professor not argues well we know that cannabis use has massively increased in Britain for example I thinking like 20-fold increase since 1960 in Britain and yet levels of schizophrenia have remained the same if cannabis was causing schizophrenia you would expect it to vary with cannabis use at least to some degree there'd be some relationship and that doesn't seem to be the case so again that's what Professor now who's the former chief scientific adviser on drugs in Britain says I haven't looked into that in great detail side but he's basically right on all the things that I have looked into that he says hmm I do they know what the mechanism would be that would cause someone to consume THC and have a psychotic break that does that of an exam I don't know about it would seem to be a big issue right like find out what it is that's causing this trigger and whether or not this exists in these anyway and maybe a stressful situation and a bad breakup losing their job maybe one of those things could also cause this trip well we know with all mental health all aspects of mental health all mental health problems there are three kinds of cause right there's my but loss connections which about depression anxiety is a lot about this there are biological causes things like your genes real brain changes things like the introduction of a drug there are psychological causes or how you think about yourself and your place in the world and then there's environmental causes like you know how we live with each other things like loneliness that sort of thing and and in all mental health phenomena to some degree these three sets of causes play out so let's think about even something very dementia dementia has a very obviously has a heavy biological driver right dementia is a physical degeneration of the brain or disease like Alzheimer's but even with dementia which has this very heavy biological driver we know there are big social and psychological effects that can mitigate it so if you're part of a strong community and have lots of social connections if you have a positive self-image if you speak other languages your dementia will develop significantly more slowly than if you don't have any of these factors right so with things like psychosis there's a brilliant person called Tanya Lerman a professor Tanya lemon at Stanford University who's done really interesting research and wasn't in great detail but interviewed her who's shown so we know recovery from psychosis of schizophrenia is much stronger in African countries than it is in the United States right and it's not a genetic thing as Africans who come to the United States end up having the American level of recovery not the African level of recovery and again it's awhile since I spoke to her I don't want to overstate my confidence about this but there are other people there are people I think including her who argue in part what's going on is in many not all some places it's really brutal but in many parts of Africa you remain part of the community even if you have these mental health problems right they have much stronger social connections it's a study that asks Americans how many close friends do you have here you could turn to in a crisis and when they started doing it years ago the most common answer was five today the most common answer is none right it's not the average but its most common answer half of all Americans asked how many people know you well say nobody right it's a huge amount of evidence loneliness is toxic for human beings lonely people has guided a lot of experiments on this here in LA lonely people exposed to the flu virus and the cold virus and the colds are way more likely to actually get them the non lonely people right it's just devastating for your physical and mental health to be lonely there's other things going on so I think there's a whole range of things that are going on with all mental health problems I don't have this relates to cannabis and psychosis I don't want to I don't know but we know with psychosis yet there's a big debate about this immigrants are more likely to have psychosis the non-immigrants is there's a whole lots of environmental factors playing out even in extreme mental health problems like now I wanna stress it's they're not the only thing there are real biological aspects as well which are clearly very significant and things like schizophrenia and play some role in things like depression for a lot of people but but yeah that makes sense I mean sort of yeah I mean obviously there's varying biological factors but the cultural factors make sense the fact that these people in Africa are not they're not expelled from the community so they have a sense of bond and maybe it's more easy to recover and one of the things that you hear about part of the problem with mental illness is that people with mental illness are pushed away people don't want to deal with their problem and it exacerbates whatever is causing it in the first place what drugs have you used I have to be slightly careful in my answer because I'm in an immigration process prescription legal drugs so I used to drug illegally that is a prescription drug so called modafinil or premium provigil why'd you use it illegal it's pretty easy to get a prescription from knowing Britain so just to explain to people who don't know provigil is a drug that was developed people with narcolepsy well it's actually developed as a performance enhancer and they just had to find I really listen to us the other way around how interesting they had to find a reason to use it and the reason to use it was to say always give it a people with narcolepsy listen yeah check to see if that's true because that's how it's been explained to me by actually by my doctor oh that's really interesting perfectly prepared - I don't know about that but that sounds plausible to me that so I think for me do you use that a lot no so V is it now so for me I think I didn't have an addition to that what I had an addiction to was working all the time my so I grew up in a crazy and violent environment in many ways and my way of where there's addiction and other things and my way of coping in that environment was to read and write all the time to just not be present by just working right when I was a small child and as I got older that was really my way of being in the world right to work all the time and I think when I got into my like late 20s I can't remember I wrote an article about my deafness oh it could I could find figure out when I started taking it but the because I initially wrote a positive article about it um I was at that point where the obsessive compulsive work wasn't working for me right it wasn't and like a lot of people with addictive behavior I was doubling down on the thing that wasn't working that well so for me modafinil was or provisional I bought it on the internet was a way I thought initially and make it so I could work even more hours do even more right and initially when you start taking it a lot of people take it before exams for example it it does make you feel it's not a caffeine buzz it wasn't for me anyway it's just you feel like you can just you know feeling when someone put it to me it wasn't a scientist so it could be bullshit but so we evolved - we have this thing called executive focus right I've got executive focus oh now I'm really concentrating on what I'm saying to you and the signals coming from you right but obviously we can't be in a state of executive focus all the time right but what modafinil does is it it makes you much more in a state of executive focus for longer and you can see why people evolved to do that if you were and where we evolved if you were being chased by a lion your brain just switches off all the other shit and it's like get the fuck away from the lion right and my understanding is that modafinil triggers that that state not a panic state but an exec executive focus day which is good for a while except 30 really big downsides to that firstly you don't sleep and if you don't sleep you go fucking crazy I'd never heard that there's an issue with sleeping in modafinil I really I'm vigil or provigil in fact it's one of the positive aspects of it that you can sleep on it oh well I mean it was designed for people who find it hard to stay awake so glancing hey that's not true I'm reading what are you reading that the guy who discovered it Michaels you've a was a sleep study yeah neurophysiologist and was working on the compound ad Drac or a driven L and then they discovered then made modafinil which is a stronger version of that hmm somebody is there anything that says that it was originally developed as a performing anything like that fucking doctor yeah my experience was two problems so firstly I don't know how to run since I haven't done a huge amount of research on this drug my experience was firstly not sleeping which is really bad for you over time and secondly actually if you're in that focus mode you so your your mind needs time wandering mm-hmm sorry your mind needs time to wander right it needs time you know if I just leave here and walk out there on the street my brain will just start wandering around loads rise there and then it will go back into executive focus where I do the next interview or whatever you need those periods when you're not in exact focus when you're exactly or not even recovery that's where it is recovery is part of it that's when your brain often has creative thoughts right when you'll wander it when your mind is wandering when things will come to you because that a certain amount of your mind is processing things even though you're not conscious of it right it's what I felt with new vigil that it didn't know vigil or provigil they're very similar that it didn't seem like there was much creativity going on that it was a more of like a grunt tool how long did you use it I mean I I would not use it regularly I would take it like once a couple weeks once a week or so like that how long I think I did it for like a year a year or so then I just stopped I haven't taken it in years right right but I liked it did you I got it from some guy was a biohacker he was the one who told me about it and he said it was pretty easy to get a prescription for it got a prescription for it and it just gave you like this pepped up sense of focus and awareness I felt like you get a lot done when you're on it but it didn't seem like it helped with those wandering creative thoughts as you were saying yeah if I was ever gonna do exams again which fortunately I'll never do in my life I will I would use that but I think I think you're right and I think but again think about that about in relation to addiction I think often when you talk about saying like work addiction right which is obviously caused by the partly childhood trauma that I'd experienced there's been a real change in how we think about that as well it relates back to what was saying right at the start about Chemical hooks right so if you look at the debate about non drug based addictions right you think about 20 years ago people start talking about sex addiction and a guy called Stanton Peale who interviewed a lot first writes about love addiction or something exactly gambling addiction at the time initially what people says well this is bullshit because they believe the chemical hooks they're in addiction right so it just seems like well that's not I mean there's an episode of Cheers actually which now would be yeah you wouldn't do this but there's an episode where the whole hilarious premise of the show is that what's the Ted Danson case a Malone Ted Danson's character thinks he's a sex addict and this is like a punchline all the way through the show right this is the attitude that it ends where they go through an meeting of six end love addicts Anonymous and like there's some woman talking about how she gets like has sex with every man and it ends with him just putting his arm around her and that's the end of the the end of the show right that wouldn't happen in a sitcom now people people thought well it might but people people don't think the very idea of sex addiction is ridiculous in the way they did right I don't think I think maybe they do maybe but then I think that's because there hasn't been a shift in gamble if you go to a meeting at gamblers anonymous as I have with a friend I don't have a gambling problem but just to support someone they are as addicted as anyone in the next roams down at narcotics not even on a lot I've known a lot of gambling addicts and did you feel that they were seduced they're straight-up junkies and they might as well be chasing crack and that tells us something really important because you don't snort a roulette wheel right you don't inject a online poker right if you can have a professor Nutt said this to me if you can have all of the addiction but none of the chemical hooks that tells us about how we've overestimated the role of Cal there is an addiction chemical hook there's a dopamine addiction well absolutely everything you do that you like gives you dopamine it dopamine hit so I think there's been this attempt to integrate it by going oh well there's this pleasure in the brain and but it's not a self-destructive issue there's something about gambling there's a lot of self-hate involved and this this overwhelming feeling of failure that a lot of gambling addicts have because they fail so often and they're they're always trying to chase the dragon they're always trying to make up for all the past things they've gone wrong this big score with this big score we're gonna settle it out somebody told me about I just think about what you're saying in relation to him a guy called Peter Cohen he's a professor in the Netherlands who actually didn't say system he'd rather I read it he says we shouldn't call it addiction we should call it bonding the human beings have an innate need to bond and connect right and when you're happy and healthy your bond and connect with like the people around you with meaningful work but if you can't do that because you're isolated or traumatized or beaten down by life or you haven't taught how to do that you will bond with something that gives you some sense of relief right now for some people that might be porn for some people that might be gambling some people are I'd be cocaine alcohol whatever but he says if you if you only have one bond that's giving you any relief you will obsessively return to that bond right and I think that's a total ex he would say that's not a total explanation for what's going on I do think that is a useful way to think about some of these behavioral addictions right so I someone I know very well a relative of mine has a gambling addiction and this is someone who has no alternative form of joy or pleasure in their life right and gambling gives a moment about lots of moments if you look at somebody's playing online poker as I'd done I'm a relative they're not happy it's not looking at someone watching a nice movie right it's you can see I don't mean sorry I should be get someone with an addiction problem playing online poker some people and most people don't have a problem right it's the it's the relief of just being absent from your life for a moment or for however long you play rather than I went to this for lost connections from a book about depression I went to the first ever internet rehab center in the United States it's a weird places impressive place that I like the people there it's in Spokane and just outside Spokane in Washington it's called restart restart Washington and I remember going there really happy it was reintroduce and I remember arriving it's a clearing in the woods right a big wooden place in the clearing the woods and I remember absolutely instinctively looking at my phone and feeling really when a minute I got the cop I'm feeling really pissed off I couldn't check my email I'm like wait you're in the right place right and it's really cuz they get all kinds of people and restart Washington but they disproportionately get young men who are obsessed with multiplayer Rob play games like then it would have been World of Warcraft now it'd be fortnight and speaking to these young men you have this realization talking to the woman who runs it it's amazing woman called dr. Hillary cash who said to me you've got to ask if I think it relates to its aim at gambling you've got to ask what these young men are getting out of this game because they're getting something out of it right and she argues that one of the things they're getting is the things they used to get from the culture but no longer get like what well are feeling they're good at something a feeling that other people see them that they're part of a tribe feeling that they're moving around you know and kids spend very little time outdoors now right I think there's also anticipation there's puzzles there's things we were trying to figure out whether or not something's right or wrong and how to get it and then if you do get it you get this positive surge if you don't get and I think there's a human reward systems that are being mirrored there in gambling and what psychologists call called that feeling of mastery the Masters when you feel you are good at something right it's an absolutely underlying psychological need everyone needs to feel they good at something if you don't have a sense of mastery in your life you will be depressed and anxious right oh you're much more likely to become depressed and anxious and I think again because it's very striking to me I've got teenage nephews I've got godson's we actually don't ask anything of young men right very rarely are they actually asked to do very much they're not given responsibilities right I think I look again I want to stress that most people playing video games are not addicted it's perfectly good for my pleasure they're very addictive I mean they're not most people playing them have a healthy relationship with them and same way that I don't know if that's true I can maybe I yeah tell me about I think a lot of people playing them have a real problem with them they take up massive hours at a time it's a giant problem with young boys I mean the thing is it's become an actual Avenue for a career now there's eSports careers where these young guys are making millions of dollars playing video games it's not like the old days where you would say hey you're wasting your life now it's basically almost like practicing golf but we have a setup back here where we play video games against each other it's very addictive don't you think it's addictive sure yeah so it's like basketball when I was younger too I loved playing basketball couldn't get me to play in the rain right the basketball has movement and exercise attached to it so you get some positive benefit from that addiction I was definitely addicted to jiu-jitsu I would even train when I was injured you know but what does that mean it means I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed not doing it the difference between a lot of videogame addictions and particularly gambling addictions is that they tend to wreck people's lives you know you have this period of jujitsu addiction did you did you because the conditioning distinction there what are you doing it to avoid some kind of pain in your life what were you doing it because you just really deeply loved it's really fun right I'll see you chasing the thrill I'm certain that was avoiding pain with almost everything I've done in my life in some way shape or form you know there's some of it where you're trying to do something positive to mitigate the pain or the frustration or the anger or whatever it is that's bothering you but I don't you know I the video game thing was a real addiction though it's like a compulsion and I was it years how did years how did you get out of it jack I quit I just quit cold turkey stop playing I realize it was kind of messing up my life in my career which is taking up way too much time and I just I came to a realization I was like I got to stop doing this I'm just playing way too much so I just said the only way I'm just too competitive I enjoyed it too much and so the only way to do it was just stop playing it all together and we started playing it again recently after more than shit more than 15 years of ever playing it at all you know and it's still addictive but I'm so busy now I can't really fall into the grip of it I'm actually just enjoying it for an hour here or there but that's so interesting itself isn't it that's a bit like the rap part principal it first made correct me if I'm wrong that like the more you have in your life that is meaningful that is good and gives you pleasure or seize mastery the less space there will be for these objects of obsessions come in right and I think that is a principle that's true this was the principle behind the Portuguese drug decriminalization right if we give people good lives they will not want to anesthetize themselves so much it was the Swiss principle and I think we all see that in our lives two different degrees I you know the happier I am the less I want to turn to you know the behaviors that I developed a child to avoid being present with like violence and aggression like I don't think of like writing as an addiction it might be a compulsion if I have a day when I don't do it I feel terrible but something that is positive and rewarding I don't think is an addiction right something that enriches your life and is not it's a way of living life the most fulfilling way calming obsession maybe a positive obsession yeah a compulsion obsession a way of being in the world right like I don't it's like sometimes I get people saying to me you know like Oh am i addicted to sex and or whatever and you want to set it off and say well does it give you pleasure does it is it is it and is it a way of avoiding pain if it gives you pleasure and it's not a way of avoiding pain it's not an addiction it's just a way a happy way of being in the world right and that's the reality for and again I think it's really helps us because - partly what I'm arguing your loss in in loss collation and tasting scream is we need to deeply reconceptualize how we think about these forms of pain like depression and an addiction and this isn't some wacky basis the view of the World Health Organization these leading medical bodies when it comes to depression the the yeah sorry now people that are a journalists and writers often like stimulants they often like adderall adderall is a big issue for for for journalists how much experience do you have without at all I've never used it it's supposed to be amazing yeah I've never used it precisely because I know I would love it right like I would I've got a young relative who's prescribed it and there are times when I've been telling ya he's offered tried to not spike me but like get me to join him and this is for you but you know this adderall I piss up a whole are thing right which is this what you're talking about again which is I'm not against people obviously not against people using drugs in order to enhance their lives look I have before I came here I drank enough caffeine to kill a whole fucking field of cows right I could probably tell I'm I personally limit my stimulant use because because I know I I can enjoy it yeah yeah and I can tell that I could easily a bit like the modafinil when I start using at modafinil I got that since I just used it every day for three months right which was a ludicrous thing to do but I think in terms of stimulants there's a whole debate that needs to be had now I'm going to write about this at some point but one in ten thirteen-year-old boys in this country is being given a stimulant drug right in any given year right for a DD or ADHD or I mean that yeah horrified it's crazy right thirty percent of children in foster care in the United States have been given at least one psychiatric drug yeah these are not children in the main who are you know have some biological insanity these are kids have been fucking abused and untreated abysmally and what do we do we drug them to shut them up right arts also children have of energy and it's not easy to control them and so they decide that these children have something wrong with them do you know I went to this Amish village but lost connections but one things that's very interesting there are these people who argue and there needs to be more research on this but Amish children don't get ADHD right and this is big debate what's going on there and so this one argument which is then obviously not exposed to digital media which may and there's some evidence of just speaking to Professor Steven Lee here but people are giving lot loads of ADHD when hours in school exactly so exactly said that's just because I spoke to go at UCLA professor Stephen H and there's some effect to digital media but it's not massive right right I think what's happening from the very small amount researcher talking to the Amish is you know I'd say to them do you have kids who don't want to sit still and they go yeah we let them go off and go fishing right the Amish don't want to make you sit still for eight hours a day right there's nothing in their society that I'm Nydia problems we're getting a child to sit still for eight hours a day insane just like trying to get a puppy to sit still for eight hours a day exactly that's exactly the right analogy what we do to our children we try to deaden them and discipline them to cope and thrive in a deadened and disciplined and inverted commas economy right if you the school system is designed in the 1870s to prepare people to work in factories right if you're going to work in a factory in the 1870s what do you need you need to learn to shut the fuck up not complain be passive do what you're told write it this is a I think it's a guy called Alfred Kohn I think is him who says every school has two curriculums or curricula wherever the plural is you've got the official curriculum which is like geography history whatever and then you have the hidden curriculum which was the kind of person the school is trying to make you into right and what is the school system designed to be it's designed to make people who are passive who are obedient who sit still and shut the fuck up right now that was never a good way to make humans right that was always wrong but it's particularly awful in the you know the culture we've created but and this relates to one of the causes of depression that I write about in loss Commission's which is you know it's really good I notice that loads the people I know who are depressed and anxious the depression and anxiety focuses around their work we talked about this last time I was on a thing and but it's not okay people I know maybe they're unusual right so I started to look at the evidence-based Gallup did a really big study of people in the US and Europe see what do people feel about their work right 13% of people one three percent liked their work most of the time 63 percent of what they called sleep working you know like it you don't hate it you kind of tolerate it and 24% of people fucking hate and fear their jobs alright so you think about that that means 87% of people don't like the thing they're doing most of the time now that can't be far off what the figure was in the Soviet Union right that's a really extreme vigor and I don't like so I'm looking at this I'm thinking okay hit this bear some relationship to our mental health crisis right this thing that we don't like is spreading over more and more of our day the average person I think answers their first email I think it's 7:40 3 a.m. and leaves work at 7:15 p.m. right what and I learned this an amazing Australian social scientists are went to interview professor Michael Marmot who discovered the key factor that causes depression at work right if you go to it's not the only one a key factor if you go to work tomorrow and you are controlled so you have low or no control over your work you're much more likely to become depressed and anxious I think it relates to what we've been talking about all along people have psychological needs you need to feel you're good at something you lose film your life has meaning if you're controlled all the time you can't feel that right so when I first learned this I'm a burr first time I went to see professor Marmot misunderstanding the implications of this cuz I thought he was saying wrongly I thought he was saying okay got this 13% of elite people at the top like you and me get to have jobs we love and then you've got everyone else who's condemned to the shit round I thought about my family my brother is an uber driver my my dad was a bus driver my grandmother clean toilets on that way are we saying they're just condemned to these miserable lifes and explain to me it's not the work that makes you depressed right it's being controlled at work and there are solutions to that there are changes we can make right I went to interview this woman I called a Meredith Keough in Baltimore it's been part of this really interesting change and sometimes some people listening are gonna think I'm gonna say they should do this and they gonna think I can't do that it's right this is an argument something else so Meredith used to go to bed every Sunday night just sick with anxiety right she had an office job it wasn't the worst office job in the world as she would tell you she wasn't being bullied or harassed or anything but it was boring it was controlled couldn't just stand the thought this was gonna be the next 40 years of her life so one day with her husband Josh Meredith did this quite bold thing Josh her husband had been working in bike stores since he was a kid in Baltimore teenager and you know that's controlled work it's insecure you don't even have rights really and one day Josh and his colleagues in the bike store and they asked themselves what does our boss actually do okay they liked their boss he wasn't a bad person but they were like we seem to fix all the bikes and he seems to make all the money this doesn't seem like such a good deal to me right so they decided they were gonna set up a bike store that works on different principle right the place they work before was a corporation most people listening to your show working corporations you know how it's a very recent human invention you know how it works as an army the boss at the top is like the little dictator you got to obey Him or leave right and sometimes he's a nice dictator and sometimes he's Kim jong-un but you know you don't much say over that right um Josh and his colleagues decided to set up a bike store that works on a different principle it's not a corporation as a democratic cooperative so they don't have a boss they run the business together they take decisions about it together they have a meeting once every couple of weeks and practice they agree but you know sometimes they don't and then they vote they share the profits they share out the good tasks and the shitty tasks and one thing that was so interesting to me their business is called Baltimore bicycle works spending time with them totally in line with Professor marmots findings is you know giving them back control over their work made them much less unhappy depressed and anxious right and it's not like you know they quit their jobs fixing bikes and went off to become Beyonce's backing singers right they fix bikes before they fix bikes now differences now they've got control over their work right giving people back control over their work is a really powerful antidepressant now every corporation could be it could be a democratic cooperative right that's a big change in our society but it's yeah we've all lived through big changes in our society there's no reason and by the way it would be better for the economy study at Cornell University found democratic workplaces grow on average four times faster than non democratic workplaces because people are more committed they're bringing more of their energy and their life to it the the we've got to understand it goes back to why the addiction is so bad as we've got understand people who are showing these signs of distress depression anxiety addiction they're doing that not because they're crazy there are some biological factors that are not rational but mostly it's just actually we've built a society that's not good for them and we should be listening to that and respecting that and like the guy doctor in Vietnam said to me listen to your nausea it will tell us what's wrong with you we should be listening to their nausea and using it as a kind of fuel to change change the way we live in ways that will make or won't just make people who depressed and anxious and addicted better off everyone's life will be better off if they control their work more if you go through some of the other big solutions to depression anxiety that I write about in in loss connections now lasts connections is your most recent book yeah that's the one about depression sad about it yeah yeah they're both available them now last connections how did the two of them tie together so I wrote chasing the screen because of this addiction in my family and I go on this big journey all over the world to understand the drug war and I said a line in my I did a TED talk about it called everything you think you know about addiction is wrong and I said a line in that which is the opposite prediction is connection I said earlier in our conversation based on rat Park right and lots of people started saying to me well are you just saying it's social isolation right like loneliness and I very clearly in my moment know that I don't think that's the lesson of rat Park right I don't think that's just what's going on in rat pockets they don't have anything that makes life meaningful now rats are obviously much more much less complex than us right so I started thinking well what what is actually missing for people who are addicted depressed anxious what is driving this crisis so I think that question that people kept asking me I could see that Portugal in Switzerland had dealt with some problems of disconnection but you went quite rightly to the port question which what did Switzerland deal with right I couldn't quite I didn't quite as cuz I didn't quite understand when I was in Switzerland so I ended up again going on this big journey all over the world from a crazy mixture of places like an Amish village and Indiana because the Amish have low levels of depression to a lab in Baltimore where they're giving people psychedelics to your city and Brazil that banned advertising to see if that would make them feel better did it which bit banning advertising yeah yep so that's not be properly scientifically study but there is a science that tells as it should I can spray more that easy but so this is everyone knows that junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick right but there's this really interesting evidence that a kind of junk values have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick so for thousands of years philosophers have said if you think life is about money and status and how you look to other people in a kind of showing off way you're gonna feel like shit right it's not an exact quote from Confucius but that is the gist of what he said right but weirdly nobody had ever scientifically investigated this until an incredible guy I got to know called Professor Tim caso who's at Knox College and Illinois and professor Kassar made some really important breakthroughs in this so there's two ways everyone listening to your show has two kinds of motivation in their life right we're all a mixture of both so imagine if you play the piano in the morning because you love playing the piano it gives you joy right that would be what's called an intrinsic reason to play the piano right you're not doing it to get anything out of it that's just that's the thing you love right it sounds like jiu-jitsu was like that bu writing is like that for me everyone will have something in their life that just gives them joy as they do it right okay now imagine you played the piano not I don't know not because you love it but because your parents are massively pressuring you it's their dream for you or in a dive bar that you can't stand to pay the rent or could impress a woman right that would be what's called an extrinsic reason to play the piano right you're not doing it because that thing gives you joy you're doing it to get something further down the line right now obviously we're all an extra base but professor Kassar showed a couple of really interesting things firstly the more you are driven by extrinsic values the more your intrinsic values are starved the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious but quite significant amount he also showed as a culture as a society we have become much more driven by these junk values right we've become much more driven by think about how Instagram makes you feel sure right we've become much more driven by this hollow external sense of it think about something simple as I will a while ago I was at Elton John's last night in Caesars Palace right amazing thing to be at and about half the fucking room is is filming it on that isn't even looking at out and John they're just watching it through their phone now that's a small example but you can see what they're doing in order to display their life to invite Envy from other people they are not living their life no one wants to watch your shitty video about them John there's a hundreds of thousands of in videos about in John that are much better than yours right why are you doing that you're never gonna watch it either you're doing it to say to other people envy me right it doesn't make you feel good in that room actually makes you feel worse you're not enjoying the experience and it makes them feel like shit because it makes you're trying to invite Envy and your friends that's a small example of a much wider thing of a kind of junk values that have taken our minds so the reason that relates to what you're asking about Brazil is professor Castro has shown those two sets of solutions to these junk values taken over our minds one is it's like fucking air pollution you know get the messaging out of your head more eighteen month old children know what the McDonald's M means then know their own surname their own last name right from the moment it's Professor Casa put it to me from the moment we're born we're immersed in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life right none of your listeners will lie on their deathbeds and think about all the shit they bought and all the likes they got an Instagram they'll think about moments of meaning in connection that's like a banal obvious thing but we're constantly pushed to not think in those terms to think about show it off buy spend right these junk values have taken over our minds so part of the solution is just fucking get rid of most of this advertising get rid of most of this you know very tightly regulated but in doing so you limit Commerce you're limiting people's ability to sell things you're you're changing the current market that a lot of people don't have any problem with I know this is a heresy in the United States but well I'm limiting commercial speech is fine by me yeah I think it's fascinating I think it's a fascinating discussion but it is in the in a sense it's limiting free speech as well I mean and we have a real problem with that the problem with it is that as soon as you start to put any regulations at all and you know you say oh you shouldn't be allowed to advertising to advertise even if it's advertising honestly about a great product people will have real issues with this we already have advertising regulation you can't you can't pop an advert saying I've found the cure for cancer right that's what I'm saying yeah so this is I would argue this is a tightening so for example in London there was a big controversy a couple years but skinny billboards exactly says this it was a billboard of a impossibly hot women an impossibly hot man and the billboard said something like are you Beachbody ready right the clear implication being if you don't look like these people who you'll never fucking look like you're not ready to go to the beach and the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan just said this you can't do this right why you can stop advertise your body building that's so silly I mean this is it's not an unobtainable ideal you're looking at two examples of it okay they're real human beings yeah but that's like I mean I know why I mean I was not saying that you have to be that way but if you do want to look like that man and have that body it is a possible goal I mean it's not possible for the vast majority of people right like if they don't have the time or the effort it's not but very many people have radically changed their body I'm not saying no I'm not saying you should do it I thought it is a possible thing to do and if you're trying to sell Fitness wouldn't you sell an example of someone who's really good at it like if you're trying to sell a business course wouldn't you show a guy with a giant house and a Ferrari like this is the guy who's done really well at business look at his penthouse apartment overlooking Manhattan you wouldn't shut you wouldn't say well that's an impossible goal I'm gonna show you a person in a middle-class suburb because as good as you ever gonna get I think that's a fair point it's two things going on isn't there there's the freedom of people to market where they want to do and there's two nanny state issue there you have a problem with by saying that yeah these are impossible to achieve body goals we already have regulation of these things so and people don't call that a nanny state thing I think so just as I have regulation these thing but that that is you're not I mean this I don't think there's a good example what's a better example so professor caso said there's two sets of solutions these junk values problems there's get the contaminants out of the atmosphere sort of thing which he says is actually a weaker one than the second set of solutions is so how do we stop people being pumped full of bullshit junk values right educate them on what it's happening to them and make it less appealing well this is the second part and you've gone to what I think was most important part of the research professor Casa did she was working with a guy called Nathan Dungan and Nathan is a or entity Nathan is a financial adviser in Minneapolis and his job was to work with adults who found trouble budgeting and explained budgeting to them and help them do it right and he gets a call from a school I was kind of middle-class school wasn't super rich wasn't poor it was a middle class where they're having a problem that the kids at this school were becoming obsessed we're getting like the latest Nike sneakers or the latest iPhone or whatever it was and if their parents couldn't afford it the kids were really freaking out right so they say - Nathan would you come in and just explain budgeting to these kids right so anything goes in he tries to explain budgeting and quickly realizes these kids may give a shit about budgeting right there's something else going on here they are so obsessed with getting these things so with Professor Kassar he designs this program that led to a really interesting breakthrough and saying people can try at home right you don't have to do in this context so they've got and you can do it just as adults but they did it with parents and their teenagers right they come in it was once every couple of weeks for think four months and at first they just say the first meeting they had they just said write a list of everything you have got to have I didn't define that right and people of course say like a home a car whatever but quite quickly people would say Nike sneakers the parents would name expensive things and they got okay tell me how you would feel if you got these Nike sneakers right and very rarely I only any of them were like basketball players I need the jump or whatever if that's the right phrase it was very off almost immediately I'd be accepted by the group people would envy me right yeah these insights are just beneath the surface where they go who put that idea in your head where did you get that idea and of course everyone thinks they're smarter than the ad but giving people the ability just to see how hollow those junk values were that was the first part second part was much more interesting it took longer then I would have in future sessions they'd say well okay given that's not actually made you feel better what are moments in your life when you have that satisfied happy in a flow state what are things that are meaningful to you people you know whole range of things playing sports playing music reading whatever it was right and they said okay how could we build more of that into your life and less of these junk values how could you do more of this every week and just meeting we don't have these conversations in our culture by often just meeting once every couple of weeks and check-in emulator and go actually I managed to play a guitar for an hour every day I managed on Saturday to take my kid to the beach and we went or whatever you know stifled materialism what it led to Sosa's monitored by Professor Kassar it led to a significant shifts in people's values that they they had a significant decrease in junk values and a significant increase in in more meaningful intrinsic values and we know that that correlates with lower depression and anxiety over time the weird thing is I sometimes feel like with all my with both my books chasing screaming lost connections I sometimes feel like I'm giving people permission to know the thing they already know right right like I had this completely bizarre experience when the book first came out where I was being lost connections to depression when I was being interviewed by some American incipio here was and I talked about how loneliness causes depression right and the interview goes saying like well this is a very controversial theory I'm kind of sitting there and I thought how did we get to the point we're pointing out the most fuckin obvious thing you can imagine that if you're really lonely are much more likely to become veterans as controversial oh I think they're persons I think the reason it's controversial is because these biological stories which have some trait in them have dominated how one I was a teenager I went to it's only thought of as being exactly a little issue when I when I went to my doctor when I was a teenager and I was really depressed and I said I had this feeling like a pain was leaking out of me and I couldn't control it my doctor told me an entirely biological creature said there's just a problem with your brain here and all you need to do is drug yourself right and I dragged myself and I got some relief from the chemical antidepressants but it did not solve my depression and one of the reasons I wrote lost connection sis cuz after 13 years I've taken the maximum possible dose I was like well what's going wrong here there's something missing in this picture because I still feel depressed and every year that I've been alive I'm 40 depression and anxiety have increased in the United States in Britain and across the Western world there's something missing in this picture and I think the reason why that's controversial it seemed controversial that women even though to you and me is crazy to think it's controversial is because these biological stories which have some basis in reality have become the whole of the picture for a lot of people right I had a completely bizarre experience where you know Peter teal if you had him on your show no but I know I'm yes a pizza teal people who don't know is the founder of PayPal gazillion a right back to the Trump campaign I got an invitation from Peter teal just before it was after Trump had been elected but before he'd been inaugurated his people to go to a they were organizing a conference for app developers who were trying to develop apps to deal with depression anxiety and addiction and I'm a bit like I don't think apps are really the solution but I would add an excuse to go to San Francisco anyway so I go it's a day-long conference I didn't hit every speech but some really great scientists before what Thomason saw who's their former head of the National Institute of Health who's a hugely admirable man and I've seen their and I'm like all they're doing is looking at pictures of brain scans right if all you knew about depression and anxiety was this conference and addiction you would literally think they were just things that happen inside the brain yes and I'm like the last person up at I think this was designed this way maybe they did I'm seeing that I'm thinking what do I say to these people and I thought you know it's like I was trying to get metaphors you could have a conference about obesity that just looked at scans of people's stomachs right it wouldn't be untrue it wouldn't be bad science we had missed the whole fucking reason why they're fat right you could you could tell the plot of Romeo and Juliet using like Newtonian physics you could draw a diagram Romeo moves this way Juliet mister you won't understand a damn thing about why anyone does anything right it was such a deep misunderstanding or not misunderstanding such a partial truth right and I said to them so we were in San Francisco we were really near the Tenderloin which I'll see people will know as a place with a lot of chaotic Street addiction it's like let's not discuss this let's all just walk over to the Tenderloin sit with the first person with an addiction problem we may listen to their life story for half an hour and come back and tell me the main problem here is a malfunction of the amygdala it's a bizarre miss understand is there something going on because amygdalas yes is it important to understand that science of course right I'm strongly in favor of brain science I'm in favor of the science of understanding the stomach but it's a bizarre reduction of what human beings are to think that these are the main drivers of these crises right yes it's ridiculous yeah so I agree and we have to wrap this up we're worried after I really dread this joke can I just say that anyone who wants any more information if I can whip me if I don't say this anybody wants any more information about either of my books chasing the scream is WWH acing the scream calm you can listen to audio blows the people we've talked about you take a quiz to see how much you know about addiction and lost connections is WWE lost connections common there are audiobooks of both those books as well that you can get on those sites beautiful thank you very much really enjoy Joe Cheers thank you very much Thanks [Music]
