join my gang Joe Rogan podcast by night all day but you have a responsibility of greatness yeah there's there's very few people that ever get to the position that you not just were in when you won the title when you were the youngest ever UFC heavyweight or light heavyweight champion not just that the youngest ever UFC champion not not just that there's the there's also responsibility that comes with potential it's not it's not just like what you've done and you know it's what you could have done right you fought Alexander Gustafsson be honest about that how much did you train for that fight I trained I trained for the fight but but I I definitely I had this thing where I just felt invincible and did a lot of wild stuff leading up to the fight I definitely didn't give it my all as far as partying and sleeping Ryan really partying drinking stand up on it yeah yeah I mean when you win a fight like that where you weren't 100% does that sort of almost reinforce this idea that you could do anything you want and the man imagine if I trained next time if it's someone big I'll train like yeah so I have this I'm gonna share something what I'm not sure if I've ever shared this with anyone else before but I had this crazy thing that I would do where I would party one week before every fight and I did it throughout my whole career and and this was stupid but it was this mental crutch that I had I literally would one week before everybody I would go out and I will get blacked-out wasted and my logic was if this guy were to beat me somehow um I I can look myself in the mirror and say that well I lost because I got hammered the week before the fight so so it's a built-in safety net there's a safety net yeah exactly so I did it my whole career I would go out and get hammered one week before every fight have you ever worked with a sports psychologist no but now but now I don't my my ovince st. Preux fight was the first fight that I did not do that hey it was my worst performance so I said I don't think it was your worst performance I think you were very unjustly criticized for that fight because I think ovince st. Preux is a very tough guy he's very difficult fire is very strong he's got a brutal left kick he's athletic he moves well I believe it was a good performance but it was my worst performance see I think ovince st. Preux is a really tough guy it was a tough fight and you hadn't fought in a long time not a lot you were off for how long how many months 16 months or something oh yes that was over a year yeah there's a long time over a year a lot of stuff going yeah I mean you're fighting a guy who'd been pretty active and fought some good guys had a great victory of a Shogun and looked real good in a lot of his fights and wasn't up-and-comer the main thing about ovince that really bothered me was um he was he was the most well he was seasoned he actually has been fighting longer than I have no uh people don't realize that but he was just so um green and raw still like skill watch skill wise like I don't um I study everybody extensively and then I come up with their patterns I figure out the way they flinch I figure out their first favourite punch their second favorite punch the third their favorite combinations the way their setups to the takedowns when they clinch one side of the head is going to be a literally everything I know everything about every opponent what side they're gonna shoot whether it's gonna be a head inside his head outside what am I gonna do about that you know I figure out everything why they shoot what area of the cage they like to shoot everything um and with ovince st. Preux he doesn't know what he's gonna do he's so unorthodox unorthodox um you know he gets these random knockouts from these weird angles and he's just wings something he almost closes his eyes and next thing you know he's knocked somebody out you know so the scary thing about him was uh he's so unpredictable and so and I had a lot on the line um so I just said you know what this guy is he's in a shell pretty much the whole fight he was defensive the whole fight and I just thought I I closed through the fight and not really risk anything which I felt like I let myself down because normally I was just I mean normally when you get someone like that you just you know take him out you know you should actually just been able to take him out but I was content with winning and I think those I think that was one of the first fights where I actually just wanted to get the win get my money go back to what my actual goal which was DC instead of wanting to finish this guy like normal so I had to really question my I really questioned myself and why um why I was like that while I was considered with closed [Music]
