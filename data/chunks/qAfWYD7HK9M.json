believe in wireless he needs to see it boom and we're live what's up bridge how are you man spot baby what's for doing this I really appreciate it thank you for having me on the show man well I've read about you fellow Boston native and I've read about your Tesla journey and I was like this is a fucking interesting story this guy buys a broken Tesla right and then you couldn't get parts for it anywhere nope so what had happened to the car had been in an accident no so the I met the previous owner and he actually uh I think was during Hurricane sandy he thought that he goes wait a minute that water level seems low enough to me to drive through it and he decided driving through the water I think I got to like the almost like the b-pillar Ono's like where his neck is yeah Jesus Christ yeah I know right so he thought he could fight the water he lost obviously and it was just under water and I'm like you know what I gotta try this thing and so what it what would Tesla do in that situation if he wanted to bring it back to them they would have to rebuild the entire car they wouldn't even do it because at that point once anything liquid you know any kind of like water intrusion happens at an Eevee face right the whole car off insurance company is this like we're not gonna do it too risky too risky not worth there were you aware of the Fisker dilemma at hurricane sandy when they had the Fiskars that were parked at the it was like at a some sort of a dock right where they weren't a ship they all exploded yeah I'll burn the outer level rose right the water got into them they just went off and they fucking fire lost a whole bunch of them yeah look just a video of it you can watch the video of the fuck you blowing up so as the water level rose and the hurt you'd see the water breaching yeah well the water gets to the cars and when it gets to the cars they just start going off like fucking fuck oh yeah oh yeah I know that feeling supernovae I mean those are big ass fucking batteries just blowing that's not a joke that turns night in the day that's amazing how many thing left like 40 cars they lost a fuckload the company essentially went they went radio silent yeah for like a year that's a big al to take yeah take it yeah once we realized their car could just explode good what happened this kid this video pot I didn't look at the name of the video it popped up when I typed in the Fisker explosion but this was the explosion of the Con Ed plant oh that's a difference yeah but there is a video of the actual Fiskars exploding isn't that there's definitely pictures the second video won't be as exciting now yeah more information set us back an hour yeah so that's the cars that's what it was left to them Wow and they all fucking blew up it's a beautiful car though Fisker did a great job of making a car that looks really good right but you know what's funny I I think the back ends kind of ugly - I think the fun's like a fish the back kind of ugly and then actually if you're a driven one no I've been in one no when you drive one you'll be like ah I get why this didn't work out well Justin Bieber had a all-chrome one I remember that does he still have it though does he still have it he probably doesn't even know yeah he probably does know at this point yeah you know the mountain money that dude must have yeah he has no idea if he has that car no kiddin it's got tucked away somewhere but what do they drive like they're just it's not really great cars it's not really a driver's car yeah it's it's a 2+2 the the centre closest thing got closer to sorry that sorry it moves around if you want to take the the center console super wide it's a super awkward car to drive and it's not really good at really anything you know it doesn't styling wise I'm like yeah so you think that back-end looks ugly I don't think I get that much no no I like it but you know what's funny the chrome wasn't look that bad some guy got arrested in Germany they pulled him over and and compounded his car because he had a gold shiny rap on it alright was a too reflective or something I see now and there's a couple on Sun cycle yeah yeah they'll let you do that in America but in Germany they're like fuck off you know they're like harsh cold stoic folk you know they don't want you doing that and then I want you flexing too much over there yeah not too much now I bet they were like reluctantly or making cars like super flashy for like American markets and shit I think so too you know I wonder you think so I don't know I don't know yay I wonder how much of an influence it has like if you could leave them to themselves right what causes it yeah yeah because I feel like so much of it is like market-driven but they when it comes to like engineering and handling like god damn German cars haven't nailed they really do nail you know what the Americans are they were trying to sneak up and get close for a while but I mean like the Germans just a standard place with the Americans fuck with it is like have you ever driven a Camaro zl1 I have yeah there that's a preposterous car it's an awesome car it's amazing I have a Corvette zo6 ooh which year and zero six zero six which is you know the LS seven seven liter and it's an insane car by today's standards it only has like 505 horsepower funny but like it's not a lot it's a mean it's a mean car the car put you on your ass really quick man to a man our friend Taylor out there was telling us that they put a Tesla in ludicrous mode on a dyno and it had some insane number of torques right it's 900 pound pound foot of torque right and somewhere in the neighborhood of a thousand horsepower and the dyno could barely even read it a lot of times they even go that high in a lot of cases yeah they're insane cars man I'm telling you the Americans know how to do it now I think it's interesting that you know people don't realize this when they see a Tesla it's a fully American car yeah I didn't realize after just like oh it's probably something like you know German or like Japanese car but the cars 100% made here is this it right here Jamie yes is this the which model is this Peter D so that's the biggest one so what does it say he's on a Mustang Dino sound work little boys won't tell you this tesla up here and try to figure out how fast she goes I think I'll get it to jump yeah no I think it uh look at the PE it even almost jumps off the dyno at this point there's so much torque yeah it's a very very very powerful car but I've tried to describe it to people especially people didn't never driven an electric car I'm like it doesn't even seem real it seems like it violates physics so how do you like yours by the way I know I know that Elon Musk came here and bambbles did you into buying one pretty much mmm I love it I love it it's great isn't it it makes other cars seem stupid right that makes it and I love cars oh yeah I know you're a car guy I've loved them I love cars that don't even drive that fast I love mechanical engineer excellence I love them when people figure things out right now which is what brought me to you I love the fact that you took this car that was fucked up right and you refused to let it go you're like I'm gonna figure out how to fix this fucking thing how much did you buy it for what it was fifteen grand it just to be clear on something I'm not like some like evil genius or Brainiac this was driven by my cheapness I didn't want to spend the kind of money they were asking for one right so so basically this car was like 15 grand and the whole story started with my friend came over he actually had a job at Tesla and he's like buddy listen did these crazy cars I know you have a zo6 but this car is faster than that you're gonna love this thing I was like that Electric crap box I don't want anything to do with that right he brought the car over great-looking car I said alright you know take it for a drive or whatever and the thing was amazing right amazing car so I was in tech and I'm just like listen like you know what how much does this thing cost like I make decent money whatever I'll just throw some money at it he's like listen this will cost about 120 I said you know what have a nice day I'm like I'm not shit and then he so he left and I thought to myself like every night I was like you know I got to get my hands on one of these cars man I got to get one like you know sell a kidney whatever I sell a testicle whatever I can do and it I was searching online and you know at what happens is whenever our car gets messed up whenever a car gets as I say totaled in a way and it's a total loss an insurance company will take it and they'll kind of auction it off to like the highest bidder so I went to an auction site and I saw one for sale was like you know 50 Grainne they said it didn't run or drive and it was in the flood I'm just like 15 grand I could do that it's a piece of cake man threw some money at it whatever how hard can it be you stick it in a bag of rice tie it up he's like no your iPhone's right right your enemy it's like that sucks doing a bag of rice and you get to go so I figured all I'd do just buy more rice for this thing and I got it home and I was like you know what this is I got myself into some shit here because this it was a lot more work than I thought it was gonna be so you didn't sight unseen you know I didn't see and that's that's the way it is the most times they don't really let you on the auction Lots too often hmm so they took five photos of it it was some from the interior some from the side and I'm one under the the Franck and I was this like I could probably do this right no big deal so this begins this project which takes how long from to completion I think it took me about maybe six or seven months or so of straight work no so I have so I was working at the time and I I think only between the hours of like 7:00 p.m. and like 11:00 p.m. like every night choose and then weekends for a few hours until I figured it out yeah so goodbye social life pretty much yeah I was I was a hermit for that for those months and what I actually ended up doing was so I had the car right so I was freaking out because my wife was just like how much was that thing like yeah she had a divorce papers ready pretty much and oh is that it I know that was a different one oh fuck yeah that was really messed up now I I couldn't say how much did you get that one for that one was about bleep guess four grand I was 20 grand I paid for them total yeah I know but these could they're so valuable man really because you know why it's the the the battery technology and the motor technology that Tesla is using everyone's just dying for that stuff man so any any any req tehsil that you find minimum I know I'm spilling the secret sauce here minimum worth 15 grand even if it looks like that dead serious that's insane what that doesn't even have doors yeah why does nobody took I took the door I took the door but the battery pack is still in there right and the molds that you want and the motor was still in there - do people take those and put them in like old cars or anything yeah yeah it's a that's the new generation of hot rodders no because you saw something like that about a Mustang it's like a 65 66 Mustang that was electric but I didn't know what train it used so so you know how they get you're a gearhead you know this the the LS swap they put literally an LS into everything yeah I have a lance grand cruiser toyota landcruiser with one LS swap shit so that's a new LS swap basically so the Tesla motor is the new LS wat everyone is swapping a Tesla motor into you know Volkswagen bugs into out ease into into Porsches into everything well I know they people are doing LS swaps into 911s and Porsche people are losing their fucking minds I'm not taking old air-cooled cars yeah which are really notoriously difficult to get to a high horsepower exactly cuz those air-cooled cars like you can only get them like around 400 plus horse brothers that's not crumbling unless your singer right well they've got that insanely engineered new one what does that call Oh either way it's gonna cost you like you know damn near a hundred thousand dollars yeah something dynamic lightweight something it's the most gorgeous looking of those portions of ever seen Everest languages and they built that one up to 500 plus horsepower right Hamid how much does it cost though that's the thing fucking million million sick yeah you know that's a giant house man that's a house with land yeah you might have a little actually that's not true in LA that's not a house no Ellen's not the real world what is that 67 Mustang needs Tesla AVR Motors all-electric muscle car holy fuck that's a 68 that's a good-looking - that's one of the best-looking rear ends of any car ever an awesome looking car fuck that looks incredible 2.20 60 there you go what the fuck so that's the new that's new it's so there's it's gonna cost you a ton of a mark that yeah it's gonna cost you a ton of money to recreate that same look you know that's rice green - that's so weird though to not shift a muscle car yeah I'm think I'm out I'm out I'm backing out I'm backing out but you love your tough so Doug if that but it doesn't look like that that would be a super ultra poser right the door those come out like a test oh wait that's a test door handle fuck off next no no no there's a company that does it's a company called ravallo G that makes old like 1966 to like 68 Mustangs but they do it with all new parts right and modern technical mod pretty much not though because it's a new car there they buy the fool that's a that's actually a brand new car that's never existed oh really yeah the ground-up ground-up built they buy the whole you know because it's I think it's called a unibody construction is that what it is there's something the way that these Mustangs are constructed the bodies built into the frame and they buy this company sells them like completed versions of the body kit that are perfect with perfect tolerances right so like that like it's going like that's one there's 67 Shelby gt500 what's the pricing oh wow stupid expect yeah yeah it's not gonna work it's like two Tesla's yeah pretty much yeah but they're dope it's dope is fuck if you look at like what it looks like go down see some pictures of it Jamie you'd get a better a better sense of it but this guy's that's great I'm meticulous yeah this company is very meticulous I've been following their stuff for quite a while what they do is really incredible that's an all met all-new sheetmetal I can have any things new but it has skilar brakes and it has the modern coyote Mustang engine right five oh yeah so it's a 460 horsepower engine and these old badass muscle cars and that one's the gt500 that was actually supercharged that is a 600 horsepower engine it's dope they're fucking gorgeous they're gorgeous cars they're really pretty so what would you think about someone dropping an electric motor on one of these things see I love it look I love I love people doing crazy shit but it's not for me yeah I need a shift if I'm driving that thing I got to pretend I'm Queen Manson thing so what do you think about the new you seen the new Tesla Roadster right gorgeous what do you think I love doesn't yeah but it's theirs from the bottom up you know I'm saying it's like I don't mind not shifting in it that thing seems like it's gonna literally punch a hole through space I think so too man I think so too I think they're looking at it like 0 to 60 in like one point something second I think it's one nine that's what they're saying it's insane that's bizarre I know it's crazy when you feel it in the p100 demine like everybody that I get in the car and I stomp on the gas they're like they can't believe it yeah they can't believe it these are around you it's like it's like vampires being around people people they just leap to the top of buildings that walk it around and regular until that shit goes down yeah no they're they're absolutely amazing cars man and I think that's that's what the main reason why I was like I gotta get one of these man so what what was the struggle initial struggle you have the car you take it apart and what did you see rights pretty much I was kind of taking my time because I knew there was a point where I couldn't fix the damn thing and I'm just kind of wasting everyone's time wisely hey is this thing almost done I was like yeah babe don't worry about it we're good don't worry your money's safe and so there's a certain point where I took everything apart and I was like all right cool I found a dead fish in the back of the car so actually you know what the turning point this whole thing was that the turning point was I I realized it was salt water and not fresh so you know what salt water does to stuff right so it just it just kills everything so 90% of the car was kind of toast and I said to myself all right I'm gonna call Tesla you know buy a motor buy a battery pack I'll be good you know I mean maybe I'll spend like 20 grand for a battery and like maybe 10 for a motor I'll be kneeling for 40 it's still cheaper than 100 right right so so I called them up and you know they were like hey you know how's it going man I was like hey you know what crazy thing happened right so I bought this test was underwater and I need like a couple of things a battery and you like a motor you know just just throw me those things it's fine they're like what we're not gonna sell it to Sogo why not cuz you have no capability of fixing the car yourself you know you're gonna get yourself killed it's not gonna work you know give me your VIN number I gave him the VIN number they're like no that cars listed as Salvage that thing was underwater we're not gonna help you and they just up the phone oh yeah so like here's the crazy part too is that they know you know I'm putting a conspiracy theorist hat on they know where every single car is they know what it's doing they know if the airbags went off they know if you farted in the front seat they know everything about these cars right so pretty much when you give him the VIN number you know the cars are always connected back to the mothership to give you the status in the car so they know that's going on so you know if you try to hide from you just you just can't do it mm-hmm so so I had the I had the car and I said to myself you know what this isn't gonna work I got to figure something out so what I did basically I bought another car for 15 grand and I was like I got to swap this stuff over so ice off Theresa the other one that you bought for 15 grand everything worked well he wasn't a front-end collision okay it wasn't a hard front-end collision and so a frame was bent or something frame was bent the thing was toast and I just took all the electronics from one of the other how do you check to make sure that everything isn't damaged when that's a good thing a lot of the wiring harnesses were cut right in in the front end collision car but the interesting part was that in the flooded car the wiring harnesses were still good for the most part in the front really so what I did was I mean meaning not broken or torn or bent connectors I just took those connectors off and actually cleaned them because I couldn't get parts you know from Tesla I took like the wet wiring harnesses that were all corroded pulled them out got like you know a q-tip toothbrush and all that stuff when he cleaning them with so I clean them with um with baking speaking soda and like a wire brush and like I got a toothpick to to really get in there and like cleaning the contacts and stuff mmm I just rinsed him out with water by this time your wife is probably like what she's pissed so far she goes I noticed we're missing $30,000 from our bank account two cars that don't work exactly to present don't work you know and thirds of $30,000 missing from her bank account like what's going on here so it was just it was painstaking but eventually you know I got the job done then so so what I ended up doing was so 30 grand right right I told my friends hey listen you know I'm in a mess here I'm rebuilding a tough son they're just like you know you're an idiot you're not gonna figure this out like no one's doing that this was this was years ago this is when the cars were still kind of coming on to the scene and they weren't as popular as they are now and like you can't fix that like you're an idiot you can't do that I've seen your work and so yeah so after a while you know I I took all the parts from one the other got one running and then the parts I didn't need anymore like the the the the old battery pack and some of the action so there were some parts of the battery that were still good so I actually sold those parts like online and on eBay and stuff like that and then I sold like the motor he had water in it someone got gave me five grand for a motor that had water in it that's how valuable these parts are Wow so why was he planning on doing the same thing or cleaning it out I have no idea to this day I don't know so I think he had in the same situation I think he brought it home to his wife and so after all that's all the parts I ended up getting the car have now for about six grand so you take the engine and is that one of the four-wheel-drive ones the ones you have this was just a rear-wheel drive one I need so it has just the rear as in the single motor yep one engine and so you take those out you put it all back in you replace the wires and then it's good to go what about the computer what about like oh gosh so pretty much the the computer thing was interesting because there was so I called Tesla again alright I was like hey buddy like this car is like 99% of the way there do you know do they know who you are at this point they still don't know who I am nor do they care they probably don't care who I am but but did you say hey man remember you hung up on me yeah hey yeah right doesn't work didn't work right so the tough part was I had to summer I had no I had no key for the car oh so I was like hey I need a key you know I mean like help me out here you keep and they were like what are you the same idiot that calm like yeah I need the key they're like we can't as I stated before we can't help you because you know this this is a salvage car so you're on your own so what I did was I actually in the in the GPS screen because the screen turned on the the guy still had the home location so I pushed home on the GPS screen found the guys address right this is creepy it gets creepy right follow the guys address and I was like hey you know can we I call them up I was like hey did you own like a white Tesla by chance and he's like who is that yeah I own one I was like yeah so I bought it and I need the key do you have the key to the car and he's like no I don't have that like what do you call me for like I don't understand like well I'm rebuilding it I'm putting the electronics from your car into another and and yeah I want to figure it out he's like you know what I can't help you don't have the key and I was like damn it sucks you know cuz you know I have a family and stuff and you know given the substrate like you know he could really look for and help me out I'd be good and we started talking about general topics and he's like you know you know I know you're a car guy that's awesome I had a head of zo6 once I know so hey I have a zo6 too and he's like yeah it was it was LeMans blue and I was like hey mines LeMans blue and he's like what year is it I was like it's a no.6 he goes I sold that same car or car like it like two years ago to a guy in Florida I was like I bought the car from a guy in Florida so we started bonding so it turns out I actually owned his old zo6 that's insane yeah it's crazy right what are the odds the two human beings on the planet you own both of the scars cause of his guys cars it was insane so he's like listen he goes it awesome you know I'll see if I could I'll see if I could find you know the key friends with that dude no no we never talked again after seems like you should know here's the reason why so hey right well one wanted was super creepy for me to call the guy right number two when I went you know I went kind of silent for a week he called me back and said buddy I found the key oh I found the key to the car I was like awesome dude like you're fantastic I'm gonna send you an envelope to your address so you could kind of you know give me the key he's like yeah yeah great great great how about like 600 bucks and I was like broheim we just bonded over the fact that I owned both your cars what are you doing to me here yeah Sakhi and remember like you know to a lot of people that's nothing but like to me like I was having cheapest crappy 600 bucks yeah that's a bit much a lot of money and I was like hey I was like you didn't the key didn't exist to you as if ik a week ago but now they know you can make money from it like now you watch I turn bucks and he's just like you know started talking again and he goes how about 400 bucks and I was like you know what guy just just give you the money take the damn money and yeah right this faculty right twice I saw I sold my soul pretty much yeah he did yeah he's got blood money no but I shouldn't have I feel like I was I shouldn't have taken it I would have rubbed that money on my ball bro make sure you sniff that I mean it's like I get he's just being a dirtbag right but know that you got the key and it's it's that's what it is and then the cars running and driving today so as soon as you got the key you're good do you have one key or two just one oh if I lose that I'm screwed can you make it this is a phone were like your app does it work on the car nope damn no that's big the app to the page yeah always go and get the car to come to you you can summon and come you park like like literally than drench on each side right that's that that's the problem is that I feel like with with the task looks I have a Model X now MMS UV now and it's the ultimate flex Tiffany Haddish had one and she had it in the parking lot the Comedy Store and she had it dancing really well Manette doors kind of go up and down this up to the music it just out in front of the car dance in their film with it it was a hilarious moment and and it's funny because I I found myself I feel like this cars ruined me as a person right like I'm not typically like pretty humble person but like having like a Tesla the fact that you could push a button and the car comes to you it's like the biggest like it's a douchebag move because honestly we were do we were like getting into our cars like peasants for years yep you know and one day I was at the gym and I was looking at my car from you know from you know from a distance and I was like you know what I really don't feel like walking all the way to my car today how far it was probably like the distance from you to me it wasn't mean that far as like it was I can last in between us and I was like you know what come to Daddy come to Daddy push the button the card is backed out everyone's like oh that car is driving itself I was like yeah that's me push the button open the door got in I just drove off yeah when I take it and I put it in auto drive that's when it really freaks me out yeah do you use that often the skin - yeah yeah it scares me it scares me but I keep my hands right there but it right haven't tried to kill you yet no okay there's no calming I always keep my hand there I always keep my hair in there but I'm I'm always a but the one thing I'm concerned with is that I think I'm lowering my guard yes absolutely I'm letting the car do too much have so little sense when you drive like one of the reasons for road rage is when we're driving around we don't know who the fuck's next to us and we're going very fast and it requires like the ability to think really quickly so your brain is in a heightened state of awareness and then someone does something stupid like that's me the fucker right asshole yeah range me exactly that's where the rage comes from um but it it lightens that almost maybe too much because I think you do need to be what she's got right into my lane right I think you do need to be at least aware that some shit can happen at any moment when cars are flying by you gonna be pleased so you don't take your hands fully off drive itself really yeah I just put my hand on it I don't take my hands fully off but if you do you can only do it for so long it'll start to warn not to complain like hey what's going on here buddy but apparently some dudes tried they say that didn't work I talked to one of those dudes who did that that experiment apparently that experiment ever the orange yeah the orange I think I might work man I think what does work better is like they said I like a lightweight like if you take like a like a lightweight and put it on like a rubber band you hang it there wasn't you know what's funny there was a guy that was selling that you hear about that he was selling like it looked like a it was like a business legal weight that went around the steering wheel and it actually had the perfect mana weight balance to make you think that your hand was still on the wheel Brian people were buying it there it is and Tesla autoplay buddy how buddy yes mag relaunches as a phone mount yeah so then so so much so he had that right he was selling it and it was like 300 bucks and then you know they were like you that's illegal you can't do that you're bypassing like a safety device of the car so then what he did was he came back again with the Vengeance it made it a phone mount he's clever he's clever yeah yeah that's a smart move although I'm not sure I support it yeah I don't think I do either that's kind of that's a little bit much don't think it's ready for that yeah it weirds me out it weirds me out because the other thing is the other people are not going with auto drive so you around you're going Auto Drive and all these other people are just driving yeah and I think when everyone's driving together you kind of in tune with each other all this assholes trying to go really fast yeah right get the fucking over to my right let me pass this guy you're aware when you're just when you're Auto driving it's like you're like a like a assist right in this movie yeah ecosystem yeah thinking right all these people be calculating each other but it's probably ultimately like if you talk to Elon he says it's way safer and that's the future I hundred percent agree them absolutely obviously hates fun yeah don't forget right Elon could talk all the shit he wants remember he had a McLaren f1 yes he did I still has a Jaguar e-type one of those really old ones like a 69 with the right shark no long good yeah yeah so he at heart he knows the deal yeah I mean buddy he didn't make that car that fast for a practicality now it makes no sense it's the same reason he made a fuckin blowtorch exactly right right it's a silly person like it's not a flamethrower we know that it's not definitely he's a silly super genius so it is what do you think and all the best ways yes right only good ways I'd never say anything bad about him of the guy so so glad he's alive I am I'm glad he's a real thing no honestly and I heard and agree I get a lot of crap from people online sitting like I'm an Elon Musk hater I'm a Tesla hater I could be critical sometimes you know what I mean but it's like the guys the guys a damn genius he's a damn genius damn genius and critical is important guys like you are important it's very important to hear what other people think if it's reasoned and intelligent right like it helps you even if you don't like hearing it alright so I got to keep it means he's a genius but sometimes you got to keep the company in check the cars are phenomenal cars they're phenomenal cars and they weren't always no absolutely not yeah and what they were when they first came out like were you aware of the whole thing with top gear yes that was crazy yeah they were being Shady yeah super shady yeah they were running there Ted the car died they wanted to bash the car but they could but like for stuff like that like I'll stick up and say yo hey yeah thank you doing that and he got pissed he loves it that's his baby yeah he sues me but I think he lost because I think the way their show is structured that was it's yes it's entertainment yes incredibly damaging to a little company because it made it look like I don't know why they did that there's a couple things that they the top gear did I was like why would you do that right that would like sound up some people remember they their focus is on petrol or a gas-powered cars like when an Eevee comes along and it's actually pretty damn good in a lot of cases people just like shit yeah I let this thing win especially back back in the day when that was going on right that was a long time ago that was in 2012 I think yeah 2013 yeah so you get the key from this guy's car right you can't use the app right so you you have to rely on the software in the state that it's at there's no software updates no so hayslett is a long story so get the car going everything's great in order to get mask masked from the Tesla system so there's a certain system that the Tesla Nova all their cars are right and they could disable whatever they want they could you really want this you know exactly so I had to reach out to like this Tesla black hat hacker pretty much oh jesus you know go to the dark with had to go to the deep dark web and and he was able to mask tussah from seeing the car which is why I can't have a Tesla app oh so he masked that so he got into the actual software itself into the actual software itself guy's a genius West one to zero exactly took the bit and then it was able to be the car could supercharge the car could do everything Wow and a car gets updates - it's great oh it does it does get updates yeah and Tesla doesn't know it's getting updates no you know it's funny you shouldn't say this yeah I'm just kidding now they they they know the deal and here's a problem with that is that people love these cars a lot man if you love these cars you know hence me I'm picking the car if I had dirty lake yeah I mean it fixing this thing here I mean so it's it's a lot of the times it's in their best interest I believe to help people out a little bit yeah but but know the things that people go through for these cars is insane man people just didn't love them my my take on it is that what they have is this ingenious company with this mad genius scientist who's running it who does a million other things at the same time right and they don't have enough people to deal with someone like you they probably just don't they don't have a section of the company to deal with someone like you remember when he was working when he was they were trying to put out the model three and he was working 16 hours a day and sleeping on the floor like a tree yeah pretty much shit that don't make any sense yeah like what the people know it's funny people it doesn't make any sense but people love the company of this guy so Cigna that when he was working 16 hours a day and he was sleeping on the floor in the factory right you know it was a big sob story a billion years to be in the photo factory a bunch of Tesla owners rallied together and they purchased a couch for him to sleep on like tens of thousands of dollars what kind of couches I lost in a nice-ass count yeah be the way like they they rallied when they purchase a couch for him and like I made a video I didn't I said to myself you know what this guy's a billionaire yeah b-but the fact that everyone rallied together to help this guy the show that their support yeah it's good people are a hands over fist for this company there are heels it reminds me of Apple today haha you know I remember there was a guy god bless his heart who was one of the editors on Newsradio the sitcom that I was on in the 90s and he was such an applehead mm-hmm that he was like he was talking about it like it was a sports team he was talking about it well I think we're really gonna get those BC Geico Dean when they had MacBooks come out yeah I keep but he really said something to that all along those lines I think we're really gonna pull ahead like who's we we yeah they were on this weird little tribe Mac and this is the same thing but you know what Pitts you know picture the Apple fanboys mmm-hmm the Tesla fanboys times ten yeah they live in it so I can Apple you live in its no I'm Stan gonna work it is not because Apple has the technology aspect of it like it's great you know Androids socks I have an Apple phone okay perfect perfect but for Tesla's you're talking about technology see other tech nerds you're talking about sustainability as well for the green people grease you have the tech and the green people mint and once they join forces so the scariest force on the earth right it isn't like war like guns and stuff it's actually Mac owning Tesla vegan owner the scariest thing in the way really discoursing in the world because they'll tell you what about at a party oh well it cornered you get corner but like they it in its and I've struggled with that in a lot of cases because whenever I say something remotely negative about tassel like hey I think Tesla could do a better job here they're just like you're just a gas head I know you own a zo6 you work for big what someone acutely working for big oil oh you do yeah what you do how do you work for peak oil bro what does that mean you work for big oil yeah you well you're a part of the Illuminati yeah pretty much that's like I just yeah you work for big oil big what is it what does that mean how much could they pay you to first of all like before people would realize it all sudden you're walking around with like diamond chain mansion right he's still fixing cars yeah you know I got another thing all right right I'm making billions for big oil yeah buy a gas car go to shell shells great I don't understand how people think that that whole Schill thing works do you just get like a monthly check I don't understand like hey rich say something negative about us everyone swim I'll give you a check for you gotta get that big oil check yes suspect that what it is is similar to what my friend who was really addicted to Apple yeah I think you just get on your tribe and that's my thing I'm all about Apple and as you can't windows are bolt it's bullshit when Rose Bowl shoe what you want to play what are you gonna fuck with the config files honey get in there and then use Doss loser but it's interesting because people like us are very different because we could appreciate both yeah you have a phenomenal collection of cars thank you and and then you threw a Tesla in there but you love both yeah if you love the driving you love the driving aspect of it of your Porsche you know you love you know the the silence and the the zero to sixty of your Tesla to so if you could we could be part of both camps but a lot of cases they're only it's camp Tesla and if you're not with us you're against us silly yeah I have a Windows laptop and I have an Apple laptop oh you do yeah that boat really yeah you know why why cuz Windows has more options and when you have more options you get better configurations you get better keyboards right like I have a Lenovo ThinkPad oh look at you dude they're the shit yeah it's way better to write on right like the tactile feedback and the travel distance and the keys is so much longer right just know where you're typing write it for me as a writer when I'm writing like I'm writing standing for something that it requires less thinking because my fingers just find the keys easier I mean like 10% plus easier it's a big day and and I bought an older Apple laptop - I bought a 2015 a refurbished one because their keyboards were superior yes the new ones are so low-profile it's the shittiest fucking keyboard of any computer that you could buy today is a new MacBook Pro and they got busted for that because now because their keyboards are so shitty if it take them back now yeah they didn't recalls in the keyboard well they do have a new patent they put out for a variable height keyboard where the key travel will vary and the key resistance will very interesting yeah there's a new patent that they filed for it doesn't necessarily mean they even have the technology for it right that's how expensive I don't know why well I mean if it's something you could press with a button that just raises the keys up that would be like a solution because if you think about the flatness of the key the ideas they want to keep a low profile to this laptop all right make it thin and sexy like fucking whatever yeah I don't have the thing pad with me but I have a the x1 carbon it's a nice nothing right and the battery life is excellent six months dude it's it's a fucking great laptop alright so the apples just they're just only Apple and the problem with that one company only selling laptops is you just don't have enough variety now there's not enough people that are offering challenges to it they don't have any challenges in fact their biggest challenge is the huawei mate book Huawei basically stole their their idea and but made it way better right they made oh I see what you guys are doing you guys are fucking up we're gonna make it with better keys right we're gonna have no bezels on the side of the screen and you know everyone's concerned about security well we're just gonna have the webcam pop up as a key have you seen them no I have it just dope that sounds the next-level shit I want to see you Huawei am I saying that right that's it come on bro oh that's dope as fuck look no bezels no bezels no no room for the webcam yeah and it has great keyboard travel - I think it's like 1.5 millimeter key travel which is if you're a person writes all the time yeah I need to get my thoughts out I'm stupid you're right yeah stand up yeah and I just write things and I extract stand-up from them and alright but when I write I I don't need to be fucking with the keys man so why do you use your Mac then you list all these pros about the about the PC but why do you because I'd like to have both I use that when I travel because I don't write as much when I travel but I like to watch movies look at that yeah pops up right how about that that's f6 it looks white up you know son that's pretty wild because but the biggest thing is like when you're you you probably have like a Skype meetings or whatever Google Hangouts the worst thing in the world is like the camera turning on automatically that's a lie right there that image is a lie there's not what if there's no what yeah no that's okay that's not even the right viewpoint yeah that's ridiculous that good looking you yeah she's pretty hot yeah yeah but it does pop up man that's in-state so that's that's a thing because if there's like a Mac yep it looks just like a Mac except is more key travel right more comfortable and that upper right hand corner that power button i was also a fingerprint reader oh fuck it i'm gonna buy one right now the shit I would I would use one but you don't have one no why don't I have a little Nova yeah yeah that's great to ever that mean this is just there it's all just better options the only difference is Windows is not as good as Mac OS but it's not that much worse now it's really not it's pretty fucking close Windows 10 it's pretty fucking good and see what this runs what is they're running Windows or something it's Windows Windows yeah Windows Windows 10 yeah she's not Android no it would have to be one of those Chromebooks where I was gonna run Android which apparently is very good book designs are really nice - very nice and you can get one super cheap right and the battery lasts like three months yes forever and if you're just putting documents you put them in your Google Docs in the cloud you pull it up instantaneously drive no it's great yeah but why wait we heard company man like I don't know what I feel about I'm buying into all this government propaganda about the Chinese yeah spying on us yeah it's deafening well dude I've had my credit card stolen my number stolen three times this year Wow it's never happened to me yeah well I think I'm on money you have the more stuff you get still maybe yeah people find out its annoying though like I got a a charge but I have an app on my phone that shows me to charge and it was during a podcast well I'm like well that definitely wasn't me yeah no definitely get you with like $10 one so cool $3 $10 to test the waters but then they start quad microphones accurately pick up sound from four meters away with the wah wait but it's a real spy yeah they don't know what they're not telling you is the microphones are always active oh yeah just like your phone they're always listening you know the government bro translate also pull upp people oh great my nervous off translator you hear about the new TVs you hear about the the LG TVs that was spying on constantly listening yeah an arbor sation wonderful and they told you if you want to have a private confidential conversation don't have it in front of TV what they were basically saying would you bang your wife in front of TV yeah do they have cameras on them oh yeah they have cameras yeah I think it lifestreams that I think is like a sex mode after a while everyone's just gonna watch everybody do everything I really I really think within a hundred years that's gonna be the case that's the case now man I think it's got blockers and like you know I'm on YouTube you know that goes thing everyone wants to see whoa what are you doing now what are you driving out right and get a video last week he was going on what're you doing now yeah you know it's it's but what we accept is way different than what our parents accepted or with their parents accepted and I think what our children accept was gonna be way different and then what their children accepts can be we're like two three generations from it just being ridiculous where there's no privacy how do you distance yourself because you're a public figure right how do you distance yourself like where do you draw the line for privacy I guess you could say the real problem was when you're eating man when people like come up to you while you have I'll have a kid in my lap and I'll be eating food and talking to the kid and someone will literally come up to me and try to take a picture really me ask me to take a picture with me I'm like come on man we're all out eating at a restaurant all right this is like you know just say hi yeah say hi man and I always tell people when I'm done I'm leaving I'll take a picture with you but you can't you can't just interrupt dinner but it's just it's just people think like if they don't get a picture with you right now you get it right now now-now-now fucking okay I'm going into my nerd school right they don't care I mean and then they'll say hey that's the price you pay for being famous well though it's like nah that's not true that's it's crazy look this is the deal the deal is someone provides something that you enjoy whether it's stand-up or thing and and I appreciate that you enjoy it right but that's our exchange all the other stuff I don't anything else it's like meeting me at a restaurant and shit when I when I'm eating with my kid yeah like come on man that's the you're asking for too much this is ridiculous now the question for you what kind of restaurants do you eat at where people feel need to come off to do like your regular a high-end right like Applebee's and stuff like that's right places normal normal spots it's not it's not normal that someone does that most people are super respectful right it all it takes is one out of a hundred true and the night just gets weird I am and most people don't most people are cool but it's every now and then people just have this idea that somehow or another you have to if you are a famous person you have to abandon everything right nothing just to press the other thing that you're not a person anymore right you're like a famous person like it's like the regular rules don't apply in someone don't apply right like you would never just barge in on a regular person that you didn't know no but if it's a regular famous person people they don't give a fuck oh this is fine whatever station right where you're you and your friend are both crying and talk about some of the died I don't give a fuck hey man I'm sorry bro I get that picture yeah damn I get that picture bro so what's the weirdest interaction you've had with someone it's mostly just that kind of stuff the weirdest shit is like people that tell me that they're gonna give me secrets like UFO type stuff yeah Bigfoot and I know where the bases are like really those motherfuckers yes get Soze I've had a few of those restaurants it just usually a comedy shows yeah yeah usually a comedy shows do you ever walk down the street that's the poor thing I just asked you me cuz like when you're always either driving you're going somewhere you ever go for a casual walk around why do I walk my dog right mm-hmm yeah I don't walk around LA nobody nobody walks now just like pockets of walking in LA okay so time out real quick okay a real quicker story with time with rich so I landed right and get off you know Boston the deal Boston yeah so I landed and you know I but II of mine picking up from the airport and I got to where I was staying on stay in the Mission District like look at all the Sun first of all who was freaking great the Sun was awesome right I was oh my gosh so gray skies and then I look down literally homeless people and everywhere and what is going on with that like it just it blew my mind because it literally I did so I went to the gym in the morning and I was like it's like at 7:00 a.m. and I saw probably just as many homeless people living in tents next to buildings as there were people commuting to work yeah like thousand it it's it's amazing have you been a Skid Row yet no God you scared you got to go you should go while you're here because it's like the Grand Canyon it's like the Grand Canyon homeless people why would I want to go there because just you can't believe that it's like did you watch the Battle of Winterfell Game of Thrones no don't tell no boiler no I won't give any spoiler alerts I'll have to have a better okay yeah here's a better analogy did you ever see I am Legend yes okay remember when all the fucking crazy zombies go running at once yeah that's what it's like you serious I'm telling you you can't believe the volume doesn't someone even like because in Boston listen they freeze to death and die exactly so no in Boston we we hide our homeless people we have like shelters and stuff we hide them for the most part you know Downtown Crossing area Park Street whatever there let's just junkies that like have that leave the whole gangster lean they just leaned close their eyes and right right right and then we you know it gets cold they scatter I don't know where they go but you don't really see them that much you know I'm not being rude like I don't - you know it's right but like in safer they're in your face yeah like you I if San Francisco's the craziest it's it was insane so like honestly and then of my friends he said listen you know come to my house you know whatever we're gonna hang out for a bit school no problem went to his house small place not badly thousand square feet like pretty nice he goes yeah you know I'm kind of you know things are a little tough can I get okay borrow some some money like borrow money from me what he talkin about dude this is you living you know you're doing okay he's like yeah living paycheck-to-paycheck I was like what are you talking about I'm like this is a this is like a you know get a decent place the house we were in was a 1.6 million dollar house and it was this big and I'm like service is expensive and then another foreign mind said listen hey come to my house you know and I Pope to the house it's a warehouse like you live in a warehouse that's actually cool you can live like blade it's it's really Snipes lives the Christmas table for say it's he had the fucking charger the Dodge Charger but it sounds cool when you have kids living in a warehouse and that's that no so so that's the thing is that like it's a common thing I've noticed for people to live in either abandoned buildings warehouses and cars yeah you know people that live in cars and the amount of smashed windows that I've seen here it's I couldn't believe it well most of those people living in cars are actually stand-up comedian everybody has a fucking story like so many comics come here and you know when they first settle in they live in their car that's super normal yeah that's that's it just crazy like more like 10 of my friends really lived in their car they live in cars they're used to at least and then got an apartment bigger time that's an issue we're having around here we're having around here with these people that live in caravans they live in these mobile homes Thanks I've seen them yes there's like if you drive around this community go down certain streets and you just see these momentum caravans yeah yeah and they have like like towels over the windows and I saw a meth inside yeah yeah these are dirty people some of these fuckers I don't so how come so again in Boston we just kind of say hey there's no likely no loitering well they're kicking people out now because businesses are complaining because there was one business where this guy had parked his Caravan right in front of it that's where a buddy mind works and this dude had laid out his like a blanket on their front lawn and was sunning himself in Cara's Caravan so the front of his building became this guy's lawn so this guy in this care of was literally using that they were sharing grass right so he's got this multimillion-dollar building and he's sharing it with a homeless guy right who's cooking meth or I don't know if it's meth but some white noxious right yeah smoke the crack yeah it's I couldn't so it's it was different from me the weather is awesome but like that was a big thing and I feel like as I'm walking around more if I see a large standing body of water I'm like there's a homeless guy live in there too the people just everywhere they're everywhere I'm telling you what you saw is nothing well you got to go to skid row it's what is this is that Skid Row get rental Maps it's good right okay snooping around they must have cleaned it up yeah yeah that ain't shit let me tell you something man it's look at that look at all that to the right to the left it's fucking gross so how do people have businesses there they don't or they just deal with it they just deal with it most of them most those people they just put all like gates and locks and shit so whether what's on Skid Row plays that's why you where you just were Jamie we just work well it's a lot of warehouses and shit and but the interesting thing is this area is getting air quotes gentrified hmm so this is where a lot of businesses are going now they're opening up apartment buildings right and a buddy of mine has lived there my friend Magnus Magnus Walker he's a famous car guy too I don't know if you know who he is he's got all these videos of Porsches all he rebuilt old Porsches he's got this crazy dreadlocks and a beard and crazy Englishman but he's been living down there forever he and he has this warehouse where he has it set up where you know his living space is one one part of the warehouse then down below yeah these cars right and he has it all set up but if you drive down some of these roads you'll see like these super expensive apartment buildings that are going up now and then a block over you see these homeless encampment right and people think it's like cute to be around like all this what dirt what is this there we go nice so that's someone's apartment what's going on here yeah they just set up tents and then the cops kick them out and they just come back and they move and then they come back but they they make these encampments and you just you just have to deal with it so it's like if you live in that area you know you just have to jump over needles and try to figure you I feel I feel terrible because no it's it's most of this most of this is either drug addiction or mental illness those are the real real problems all right do you guys have no drug addiction or mental illness like places that you could go to for help here I don't know what it is man I don't know enough about it I'm entirely ignorant about how what's going I know that if you talk to people that work in the field that work with these folks right they say that it all really started to happen leave this guy it's like run over my leg oh my god I'm gonna need disability oh my goodness man that's crazy crazy you're laying in the street this is like everywhere honestly if you were to take a screenshot what you just showed me I'd be like okay that's some third-world country right this is La people can't even afford to live in LA I know it might as well be a third-world country though I mean it might as well be the apocalypse it's the apocalypse for those folks I mean at least they're there around all these cars and shit but I mean there are thousands of homeless people in that whole Skid Row area yes that's one of those one of the things that keeps them there I guess they have a mission beds three beds and the whole thing I don't know that's wild but they have they allow most of this to go on I don't know like how often they break it up and make people move but this did not the numbers are so high there's not much they can do man that's crazy sad sad it's super sad like but what do you do how do you fix that like I don't have any solution yeah you can't tell people this yeah yeah yeah went and spent three days down there like undercover and people are filming him experiencing and then he'd come back and do like an interview like what he just went through and it's it came out 10 years ago so it's it's different I don't know if I'm I'm assuming it's worse now but it's definitely not good and this and this so he's crazy so I I was on my one wheel right just wreck riding by I was commuting back here by the way the thing is badass it's pretty crazy right yeah I've wrote it I wrote yours today you did write mine it was good and after watching you scoot around effortlessly I was like how hard could it be you need one you get one I also don't need broken elbows like like honestly it's good for it's good it's a good core workout it's a great work just sit-ups I think it's a better core workout show you this yeah hip and glute machine from rogue we put your ankles in this thing and you lean all way back go all the way up yeah you have some next-level shit here by the way I ain't got some cool stuff man it's awesome it's mom man warehouse it's really it's this place is fuck I live here sure I had plenty of room yes bring it to baths but but yes I was right my one-wheel past this past like this kind of over past and there was a tent there and like a lady sticks her hand out and she offers me a chocolate what was it I think it was a chocolate ladybug right it was a ladybug wrapped in like that that in my comic no thank you no thank you ride back again the next day offered to me again I was like no thank you no thank he was like you know what I'll look I'm gonna like you know do something nice right so I get five bucks and I was like ugh I'll give it to her you know it's a nice gesture I write up you know I give her you know a hand of the five bucks as I start slowing down the one-wheel other people started popping their heads out of the tents and they actually saw me give her the money and immediately a guy runs out and like snatches it directly out of her hand snatched it right at hand someone else comes around the corner takes it from him and they start getting into the scuffle and I'm just like it I've never seen anything like that before I know I'm really passionate about that I just it's just it just I just can't stop thinking about it's crazy it's really crazy out here man that's crazy then everyone comes everyone comes to to LA California to get there at their big break like all and I'm gonna be like a famous whatever famous you know actor singer exotic dancer a porn star whatever and it's the struggle is real out here it's real it's real everywhere but whenever you get giant groups of people you're gonna get you know a higher percentage of people that are out here that are homeless or struggling right um again I don't know what's the solution yeah no idea no you know I know they don't put enough effort into it just whatever it whatever the solution is that's one of the arguments that who was it someone made was it share someone unlikely had a really good argument like that everybody is so concerned about illegal aliens getting into this country and so not concerned about homeless problem right and what the fuck is that about like there's people right here right now and you know we're not taken care of right and you're like but these people from other countries they're trying to but my take on that though is but those people are trying to do better they just got fucked right whereas the other people live in America okay that's too many of vets its Cher look at her yeah that's what happens when oh let's just don't look that good I wish it was time for all this year this is 12 if my state can't first of all this is my problem right why is this bitch capitalizing every word oh that's frustrating oh my god she's capitalizing all of them and then afterwards she's capitalizing the whole matters yeah if capital my capital st8 you have like someone to write this for her I'm not saying he must be she's got an assistant she's got an assistant hates her yeah like I'm a subtly gonna make this bitch looks too fake pictures and her Photoshop filters fuck you share hey just for the hell of it can we find like a recent photo share like how old is cher actually 750 she I would say she's 65 how old do you think she is so take a share home hold the 60 maybe 70 about 210 273 serious hmm when I was a kid well it makes sense man I'm 51 I was like 20 years ago no way yesterday you asshole no way you're you're is that what is that what money does that's some vampire facial yeah you go get that money both money gets you good Google search of pictures all that keep oh wow but that's what they sound like when they get to that age they said I'm crazy that her real here a hundred percent she bought it she she does she looks good she married you want to know I do not know I was always like you know really get her to sign no Prine right and how much time she ching-ching I mean if you could hang in there for 20 years what are the odds yeah that she can to wait it out you gotta wait it out man this is announcing our tour this year this picture something people use my old pictures from I don't even ask them to he just like if you find that picture of me against a brick wall we took that shit back at the old studio that picture was like four years old yeah she's um she's on tour congratulations yeah we were talking about vampire facials that some ladies Jeff told us this lady two people got hiv/aids right yeah not necessarily a sorry I don't think I know is I drop the gun it's more fun I apologize room with HIV just like it feels like you're not even supposed to say AIDS yeah brother to test positive gently after vampire facial says vampire facial as girls get jabbed in the face with some was it plasmas it what is it PRP what are they doing yeah yeah yeah she she took pictures of it on the insta I don't understand so wait a minute don't they get a new needle every time use the same needle I don't not here no if they're you there's Kim beautiful guy I don't know if they use other people's blood for the facial watch yeah I think that's probably what's going on I don't think it's that it's a used needle I think it's that they're using someone else's blood why would you this doesn't make any sense like does this make sense to anyone no because I would think that that if you drew blood you would draw from yourself so it takes it from your body puts it in the center view and then put it right but so that is basically platelet-rich plasma so but why why would anybody get HIV unless you're giving it to yourself maybe they already had a try the bear lion myth busted just blaming it on Mexico why was per usual what if why did she do it on her nose she didn't every part of her body but her nose yeah she scared of her nose she knows to look old its plastic just kidding just kidding camfil watch this I'm just kidding just kidding lol yeah so what happened to these fucking people did they really use an old needle they probably already had AIDS goddamn why because think about for a second why would you take an AIDS test before you know Oh getting deep I took an AIDS test before and after my facial and then I didn't even have a it till after my face congratulation right yeah does it make sense that's like the Indian footage they found footprints of what they think is Bigfoot in India and people saying hey asshole this is an animal hopping yeah this is this thing's only got one leg if there's a Bigfoot it's a one-legged Bigfoot like some dr. Seuss creature like that they're like look stupid that's not yeah two feet it's not bipedal what do you guys do look at that that's one leg look at that yeah boring boring but that's an animal jumping you assholes the thick part is where their butt lands the front part is their paws or I just keep going see you see one of them it's even broken up like look at that one picture where like one of those footprints is actually two separate marks in this in the snow yeah I'm not even a wildlife just the one right there I'm not even on that Bob you know that's a rabbit bro it's a rabbit those look kind of big be a rabbit rabbit there's some big-ass rabbits how big the rabbit himalayas due to your scenes I don't know that's the question Himalayas like what would it be what what is your animal it could be well one of the things this is very interesting about animals is that when they go further north contrary to logic like what you would think they actually get larger you would think well there's colder up there they'd probably get a small little thicker but no they preserve their body temperature by being larger that's why moose are so big they're the furthest north of all the makes sense them totally makes sense if you get a deer from Mexico they're tiny they're like a hundred pounds right there's a deal deer called a coues deer and a really big one is a hundred it's cows or coos depending on who you ask Co us but it's a variation of the white-tailed deer that's really small it only weighs like a hundred pounds and it's in Mexico full-grown one it's like a dog size right and then there's other ones that are in like Saskatchewan the same species that are 300 pounds how do you know so much about dears does it kill them oh you're a ha I forgot that explains a giant bow outside yeah ah that's how I get my meat oops please you know what a supermarket like everyone else I do go to supermarket okay but most most of the meat that I eat I try to eat from animals that I kill where do you hunt in LA know la is tricky the tents get in the way of your line of sight yeah but you can get a lot of coyote hunting in LA if you want this fucking coyotes everywhere out here man would you eat a coyote from LA I don't think I need a coyote period right yeah a lesson no it was a goof or I was really hungry you can't eat them no I mean you can it's just meat yeah it's you'd have to cook it really really well but when you cut away all the fur and mange and all the shit on the outside much life is just getting a tissue where do you out what do you hunt Italy the mountains usually every year I go to Utah in the mountains of Utah go l-cut what do you got Jim further explanation on this oh it's a bear yeah okay they call a Yeti something different a Himalayan brown bear or a Tibetan Blue Bear Oh what they call with all due respect what we call Yeti is with all probability the either the owner okay that's not like that called the Himalayan Beryl Yeti it's like they're saying that it was probably a bear that was making those mark that makes sense if those are big marks that the bear is hopping through the snow if it's thick snow that's that make sense that guy Kunal he's a nice guy with all due respect to everyone mm-hmm right a single footprint sir when the bear walks on four feet yeah that makes sense all right yeah so yeah so as you go to Utah and um you just you just wait well is a lot of hiking you know you go and you essentially you go where you know that the elk are going to be in the area and when they're in the rut which is the one you hunt that's when it's legal which means they're they're mating and breeding and smashing heads together and write it then you hear them you hear them scream and each other and you're ready to be killed well they are definitely ready to be held down right a little do they know yeah then you got to figure out a sign on them right they can't help themselves they just they're competing with all these other males scream at each other and smashing heads and occasionally you find one that's dead was killed by another bull but you don't eat that no no no no you could I mean you certainly could if it was like a recent kill right if you knew if you got to it like right when it was dying yeah the blood was still coming out of its body but you will find them they get stabbed and they they kill each other yeah that mean that's the whole reason why those antlers exist for war for stabbing they just fuck each other up they don't even use it to defend against other animals like wolves and shit right they kick the wolves from also Tom so where do you how do you get that thing back those things don't aren't light yeah you have to you have to do what's called quartering it which is you take the legs off and you take the the front legs off and then you take the meat off the carcass and then you take the heart in the liver and the the edible organs and you have to pack it out so you have a you have a crew that goes with you or is just you with a big-ass knife yeah I go look I'm not very good at hunting I'm like if hunting was a martial art I'd be a blue belt a blue belt is like your white belt blue belt purple belt brown belt black belt right oh it's not a black belt okay I'm like a blue belt maybe I could get my purple belt if I like work real hard this year right but I go with a guide who's gonna take me to the places that I need to go and show me and a guy who is an experienced outdoorsman who basically teaches you just like having a trainer in martial arts exactly yeah he knows the landscape he's a hardened outdoorsman you know these guys never get fucking tired and they'll go and take you and show you like what but then it's it's your job to execute the shot your job to get close your job to stalk in your job to make sure that you don't get what's called winded means the animal smells you the winds at your back and the wind carries your scent towards the animal so you have to move around there's a lot of thoughts I think you just got the gun go use a gun I use a blow which raised here yeah I'm gonna have use a gun I have really you know I shot a bow once and it didn't go so well it just kind of it's fun both just shooting targets is really fun it's very cathartic it says I was like something there's a release when that arrow finds its target just feels really good yeah it's probably some primitive shit from back when we used to rely on killing things with rolls and arrows that like accuracy but there's something about hitting something with a like when you're shooting something out of targeted hits it it's very very sad very rewarding yeah yeah and when you do that with a bow and arrow it's very difficult with it's more challenging it's more rewarding yeah I've never used traditional but I mean I have like a couple of times but I've never really tried to shoot with like a traditional bow or read mechanic on but they also like that no no I have a you draw it I mean you have to pull it back but it's a compound bow it relies on these mechanical of these gears that these we call cams it's like the bow and walking dead no that's a crossbow crossbow yeah that's that's a bullshit bow then what that is is a shitty gun okay this guy's got a trigger well no I mean a lot of zombies now it would make me very angry okay very frustrated first of all he doesn't even have a broad head on that stupid thing he's shooting him with little pencil holes and it's killing him instantly what that's all that's all he had access to much makeup broad head makeup do that break into a Bass Pro Shop broadheads man did see a few Bass Pro Shops and walking dead they just walk right past Metzen yeah kayaks so that's a crossbow and there's a that's a very controversial weapon amongst outdoorsmen why is because they use those during bow season okay and there's a reason why bow seasonings like the if you looked at like statistics across the board if you have a what's called a tag like say if you wanted to go deer hunting you'd have to get a license and then you'd get a tag and if the tag is available for the area you wanted you to pay a certain amount for that tag now if you get a bow tag they they make the bow season earlier you have a higher much higher likelihood of failure with a bow than you do with a gun so I give say like 50% of people that got a tag it's usually not that high but if 50% of people that got a tag for rifle were successful it might be 10% with a bow might even even less might be even less than some places all right depending on how rugged the landscape is how hard it is to get to where the animals are and you have to be able to shoot far accurately right so do you do most of the shooting when you go up there do you have you all shoot to myself yeah that's a man that's a manly asking to do its well a lot of manly shit I noticed I know I'm probably compensating for something yeah I didn't want to say that but yeah it's funny cuz inevitable let you do a lot of I know 7mm a stand-up Bing everyone laugh and then yeah I didn't know you were you hunted as well well you know what it is man I don't have anybody telling me what to do so because I don't have anybody telling me what to do I gravitate towards things that I'm really interested which is why you're here right I found out about your story I was like that guy seems cool when I saw her YouTube videos I go he's cool alright let's do this yeah I mean that's like to have that kind of freedom in your life is a beautiful thing and I feel incredibly fortunate that I have that kind of freedom now so I indulge it I indulge it like a little baby right like a child like I just gravitate towards things that I like to do and you know people could say it's stereotypically toxic masculinity or what it was nice I'm a nice person yeah but I gravitate towards manly shit I like watching fights I like doing martial arts you like fighting I like fights like pilot hunting all right cars I like these things I mean I'm one of my gonna pretend that I don't like them to make other people feel happy yeah so people feel intimidated by that I cause to Manly awkward that's the problem is you don't want to look like an asshole which I've experienced you know I look like an asshole to me I'm sure I look like an asshole true wow that looks like a like a decent guy coming out of that fancy Tesla yeah I would think you're environmentalist probably a douchebag yeah probably like super vegan ooh yeah uh really annoying right yeah doesn't want your kids to get vaccinated yeah doing this what you want to do that that's that's defiantly I definitely speck out about you I've seen more people should do and I think one of the things that we have a problem with people doing what they want to do is because we don't get to do what we want to do so when we see other people like yeah that's bullshit we get mad or but like he doesn't even really like that stuff for he's you know oh yeah you're you're you just falling into the typical stereotypical man own behavior yeah maybe explore your sensitivity man why would people say that because they love telling you how to do shit I hate that it's usually men that are bitches yeah there's a lot of those like they're funny how that works yeah any names for me well write them down all right so speaking of that so an interesting story for you so yeah I was kind of talking back to your guy back and forth about being on the show and the craziest thing happened where you know I was out here to actually work on a tussle related project oh and the top secrets gonna come out in a couple months but basically was that my job right and then I was like hey listen I got to take a week off to go out to California work on this project and then I was talking to your guy and they're like hey listen you're gonna be out here come back then next week as well you know what you could say hey listen you have two weeks out here I told my boss I know he's like listen man like two weeks is kind of a long time we don't have any coverage like you know I know you'd be on jailbroken it's really cool but much like it let you do that or not so made decision following in your light I said you know what then I'll leave my job then oh shit I love my job man damn I left my job which is why I'm here I need a job Joe did you really leave your job I did yeah yeah it was a big thing because I had this whole meme thing going on my YouTube channel and I say oh I have a full-time job I can't work on these builds I can't do this I can't do that I was getting in the way and you have no idea I finally left and this is kind of I was reading um your story a while back about how you got started the whole comedy thing how you went out you've got in Boston went to LA and it just felt so liberating because literally you know when you're doing something you're not passionate about that's literally eight to ten hours of your day doing something that you just you just don't really want to do it's most your day it's yeah it's most of your day so it's oh it's insane so I thought to myself you know what everyone's in the rat race everyone's rushing to get somewhere every you're in but you're you know about Boston like you're rushing to get on the train you're rushing to get somewhere that you don't really want to be you're running there to work for eight hours for someone else doing something that you don't want to do and it just gets taxing man yes it was it was it was just taxing so I and you're not gonna do your best with the things you do afterwards if you've been doing this thing for eight hours like four hours that you have before you really have to go to bed when you get home at night right you're not gonna have the same kind of energy that you had at new we're at 10 a.m. or whatever it was when you woke up or when you got to work your what you what you're dealing with is this past this crossroads right you've you've hit this path where you can decide to either not take a chance right and just you just slowly take like little incremental steps towards what you really want to do or take a risk right and when you take a risk yeah you don't have health insurance yeah you don't right that's what the risk is all about right that's that's the only way and people like you whatever food but you can't think like that because if you think like that you're gonna fail so and second of all yeah you might but then you got to do it again right and well if you continue to just fail and do it again one day you'll figure out why you were failing if you're paying attention and if you're doing your work and then you'll find something that you can do that you're successful at if somebody wants to hire you if you're good at your job if you go to a place and you're valuable to that employer you could be valuable to yourself you just got to figure out how to do it or what it is that you want to do that you could do without having a boss without and something that feels natural something that you'reyou're you gravitate towards when you get up in the morning go I'm fucking pumped I'm going to like I want for myself yeah and I'm gonna do my thing alright there's not a time where ever come here to do a podcast where I go fuck and believe have to do this right not a time I miss feel good thank you this times where I leave I was like what the fuck was that about yeah I could imagine there's a couple yeah in a thousand whatever podcast I've done there's only been like a small handful of those that have been like what the fuck was that right if you can do that man if you can find that thing that you love to do whether it's making furniture or fucking painting or whatever it is baskets you can make a living doing that goddamn that's everything it changes the world the world becomes a better place that's the goal man so so we'll see so again I took uh some cues from from some inspiration from you when you left Boston you're like you know what you can do this comedy thing I want to figure it out so what what was that like for you so when did you make the determination to say hey you know what I work at this gig you know this isn't the thing what I want to do and you made the jump like what is it what was that like the Boston thing was super lucky I was only 25 more less 24 damn yeah 24 and I was doing stand-up and I was driving limos during the day and doing a bunch of different odd jobs and shit and then I got seen by a manager who was coming from New York to Boston to scout for new talent okay I just got dumb luck I wasn't even supposed to be on the show and he asked me to go to New York and do some spots in New York I did some spots there and then I next thing you know I was living in New York I signed a contract with him and I just packed up my shit and my grandparents we're still living in New Jersey they live on North ninth Street which is like when the time when they first moved there was a pretty nice neighborhood middle class but then as Newark has got kind of funky like Skid Row now yeah it's not let's just it was the next-door neighbor while I was living with him they broke down his house door because he was selling crack oh he had a dope outtie parked in his driveway and he smashed his door with a battering ram and it was it was a legit I was an experienced sketchy neighborhood but that's so that's what I did I just packed up my shit and moved I mean I didn't have any money I didn't I didn't know if it was gonna work out at all but I knew this is a chance but I was young when you're waiting for you like whatever insurance whatever I didn't have health insurance for a long time do you have it now yeah okay good that's good yeah yeah you got it paid you ate it when you quit this job do you have it one wife has it okay there you go so that was a scary cause like shit hey listen what did she say you should go for it whoo I like it good you got a good one yeah I go for like a I go for it because the tough thing is that uh it's you know how my little my little shitty loo Tube channel and yeah but your YouTube channel is pretty big you're saying that shitty YouTube channel it was funny I say that but it's hard because I don't want to be you want to be a dick I don't be a dick yeah but I have this massive following well how big how many subscribers do you have I think 400 that's pretty goddamn thousand or something like that's pretty good I'm good yeah it's not bad that's pretty goddamn good so yes I fixes cars rebuilds Tesla's oh shit yeah it's not bad right and to think that I have a mast that kind of falling only fixing really one car right now imagine if you put all your time in the dáil bingo that worked and after the show I hope it's a cult on YouTube Everett rebuilds it's it's great new ideas are really yeah oh the nice describe subscribe Oh awesome that's a perfect shot of me by the way the the frozen but your videos are excellent you're really good at it and you're really good at explaining things and you have a good sense of humor when you're doing it and it's interesting yeah thank you it's interesting stuff yeah I try to be it's funny because there's I'm not a super genius there's other people building Tesla's left and right and are there there are a lot of other people that are now there is they're getting more involved in it and they're starting their own little channels and stuff but my thing is I want to be a little bit different I want to add some kind of humor and like comedy to it to make it interesting because quite frankly not only when things building a test is really that funny or interesting or fun you know so adding a humorous spin to it makes this yeah you know you're great at it and you know when you look at any other kind of car like if you buy a Chevy or if you buy even a you know a Porsche or something like that right you can find these little mom-and-pop fix-it chops right you can find them all over the place absolutely all around you know you go to west hills there's a bunch of places that fix cars right hey something wrong with transmission can you look at it no problem they put it on a lift to go oh you got a leak here you got this you got that with a Tesla you're on your own son either bring it to Tesla I know man or nada then I get it from their point of view they don't want a bunch of people monkeying around with their shit yeah but is it even like Mack like you can go to the genius store which is gross genius bar yeah whatever the fuck that name that's gross he's partying yes bar bitch let me see your IQ test that's a bit pompous get the fuck over here some people they're not genius smarter than you whatever so you can either go there or you can go to these little mom-and-pop max doors those do exist exactly and they're not approved but they can fix your computer they get shit done yeah I think it should done so that's the goal for me so you know I'm starting my own shop a shop called the electrified garage and that's like oh I like it yeah not bad house good name I got some swag for you too so and that's the biggest thing is because there's no mom-and-pop shop to fix Tesla right like right now it's the only game in town if they're pumping out what like five thousand cars a week now why does a week right which doesn't seem like much but for a small company it's insane that's a lot and he's out a day it's 30 days it's a lie it's like what 20 20,000 a month it's just no five thousand a week oh yeah there's like 20,000 a month or so cheese about that so and then all these thousand cars is a lot it's a lot of cars right that's a lot of freaking cars I think they're too busy so social right now you know there's only two places to fix tussles in my state so when someone's like hey I want to get my car fixed you called us so they're like yeah it'll be about you know maybe a week I'll get you in like thirty two weeks oh you get you in in a week yeah get you in a week maybe two weeks then they got over the par sometimes three weeks and times a month yeah people wait lost man so that's the goal so I'm opening up and there should be open departmental in a month or so and then I'll drive people there I have a fantasy of one day building a car one day old a 69 Camaro I thought you had one no I don't for somebody here with a whole bunch of cars I lost track I have a 65 Corvette but I just oh you had no you had a barracuda yeah that's at a 70 Barracuda yeah yeah I got rid of that why you had problems okay yeah I had all the problems fixed but it was more designed to look really good then I look really good it was a beautiful car yeah but it wasn't my style like I like a car that you can like that little Corvette that thing drives like a modern car look if you drive that thing in handles now it's it's got fuel injection it feels thank you but it feels like it feels like a car that is not dangerous right that Barracuda is like any time you want and you stomp the gas if you taken a turn that yeah totally such it's fun yeah a little bit yeah but it's so front heavy like it had a giant ass engine and it was a beautiful beautiful car it also wasn't a stick shift and that annoyed the fuck it was but um what was my point I forget no fantasy of building a car like to spend the time and actually put it together because I would imagine that the way you feel when you drive that Tesla is like this crazy feeling of satisfaction that you you made that thing much like the way you feel if you hunt and you eat the steak from an animal that you shot yourself right no you drive that car around you built that fucking thing right about the hunt well you know what's part of its the hunt and the chase though yeah because now the cars built I'm kind of like all right now what right after you hunt after you you know you take that kill shot you want to do it again yeah we want to hit something different right what kill an elephant next time no but like you know I'm sorry about that yeah that's why I don't get that one I don't what do you even do people kill elephant do it I hate them they eat yeah well the thing is when they do kill them and the villagers get to eat the food they get very excited about it yeah apparently elephants are delicious I don't think that's a lot of meat in so much meat but that's the thing that if it's one thing that we don't want to ever think about when it comes to like conservation these animals but the the money that a hunter would spend to kill an elephant goes towards making sure that the elephant population is healthy and pays for all these game wardens or whether they call ph's in Africa and then the money also goes to some of these villages and then the food the meat from the animal goes to these villages but still you shouldn't a fucking elephant yeah I feel like bad yeah it's weird how like you feel bad for killing an elephant but other animals it's like a rat you kind of deserve it yeah yeah rockets hit by a car you cheer you're like yeah yeah you fucking lose I hit it myself right yeah it's we're totally you know biased towards certain types of animals right and for sure like it's like why we are they say it while we feed pigeons I mean like we shoot bald eagles jazz majestic yeah oh you want it do you see that beluga whale that they caught that had a net it had a harness on it and they think that the Russians were riding now they think it was they were using it as a bio weapon like they would strap a missile to this thing oh and then tell the Whale to go to boats how do you tell a little about this way I was trained to go towards boats holding it had this harness on it and they think that what they did was they trained this thing to go or that boat this choking the shit out of that thing well it you could use something like that to hold a bomb so you train it to go towards the boat and then when it would hit the boat it would detonate the bomb and explode so they must have given this whale some sort of food Ward for banging into the boat and so that's yeah actually they cut it free of this this harness I mean this is total speculation they don't know where the harness came from but I'm hoping someone was trying to ride it and they weren't it's probably a bomb though there's pretty sure pretty sure it's a bomb I'm pretty sure look at this whale found off Norway coast believed to be spying for a bunch of cameras and stuff that might just be click baby bullshit to read who wrote this article are they an expert of a security expert yeah and they just have a whale with a harness right we don't really know like how often do whales with harnesses show up the fact that you're an expert could speak intelligently about it I think that the US government but it's read equipment of st. Petersburg on the strap oh yeah but if I wanted to trick people into thinking that the Russians were involved I would like it super obvious right that - yeah why would you write that you got a fake trail and you got a look into exactly made in Russia by Russia exactly yeah I would write made in Russia on it is all in English - property of Mother Russia love Russia I think the government did that with dolphins see see if that's true that the government trained dolphins to for weapon 20 of them something yeah I think US government did that find out what they trained dolphins to blow up boats what a place we live in they're basically trained dolphins to be jihadists but they didn't know it they didn't know they were at least a jihadist knows right I mean you tricked him into going for 72 virgins and blowing up mmm you tricked them but the dolphin doesn't even know it's gonna die yeah probably would be like what wait a minute why I get fish I love fish she just thinks he's gonna get fish to be brought into the boat it's just thing on my back now whatever I'll do oh my god yeah yeah that's it poor things no really yeah it says it's a myth it's mathematics all this information yeah well who says that the Navy not why it's a second guesses everything is that true but then in 2015 it says that the US Navy's combat dolphins are serious military assets oh yeah hard it stopped and started back then did it why don't they why are they sending dogs while these build robots to do it because the robots aren't as advanced as I - they can't go through the water the way a dolphin can and it would look like a robot dolphin the duck gonna do shit they're always in water alright and get something that's an organic part of the environment they're not gonna kill every dolphin that comes near the boat you know so they see a dolphin they think it's just a dolphin right and then it but why don't they have a missile painted like a dolphin the time they get it going too fast you creating killer dolphins escape naval training base in search of love yeah it's accurate for some reason I don't know why I escaped during Hurricane Katrina they've escaped multiple times I've been on the Howard for just training more these dolphins keep it's camping everything out we don't fit smarter than us they keep escaping how do they're super smart how do I not keep a hold these dolphins not on the loose I don't know it's very confusing when you look it up Ukrainian military dolphins not actually on the loose who says that that's government gee gov hey you know the chicken the Dolphins my fun dolphin facts that dolphins are one of the few animals that have sex for pleasure yeah another few chimps dolphins people yep and dogs well dogs for fun no I guess I'm gonna fuck your leg were they trying to what are they trying to prove yeah all right let me ask you this because you're all into technology go ahead what do think about aliens god this doesn't seem tech related at all yeah um think they exist do you think they've ever visited here oh god no no I don't think so I think they would have destroyed us really yeah but by when we visit primitive tribes we don't destroy them necessarily like we try to leave them alone do we tribe we end up destroying him one way or the other anyways you know that we even some people do for sure you don't we try to be nice it's like Yeah right look at that tribe let's analyze them a few photos all right let's give them food and they die pretty much yeah there's always that there's the image famous image of these tribes people in Brazil and uncontacted tribe and they're painted their body paint right in their arrows drawn at the helicopter exactly yeah yeah yeah now they know about helicopters surely they get freaking out it's the New Sun God now they worship a new religion think about it you imagine if you were an uncontacted tribe and all the sudden if you saw a helicopter was up whenever I see a helicopter shop I freaked out in general yeah in general you know what I mean so like imagine up that's that's insane have you ever been in one helicopter yes so weird right right is weird yeah swinging around like okay we're in the Skyway it makes noise absolutely but no I think um I don't know man I think they would have destroyed us they'd be like these guys are stupid don't you think they would want to watch look look if you go to the zoo yeah you go to the chimpanzee exhibit and you watch them swing around and shit people love to watch the chimps it's probably one of the most popular parts of the exhibit right and we love watching them like I look at them look at them and if you could go someplace where you could watch them in the wild yeah like if there was like a webcam right you tuned in to the Congo right now right you would definitely how do we know they're not watching us right now exactly that's the thing they probably are they probably are but wouldn't they just like watch and observe so we don't blow ourselves up so we would never know that in general they can live among us we wouldn't know they're probably I mean I would imagine that if there was a civilization that's on the cusp of some major breakthrough as far as artificial intelligence goes which is where we are right and in many ways I think that we're all super fortunate to be alive right now absolutely cuz even though it's a time of incredible turmoil right it's also a time of an amazing potential and change I'm greedy as how I want to see more I know I want to see more I want to see I really want to see a robot uprising I'm dead just don't I do I really do and I want to be like 90 ish years old and I want there to be this super advanced AI robot just to take over and start shooting shit and I also want I'll cuz Elon Musk is head oh he'll still be alive is how to be in a jar maybe I told you so this is a robot hand I told you that's what I want to see because it's like it's that's a cool it's a terminator shit I don't want to see that one at all I want to see the aliens come in and stop us write more about the hit the green switch yeah to turn on artificial intelligence I want the aliens to come down with their little Lego brain and go hey hey yeah no no no they would think the robot gave this guys dynamic yeah but it's wrestling with him right yeah it's gonna grab your dick I might like it beating off that thing's gonna come in let me help you but the thing is what's what's stopping that from not wrapping around his neck and just crushing it there's nothing stopping it if you get hacked think about the same people that helped you make your test will work all right I got a hack into this fucking thing it's gonna run right through your walls like Skynet it's gonna eat your dog you've seen the ones that flip they have them on trapeze is like Cirque de Soleil actually have you seen the part where they actually beat the robots and yes like yeah you know my favorite part of that is what well they beat the robots to find out the robots fall over right kick them and shit right they're not just in HIDA release to stay yes I sang it's not cool you can't do the robot get involved in everything for unity it's not cool wait how about a robot coalition should be a robot coalition well like would they we stand with robots to say listen we built these things but we can't hit them like all right let me ask you this here's the real question if you're 90 years old and you're still lucid in your but your body's failing yeah your knees are gone and your hips bad yeah your back hurts all the time and your your shoulders are all torn apart you can't pick things up and they say rich we can download your consciousness into this artificial body that's like you if you were Anderson Silva when he was 30 years old black Mara shit yeah yeah they give you this super powerful body all right it's it's it you're gonna feel it just like that but now you're gonna be like a super elite athlete and it's gonna be you your consciousness or you can just go to black and see what happens in the afterlife yeah this is that let this 90 year old body dies this is the silliest question ever you gonna take the horse bird in the hand right yeah what's that might might be bullshit right I can do stuff right now wouldn't you do that fuck yeah yeah okay I actually want to do it right now I'm 90 I think that's how they're gonna get us I think slowly but surely they're gonna replace parts like there's already amazing artificial hands they are creating and you know limbs that are articulating rims things I think would you want one of the limbs that looks like a human limb would you like a robotic limb like in Terminator I want to terminator limb for sure would you for sure I want everyone to stare at me but what if it was nice and soft do you think we're close to Robocop then like would that be maybe the first first step yeah that's probably right they're probably gonna do that with like soldiers yes cheffy all the money's the military yeah so skeletal drop 10 billion on that I met was robust I saw was a childhood casino at the mall it's the most ridiculous thing ever weird I'll fuck that thing up you know the one in the middle the one in the middle I want so like I said I put my hat on it and it's not freaking out did he get mad at you yeah it just lets finger on circles I wish I wish I had a gun on it oh people take it seriously well that's the worry about those dog things those dog like robots yeah they just put guns on those motherfuckers that is an episode of black mirror yeah that episode no I didn't see that one yeah it's called heavy metal really one of the best episodes this lady's run out spoiler this lady's running from these robots they had dogs not the head outros I'm a dog like one of those things yeah yeah and it has potential like actual real technology that it's using so like it's not outlandish yeah the thing is about black mirror everything is yeah like that could happen yeah you know the thing with the implant memories and you like live this crazy fake life right that's all that's on the horizon so you know the interesting part about black mirror is that there's a pro and a con to everything right so there was an episode where a woman wanted to keep better track of her daughter so she implanted that ship so she could see whatever her daughter sees right then her daughter got older and older and she started to see some wild shit that the kid was doing right but then to your example what would be the downside of putting my consciousness in someone with a jacked and like ripped body well the downside would be would you even really be a human anymore or would you be some sort of a thing that we've created that keeps your brain alive right who cares who does care you know well here's the thing would you want to live a whole nother life like how much time do you want in this fake body do you want to be immortal you want to keep going forever not forever now I mean well you at 200 years you know there's an old story about that about a guy goddamn it it's like an old legend about a man who kept killing his sons in order to live longer yeah that God came to him and told him if you kill his son and he lives to be like thousands of years old but he's had around him they cried about him I saw a job in the Bible something like that whatever keep going since from something yeah I don't remember but the point is like when you got to 200 years if you said okay I'm gonna take this body and we live in it for 200 years about a to many years I'll be done that's right 198 years comes along and you still like a 30 year old Anderson Silva I could hear you it you're having a great time right to the point but you might be like super wise that's the other thing if you think if you've if you think of how smart a person is they keep their shit together and they become like a mature older man who's just wise understands the way the world works it was well-read and really has taken the time to do the work on themselves personally they know themselves better than they did when they were a young foolish man that's hopefully most of us as we get older but what if you could live to 300 years how wise would you be then my biggest concern isn't necessarily about being wise I think it's about my loved ones mm because I watch the you know nummy because you see a lot in 300 if you see a lot of shit right like that's like three wives actually maybe four or six on who knows right but like as they pass you be like you have your kids and like your kiddo lived to be like 80 years old and you're just like hey you know gotta get you kid a new body yeah yes that's more attempt to go on or ever though cuz I feel like what's the world gonna look like in 300 years maybe the dope maybe would be the shit would be maybe it would I wanna dancing you know might the most fascinating thing I keep thinking about is us going to Mars I know he wants that do you want to go would you go nope why not interested it's a one-way trip by now look I don't want to go to Antarctica really fuck what I want to go to Mars I don't want to go anywhere where people can't live you go to Utah in the woods and shoot deers and still people live there really beautiful the streams and trees it's gorgeous but you were just saying that you don't like when people come up to you at a restaurant harass you like you living alone I like being around people though that's where I go to a restaurant I'm not lady in a cave somewhere trying you know I mean there's nothing wrong I feel like you would want to do that that is manly shit that you do like men want to just go and just like light fires and caves and shit and just like dude I know Mars is stupid you can't come back that's like going to the shittiest neighborhood in the own university you can get to if I guess one way guess what your name oh yeah we'll live forever will live on without me guess assholes no one cares your asses name lives forever Hitler fuck what are these roses Elon Musk's base station on Mars between this neighborhood sucks yeah that's like living in Barstow for the rest of your life what do you even see there yeah if you get trapped in Barstow in a glass bubble you're halfway to Vegas hey remember my OHS fear yes Pauly Shore yeah no but they did a real one oh that's right the actual biosphere always sure and who else uh Stephen Baldwin yeah that's right advice feared like that how'd that that didn't go so well now people went crazy crazy why don't we like do that again people go crazy man you don't they don't want to be locked together with each other it's not normal for everybody we just stuck in some bubble with each other it's been 25 years since biosphere since eight scientists sealed themselves in the biosphere for two whole years what ended up happening them I forget they probably went on a fuck rampage took more than three months just to make pizza why does that mean they pray the good ingredients from scratches oh of course oh yeah they had a live they had to be sustainable inside that little ecosystem were they allow to bang each other how could you forbid that how could you tell people want to do in general but it's work work environment harassment yeah broke whose HR who's gonna stop you that's right who is HR so there's 25 people in their sciences and that's the thing do you think that if people if we didn't have laws you know lawless society no police how will we just kill each other yes real parents because it didn't happen they're like who was the law they're in the biosphere no I think most of the time we don't even what does it say Jamie nevertheless the team completed the mission emerging from the outside world after two years of solitude okay I think most of the time you don't need the law but is that because we know the law exists and people formulated society in the sense that you could always count on the law so that keeps people in check I don't know and it depends on where you live like if you live in a poverty-stricken crime-ridden neighborhood right do you need the law there more or do you need the law there less like what what is what is is maybe people being arrested a lot causing some of the problems that you're seeing in that neighborhood and there's some of those arrests because of nonviolent drug offenses right like how much how much are you turning because there is a certain percentage of people to get turned into criminals once they get introduced into the the judicial system as a non-violent person person who's deciding the roads that you're stuck in a fucking a full penitentiary with criminals all right real criminals like violent people and then you're just a guy who sells weed yeah oh my god yeah fuck what am I doing here this is why it's real - this is why we need to analyze those isolated environments those isolated ecosystem people that's never seen anyone from the outside see how they handle shit well they kill each other they kill people that don't pull their weight should be able to kill the weak no I don't think so this there's a great book sapiens from Noah what does you've all her Otte it's a great book but it just it outlines the history of the human race and these various tribes that have dealt with like weird shit like that like there's there certain tribes that like when they see like old ladies that are moving too slow is kill ma'am yeah and this one guy was talking about I think it was that book I'm pretty sure was that it was sapiens I read a bunch of books I've listened to I should say donal I listened to him on tape a bunch went back to back on runs right that we're dealing with this very same issue and um there was talking about this guy who was like he killed a few of his aunts damn and yeah and they were like all the old ladies are scared of him cuz he was the guy that they hired to kill them when they weren't pulling their own weight I'm like oh yeah but maybe that is that a bad thing though because if you're out if you're that old lady if that's correct if you're part of an older tribe it's about a tribe right mm-hm and you guys have to keep moving and keeping things going because you're gonna get killed by another tribe yeah then you have weaker members of that tribe that are holding the entire tribe back what do you do what do you do you risk I mean to you that's the real question would you you know would you put a bullet in you know your friend's mom because she wasn't pulling her weight and because that that depends on the entire tribe itself she's still on the whole tribe down see we that's the thing that you do when you don't have much right right when you have surplus like we have we we value our older people want to care for them right and we have something yeah like there's a there's a famous video of these two comedians you've seen that video those two comedians to find this lady who's trying to buy gas with like pennies and shit and they give her money and she starts crying it's a tearjerker it's a serious to your jerk er but what happens the video they give her money they've had some lady yeah they just think they just these two young guys get out and give this lady money and and she starts crying and yeah just like okay he's like five bucks a gallon I probably pain with like pennies and shit she's like she's yeah and so they give her some money and she's she's like weeping yeah it's really she her husband died just a week ago damn it's like it's heavy to turn it off I'm start crying yeah stop it I want to see you cried you don't know hey Joe was about to be cried oh not that long ago really yeah I cry for a happy thing oh really yeah you know cry for sad stuff not as much man well like if someone does something really amazing I'll stop yeah really yeah you saw my videos you like yeah when people do good things that cry yeah I get I tear up for shit like that yeah yeah same here yeah I'm not into dudes who cry about like stupid shit yeah you know if he cried was it always me yeah no that's what happens when you drive and it says right my idiot Jesus Christ ship on TV when do you think is gonna happen that v's are all electrical like with the solar oh not for a while man solar densities tough because a lot of panels but outhouse yeah the true well he out here I think a lot of people are rocking it that way in two steps they got the solar from the roof or from the panel's and then it goes into the battery and the battery in your charge so a lot of people what they do is they just it's cheaper just get a whole bunch of panels mm-hmm and they reduce their electricity bill by not having either battery pack itself restore the electricity right and a lot of the times people don't have a large enough battery pack in their homes to store that energy to charge their cars you know only a lot of people just have the panels to offset the price of electricity that feeds back into the grid but what I mean is the car itself like Fisker had that for a while where their roof yeah that was powering the radio yeah it's not good it's like a gimmicky kind of thing is it gimmick game it kind of is because you're only because you're very limited in size amount of panels that you could put on the roof it's really only enough to like trickle charge like a couple of things here and I mean you think a bigger array or like heavy solar density and that's coming but like there's not enough to really like power the car from it mmm you don't I mean while you're driving maybe there's an alternative way to gather the Sun together raise yeah because if that would be the most amazing thing ever if we all had cars that were left with it just ran on a Sun and there was no need for oil so I've done yeah and that's it is that the Fisker Jamie yeah so that solar array on the rooftop I think it powers the radio yeah so like you have that much you only have so much room on the roof and all the powers of the radio we're actually the motor yeah remote it's just it wouldn't even do it right that didn't even exist 20 years ago so who knows in the future that would it seems like it could be possible you could figure out a way I can still make it efficient and now especially out here yeah there's a ton of Sun out here yeah that would be by something like a roof I don't understand you're trying to be hot bro try to get some dick yeah look at her try sell cars yeah what's up with the glasses she's looks really pale - she's got a burst in the frames that chair like Cheryl that shares fetus yeah yeah I mean I think that would be that would really be the future I think we had no reliance whatsoever on oil I think that asked man what do you think about sticking of Reliance what do you think about people no longer relying on driving their own cars what do you think of everyone owned a Tesla right and well that would look like everyone put an autopilot when they went somewhere oh that looked like you've used autopilot being on the wheel because you're nervous I think one day it's gonna be amazing but I think it's like if you bought Windows 95 if I bought a computer in 95 and you had Windows it would crash all the time you get that blue screen of death right it doesn't always work no and but you can rely like Windows 10 does not I've never had a crash not once yeah I think that that's what it's gonna be like with the Tesla I think there's gonna be a few crashes yeah of course everyone's driving these things there's gonna be hiccups errors software problem glitches some people just dumbasses yeah yeah but then after a while it's just gonna work you know it's like if you look at the like we're talking about Windows or Android versus Apple the old Android was dogshit it was terrible but I have a new note 9 a galaxy note 9 you're an Android guy no I've both me both of everything yeah I like to fuck with shit yeah that's why I meant your senior so say what do you use two phones what do you mean your drug deal work yes yeah okay one one number I give to people who are squirrelly yeah yeah yeah well yeah I have to you know I'll turn it on every now and then check text and yeah she's this fucking guy yeah and then the other so why don't you give me one mmm I'll give you the iPhone nice it comes up blue if you get a green text for me you know you're on the school right now I'd be like hey listen what's this bubble showing up I like the idea of supporting alternative platforms that's one of the reasons why I'm I appreciate Windows and I appreciate Android but I think that Apple has a better platform it is a better ecosystem absolutely I just I despised their lack of options with their laptops I despise it I think it's it's it's unfathomable how such an enormous company can have such shit things to type on yeah when they cater to creative people yeah it's their way or the highway this is how it is and that's kind of it when I want at home I have a mechanical keyboard no you spec it out make an elf super sweet now I use a razor razor once oh no it's a gaming one I never use it for exciting why do you I never use mechanical keyboard as a tech guy I'm embarrassed with ya I never use one I just use like the light built-in laptop one there's a what are the benefits of it I I'm a feedback person I like tactile feedback yeah I like that I like to click I like to feel it and the same reason why I like a manual transmission same reason why I like mechanical thing maybe you should get a phone that has buttons on it I should bro like one of those like it's cyber those t-mobile sidekicks foot phones and stuff like that shit man people had those I was jealous yeah what about people that can still type with just the keypad when they have to do four presses yes yeah there's a lot of people out there still no key is that you pressed like three eight times to get the e and stuff like that we're playing snake game snake there it is their society oh damn write it back no they didn't is that what this is every breathe what year is that bring that back this is coming back that's bullshit I don't know how popular is this for sale right now what what version of t-mobile website is this there's no way this still has sidekicks bro get sidekicks always it says 4G so it is world we live in in that that Paris Hilton's got one let's get a pink key what's that key for is that enter go back in time yeah right time what the fuck man so that's like a Twitter feed that someone's looking at on their sidekick however you know what I will admit it was a struggle for me to go from the physical typing keyboard to the actual me too much pad it was hard I didn't want to let it go I was blackberries pitch for a little while longer than I should have right yeah yeah one no no no no I gave up on it yeah but you have you have advised us what's up Tom Segura is all about that blackberry he's real shitting you do you not know that did joke I know those things exist no definitely don't one uses well they have the ones that would have the physical keyboard attached to a big screen you've seen that I think it does it slide down yeah those are like all Android those are all Android power I think right yes yeah all the black boards here how about Windows Phone 8 Rick's phone that's that they clicked it and it's the mouthpiece like slid down and everyone was like oh that bet that looks badass can't wait so that comes out no came out they made a couple of them just because people nearly 5,000 bucks or something Windows Phones it's weird that that didn't take off but a friend of might had one of those like looking have those weird tiles yeah Windows 10 right exactly the tiles are awkward you're still awkward I'm like this is not the way to do it yeah okay so if you have a Windows Phone now what are you doing you're fucked like you didn't make them anymore you're like you're not getting updates no I ain't getting shit they're just letting a dog I just stuck in 1996 not tracked what does this Jamie's with matrix phone well that same phone released last year look at that guy he's so excited I must a slight yeah that's like the old school it had a slider phone oh you think you look cooler stupid with that thing stupid yeah please doing guy get yourself a banana get a real phone you fucking dork but it does have the keypad well you have to do that shit back to doing that assholes some assholes like a t9 texting was pretty fast you're a prick you shut your mouth 39 forgot how to do it I forgot I never knew all right wait is that touchscreen as well oh god I hope it is they got to navigate with that stupid thing I hope this doesn't succeed probably got snake on it though yeah snake was a shit right mistake what a snake is that a game yeah I have avoided games on my phone for a very specific reason why I have a problem with games like it you get hooked on it yeah badass gaming ring over there I saw a gaming rig game room the lamb but that's all for first-person shooters right while we're here like I cannot have a game that I love on my phone why not have that why because I'm a child yeah you can obsess with it yeah I don't have that kind of control I have a fucking awesome game that's on my phone yeah that's my life my life's gone now you go get that game on me everywhere I go what apps do you have on your film what keep you going I have a bunch of normal apps like Instagram and Twitter right but I have a bunch of cool ones like some star map shit what do you I've never looked for this but I just found someone playing quake on their phones many dope yeah this the ship what they plane they have quake three Portobello god damn it see why the fuck I tell me that whenever I look before it yeah son of a bitch I think it was two dimensional though or not 2d but but didn't have an up-and-down yeah you know diction out congratulations in the new dick shock I'm not gonna do it I'll have anything I'm life I don't even have chat I had chess on my phone for a little while and even like that yeah cuz I've started going home how do I get better this Mike shut I'm trying but I had to just shut it off put that goddamn thing down you have to pick and choose what you want to devote your time and energy do so so what do you win your top three things that you put time and interest to that aren't your family right now well work stuff it's mostly work stuff or martial arts right so it's like work stuff is stand-up which is the most time-consuming yeah because I have multiple sets tonight and I'm always writing and it was tweaking and listening so you alright so how do you how do you do your stand-up stuff so I want a rice shit you want to get into stand-up I not really well you know it's kind of thinking about yeah I don't get into stand-up comedy people watch my videos like well you're kind of funny you're funny you should do stand-up no I'm like shit let's trust me I'm a professional you're funny guy you could totally do it all you have to do is go to an open mic night yeah what I suggest go to an open mic night and see how terrible everybody is right and then you'll be inspired to try hmm you're gonna be terrible - don't get me wrong I was terrible when I first started but you'll probably be better than most really yeah and that's all you need all you need is people if you say something people haha just that's all you need right it's a little chocolate guy in the front okay I got amber I got an ember yeah I can do this and you'll figure it out you'll get better at it and you'll work at it and you'll tweak it and you how old you 36 you can do it stuff time you know live once once a cutoff date 40 shit jokes folks just just kidding JK okay but if you if you're a person who can make people laugh and you are willing to dedicate yourself to it it's not like you have to have certain amount of flexibility or you know a certain amount of physical strength right no it's just can you make people laugh fun okay then you can do it are you going to pull it off right that's another question so how do you get inspirate it down yeah this is funny they write this stuff how do you get inspiration for that I think it's you have to be what I would call a professional and this is I've gotten this from Steven Pressfield who wrote the war of art which is a great book and I'm also got it from reading Stephen King on writing and talking to a lot of different writers about how they handle things right if you just waited to be inspired and that's the only time you wrote you wouldn't have half as much shit right not even close written not even close half as much good material as you do if you decide I am going to write yeah so I sit down and I write and sometimes I don't know what the fuck to write about and I just start writing I just start rambling right and a lot of like the first 20 minutes might be total horseshit that doesn't get me anywhere well dan I got an idea what about that well why the fuck do we do right and then I'll start writing about that well this is and I'll make things up a makeup effect right and then I'll argue against that fact right and then maybe I'll find out what what the real fact is and see if I can argue that way all right and then I'll and I'll give up I get to like 1,700 words somebody that'll shut the laptop and what the fuck am i doing how do you know that you're not gonna accommodate jokes yeah sorry oh so while you're writing and you're like yeah I'm gonna do this is awesome idea how do you know that that content already hasn't been uh been discussed well you look like always you don't always you could absolutely write something and have parallel thinking write something and not even know that someone's already written it right but you there's a difference between that and stealing like you know what when someone's like if you come up with if you like look at something whatever it is like say maybe your wife sends you to to the grocery store to pick up some tampons right and it has the the price things all fucked up and so the guy has to yell price tag I can check on tampons all right there has been like a hundred done bits on that right and it's not that they're stealing they probably didn't hear anybody do it they thought it was funny they thought it up themselves and they did or maybe it even happened them or any did it that's parallel thinking it's a common one right and then there's other people that did hear someone do it they stole it off that's a different thing that's the worse right but you could get both of those things from that same subject right that seemed really common easy to think of subject right there's a lot of those cops and donuts there's a lot of there's a lot of things that are like a part of the lexicon they're like a part of their part of the way we talk they're a part of culture and you could think you thought them up but you didn't other Seinfeld in a way that should happen to everyone sure right sure but then there's stuff that's clearly yours like if you did a whole bit about how you built a Tesla right you know and that you think and then you got a heavy hitter and you thought Elon Musk is plotting against you and you could and that's something do that and that would be something that's wholly unique to you how many fucking people have built a Tesla is there even 20 on the earth at this point yeah probably I may even 20 yeah let's pretend yeah let's pretend that out of seven billion plus population of human beings maybe twenty people have done what you've done but doesn't it get old though you know that one bit yeah that's okay yeah but you can the same so just talk about other things then right look you could talk about anything that you find interesting personal shit technology world events right worrying about the environment where you know all this anything yeah did that whale really have a bomb strapped right I keep thinking about that over now why not yeah I mean and then if you maybe it was like someone from CNN that fucking hates the Russians right you know like wanted to blame everything on the Ross yeah they got duped for two years saying that there was collusion and that Trump was going down they colluded with Russia and it turns out that the Mueller report doesn't really necessarily say that right and then they're like fuck we got to do something about these goddamn Russians yeah so they hired this whale and they put a strap on a good story the cuff so so that you write all your stuff down right you write like you know seventeen hundred words two thousand one out of that I might get one line really maybe how do you remember when he's that stuff I write it down and then I take it and I extract it and a lot of it I put notes on my phone you're on your iphone yeah that's one of the reason why I like the iPhones because when I write something in notes they all show up automatically oh yeah cuz I'll sing but I also have a thing called Evernote and so Evernote you have app so I have I so I transfer everything into both mm-hmm so one goes into Evernote and then one copy of it goes into notes sometimes not like right now I'm a little behind on Evernote because I've been using just the Mac laptop for the last couple weeks yeah damn yeah so that's how I do it I go back and forth and you keep reading it and write it out on paper app and the write it down on paper part is really more just to highlight it and so I remember what the key points are right I don't necessarily write it out in full I look at what I wrote out and then I say okay I know where I'm trying to go let me just try to go there organically right so there's one time I did a I did a speech in front of about maybe like a hundred and sixty people or so I threw some jokes in there which is actually pretty good you ever get that weird thing where you're explaining a story and you didn't even get to the joke yet and you start talking people are already laughing yeah I'm like wait a minute that wasn't supposed to be funny exactly I was a terrible moment my friend died while yeah it's one of those things sometimes people see where it's going and they their plan ahead Ryan I start laughing oh my god I know where this is yeah they see where you go oh god is this go oh shit they start when I start laughing there yeah yeah it's kind of one of those crazy things but no I I think you should try it you wanna try you should try most everything is like going up on stage and not getting a laugh because I'm that same prick that's in the audience like wow this guy's not funny at all Jesus of course I look freaking stage we are out we are all that person I mean any look especially you don't know the guy people love to talk shit it's fun yeah some guy goes up right in front of you and says some shit this guy's a little funny it's got a date you know yeah fuck yeah it's got no sex that's normal that's normal you uh you're gonna have jokes that don't work and then you're gonna have jokes at work a lot better than you thought all right doing Wow but just I can tell you're thinking about it yeah you should do it there's attorney but you're also thinking about in terms of like the right way to think about it like that your setups are gonna get laughs right and then you that's what it's worth the weirder things about comedies that it sort of - it kind of comes to life on stage right on the paper all I'm doing is looking for seeds like I'm looking for points and seeds and things that make me chuckle while I'm writing it right and I'm taking into my go game I just fucked up or it's just gonna be funny and then I try to bring it out on stage and water it in front of all these people right that's the only way to do it you have to really develop it in front of people you remember you know some of your old bits yeah you do yeah they were terrible oh my god shit was awful you weren't there no I was stuff I've heard like recorded it's not those good stuff when I when I'm in my Tesla yeah I type in a comedy stations oh we always come up I type in a Patrice O'Neal and then you come up all the time in terms of your skits Pilbara skits and stuff yeah good Patrice one of the greatest of all time is a elephant in the room those best never damn it's hilarious it's just a it's awesome man yeah you know there's a few guys you just wish you could get to that could just clean their health up yeah yeah I wish she was here today he'd have a lot of cool shit he'd have some cool shit to say about that the closest we have to him today is really bill burr in terms of like ballsy stance against political correctness yeah but he gets away with it in a way that other people can't get away with yeah it's um yeah that's that yeah it's it sucks man because it was a diabetes thing it's like fuck it come on man I could have been I didn't know him well enough you know I wasn't hanging out with him I was I was on the west coast he was on the East Coast right I knew him and I want to try to talk to him but you know I tried to talk to Ralphie May - that didn't work yeah people there on their path yeah especially comics is a thing about someone who's that free like Patrice O'Neal like he really doesn't give a fuck not zero he didn't give a fuck made him hilarious he didn't fuck what he said about anything didn't give a fuck what he ate either though yeah yeah just ate whatever the fuck you want it did whatever the fuck you want it was indulgent yeah that indulgent translated to brilliant comedy but it also translated into him not taking care of his body yeah man yeah I am so my big question for you is what do you you know you go to a party right right everyone has that one thing that they can't stop talking about you have like hey I have a Tesla you know hey you know I do yoga like hey I'm vegan what's the one what's your what's your party trick I don't have one what's the one thing that you can't stop talking about i luckily don't have one I don't do I really don't really go to rent party so but yeah the party's there for my kids yeah it's like birthday parties and shit then you're just talking to parents yeah they usually want to ask me a UFC question yeah or or they want to ask me about like what's he want musk like you know what are you gonna get Kanye on yeah I know like that kind of shit yeah what's up so what's that weird thing feel like will you actually go out in public and like you're actually amongst like people and stuff like what are the most frequently questions they ask you those kind of questions MMA stuff MMA stuff is real calm and comedy so it's real common stuff yeah they ask you weird questions but most the vast majority people are cool vast majority people like hey what's up hey what's going on man it's all great yeah yeah it's all good if you put that out there right what I put out there I'm pretty nice it's like that's why I try to put out there so that's what you get back right so what's next now what's next for Joe Rogan are you interviewing me MEMS yeah yeah you're a natural yeah you're a natural for this so yeah so what what is the thing you know the X don't just do that but the thing is I'm trying to legitimately I'm telling you there's no next because you're a successful person right I came in here he pulled up in a black Tesla it wasn't salvaged you didn't get it out the ocean I want to learn from you anyway I don't know the things that you do with the thing is what I quit is what you're doing right now I took my own path all right that's what you're doing right now yeah yeah I mean what your path is gonna be I assume you're gonna be doing more YouTube videos I'm assuming your channel is gonna grow and I'm assuming you're probably gonna try stand-up comedy probably gonna like yeah you probably do a podcast to kind of cool a podcast you never even done one before tell like people don't understand like you're like how do I put these headphones on yeah what do I do with the my slate what's this black thing in front of meanwhile you're doing this like a pro yeah thank you even interviewing me yes I wanna know I want to learn from you but see that's how this comfortable easy nature that you have totally translates into all these things we talked about okay you can easily do a podcast you could easily do stand-up easily 100 mile Santa it's not as easy as yeah doesn't see you ever have like a new stand-up person you have the immediate they just saw Connie just like why these guys should be yes yeah there's a few that you go I gotta get out of here yeah I can't be around us you worry it's contagious word yeah if you watch someone that's really bad it's one thing I don't know not everybody like Greg Fitzsimmons it's all areas yeah he loves watching shitty comedians yeah but if I watch someone who's bombing I got to get the fuck out of the room cuz I start thinking there's nothing that's funny like things that are funny don't exist like this is because certain people like if you go to open mic nights yeah there are certain people that are just insane do you still go to open mic nights yeah I'll stop by okay if I'm in the neighborhood you know and if I know I want a peek in like once a year once a year and watch a little bit just because it's I want to remember what it was like that's what you started man oh it's the fucking to wanting to get on stage list of people in in the open mic night at the Comedy Store in particular the room is well lit mmm because they have all the there's these signatures on the wall of like Robin Williams and famous comedian out in Sam Kinison and those those are all neon so that when the comedians are onstage during open mic night all that neon is on and the room is kind of fairly well lit right and then at the end of the stand-up comedy like okay the no more open mic night boom those lights go off the room gets dark and then the pros go up home and then you see this marked difference and skilled and quality of material and I feel like real professionals you know what Krystal LLL go up bill Berg Chapelle stops in all the time I open mic nights yeah they're no joke yeah he'll just Chapelle just show up at 11:00 p.m. just random open mic night now up so you get both things you get to see people that have no idea what the fuck they're doing you get to see people that have potential they get to see crazy people yeah they're just insane and then you get to see like world-class comedians in the same night it's a it's a cool experience at the Comedy Store Monday nights okay it's awesome used to be Sunday and Monday yeah then this place started getting to successful mmm and they cut back on the Sunday night open mic night socks man it does suck a little bit a little bit yeah so you live in a good spot because you're in Boston and it's like one of the best spots in the world for starting out I didn't have to try it it's weird cuz like I feel weird cuz I have a following and it's like hey listen shut me down comedy let's go weird no they would like it man you think so fuck yeah if I'm a fan of your video right and I am a fan of your video so if I was a fan of your videos and I wanted to go see you live at a club right she's gonna be at this place yeah oh yeah what time 8:00 o'clock okay let's go yeah I go that you think is gonna be funny huh yeah he was kind of fun yeah yeah yeah for people to get a chance to see the first time you ever go on stage too and just be prepared to eat shit yeah if you do eat shit have some stuff to say about eating shit I don't know I ate shit you'll feel it yeah ooh tastes like shit yeah yeah it's definitely good thanks for everyone have a good night yeah it's look I encourage everyone who thinks they could do it to do it because there's not enough of us and there's only you know is that is it a dying breed it's not a dying breed no I think is actually up right now I think it's on the upswing quite a bit because I think there's more avenues there's more clubs to go to comedy is more popular than ever like if you go to the Comedy Store tonight it's sold out I have a show at The Improv tonight that sold out its places our show tonight yeah and you're here with me always work almost every night except Sunday and Monday how much do you sleep I sleep a good solid seven hours what yeah what's hard well I just wasn't hard to believe I feel like I never I never sleep I don't know what it is you don't like it you know what your health guy you know how I get better sleep at night melatonin really some melatonin I can't keep doing that they'll forever can't I it's not bad for you really yeah war if they get saunas good getting a sauna before you go to bed it'll it'll make you feel good I have to have a sauna yeah that's a problem yeah you can get one of them sauna suits you know seeing those things you know and it's like a look at sleeping back infrared suit really yeah they make those yeah um so I just going like it's like a waterbed but it's like a bag that I kind of sit in like a bag but it's I go on it's up it's like kind of heavy yeah and it heats up and it's like infrared it cooks your body I think I'll just get it you know a turkey when I got out of that thing I think you're that bad it's not that bad it's really good it makes you feel good when you get out of it yeah a lot of a lot of people that help them sleep you have that like that chamber here that's like a sensory deprivation what is that it's an isolation tank it's I heard of it yes what do you what is it you float the water has a thousand pounds of Epsom salt yeah so as you lie down in that salty water you're you know your body floats yeah like half of your body's above the water halves under the water so your ears are underwater but everything above your ears forward on your face is your face yeah yeah and then the water is heated to 94 degrees well the same temperature as a surface to your skin yeah and then you shut the door and you're in total silence of total darkness you can't see anything you open your eyes total blackness that's not close your eyes terrifying it's not because you just open the door anytime you want a lot of people think that like the I'm getting claustrophobic you feels wonderful it feels like first of all it feels like you're flying so you lean your arms back and once you kind of bump into the walls a little bit you got to center yourself and once you send yourself and then the the water stops rippling then you just let your arms relax and you just float and it feels like you're flying you fall asleep and die my biggest concern right now oh it's only 11 inches of water and you're floating you can't drown unless you flip over face-first you start breathing the water and yeah yes sit up and you're fine there's no way to drown and then no one dies okay you're fine you don't have to worry about that and you're floating it feels great man yeah it feels great Hill is very relaxed so the concentration of salt is what keeps you afloat yes this is a thousand pounds of epson salts in that tank Wow for your skin too I found out about it first through the movie altered states I had heard about it was a movie that was based loosely very very loosely on the legend of the sky named John Lilly and John Lilly is the guy who created this sensory deprivation tank do you know yes no I do not well he also was a pioneer and interspecies communication with dolphins yeah he was a scientist all comes back to dolphins biscuit for this guy he gave dolphins acid he was a part of LSD what allows you to do that who won the fifties and sixties again did or didn't metal acid you know well they actually shut his program down because the woman that he had he had this woman who was living with a dolphin and she essentially half of her apartment was underwater like she was her house was half submerged so the dolphin would come in and out of the house and sleep with her and then go into a tank it's like her husband or something that was the problem she was jerking the dolphin off oh the dolphin like would be distracted all the time but the dolphin stayed well of course got jerked off all the time so they were like Louisville we're paying for what they were trying to teach the dolphin to talk right right so they're trying to teach the dolphin English words but the problem was dolphins don't have lips they don't they can't make there's cords can't make fix times what we do so they were trying to get a lot of work for this a lot of work for hello but it was really obvious that they have some sort of language right and so Lily who is obsessed with it he would set up his sensory deprivation tank right outside the dolphin tank and take acid and give acid to the dolphins and he was trying to communicate with them he was trying to communicate with them like in some sort of a like neighboring dimension right he was a trip I mean that guy he would take intramuscular ketamine that shoot it into his his meat of his body and then lie in the tank and have these crazy ketamine trips while he's in the tank why well I don't know I've never experienced ketamine yeah but apparently there's something about that particular drug that lends itself very well to the sensory deprivation experience least for Lily then he's very addictive did you bought the tank what about that and then I read a book called the deep self and that was a book that Lily wrote about you know I think that one he even had instruction on how to build a tank he actually had like set up like all these plans yeah or how you blue print for how to build your old tank yeah use water bed liners and yes probably pretty easy right get a kiddie pool throw letter people have done it - people have done lay down yeah you can do it but you have you know you really need is there a filter at all not really a very heavy-duty filtration system really yeah because the one that I have is it's a company called a float lab and the float lab is like the best they make the best tanks and the guy who makes it as my friend crash and he's like a super scientist dude yeah a mad genius when it comes to tanks he's like over engineering everything and making everything like it's like complicated is because you're fine right yeah I'll show you the whole system it's like all that stuff that's in the back of it is like essentially from a public water purification system it's super super heavy-duty purification and it even pumps ozone into the water oh no shit so what do you do when so like let's just say like someone were to go in there yeah you just had a fight whatever might you want to relax you go in there the person comes out is there's the water change there's just a filtered system with water to be filtered but nobody the only people that have been in that thing are Dan Harris from Good Morning America any really yeah he's the only one that ever took me up on the offer to climb in there most guys go yeah yeah I'll go in there yeah rescue what I did you like climb into my little tank literally yeah like this trip naked rich oh there's definitely no cameras there yeah I worry about that how do I know they get that out of your head yeah trust me I'm gonna bet I guarantee you Boston but Google sensory deprivation tanks in Boston I guarantee you oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of places where you go and you rent them and it's like you know 50 bucks for an hour so I'm like that that's not bad at all it's not it's worth it man there you go float restoration therapy where's it that third floor relax tonight there you go $80 for 90 minutes it's in Somerville on that in Medford Street and Somerville there you go papow what if I come out someone's 90 minutes that was a risk right well hope not yeah I hope nobody steals your clothes usually like you're in a room and you get to lock it dude did kids do it too was the kid in there um my kids are scared of it but yeah they could do it was where like they draw the line with Daddy what an unaged in floating Wow dilly bear me but they won't float gonna float no letter mmm too weird oh my god it feels great man I'm telling you everybody and it's also a great way for your body to absorb magnesium because the you know Epsom salt baths are great when you have sore muscles yeah well when you get into this this is so much Epsom salt yeah you float in it and your muscles loosen up and it kind of like pigments and tight areas loosen ah yeah that's one cool pod yours looks like a safe yeah it's much bigger yes see this is your a two-person tank no you want to talk about nothing yeah we're not here to talk that's why I'm here now okay before we go on into the next dimension I have to know about the curtains I have six question I want to buy these curtains huh yeah what is this samajis new lily pad a flow tank that hides in a daybed BAM Sumati is the company that I bought my first tank from they make great stuff so that is that looks terrifying look what if someone's sitting on it you can't get out oh that's true like hey really can you get off this thing I really want to get out of here I'm getting scared right if like a fat dude gets drunk and falls asleep on a list yeah yeah wait you can't run the air this is the air bro no I'm it so eventually you could no no they pump air in they don't do this to me so actually yeah there's actually a variable speed fan and the one that I have that pumps in oxygen okay clean purified air okay so purifies the air and pumps it in it's not everyone's is that safe though no and I guess like a sealed system that way that one right there the day bed one could be a real issue yeah like you have said drunk fat guy yeah you have 37 minutes of air left yeah it's like an escape from space there's a light song what Jamie said this is what yours looks like but it has lights that's bad similar see yours looks like sorta sorta similar like black it's like whoa mine is mine is the state of the art yeah lights and inside here no there's no lights no lights bro yeah I know what I'm doing yeah I've been I had one of these in 2002 so I've had one forever Tom I love them we should all love them yeah I think they're one of the best tools ever feel like thinking what else is a good thinking tool marijuana yeah I heard you like marijuana now do you you know what uh you know what you have an interesting thing for you what are you able things so because I'm gonna budget it let my job and everything I stayed at a hostel Danner's I'm doing some broke people shit right Hostel probably no no I'm never stated Austin so so in case you know what a hostel is which everyone listening distance of the hostel is its I shared a room with three other people at Hmong vets right right so you know Massachusetts just said hey listen you know we're gonna allow marijuana but it's still kind of like a taboo thing right they don't want it getting too widespread so when I came here to the hostel I walked in and there's a giant bag of marijuana on the table and I was like I'm sorry is someone selling this is this like no it's for you man like we welcome all our guests like this you could have as much as you want how's these crazy shit man he reels smoke box the other day yeah I think I'm just starting to be non not high really from that from the other day so is it out I don't know if he's really see yet anyway he gave me a bag of weed that every time I open up the trunk of my test that's all yeah whoa so what so one over a skunk I'm not very familiar with with smoking marijuana I think I've done it like once oh you were the government I don't know I don't like once and it's like I try to be cool like yeah you smoke right I'm like yeah who doesn't right man so I was told they offered me this big bag of weed I was linking terrified you should be because the thing is like if I try it right I want to be where I'm somewhere safe you're gonna do coke meets only marijuana it's not like you know you don't want to freak out right that could happen and you you should only take a little so if you're gonna if you're gonna this is what you do yes a little yeah just a touch you know it's like there's a smoke box first of all be real smoke me no coma I quit maybe five minutes into the smoke box I was like what the fuck am i doing we got high before we got into the smoke box - yeah so it's those of stone so smoke boxes and you put who were you in a car it was like a dead case that's the car it's a old Cadillac look at barbecued I am I can't keep my eyes open wait that's you yeah oh my god can't believe you still smoke doesn't even look like you exactly I'm so high I'm in another dimension holy shit like your great-grandfather's oh look at me this world lighting but the that's crazy what be real does is he gets you in that car and then everybody has a fat tube like a big giant joint of the most ridiculous weed on the planet Earth there's none stronger so wide it's I don't understand what's the point of having a joint just go in the car and get high that way everybody's so hot you can't breathe there's no air in there when I got out of there my inside of my mouth was cooked yeah if he's never smoked weed he doesn't understand the hotbox concept all that smoke you're breathing in right so you're smoking it so you're getting high from that and then you breathe into other people smoke you get an extra high that's what I'm saying there's no air so why not just go in there and just really hey you know what I'm just gonna sit in here for five minutes get high yeah you'd get high from that I probably wouldn't get really high from that oh yeah you smoke every day no no every other day no Sunday's don't know but I've been taking this what is that the DMT this is CBD with THC it's ten milligrams of THC and ten milligrams of CBD so so it's not a lot of THC but it's enough so you just put those pills and like your coffee I just swallow it it's like a little gel cap well isn't that like not fun because it's not you're not smoking it oh yeah it's like a fish oil pan exactly but it's CBD oil with THC it's a hemp oil so you just you just pop it in you also swallow it no I take that back I did have marijuana chocolate when was this was like last year how'd it go nothing it was it was like nothing I probably take enough my friends like you didn't take enough so I had it and then how that's how worst our late oh this is dumb I just there got a little high and I was just like that wore off and went to sleep and it was fine I didn't take it off oh yeah you definitely didn't took it out yeah I was worried the other way yeah watch this is dumb and they have like five more pieces of Jobs Act Lee that's what people do the worst thing anybody could ever say when they eat pot isn't man I don't feel shit it's dumb and then they take another one yeah and then it kicks in and then it gets in your DNA and your kids are high and then you're on a ride you're on a ride for like hours really oh my god I have a friend who ate too many edibles and he was high for 27 or 28 hours Wow a full day later he was still high and it took like four hours after that what is this guy's doing a leaf blower what is that doing is making a giant hot box house Oh see some stoners like that girl right there they just get too high yeah like me so it wasn't the hot box like what can you not do everything can't be anything is it like getting drunk no no no no you get paranoid you get freaked out think about people you fingered in high school oh you start you fucking you you comb over everything you've ever done ever that might be even remotely questionable so why would you want to get - well I think there's a lot of the first of all that's - I yeah that's like paranoia yeah but I think it gives you like a self-examination that I think it's probably critical for people to just examine like maybe you would be thinking about your life yeah but she's gone like if you got high and started thinking about this job you're quitting like why the fuck would I stay with this job right god I could be here forever you start getting paranoid think about what its gonna be like yes 60 years old I'm still here and I'm I wish I took a chance but now it's late I know I'm tired of the energy to do it anymore or I left now I'm on Skid Row fuck yeah I do I don't think like that yeah so you think you think very positively yeah I think if negative shit happens like you should be aware that it can but - well on it I think is not empowering at all right I think what's important who was 90 years old and you lived a boring ass stupid life working at a shitty job but yes then someone gave you a chance he said rich how would you like to be you say 36 yeah would you like to be 36 again with vitality and youth and energy and ambition and you've already got something going on your YouTube channel with like four hundred fifty thousand subscribers yeah yeah what'd you think what would you be willing to do to try again anything you say anything yeah I wanted I want to be a killer yeah a fulfilled life a life that I enjoy well that's you right now so that's how I look at things damn I look at things like what would I like to be if I if I was if I was someone who was broken down and beaten by life and exhausted and I never took any chances alright what would I do now well I would say if I could be that guy that that is willing to just try to just take risks and and carve a path for yourself I would want to be that guy I wanna I would want to live a fulfilled life to your future so how can anybody could do that man anybody could do that that's not cost-prohibitive it's it's dangerous there's risks but but that's why it's good right if you knew you could be like if you play even play a video game in god mode and just run around shooting everything pretty much you can't die that's boring that's dumb it's boring what's exciting is you could die right yeah I guess it's just like real life yeah it was exciting his risk you don't want to be that guy who's just barely alive but alive right fuck that and by existing yeah I exist right you're live man so we worked it out you're gonna do stand-up right I'm gonna go hang gliding all I wanna do right now is just smoke marijuana and then going online is how one of the greatest jiu-jitsu artists of all time holls Gracie that's how you died really yeah man there's one of the greatest of all time but I'm not have lifted anymore Chile this have told me about this uplifting Binion's die what the hell's going to reward if you land oh great you're still alive there's no reward well you got to almost die flying around but now I'm confused you don't slam into a cliff bro but wait a minute you just said that it's this an exciting thing no let's not you could almost die if you quit your job right and then you take a path that you may or may not succeed on where you do succeed you're gonna feel invigorated you took a chance and you want it's like I got here look at that gentleman rushing away saw this right oh no what happened oh just a mishap oh no the guys left okay I just watch for a second and see what you think is wrong here in the first 10 seconds I can't believe I can't show this everybody online people know what's up oh my god he's not attached now not just wait welcome charge here the guy that in the blue he's the he's the like leader guy oh and good luck here oh crap they are flying and he is holding on tight but Hernan they are very high uh and they're going higher um just just to be clear this is a very this last four minutes this is like this last four minutes yeah turn around do you have any idea how hard it is to hold on yes - four - four minutes yeah even two minutes is hard how did this guy do this how did he manage to hang on luck I don't know like they're the person in blue is holding on oh my god got one hand do I do a pull-up and I say this yes I do a pokemen get my arm light might be able to the drag of the win how does he hang on oh my god it get down to the bottom it is amazing his grip strength is incredible his forearms would be huge his his grip strength incredible because oh what a chicken he couldn't wait till he got to the actual ground so I just couldn't I'm just kidding well I don't think the guy even really landed this is a very high definition video was taken on fire what's go pro go pro Wow proper way to land dick first fuck that he hit a rock with the locks Rams okay upon impact my right wrist suffered a fragmented distal radius fracture which required surgery damn son think so like he took a risk but like there's a reward the words that got an adrenaline rush that's whole will go hand gliding and stuff I hit up hang gliding parasailing all the water sports mmm yeah you get a little bit of an adrenaline rush you know I mean if you want to live for that little drug the little adrenaline drug go ahead what if you went hunting right mm-hmm and we also towards bicep tendon from holding on as long as you did what relative damn damn they like ya face hoping tomorrow Wow geez so what if you went hunting right and you didn't kill anything cuz it's still fun happens all the time yeah sure so it's not it's the thought you might catch something well it's not even that you don't say catch oh sorry yes kill something joy something no no something and something but I run it water down they called harvest harvesting it now they actually do throw it's not a pumpkin yeah fucking deer killed oh yeah yeah I mean it's difficult to do but if you do that's one of the reasons why when you do do it it feels like you accomplished something right yeah so that's the positive aspect of it the positive aspect of it is that there's a reward when you pull it off not just that you like serve I like I want to go running with the bowl look I loved you yeah I lived awesome yeah I guess that's a good way to think about it roller coasters I like roller coasters but I have kids okay I like roller coasters so my kids it was just for me I want to fucking Disneyland know you like them because of your my kids like it so I guess what I love it is why people like that they like roller coast conciliated ritalin rocks yeah it gives a little adrenaline rush yeah I feel uncomfortable because I feel like if I died this would be so stupid I didn't need to do this right but I did this for a cheap thrill and it broke and I went flying off in the free white boy yeah you know got a lace you know those weird carnivals that like pull up the Ronnie hokey looking one that you pull up in like six trucks and it like unfolds as like a checkers board dude came in my neighborhood and they had this fucking thing where you spin around really fast no way to the wall not for a pop-up I took pictures of the way it was said I think it's on Instagram you probably won't be able to find it I took pictures like years ago yeah the way this thing was like on like five or six different two-by-fours it was like on blocks I was so lucky and people were climbing in there oh boy I think your chances of dying at those things are like whoa how did you find that so quickly how'd you find that I'm a Google master good you're a Google master but look at that thing let's go stupid edit so you can see the stacks of wood that is so good hello jeez how they do that to balance it out because they put that fucking thing on a hill well so what were you doing there was your keys were on that no I didn't get on that thing but they you know you squirt the fucking gun little clown face and the balloon pops and you want to what would you nail at at one of those carnivals what do you like kill every not good at anything those things yeah it's it could be against you it sucks so I'll bring it back to aliens yeah yeah oh yeah I'm gonna wrap this up it's already three o'clock please please please yeah we've been doing it for three hours are you shitting me yeah what yeah for real damn alright if the aliens came to you yeah said rich yeah we're gonna give you this technology whatever it is gonna be yes but y'all can't tell anyone else yeah would you be willing to what technology hey well what if the government brings you to area 51 like Bob Lazar and they bring you down to the base yeah and they show you an alien spacecraft they go we're gonna let you examine this we know that you love to tinker and back engineer things but you can't tell anybody are you in I'll do it a heartbeat because you you owe us the rest of the human race like these fucking assholes in the government they're gonna keep you you telling us the truth yeah don't you think it would affect the whole world if we knew now honestly I probably tell you one anyways cuz the fact that they called the Tesla guy to go down there you of course you're gonna rat them out well that's who I would call if I was the government I wouldn't call some respectable scientists from Stanford cuz that guy's call some dude who would be like easily discredited right guy who maybe like a little fudgy with yes science reports ambitious maybe plagiarized a little bit in college yeah those are shit that's me yeah i would go with some guy whose was that otto tactic is that what the word what someone learns themselves is that what the word there's a lot right said the word there's a lot of geniuses out there yeah I just don't have the credentials very smart people and autodidact yeah take that car take that guy would you do that no I'd tell everybody why 100 percent why would you why do you entrust those out so you know anyone anything cuz I would I would want everyone to know well what are they gonna do with if I wake out with a live with myself really 100 percent yeah if the government wants to tell me some secrets let me tell you something I'll tell everybody yeah would you say that first I would definitely tell them I'm telling everybody realize they don't show it to me really yeah I would say don't show it but that's that's not progressing the human race forward because there's always the goal is for you to see it a confirming right you want to see a converting tell everyone you just be gonna say go I don't want to go I don't want to die and I don't want them to kill me so I would say listen you show me you fit maybe people have died already and we don't know it's deep maybe bro yeah look into it I don't know it would be a thing where I would in all honesty depends on what stage of my life if I was 30 years old and they said I'm gonna show you this you can't show anybody are you willing I'd be like yeah sure sure but at 50 I'd be like no yeah no I'm not making any deals yeah I don't want to make a deal or you tell me that I can't tell anybody about right I mean it's one thing if it's a business thing like hey we're gonna Apple is gonna show you the new iPhone don't tell anybody oh sure I won't tell anybody right fine but this is something what it would affect the human race how would a li how would the confirmation of aliens affect the human race you think yes there are aliens now what we're gonna do realistically you would have to have confirmation that was undeniable and your own eyewitness I'm gonna think you're crazy they'll shoot you anyway exactly I just think you're a fool and they'll just make you look like a dunce and no it would actually probably help their cause right because no one would ever believe you and no one would take alien seriously after that which is one of the arguments for like what they actually did with Project Blue Book like there was a guy named Philip Corso and J Allen Hynek was the guy was running Project Blue Book and one of the things they famously said after was over that they were they would just try to debunk things and make these things look foolish yeah and that anything they found that they couldn't explain they just tucked away but the things that they could explain even if the explanation didn't jive yeah came up with an explanation just to make people realize that aliens were bullshit right but he through the course of Project Blue Book studying now now you have to ask your question this question he through the end of it he decided that aliens were real and that we had been contacted yeah however you always have to question whether someone every is doing that because this is a new avenue for them to make money is this a new stream of revenue I'm gonna do the lecture circuit I'm gonna write books I mean if you're a guy were for Project Blue Book and then they shut Project Blue Book down you don't have any more money yeah you're broke and you decide well I don't want to work for the government anymore you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna write stories about UFOs the sort of podcast suck these assholes right I mean J Allen Hynek died a long time ago I believe right Google J Allen Hynek project Bluebook UFOs all right I'm pretty sure there's interviews where after he said he is sure after all of his time studying that there is and has been some contact yeah extraterrestrials what do you think I don't I don't know see me me personally I have zero experience right all right well so it doesn't spirits someone might what do you got what you laughing at you don't talk about looking into about this topic so this guy worked at that company I've told him told you about in in Columbus Ohio yeah he was a teacher of physics and astronomy at Ohio State 1936 so you think there's some real shit going down you think some real shit's going down I don't know about all the alien technologies are actually what about beings or aliens or something there's something going on and it has to do with that company and it has to do with everything you're talking about in Project Blue Book I don't know what it is that's very fake I know super something's going on guys I can't because it's it to me it doesn't seem fair to just go with the big conspiracy but there are facts that you can look up and find so once you get to the bottom of the investigation you'll have a report for I want to leave some of the gross stuff out yeah it's one of those subjects that inherently starts looking crazy until aliens show up there was like that what was that movie was them the recent movie with the the the way they spoke in like smoke Oh Oh God was that big arrival arrival if something like that shows up then all the sudden our perceptions completely change they'll wait undeniable there's like just some giant Los Angeles size gang floating over the continental US yeah we'd be like okay so has to think so why would you so if we let's just say we had a microscope right periscope whatever whatever you call it look into space really Oscar telescope yeah a periscope if it was a submarine so and we see an alien you know colony yeah I'm like Mars what would we do we'd study it yeah we try to communicate with it but would that be a good move like what if they came over to us now go oh look at these fucking dumb champs do you think these do they you think they're any foreign or alien species were think we're idiots a hundred percent of really think we're idiots yeah if they're advanced to the point where they've gotten control over their emotions and anger right I mean just think about how much tribal warfare grows on still on America in the world you know how much how much warfare is taking place how many people are dying how many innocent people are dying drones all that kind of stuff they'd be aware of all that they'd be aware of our polluting of the environment they'd be aware of our depleting the ocean of its fish they're just pulling in giant nets filled with what the fuck are you people doing they'd be looking at coal plants and the president United States the greatest superpower of the world's ever known saying things like clean coal like clean coal what do you think so so what do you think okay so someone comes to visit us right what's the dumbest thing that they're gonna notice the first you say oh wow this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen what's the number-one thing you visit our planet the number-one dumbest thing they're gonna see him just probably gonna think the pollutions the number-one dumbest like yours are shitting in the environment that you need to sustain you all right you're and you're doing this in it's not like you don't have the resources to fix that - it money yeah we have incredible amounts of money but yet the money's not going towards that yeah massive resources should be going to removing carbon from the atmosphere removing particulates from the atmosphere yeah like brake dust and all the shit that's in these cities and well you're these cars are constantly slamming on their brakes that dust you have to clean off your wheels that shit's everywhere right in your lungs baby it's fucking everywhere yeah and takes years off people's lives it absolutely does they would look at all that they would go go why aren't they looking at that like why aren't they why don't they have some sort of system in place to mitigate all the problems I've created in terms of like I mean oh they got rid of plastic straw right yeah keep keep the caps though keep the bottles to fine keep the tabs that you pull off of things keep PLAs - crap everything's plastic they think of those new disintegrating straws by the way ridiculous yeah it's like I want to keep around what stainless steel you should but you have to clean it though about that same thing you could all stab somebody if somebody attacks you yeah and yeah I'm sorry that I snapped their hunch a hole through them like that Walking Dead crossbow bolt yeah yeah I think that's the big one that we would that they would get they would go wow these people are crazy the other thing they would say is the nuclear power thing like when you find out things like the Fukushima plant they didn't have a any sort of back-up plan to shut the hell out shut it down yeah like you don't know what happens if your generator goes out oh well we're fuck well no it's fing Rayleigh nuclear meltdown and everything dies forever yeah yeah they didn't plan on that like that the fact that we they built these plants and they have no idea to shut them off like that's crazy yeah the aliens are probably like these people are their fucking mind they're smart enough to figure out how to harness nuclear power but what they use it for is to generate a steam yeah constant and it has to stay on forever that's why they put them near the oceans like these guys are assholes any sense yeah now the other thing too is that how would you let's just say things are going to shit really quickly right right there's a nuclear power plant that's gonna blow up any second now any second how would you are you like I know you're an outdoorsy guy you hunt you kill harvest as they say sorry how long do you think you could survive if things went to shit really quickly if you have to survive you have all the money you want right mm-hmm but like how long you think you could survive in the wilderness it would be very hard it's not easy and not only that you got to get through the winter so you're gonna have to build some sort of a shelter but it there's no winter here that was there I mean that's in LA but in Big Bear which is only a couple hours north in here yeah I mean there's plenty of places we could drive in a couple hours you could go to Big Bear and then you can go down to the beach you could experience the desert yeah you could experience a lot of different climates it would really depend upon where you were stuck and what what you would eat so the thing is if you want to stay in the LA area you're dead because you're not gonna be able to eat shit there's nothing here would you stay in your hello could you my great give your kids why you got to get out of here so you'd leave if you drive your Tesla right no way what no way who's a big debate that I had if in a crisis situation right uh-huh would you take the test Oh would you take what would you take I have a Toyota Landcruiser with a VA gallon gas - hell yeah I got a apocalypse 'mobile but so now I won I got I got shit on so much for this I said the same exact things I listened in a no shit situation I would leave the tussle behind who argued with you about the a lot of people I leave it behind I take my pickup truck yeah Tacoma that's right deal with gas 500 well you know in an emergency crisis situation you don't have access to the gap what if the gasoline didn't work the liquor store you fill it up with alcohol well run where we had the hurricane in Florida well now everyone was saying like you have that the gas pumps wouldn't work because the electricity was shut off and but the supercharger is still working you could get to your destination still unlike Tesla's use less energy it's like at the end of the day I happen to pick up truck with like two shotguns and like five things the gasoline and be fine I don't understand that yeah they also make tanks that you can put in your gas tank in your of the bed of your truck rather there are like these survival tanks the drive as far as you want hundred miles yeah and they've more and they that you drive thousands of miles there's a guy who actually there was a podcast that I listened to this guy who is like an extreme prepper and he actually made a trip with one tank of gas yeah from Arizona to Canada damn he drove all the way up to Canada all the way across with one tank of gas because this massive tank on the back of his pickup truck right feeds directly into his primary gas tank yeah yeah and you can get these they're like these survival tanks and you know the hosts like hundreds of gallilee you're also a turtle I probably shoot I probably shoot it the guys car do that I don't know how sudden you're lawless yeah the lights go off for five minutes want to kill everyone you're starting fires shooting cars yeah so so then alright so you leave you take your family right you have your kids of your wife wait where you gonna go you hop in your Land Cruiser where you gonna go you have a real power what are you gonna bring you well you would have to bring things to start a fire and things to kill animals right those are the things that it would be important I would bring guns right I'd bring bows I'd bring ammunition and arrows but I would realistically realize that first of all I'm not gonna make more bullets and I'm not gonna make more arrows am I gonna do and how long am I gonna last marijuana no okay no no I'll be just trying to stay alive yeah but you'd also be trying to stay alive for a long period of time right you might want to bring it that's the pain no really what no it's not gonna that I mean marijuana for pain relief I mean I guess it works yeah that's not what I use a pain at night of the impending doom years yeah you'd be freaking out even more I'm freaking out plenty yeah I may be out I mean I just there's no there's not room I would bring water for water purification tablets no food that would bring food I'd probably being food in the form of heavy-duty bars like that take don't take up a lot of space but dense and nutrient-rich like there's those green belly bottom bars yeah something that has a lot of calories high calories in a small package a small size all right where are you heading yeah exactly going Goods yeah you got to go somewhere where there's animals and even then you're not gonna make it and your kids are probably not gonna make it that's the real thing is true.you the idea that you're gonna live off of animals this isn't the Serengeti man there's not a lot of animals unless you're somewhere where you can find a lot of fucking animals all right like rabbits and shit you got to keep them like you're gonna have to kill them every other day because they're not gonna last with the heat and your kids not going to eat our dead rabbit for sure yeah they'll eat a rabbit yeah my kids leave pretty much anything you got to start a fire yes really yeah but it's not easy no it's not if you have a string and a bow and two pieces of dried wood and you know hardwood and a softer wood you can do it now you can do it but it ain't easy like starting to bow with one of those yeah now two months that takes a little while really but it's not easy you're better off of a flint if you have a flint and a piece of metal you can start a fire pretty easy mark yeah and also you want to bring with you some tinder you wanna if you have some dry tinder she been out with you too but you're in for a world of hate yeah now the world of shit if you want to really survive right those whenever I watch those two viable shows which I love by the way that I'm ready into that shit they're exciting yeah I mean in that should I do a yet check it was asking about this guy YouTube kind of fed this to me the other day self documentary of him spending 300 days on an island by himself she got dropped off with a satellite phone cuz he ends up getting hurt at some point yeah you couldn't don't hand off no I'm not showing on here cuz there's lots of views you can look it up 200 days alone he he does it at the very end of it his friend meets him and he shows him what he's been doing for like the last two weeks all alone this is a volcano on this island yeah he looked like he freaked out he's basically cast away at the end of this fuckin vacuum oh yeah I'm sure pretty cool look that's a fucking hard thing to do just for your mind I didn't do that he's weaving together ropes and shit yeah yeah fuck you they put you want an island Holly the Hugh glass I probably last I'd make it maybe 45 minutes depends on if I knew that my family was still alive yeah I will make it really yeah I'll figure out a way to make him a little pig oh oh my god for a little while I thought it was dead he's gonna kill it no no no he kept it as a pet and I could ended up running away how did he feed it he feeds it he told you shows you what he does it's pretty wild so that well it means he's on a very animal rich environment if he's on an island with pigs trapped it gets something in it so did he kill any pigs I didn't why honestly did another tire thing that's not messing around it I didn't watch the whole thing because it's true drinking the pigs is how you caught fish guys drop them off he just said don't come back for 300 days he charged the batteries for this footage you have cell phone chargers to use satellite or use solar power a lot of guys use those when they're really but yeah my friend Adam green tree yeah he lives in Australia and every year he comes to America and he's a bow hunter and he do like a one month trek solo yeah in the mountains hunting for elk and he uses these solar panels the lays out a charged battery packs and charges his phone and so he he got very famous on Instagram for documenting all this in his Instagram stories yeah like he got an altercation with a grizzly bear and he was documenting it like he could see in the Instagram story the bear standing up no shaking at him and and coming towards him and he's got a pistol out it turned out the pistol was jammed did you throw at the bear then he didn't he didn't have to but he had it pointed at the he didn't even understand that the pistol it wasn't his pistol so yeah let him borrow it for personal safety in the forest and the bullet was the wrong size for the pistol I could have blew up in his hand if you're not careful but yeah something who knows yeah not good but he's fine now he's okay okay Australian man they're a different breed of people have some shit down there yeah
