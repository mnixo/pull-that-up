hello freak bitches it was the most brutal injury is I've ever have you ever seen one of those before have you ever seen a skull get crushed no I actually had my skull fractured but not like that that was one of the worst things I've ever seen how did your skull jerk I got kicked in the back of the head and the guy had a steel plate in his a shin guard in China what in his shin guard yeah so he had a shin guard on with a steel plate in it yeah you know I didn't really think anything of it at the time you know this is like 10 years ago you know we would just fight all everywhere anywhere or whatever you know and and not really think twice about it and I so I fought he kicked me in the back that I got dropped got up ended up knocking him out fought again the very next day why ya not knock this guy out too and then when we got back to the states out like I was having headaches all the time and I just thought I had a bad concussion you know but like up to like almost like a month later I kept seeing these like flashes of light anytime someone would ever touch me you know I'd be working with like little kids or girls and smaller people and just them touching me I'd get this like jolt and it you know it was kind of freaking me out and I was getting ready for another fight and I had to get my MRI or a cat scan I remember what it was and they're like yeah you got an inch and a half crack in the back of your skull and they're like I don't know why you're not a vegetable right now you should be they're like if you even hit that again you'd probably kill you doctors always say that though yeah of course fucking knocked out one more time I'm dead yeah you know it was one inch closer to my spine I'd be dead it was it was it was it was pretty rough thing to happen and I couldn't do anything other than hit the bag by myself for I don't remember how long it was to like it let it heal but but it was a toe just essentially out of clothes on its own you know just like don't get here wow I was getting ready for a fight and I actually still tried to fight anyway the doctor who the doctor who diagnosed it was the doctor for the fights oh that's hilarious like dude you can't fight get out of here how long after that was the fight after the diagnosis like week I don't seek a fight with that fucking chick you know that's that's just kind of the mentality I had coming up you know and how old were you at the time 25 so he just felt invulnerable no not really I mean my mentality from the beginning has always been I'm gonna fight as long as I'm breathing and you know I've gone into fights with some of the worst injuries ever broken hands broken broken skulls broken faces and that's just the way I came up you know like you're gonna fight no matter what you're gonna fight anyone anywhere any time any weight class and that's how I was able to get as much experience as I did yeah scientific research and showed the red cell generation can be accelerated if it is so in those circumstances then science has to update what are the circumstances where their cells can be regenerated it's like in 24 hours the body is not able to adapt to the circumstances where there is a lack of oxygen is have the oxygen and less and we go into the altitude on Kilimanjaro is a like 20,000 feet at the top so at say 15,000 feet the the acclimatization that the adaptation is not as fast in human bodies now we found this breathing techniques and using the mind and that enables us to accelerate that what they thought what science is thinking that that it is arranged autonomically so outside of our will and we cannot interfere we cannot intervene now so we will show that with a like 30 people by the way past January I did it with a person 76 years old without prior mountaineering experience and he did it in 44 hours don't 76 I mean it's a robust 76 year old right now but he was a good guy way yes that so was glamour and brightly phase his old life is dead he really transformed so um let me ask you this so the the standard of what someone can do as far as how much red cell red blood cells they can generate is observed and they thought that it was at 15,000 feet it became too difficult but you've shown that with your exercises and when your deep breathing techniques that you can actually accelerate red blood cell count consciously or at least not consciously you're through conscious action conscious action using the breath what techniques you use in the same what we did last time but then adapted to while you are walking and when you know first sign of AMS lack of oxygen in the head means headache mm-hmm AMS is acute mountain sickness and first iron is headache and that means a lack of oxygen inside the brain normally we are not able to get oxygen then at that moment inside the brain to equal the balance that this balance the lack of oxygen and I've learned just to do that so we tackle the problem and keep on able to perform in the extreme conditions even so through this technique of taking these enormous deep breaths letting some of it out and then trying to refill and then letting some of it out trying to refill letting some of it out yes and then you are you're forcing your body to you're forcing your lungs to constantly carry air yes that it is we use the lungs it's the passageway but it gets into the lymphatic system it gets into the tissue you know what we just found with the university in in Germany they found out that the devices that showed that we have hundred-percent blood saturation oxygen in the blood is not 100% we go more they found it out with so what they thought was 100% blood saturation there's actually a higher level above that yes and that's what I always said but now it's a it's like proofing and now I you know for people listening it might be in one of those valleys it's like don't try to just get through it mmm really ask you know why what can I learn from this that was my biggest thing is I stopped asking why is this happening to me and started asking what can I learn yeah so instead of painting yourself as a victim you paint yourself as someone who is present in the moment and just okay I don't want to do this anymore right let's figure out what's going on exactly and we don't a lot of times we don't have the tools and that's where things like life coaching and personal development come in handy because we can go and get those tools instead of using our old coping mechanisms by like being strong or overing over working over drinking over you know jumping into a relationship like whatever it may be we we don't really learn how to deal with disappointment failure anger or shame any of those things and so we're kind of left to these quick fix devices that you know I think that's a big reason addiction is such a problem is because we don't really learn how to manage emotion and how to manage disappointment and so we go for that thing that makes us feel better in the moment but the problem is we have to keep upping the ante you know the at first that one glass of wine does the trick but then you need to then you need three then you need vodka me whatever it may be and so I mean why I'm so passionate about what I do is first of all I never I never thought I could be happy like I really didn't I thought that this you know I I was going to be depressed and I just was gonna constantly be looking for something to fix me I never really truly thought this life that I'm living now was possible again externally things look fine but internally I'm talking about a totally different kind of experience and it's only because of those like really awful moments I call them expectation hangovers that I was kind of desperate enough to let go of my normal coping mechanisms and my trying to control everything it was like the ultimate and surrender truly of going okay like I don't I don't know I need to find a different way to deal with this and that's really what has led me down the path that that I am today [Music]
