what is that thing you say when you clink glasses sabasha it's like dyrus you know salute or you know nostrovia it's just the Irish version slide show Slainte / yeah likes SLA int II I believe it's house about nips hmm / I never knew that you said it before and always just let it slide so they want to seem like a dork yeah no I'll probably saying it real but I mean like you know Gaelic is some real harsh yeah like vowels and it's a crazy like I've seen Gaelic names that like were spelled insane and it was oh that's pronounced Shawn like that wild ancient language right yeah for real oh I love Irish people man I just I'm fuckin fascinated by the wildness of that culture well yeah that's what God made whiskey you know so the Irish would so the Irish would never rule the world when you see a guy like that guy like Conor McGregor that part of what is him is Irish he's like a pure like brilliant Irish you know I'm talking for sure most all the way motherfucker knows like a los knows how to take a loss takes a loss like a man it still talk shit you know I'm right back to my is it it's like that you know that that guy that you fight but he loses but you know you're gonna have to fight him tomorrow yes or so is his shit is healed up and the busted up Ness is gone it's kind of like a hundred million dollars in the bank he still wants to fight people still smacking people at bars yeah that's that's don't do that no not that who knows what the fuck the guy said to him but it looked like the guy was old as fuck someone said he was only 50 that the guy was only 50 dude didn't fold up though he just kind of sat at the bar Connor didn't really yeah he didn't even the smacking of a couple of fingers he touched you did what we call mu schtum schtum yes you can kind of be interpreted as hitting but it really Kwok ain't quite a hit yeah when you're a guy like that you're basically walking around a not to fuck people up because you have to kind of agree to not fuck people up the money he's got there should be like five guys around him to make sure that never happens yeah but they can't listen to him like if you have a guy like him he's gonna do whatever he wants even if there's a bunch of people around him stop at him you're not gonna stop them from doing checks when he threw that guy's phone down the ground stomped it in Miami there was all the bodyguards there he just did it he just did it he's Conor McGregor he's fuckin look he's living like you're supposed to live if you're Connor Gregor the dances dog go to jail dude don't get locked up it's also the the whole structure of the way things are now as far as like entertainment it's like guys it's all about eyeballs well he fucking figured it out man pulling I figured like in the most crazy way possible he figured out how to just blow up the whole system when you're a guy who has been fight I'm eeen I contacted him on Twitter in like 2013 right by 2018 he's worth a hundred million dollars so quickly and he calls it all the way and he calls it all the way that's Daisy as far as I'll know I called it all the way like I'm gonna be you know a billionaire I'm a multi-millionaire you know what Dana White said to me once about him that's dead-on he said he eats pressure he said that guy eats pressure he just eats it he goes he just he just goes in there and then the more pressure experiences the better he can perform it's true so I go look at the Aldo fight picture perfect left-hand knockout it doesn't get any prettier the timing is setup the patience the movement that the setting it up looking for him to leap in and blind catching him when he's coming I'm pretty sure he said exactly those that's exactly what he said he was gonna do right before the fight - oh that's me tweeting him in January of 2013 I saw his fight in I think it was Cage Warriors I think that's the promotion cage Wars or Cage Warriors I think it's why am i fucking that up Cates wars is it two different ones there probably is it's probably a bunch of cage stuff but in either way he was uh fucking people up overseas I was like this kids for real he just sees something sometimes he's he's like I watch a video see how a guy moves on my Jesus some guys just have something and he had just ridiculous timing yeah it's so relaxed in there those were fun trikes man his early days of MMA's like you can go back and watch him and you go oh this guy's going to be special he's got like a weird sense of timing you know it's like he's just very good at understanding where you're at no not to put it all he's had me when and you know the I were you know you know how I was thing that's it oh I love it yeah when he was like we all fight together look when he's in the room like if he wins a fight and there's you know the crowds filled with like 7,000 Irish people do you feel it like you feel like goose bumps it's crazy like you do everything you can to stop just to keep yourself from crying at the beauty of it this guy's standing there in front of thousands of people that have flown overseas and he's saying I only people fly over dude it's crazy they take over the fucking Vegas hotels take over like we you have seized the finish up there like 7th Avenue in front of in front of Madison Square Garden there's not a fucking fan on earth like Irish fans they're different I should think Brazilian fans were crazy until I saw the Irish fans they take over the whole Mandalay Bay was taken over by people singing it was all and doing a fair amount of drinking Oh fair more than fair but just the fact that they could do that that they can gang get together and sing the same song like thousands of them together singing the same song I remember the first time when we went to Ireland as House of Pain and uh in between saws they broke into the whole you know all the soccer chant stuff and we were just like wow this is crazy you know we never experienced anything like that they don't they had you didn't do that at the sports events at home back then not back then at all so that was amazing culturally it's it's it's it's it's that soccer - it's real Connor fight in our once he's got a fight in Dublin in a soccer stadium fuck yet right why not why not if he's ever gonna fight again don't do it I don't you know that I think the idea was that it's like more money and pay-per-view if you fight in Vegas you know in Vegas is worth a lot of money he doesn't the time have a lot to do with it too when they got European thing they're gonna do the whole weird time thing over there so they can accommodate the pay-per-view here yeah I'd be real weird they'd be fighting like 4:00 in the morning it's always real weird to me when I wake up and there's like a South America fight didn't happen at noon and I'm like oh yeah I missed Japan like Rison if you try to watch rides and they have it in Japanese time that's how pride used to be we would get up at like we would have guys come over my house and we would watch pride at like 3 o'clock in the morning like sometimes they would have him live for some reason if I'm remembering it correctly sometimes they would have him live and sometimes they'd have the fights and you knew what happened but you didn't get to see it for like a couple of weeks they would delay it in North America for some strange reason they didn't didn't didn't totally do it live I was hip to that MMA share thing a long time ago they always had the bootleg videos and ties how anybody that's like Voldemort don't say that did I just mess up thought it was gone anyway that was 10 years ago dude UFC is gangsters with that like it used to be you could watch those and then I overtime use that because they can Europe before like there was things like fight pass and thing like that you couldn't find a pay-per-view if you were stuck over there 4:00 in the morning in the middle somewhere so you would lean on whatever you could is a fan and but the dates that you started seeing there shutting them down like it doesn't they're they're gangsters the UFC are gangsters yeah as a it's a big money business people fucking people - impressive is what it is it's impressive it's like there's like there's a army of muhfuckas somewhere going oh yeah oh yeah some of it must get through right just everything the internet just have stuff that gets I don't know I got the fight pass now so now everywhere I go it's I got the fight pass and the little you have that look static IP address so like when you are out the country you can it's perfect as perfectly normal you know what's weird why aren't they showing why like I need to ask the UFC this why don't they show like the height like that knockouts on their Instagram page they show when the knockouts over yeah I noticed that yeah I do not understand I don't understand because once everybody knows they know everybody knows they know it's not hurting anybody to watch it like it'll just hype up the fight replay business a lot of business I wonder what the replay buys are like the cats who just missed it and bought the reef flat maybe that for sure I'm sure they probably make a nice second round of money on that replay right like so how long do you think they should hold off for like a we a or two ma'am yeah we we can then put the highlights on shore do they do that do they ever show I get this weird impression that they only show like right after the finish on Instagram now no they have they'll show entire fights on Instagram now but all rights like all face yeah so like pretty sure they showed steep Bay just pulling off of DC was that the case that was it yeah I got my whole phone got blown Oh cuz apparently I'm right in the back when that happens I don't know I have a seated but blew up right there that was that fight was chaos that fight was ki was fun I had an amazing time that card I should say that card fight card was chaos yeah there was a wild one man in Anaheim it was hard watching TC get hit with those fucking body shot oh yeah dude soon as he'd start digging in it was like oh wow something's happening dudes deep bays nasty he wanted that belt by shots he took incredible you know we were talking about Yolo the shot steep eights hook and I walk through him like well I was crazy because DC managed to put him away with one punch the first time I didn't see coming yeah yeah see incoming everything got hit with was hard as hell but he saw it all coming yep let him get in that little right in his chest area cuz that's what he got that short one on him that last time that's exactly what happens if you're not prepared if you don't think you're gonna get punched and you relax for a minute and then you get punched by something you don't see coming you can get fucked up and when you're in a fight with a greco-roman wrestler of the caliber DC knows how to manipulate you and he just been manipulated him perfectly into that right hand and it was a beautiful work of art but he was never able to hit him like that in the second fight like as cleanly and have that kind of an effect the shots he hit him with were pretty good shots but steep they ate him and then you realize Oh Steve I can't take a fucking shot he just got clipped you just got caught he could take a fucking shot and he was there in the fourth round which is really impressive like in the fourth round he was looking good he recognizes him soon as he touched that net never shot that it was yep Wow something happened there and it hit him he dug in like four or five straight times man cannot let a guy like that punch you in the liver that many times I'm sure DC obviously didn't want him to do that but that's how good Steve is selected do you see them yeah I respect DC I love that guy that was he's one of my favorite people to do commentary with man for sure he's he's the best he's so fun he's hilarious like when when Rose Nami unis not knocked out that is what I love like he's a friend Roman he's so free that in the middle of like this crate we're calling a world title fight he's just DC he could be himself and it's uh he's got a great personality man and he's a hell of a fighter and he was dominating in the first round you think he's gonna go he gonna go find a camper I think he's gonna want to fight steep again if I guess if I really guess I mean if he wants to do it again he's gonna want to fight steep pay again because he's gonna want to what I think the way he described it is right that wrong that he did he just didn't fight well he didn't listen to his corner I think that's what he thinks it's like he fought really well in the first round and then Bob Cooke was yelling at him in the second round keep your damn hands up you know and he he was like walking him down like almost like disdainfully like walking him down and I don't know if that was part of strategy to psychologically put up a lot of pressure on steep a you know to try to establish that steep base done that he's the champ now but it was almost like disdainful but steep a survived so and he just was there and he was in there in really good shape and rounds 3 and rounds for that was what was really impressive I was I was amazed especially I have to getting fucked up quite a bit in that first round I mean there was a couple times where I thought he was gonna be fit like dude was gonna get him yeah DC was all over him in that first round and when he when he picked him up and dumped them you're like Jesus Christ DC's good yeah Jesus Christ he's good he just didn't maintain it that's exactly what it was and then steep they made the adjustment and you know who the fuck knows he might decide you know what my body doesn't want to do this anymore I'm done I know he made a ton of money and I know he's really good as a commentator and he'll would he'll do that forever for sure or he might don't want to do it one more time but then there's always John Jones were lurking man John Jay felt like everybody knows like that's the biggest rivalry in MMA isn't it isn't it yeah I mean the only thing you give if you're gonna talk about accolades of of Cour means he has everything all those championships but there's that little asterisk yeah on the on the light heavyweight belt that he never really got it from Ryan but that's the weird part about it right it's like when you're a champion but the champion who's the real champion didn't lose it and then they have an interim Jim what are we doing here what does happen is he gonna never come back and and and shown that he's still him like and hopefully God willing for him keeping all his stuff together and it yeah it would have been different if he just kind of fading in the distance and then it changes that narrative but he came back and he his original thing was like you ain't that guy I'm that guy still yeah it was crazy I mean dude that's how crazy good John is really that's how crazy good John is I'd love to see that dog and the way DC was able to beat Rumble twice Rumble to me was always the smartest guy out of this is my dude that's my dude he's so ferocious his punching is so fucking explosive man he's just got so much power when he knocked out Glover Teixeira with one punch I was like who then I first met him he was he was a much smaller dude 170 yeah yeah he used to work out with some friends of mine that we used to work out in this though I mmHg them was off Melrose and La Brea thing was called La MMA at the time or something like that and he before he wound up in Colorado I think you know but no I've known that dude a wild man he's so good to take you lessly powerful he's a really nice guy yeah it's good to his fucking powers preposterous though like but it was and then when I see him come back in on the 205 that's what I was yeah just my dumb people at 2:05 but it was interesting man it's is his retirement was like one of the most honest and like it was like he was like happy with it because he was like man I'm not a fighter on my ass leat I just just good at this like wow that's really that's that's interesting interesting weed now and and mazes dogs and likes French bulldogs just a grappling competition against this guy Craig Jones who's this Brazilian jiu-jitsu guy from Australia that's a murderer he's a leg block specialist to any carnem in a leg lock it's crazy to see how big he is rumbles like fucking I don't know he's gotta be like 260 pounds like no bullshit he's huge I'm sad that's like I say we sat next to a fighter laughs not the last fight I went to but whatever the one last mile before that in Vegas bro he looks like a fucking super heavyweight he's so big it's ridiculous yeah he's just not even thinking about losing weight for fighting anymore I wonder what would happen if he decided to come back to the heavy weight like no bullshit as a heavyweight if that guy I mean did you know crazy would be if that guy wound up winning the heavyweight title you think of the rumble career he wins the Ultimate Fighter as a 170 it gets all the way up to 185 can't make 185 misses wait right misses it for the Vitor Belfort fight I believe a big fight then he goes up the light heavyweight even goes up to heavyweight foot beat Andre Arlovski in I think was the PFL and I think it really beat him badly if I remember correctly I got broke he broke his jaw so and then I don't know was that anyway that was a heavyweight in the PFL it wasn't in the UFC and then comes back to the UFC comes back to UFC as a light heavyweight and just flat behind people yeah you would see him hit people who just go wow that guy's scary timing - excellent timing you know he it wasn't just power Rumble Johnson UFC return could be on cards of prices right yeah that was when this is from recently yeah after his grappling match oh really I'd you like two months moody he's so big right now I would think he would fight heavyweight everywhere him and I really think he's him as deep a he was torturing his body for so long to make 170 I never saw anybody lose well we got 270 800 pounds over what he fought it is gain that is so crazy a hundred pounds more than what he weighed in when he won the ultimate fighter that's insane that's insane god bless oh my god 278 oh my god a hundred and seventy oh my god he was 170 170 pound champion becomes a 278 pounds heavy weight and it's like where did he how did you do that where is it just it's crazy that guy's power is fuckin undeniably preposterous what do you make of Brock trying to pick a fight with John Bell so that's so silly that's just talk what I was gonna say about rumble is that even though Rumble was that that good and that scary DC handled him man DC a take a hard shot got him to the ground that was Rumble ds1 70s right then now he's enormous but DC was the guy who managed to handle that yeah crazy and that as DC is seemingly easily will he won he was you know one that can handle him I didn't think that was gonna go that way like I said that was my dude so I was routing heavy for him well he's he's a special guy when it comes to wrestling he's especially talented and I think wrestlers they know where they stand in the wrestling food chain and when you get gripped by a dude like DC like oh Jesus is Olympic caliber wrestling that's beast mode he just starts smashing and he was able to run his way through the heavyweight division you got to realize before he lost his steep a fight he had only lost one round ever at heavyweight really arguably and that was to Josh Barnett I think that was like one round that he lost on the cards and Josh Barnett is you know a legend a fucking the youngest-ever youngest-ever you have seen Heavyweight Champion Josh Barnett brilliant guy - do you know Josh not personally no fucking brilliant guy brilliant guy so that's the last round the DC had ever lied lost like one round as a heavyweight he's just dominating people with his wrestling in his hands be he was just fucking people up but just that's how good steep a is man people slept on steep Bay you know people thought that DC was gonna run him over again like you've ran him over the first time and you know I think DC prepared for a long and arduous fight but Stieb a he's a big big man big giant heavyweight man he's a long tall dude a long frame and DC weighed more than him during the fight after you weighed like six pounds more than him something like that but it's just built it's a justice just didn't meet it but I definitely come in like twenty or thirty pounds less than last time he came in less yeah I don't know it was 20 pounds but I think it was he was like 230 in this fight I think DC was 236 so DC came in like two came in lighter than their first fight but I think you know Stevie came in after like a whole year of waiting for this rematch like you're trying to figure out if it's ever gonna happen it's is DC gonna fight Brock Lesnar and Jesus you know it's like he was always waiting and then finally they gave him the chance to see him I hate to see DC lose I hate it's hard to watch man he's such a nice guy it's it's hard as much as I like that guy to see him get hit it's hard but you take all that stuff out and just look at his two athletes and what's deep they did was just brilliant that the whipping of that left hook to the body was just tax book man tax book it was fight another amazing fight up and so him that until they he gassed a little bit it looked like to me and the liver shot started happening you know it's also you got to appreciate the technique the way steep a threw that left hook was perfect I mean it was just these are brilliant shots there's no wasted movement the technique was pinpoint I mean he just he just rips him in there and he caught DC standing there and he just hit him with a hole hard left to the body and then once you realize he could do that more he just continued what they were doing then but he would go to it again and he got in again and then now DC is in a little bit of trouble and now he's gonna eat was gonna try to do take him down like using this spot was kind of still standing with him and he's not down but he's hurt and so it's how much is he hurt he hit with hard body shots by a very heavy weight definitely no those are brutal and and then boom he starts hitting them up to the head and drop some Wow that was super impressive like when you're calling a fight how often are you looking here and how often it depends on what I can see some I mean what you're saying is a monitor yeah it depends on how often like I want to see it if I could just say that's why I'm just curious like I'm not even I'm just saying a percentage-wise if you were to guess what isn't what about a third of the time you're looking at this and the rest of time you probably up here yeah maybe less than a third on the monitors I try to stay off the monitors the monitors will I want to see you know I want to see what's happening but they're like if they're off to the side I like pressed up against the cage then I can have to go to the monitors because I need to see like I'm comparing it to like other experiences like ringside experience where I'm like how often I'm like about a third of the time I feel like I'm looking watching spin the screen yeah I mean just because I want to there are there on the ground and I want to see what's going on with them with the arm that I can't see you know I mean that kind of thing yeah yeah it's a wild fucking sport man so while I was trying to figure it out the other day I think up in the lake maybe 60 UFC's man Jesus Christ I think so dude if I think back to the years and when I met Dana and Chuck and like ever since that day it's like anyone I call up and you know I'm blasting thing you know I get to go yeah I know your honor what else Agel dude I've you know you when I was when it was those days it was a whole different game I'd be it almost everyone cuz a lot of most of them were in Vegas yeah so it would be it would be easy to get there yeah those are fun experiences man trying to figure out how to pull up on Abu Dhabi man are you really I'm trying to figure out do I just buy a ticket and go or do I figure out how so you know any promoter out there that wants some job around holler at me you know and I'm just tryin to pull up on the Abu Dhabi fight and have that experience I'm gonna be watching that one from here we're gonna probably do a fight companion for that and one day I want to be invited to one of those you gotta come to one of those those are ridiculous yeah no that's their foreign I trust try not to get into conspiracies no no I'm well aware try to keep any well well naughty right this is the only way it goes south but even then it's fun it's always fun it's like it's just that the best thing in the world is like watching fights with friends and and laughing no I've watched it yeah it's a fun thing my most favorite way to watch fights turn the fan down at baths get y'all up man you should say things you just can't say you know you could talk about things absolutely never otherwise talk about and you could describe things with language like the whole all the language you could use all the language you know like when I'm doing the UFC yeah just like little kids are listening to this which is kind of weird right like if you say fuck that's bad but if they watch someone get the fighter could say it don't I mean I mean the fighter could say it yeah I think I think appropriately and intelligently placed it wouldn't be out of line but you couldn't overdo it or overuse it would have to be like you'd have to like pick that perfect the problem always it it gets in the way of doing the commentary right you're just any decision that you would make to use that kind of language would get in the way of the commentary because it it would be like it would be less effective like they would go ah this guy like why do you have to use it there true and there would be like judgment of like when to use and why uses and then they would like think less of what you have to say or be upset by what you have to say and that would be the number one thing if you're trying to do commentary the number one thing you're trying to do is take yourself out of it like I'm trying to do that I'm just trying to like use the best language possible to express my excitement for what we're about to see like this is what's important to me like I just want I'm fucked this is our fucking pumped I am these guys are murderers this is gonna be fascinating to see Yoel Romero Paulo coast of what the fuck that's exactly what we're talking the car on the way I was watching that fight like this like this this is me like like it's like one of those fights we just waiting for some praying the beatings they were giving each other was crazy man fucking two chiseled granite man motherfucker oh and a good it's gonna be in a Gucci model ad next we have for sure pick him up they're crazy the guy's beautiful they're both giant beautiful men with incredible bodies it was a man the fight was fucking fantastic and was so highly skilled that Paula Costa got is for real man he's for real if he can do that to yo L if he could stay on top of you l like that yo elves explodes on everyone explodes on everyone but that dude weather the storm he weathered the storm and he landed some great shots it was a very close fight though cuz you well hit him with some big shit too and yo L took him down twice yo we were we were you know it was my 50th zap Sunday so we were out Saturday Sunday Oh sláinte sláinte yes sir macho so like you know we were going yo well the old guy rep you know I mean you know for guys yeah we were going hard for yo out bro he wins best body at 42 all over the world the guy's a monster I mean who who has more like athletic length of their elite career than yo L because at 42 he still moves like he moved 10 years is he 42 - is it you know Cuban birth certificate would be like 48 you know that's what they say about that Luis Ortiz guy you know that elite heavyweight boxer from Cuba my friend - been friends for that the Cyprus guy I had him on the podcast with Joey Diaz translating it was amazing man to hear him tell his stories in Cuban I just wish I spoke Spanish I could understand it like coming from his mouth but having Joey translated and talk about all the shit that he had to deal with coming up through the Cuban Amateur sisters was one of your pockets yeah look at I gotta watch it that one got my bill that is preposterous that is one of them sculpted things you buy at Toys R Us right like a real live human he's so freakishly athletic and so powerful and you know it's that Cuban wrestler system he just the way he described it like that darn you enthrone my Jean you just become a fucking machine and that's what he is with competition he's just a machine he was clowning to in the second two rounds like that's why I was like kind of felt like you know was trying to get that guy to be emotional and make a mistake you know short but it was like he again he finished begun I mean he got the best of him in those two rounds in my book I thought he wanted close close not bad enough to be like bitching about it but like I would have flipped the 29-28 personally well the audience agreed with you when they read they were bored they were doing it yeah which is unfortunate because Paula Costa just fought an amazing fight and he has to feel like shit during the the poster site it's not I don't condone bullying any of that most of people that would boo would never get in that ring I would never get in that ring you ain't got enough money I can I've made a lot of money and that Conor McGregor it hasn't got enough money from sorry okay got a hundred billion yeah yeah man I like my consciousness you know I'm not getting in with Mike Tyson for any money you know cuz the problem is there that's a lot of researchers on the wrong side of things yeah for sure the problem is they're booing the decision it wasn't his decision he thought his heart out and it wasn't that ridiculous is my point to like it was like I would have flipped it but hey okay no it's I can see how that could be seen a hundred percent and you're a guy who's been some live to 60 fuckin UFC's yeah it's just um I don't know what the woo thing is that's happened in the last couple years woo like it's a second the whole crowd starts it's safe that's new that's like I wasn't around a lot there will be some soccer thing the person it's like it's like animals answering each other you're communicating by with the wus dude I never even thought of that that's so true the whoo that's a new thing yeah and I mean the last five or six yeah right what do you think it started when it's you know it when's the first time it popped up down south like a Kentucky or a North Carolina that's when I feel like I heard it first like you know that might be Ric Flair that might be a Rick might be a Ric Flair is that what that is oh dude that would make a lot dad now you fucking solved a mystery for me that maybe that would make sense if we can get some confirmation on this somehow someone in a someone asked this question on reddit if someone says you've been talking about Ric Flair so much that they might have picked it up from you sorrow a moment where it all connected like oh shit I started that listen guys like that are important to America the guy's such he's such a character in his prime with his suits jet flying alligator wearin I was a WCW guy man and Ric Flair was the man dude he was a like he's a character that made his way into what a thousand rap songs how many rap songs have Rick dude there's a whole like like hip-hop subculture involved with wrestling like I mean I was like these cats that I'm actually fans of Westside gun and-and-and Conway and this kid Benny they got this record label called Griselda but the the Westside gun kid is like a fucking wrestling fanatic like his mom or like he's like involved I think he's involved with like the WWE like doing merch and stuff like that cuz I see him putting shit together that's like definitely got to be licensed so I go that it's this is this whole subculture of like this wrestling and and and hip-hop it's definitely made its way into stand-up to now you know they have this podcast to store horsemen where they all just talk about Pro Wrestling a bunch of comics Tony Hinchcliffe and these comics Clues on that store horsemen Jeremiah Watkins right who else no he's not I'm giving out fake news fake news that's fake news but it's not fake this is delicious by the way very good delicious mad as companies from 1773 son they started in 1773 did you know that they sold whiskey during Prohibition for medicinal medicinal purposes I didn't know that but I didn't but I would I'm not shocked do they so this company kept making whiskey all through the Prohibition legally legally yeah for medicine so people that you know I'm gonna need a little medicine I just got a slew of new whiskey oh here it is that day it's Tony Ames cliff jaw nice Curtis Matt Edgar Josh Martin that's right I hope I said skirt is his last name right is that right so I said yeah anyway um so comics are really into pro wrestling too they even go live these dorks they fly out to like Wrestlemania and they go in the our save live same saying yeah same saying yeah it's become like a pit Nautica it's become a thing that people like to do like to go to these big wrestling events and groups of people whether it's musicians or rappers hip-hop or stand-ups they're going like for sure experiencing it exactly it's like the concert experience why rapper rapper so obsessed with Ric Flair cuz he's got it like 40 Rolexes Blair you got one famous rant that he went on limousine ride and jet flying yeah exactly you

know like I did in my special where I said you know Ric Flair and then I put the microphone out to audience audience goes blue like jeez you started that shit then dude you started the wound I don't think I did I think it was already going on I think everybody appreciates this guy it's like as you get up we can't play this right we're get in trouble but this is the as you you know you get older you and you see things like this you appreciate them for what they are like you could think they're cheesy when you're young but then as you get old he goes yeah that's fucking awesome the fact that that guy is this amazing beautiful golden mullet with those crazy sunglasses saying this all saying all this nutty gold pinky ring dude man that's a artist the guy's an artist look at this that's the male soap opera forever since back when forever children yeah yeah I mean when I was a kid it was Bob Backlund and Jimmy Superfly Snuka an Iron Sheik I don't know if you could have really grown up in America as a little boy and not had a phase at some point were you interacted with one of these wrestling organizations WCW or WWF when I was growing up and if you were like one of those kids is really into like all music and indie groups you know you you would go for some like fuckin killer Kowalski shit you would go you would try to find some people that were off the beaten path like do you know about this wrestling organization cuz there's a bunch of like weird little time dude when I was when the House of Pain like was like early on like you know but you know we were experiencing pretty good success like ECW had formed a crazy Extreme Championship Wrestling I think that's what it stood for out of Philadelphia and they invited us to a bunch it was the first time I ever really and I know it had happened before but their whole show was about cats cutting their faces open and bleeding during matches and shit it was insanity man and they had packed houses I mean I think dude bought it up like Vince McMahon bought it up and the guy who owned it or I ran it became one of the like characters within and I believe I've it's been a long time I'm old now I'm 50 do you see what Ronda Rousey did to her finger yesterday how about that man they big glued that thing together and she went back to work how about if I read it right she finished the tape she finished it taking ignored it until it was over and then overshadow it's bad it was guys it goes the hospital they put it back together again and then she goes back and finishes gangster dude that's dedication not a lot of humans it's also like I don't want to fight anymore I'm gonna go finish this movie things like this you know nobody was to cut the weight with their dough and I don't want to come back to that shit that's just the mindset of an elite combat sports or she just had that mindset there's not a whole lot of humans that was dealt with that that way that's crazy the ladies made out of bullets I'm going on my workman's comp from my sag AFTRA insurance yeah you shutting down production son we ain't finished in no scenes what chopped off a superstars finger yeah Jesus Christ her finger what if it was like I mean how far I mean it wasn't fault I mean row yeah that's a fuck without Dave the super expert ring yeah surgeons that's gone you speak you know it's do last last think it happened I don't know if we talked about it might have been after the last time I was on doing so I'm on a trip and I'm coming home literally about to get on the plane and I get this text from my wife like um I'm at the hospital I got a I chopped off my finger and I'm like in my head I'm like she didn't chop off her finger man I cut her she's probably got a pretty buddy stitches I was like okay that's pretty bad as all right I'm about it was like about a three-hour flight home so I know I'll be there soon as I can so I get there and I pick her up from the hospital she's got the big thing on and I get the story of she was getting in the shower and we had a you know a big glass swinging shower door mm-hmm and she fucking liked her she was like getting in like you know holding onto the like edge real quick as the door slams shut on it and just locked off the fucking hole like I know to the knuckle basically they put that shit back on fixed it up a little bit that was crazy now you just reminded me of it with the whole Oh Ronda Rousey is so it's it's amazing that they don't break more often they're so gentle much it would be over like if that part of might this finger like this is the gem you know the guitar on the fret hand you know if I lost that part of that finger um I got it's gonna take me four or five years to learn how to play with just these at least my friend Paul was closing a window and it shattered and cut his finger and cut through the tendons and his fingers like permanently curled and he had a bunch of operations to try to stray and out but then eventually just gave up they could never straighten it out it never regained like full range of motion from a window yeah like it's so delicate everything all this stuff is so delicate you know that's why it's great that's so ridiculous a us a glass door not sharp really I went home and looked at it like it's pretty beveled on the edges but the weight of it just lopped off the fucking finger like crazy yeah she was pretty gangster though I have to say she was pretty gangster what do you think of that scene where they put his hand in the fuckin actually posted I thought I think she don't think it's on her knee she posted the tip of her finger in the plastic bag as she took it to the hospital dude ice in the bag yeah they couldn't reattach but they it was like they were able to like extend it somehow and like and planted luckily the dude out right there there's a dude who was an expert at hand plastic surgery you know Wow hooked her shit up like it looks right this is pretty normal something happens to your skin like if your finger gets chopped off at the end there's a way to make it grow back right isn't there am I making this up it seems like I remember there was there's a way was if something happens to you tip of your finger oh yeah if you don't get the bunk and they they can't dad I think they said something like that but I get got her pink hot piece of her bone just laughs that's why I'm saying it's so shocking how it just lopped it off clean like a like an angle like whip and did wow you like that sound effect yeah I keep thinking that one day they're gonna come up the artificial Luke Skywalker type hands and that people are gonna want them instead of regular hands that's what I'm worried about Wow if they came up with an arm it would sound terrible though like metal or metal English if you had the skin like simulation okay I can play guitar with that maybe I'm talking about cell I do some wild shit I'm talking about self-healing bulletproof spider silk hybrid skin look at the government's work on mmm they're working on that right now they're working on some sort of I don't doubt him and I said I wouldn't you want to hear that wild one all right I went on you know one night fucking smoking I went on a little YouTube wormhole situation and somehow I don't even know if it's a YouTube video or someone else but I wound up on this video that was like world's smartest kid thinks that CERN blew the world up in 2008 all right and I'm like what the fuck so I go on this video right now watch this video dude and it's this young kid he's like 12 and the motherfuckers talking you know half the your you got to invest like 20 minutes into this kids talking about things that are super smart and it's kind of like to show you he's super smart you know I mean this kid and his dad's doing the recording I believe or a relative somebody very close to them and he goes into this whole theory of how he thinks when they collided the the electrons I believe in the in the in the super collider mmm sorry that they caused some crazy chain reaction that blew up the universe but they also weighed they've created an atom that weighed too much and he's the first 20 minutes is also explaining infinite parallel universes so what the kid was up with this this theory of like one atom weighing too much and way and if that being just enough to shift our University into a parallel universe so this guy have this kid had me fucked up because after I watched this everything I saw for months was talking about like it would be news guy on the on the news like I don't know what universe I'm in anymore or uh the Spider Man into the spider verse like all these everything I saw for like four or five months after what's in this video was like multiverse shit legend about multiverses and it's got me fucked up Joe I hear you look who it says there he claims it's CERN destroyed the universe during recent experiments which has resulted in us living in a nearby parallel universe instead you're welcome Eddie a lot of people think this is an explanation for all the Mandela effect thank you stuff about the Mandela effect Holly you know there's apparently a bunch of people who think malla debt Mandela died in prison right and like there's you know as far as I know he was released became president in South Amer you know from just personally you know but it's crazy dude what cuz it's not just this video it's like you watch it and that YouTube algorithm starts sending you down a whole bunch of it you know I mean you start hearing humor and it's like it's and then again everything that came out there was all these shows I would see or movies or news things about multum multiverse all of a sudden was everywhere around me it was fuckin Mehdi dude so I'm fucked up about that shit right now well if there was something everything do if there was something they could do that might open up a door to a parallel universe you don't think they would do it stranger things you mean yeah stranger things I mean things are strange right yes stranger things bizarro world you know what's the weirdest one is the the like the people that dismiss climate change that is the weirdest one to me so I'm like what is I'm trying to figure out what's the benefit of dismissing climate change other than if you work for like the oil industry or something well you were just lost a glacier yeah like they just posted a whole thing of 10 you or 80 like something in the 80s a glacier picture of it and I'm just now and it's gone but I'm not even saying like blaming anybody for it I'm saying dismissing it as an issue like let's pretend the people have nothing to do with it let's just I wish people had nothing to do with it because then we can go holy fuck it's getting hot how hot is it gonna get like we could just figure it out like if it was just record at this point where it's two degrees the oceans are hotter than they've been in do you know how people do that where they try to say well this is a natural cycle this is something that some people still say right okay even if it was just a natural cycle I wish humans weren't in the equation at all so there was no argument I wish it would just be like hey guys is getting really hot what the fuck do we do as if we had no control over whatsoever not saying that we shouldn't take steps to fix it we definitely should but I'm saying that if it was impossible for people to have created it and it was happening around us maybe we would be for us to do something maybe we'd be forced to like go to higher ground get the fuck out of the really hot spots you know make your way towards Canada like I mean maybe that would what's what we would do if there was no other way but we know that at least part of what the problem is is people at least part with the problem but so many people start they want to start arguments about that and fight that and to me it's so strange it's like what's the benefit of arguing against that it's happening I don't understand like it's happening you see it getting warmer you see the statistics you see everybody freaking out though the amazons on fire have you seen yes no it's fucking horrifying photos from there just and I believe it's purposeful I I have heard that that is that some people are being burnt away on purpose is what I'm if the things I've read over understood the diamonds where their truth because again now that's one of the things we would be are saying is mission is you've got a question everything now truth has been compromised men you know I mean no matter what side or whatever you are on truth is been cut has been seriously compromised because there's a counter opinion to everything and if you're not adept enough to really get involved in fine factual information you can literally counter any argument there is yeah with with something oh I said well I read this well I read this okay well that doesn't mean either one of those things are true let's go find the truth you know I mean it that doesn't exist anymore because it's that people just want to Google that shit get on yeah and move on with their day you know and and it's laziness on our part and a lot of people don't want them it's like fucking this thing that everybody's posting with the goddamn fucking Instagram I don't give you permission you know use I read a whole other thing that says the average American I believe signs one or two legal documents a day without reading them and just by logging into shit on your phone Amazon or Instagram or whatever you every time you do that you you subscribe and and and and adhere to their terms and conditions and some you think a picture of a copy and pasted Instagram thing over something that was from Facebook fucking 12 years ago is it's it's bananas what's bananas people get roped into things you know once per person see small doses and better safe than sorry yeah like yeah I've seen that too what argument is that they don't know how to internet internet I'm just saying even if it's like you suspect it's wrong but you know fuck it anyway wait wait that's if you suspect it's wrong take the extra time or just don't do it at all yeah like what I'm just using that as an example of how why what the state of things are as they are yeah it's a sneaky little loophole that's a sneaky little thing that happens to you you have to everybody's posting something stupid did you send it to me oh whatever lesson to me it must be legit you know I mean how many times you've done that I've done that all post ism clown in it and then immediately after it Dana came up it was him what the whole night better safe than sorry think they got everybody though they got that fucking Perry guy party every party isn't big Perry's job like fucking protect the nukes or something like I saw governor someone posted to Rick what is Rick Perry they said Rick Perry but but but he has a specific job and her government is like energy the energy secretary he's like in control the nukes right is that what it is energy secretary yeah you are I don't know whatever the fuck he is he's got a big job and you fell for it oh it's bizarro world we're in bizarro world maybe that fucking kid is right I'm telling you dude you're yo you're gonna be calling me in a couple nights like fuck you dude why did you even tell me about them I really balanced the idea of multiple universes many times we all have but this kid watch it just you're gonna invest it give it to twenty minutes or fifteen eighteen minutes whatever it is and then you'll be like oh wow it's it's not that it's a fact it's but it's like wow that's super possible it's super super possible the way he breaks it down what about this what if every time you went to sleep and you woke up you passed into a nearby and very similar universe but not quite the same and depending upon your choices and how you live your life it's how you wake up and what new one you pop into on the other side and everyone's just a little bit different the whole world changes just a little bit each time you make a decision one way or another everything changes when you wake up you think the world is static because it is when you're awake you have no fucking idea what's happening while you're asleep and when you wake up again you have this foggy recollection of the past and that's what you're going by you're going by every morning waking up with a foggy recollection of the past that's what you're doing and here you're assuming that nothing's changed and everything static and while you were sleep for eight hours nothing weird happened you know the fuck you're talking about you have no idea you're dreaming you're having crazy fantasies that shit weird stuff is happening you're fucking mermaids you're flying through the air on a on a helicopter you know you don't you weird things happen you dreaming what is all that about we don't even know we have no idea what that is that's super possibilities it's fucking swirling around in between your ears while you're snoring up a storm and then BOOM you wake up are you sure those memories are real are you sure this isn't a whole completely new University living in today or simulation or simulation there's some Isis simulation right there there was some fucking another genius super wizard kid who was talking about that that something about simulations I forget what I was high at the house with my with the guy who runs my studio divine and and and we were just fucking laughs and talking shit one day I like like what if like I may have heard this could have been on your show I could have read this so I'm not claiming respond with the thought but it was like what if like we just come from a universe like that's so perfect and shit and it's boring as fuck and we just plug in to have all these fucked up like weird problems and that's why everything's getting fucking weird or in crazier because like that's kind of why we're here that's part of the ride you know that could be it it could be the only way you appreciate love is to know hate they'll really appreciate it and it could be the only way we would appreciate all the good that we have is to balance it out with all the bad that we have and when they start to overwhelm each other one way or the other there's an imbalance it takes place and it leads to all of our fucking problems as a society and when you you think about how long you're gonna be alive and what it is that you're doing here why you're doing it you know all those weird questions and answers that go on inside your head it's all you're distributing energy right you're trying to figure out am i distributing my energy right my my living my life in a way that is like the best I can do with what I've got right now that's it all these mine folks that's all you got to do though I mean honestly even no matter what we're saying if you woke up every day and that was your objective yeah you couldn't really go or do much wrong no no you can't and what if every day when you did that woke up in a nearby universe tells just a little bit different because of what you thought and did dude that's like you know that's almost a magic type shit never last some movie some magic touch actually I will cows you know I just was like trying to be a not such a glutton there we go salut salut [Music] DJ melody over there is one dude Cheers how about Cheers let's go American guys women cheers Cheers Jay yeah you know you got a DJ problem the only guy ever I see the thing I believe besides myself is honey honey man oh yeah I think they're the only one other ones that have done music on the show right not totally true is that true you might be right you were definitely the first and then Gary Clark brought his guitar but we just I'm a huge fan of that I think Sturgill brought its guitar the first time he might not even brought his guitar the first time george'll Simpson Sturgill yeah I hung out with him once this a shop on Melrose they have a new song that he just released his new album is fucking incredible I got a chance to listen to it in advance before it's released and they they just released something on YouTube it's like this Japanese anime with what is the what's the the name of the actual video so people could find a single sing along sing along it's fucking amazing song but the video is cool as shit man it's all this Japanese anime so he did all of this they did like all these crazy animations he's it's like a film that takes place while the album plays oh shit yeah so it's all coordinated to the songs I mean he's been working on this shit forever he's been flying back and forth Japan and LA I mean this is a labor of love I like to ease out incredible I met him like I said it was my buddy owns a sneaker shop on Melrose and he was I guess a bit of a sneakerhead himself oh really would be politic want a stirred shit he's one of my favorite people yeah I like it I like to love it I did a music country kind of outlaw ish like but like big band ish yeah you know what I love about that guy he didn't even try to go for it as a professional musician until he was like 36 his wife talked him into it his wife was like you know you don't suck that's like what she said that's that's that's high praise she's like you're fucking good and he's and he went for it because somebody who wakes up with you and goes to bathrooms that you don't suck I mean that's what that's high praise you know but he had like crazy jobs like railroad worker shit like that like did a bunch of like regular jobs and just was writing music and singing music and then she convinced him to go for it yeah he's so unusual character man this stuff this all this new stuff is different it's like he used to be you would think of him as country like you can't even you don't even know what to say now with this new stuff is not country it's wild though it's really good check it out yeah it's like it's so this kind of hybrid rock thing he's doing but it's pretty fuckin badass this says Waylon Waylon had sex with squeen to the stone-age while the Black Keys watched first comment on the visit who said that whose name that guy top comment Shelby Riley Shelby Riley Congrats Congrats you won you won the Internet for the day for the day that is exactly what it sounds like really good stocking on he's a sing-along you said that was coming out I'm checking out now absolutely he's doing weird shit that's the only thing that element it's you know and I don't you know weird shit in the sense of like you know shit that excites usage this is like you know you know don't know I've never tried to make the same thing twice you know cuz it's like I want to be a side I won't be scared to fail yeah yeah I don't know I want to be like you know oh that didn't work next time yeah well you you've always switched shit up that's one of the more interesting things about you it's like when when you were doing what it's like and when you switched up to like whitey Ford sings the blues' everybody was like whoa like what is this is this is Chris is the jump around God is the House of Pain guy but it it it was a it felt so easy to digest for most people cuz this before I knew you and I was like that's so easy because it's so authentic like it's very obvious that this was like you the kind of music that you were writing was like music that like came from your feelings and your soul it was like wow this is real shit I was 20 20 years ago what it's like was a classic that was a classic that was one of those songs was like that's a heartfelt song that's a soul filled song you know that's like a universal song yeah I went to New York I had left House of Pain and went to New York was a buddy of mine and was just kind of sleeping on his couch and he had a guitar there I start strumming it one night and singing these little words and he came bursting out of his room in the back like what the fuck is that and kinda was like we're recording that tomorrow we were making a rap record I was like there to like just kind of further you know the rap career and nobody really knew I played guitar and stuff like that little mess but it was his his encouragement that definitely came back he liked when he was like I think he was with it broad back there and he just heard the song and jumped what the fuck is that you know I mean and and so the next day they basically forced me to record it so I had to finish right I had wrote it like that night I think I had the first part the whole liquor store guy at the liquor store thing but I didn't really have anything else but he heard that part was like yo we you need to finish that when you get those ideas when they come to you what does that feel like does it feel like like a gift comes out of the universe mouths the really good ones yeah you know I mean I I mean what blows my mind and I'm gonna flip it on you real quick is is the the the comic art arc of you get to work this thing out for a whole long time and if you're really successful on your level type thing then you shoot a special and that joke kind of goes away you can't you know really get tell that anymore and that blows my mind because like my whole thing is like work this thing out and build this thing that I can go out and play every night for the rest of my life so like you're you know me like so all the kudos being throwing back and forth when I look at you or any amazing comedian that just turns it around and every year two years is belting out these fucking funny ass specials and then like you can't do that anymore like you know unless you're Andrew Dice Clay with the little fucking hickory dickory dock you know you got the little you know you know and only guy ever that you want to hear the old stuff over and over and over again like poor I don't know see a whole set of just rhymes or even like

talk about the fuckers shit like right we were both like kind of little traumatized that's me and um cuz what happened was I put this record our last what I think October right hit the road and you know maybe two weeks in and get a picture of my house on fire home so yeah this records out but we're right now in the file right now I just shot a video for the for a new song and we're releasing cuz I don't everything it's my label we're just gonna release you know og Everlast on all of whatever whatever's you know formats you could find me do you feel like when you get through something like a fire with your family that like for some inexplicable reason you feel like a little bit closer oh yeah because I mean much wife and children were in the house when it was caught fire you know and so yeah not literally here's how it went down you'd stop let's tell the story right basically I guess I was in New York I get a call from the wife the fires right across the hill like I live literally like Simi Valley then the mountains bang I'm kind of the first line right there once you come over those mountains so I get a picture like from her like across the street from you to how the hills just like it looks like a hello landscape you know it I mean this fucking just on fire and so they're packing up and they're getting ready to get out and there's a fire truck in the neighborhood and thank goodness and as my wife's putting the final like stuff in the car like the kids or any nurse putting all the dogs and you know whatever the medicines and stuff we need for Leila and she turns around and sees like on the corner of the garage like an orange kind of glow and the thing about this is like you know people think the fire comes and his Street and then jumps and burns all these houses that's not what happens if you ever notice in the middle if you in the news shit it's like one random house in the neighborhood - trees it's having a tree right on your house that's touching your house well I happen to have a tree right there that was touching the corner of my garage the tree went up that thing caught garage went about a third of the house went you know I mean you know where everybody was out already my wife was able today only reason a third of the house and the whole my wife saved our whole block honestly because there's trees between every all of our houses like but for privacy you know because everybody has a pool and everybody wants you know nobody wants to be seen two-story houses all that shit so everyone just has these big huge like those just spiny looking trees you know I mean they go that cover turned into a wall basically right they all the whole the whole block would win her has she not been there and had the wherewithal to run down the block and get the firemen that had just drove Hyatts they come back and fucking put this out she actually ran she ran down the block and got a Dutch gangster the fines against we're out here was so it's so hard for people to understand what it was it was frightening it was like a war whose phrase like we were at war with a natural force it was very strange man is everybody was holed up together me and my family we got a hotel in town with a bunch of our friends we were texting the knavery we were texting back before and Tommy and his white Tom Segura and his wife they came over to and we were all on the same place it was like we were all like refugees for a small tiny period of time it makes you realize how fortunate we really are to be here in this you know this place like where we're at right now where we can just we don't have to deal with most of the bullshit that people are doing with all over the world man you know we just one day of fire one week of fire whatever it was it freaked everybody out and scared the shit and a lot of people lost their lives or houses rather a lot of people lost their lives in Northern California ya know that was that's like it's like even worse than them couldn't even it was yeah you couldn't even like really get a perspective like for your own shit because the minute you wanted to like do that you saw an entire town flattened in like an hour on the highway maybe we're trying to get out on the highway and they get caught in their cars and they get caught farm and it's horrible you know and there's you know for the people that survived like for us in the sounds ridiculous call yourself a survivor some like it was a war but it's it's something that you really understand when you get through that like wow like we are barely in control of our own environment barely and all it takes is one good strong wind one good fucking hot day of one good gust of fire and next thing you know everything's on fire I mean that was nuts the kids the kids are still dealing with it you know trying to explain that thing to the kids of like that Universal unsure D like there's just not really honey I'm gonna keep you as safe as I can but if you really want the absolute truth I can only tell you that some shit happens and you know that it was actually another big fire somewhere oh is oddly enough when Notre Dame caught fire it was all on the news and my daughter my oldest was like oh that caught fire you know cuz she always propose my wife in in Paris so like we talked about Paris a lot so she you know looks forward all that she wanted to see she was really interested in Notre Dame one thing Brian but then but something about that burning and when it did and she saw she was like oh it can happen anywhere any kind of and it kind of dawned on her like okay it's not just there that Polly because for a long time I couldn't even drive by the house with her like to go check on it or something and if she was in the car my wife either cuz she just didn't want to be over there and then after that it kind of changed and she kind of realized like well it's I guess it's kind of can happen anywhere yeah if it can happen a note which was a crazy thing to witness happen in a human like person like come to that understanding of like wow shit's just not guaranteed like in a weird way you know yeah but isn't there kind of um there's a magic of that yeah if you can get through if you serve if you're one of the survivors is a magic in that that doesn't exist without the possibility of that I have people asking me what are you gonna do and I'm like what do you mean are you gonna build the house in the same spot I'm like fucking goddamn right you know absolutely I don't live in like some crazy bizarro like place I'm gonna build my house right where it was tell you what I'm gonna do the house on top of a hill is but the sprinklers on your house like people have the sprinklers I there's neighborhood there was cats that whole neighborhoods burned down and then this one cow side the sprinklers that councils pristine the problem with that is you do get survivor syndrome you feel you feel weird you see get survivor guilt of the first three houses in front of me right in front of my house you know what right house is gone yeah I could understand that if if if you were like the guy who kind of futuristically predicted a fire and put that on and we're but after now it's like you'll if you didn't push shit or now you everybody knows about that shit now so put this shit in your house so you know if you're gonna live in one of these areas we're basically in California they're telling us now this might be a new norm you know I mean these kind of fires so you know so cuz there hasn't been one in that the area you know there those areas like look over the hills and Simi Valley there hadn't been one for all many many many like a couple decades I believe climate change is not real no it's fake its fake news it's something that if something's clearly happening right this is not normal right not in my 36 years so it seems like this has been an adjustment I've been the same Irish white motherfucker all my life and I didn't burn like this when I was young when did you move to LA oh I've been here most of my life like I was born in New York and whatever and probably did a um kindergarten part of first grade out there and then for the like my dad was construction dude like during the 70s boom of like Simi Valley and all that shin being built he came out during that era nobody talked about crazy why fires back then did they they didn't right not really first I got evacuated for the first time while we were filming fear factor and I remember I was driving home and it started there was a fire it seems like it was a little bit out of control but while I was crazy and I'm driving to work and then we filmed the day and then as we're driving home people are letting us know hey man this is bad this has gotten really bad and as we're driving home a guy got hit by a car and he got killed and I didn't see his body but I saw a shoe and we're like passing by or like all these people were freaking out because of a guy apparently just tried to run into the highway and some guy hit him because he was panicking because he was there was a bunch of shit going on there was fire I don't know if he was panicking but something happened he got hit by a car so his his ominous feeling somebody just died and we're driving down this highway and the whole right side is on fire I mean the whole right side of the highway for an hour like a Lord of the Rings movie Mordor dude like flakes of ash are falling from the sky like a like a light snow it's fucking strange you're just waiting for demons to come riding on fucking horses over the top of the hills it's that bad and by the time I got back we had to evacuate from our community and we just got the fuck out of Dodge that was the first time that had ever happened ever for me living out here since 94 and that was in like 2003 something like that and then it's happened twice since then it's a creepy feeling man it's creepy it's like you know that no one can do anything if everything goes wrong if everything goes wrong the wind gets too strong it gets too wide it goes left and it goes right and everything starts swirling around and ashes fly through the air and they land on other people's houses like you got to get the fuck out of there just get out of there's a storm of fire bliss like all right so that I get a picture the last thing before I get on a plane is a picture of my garage engulfed in flames alright so I get on this plane I got to take like three planes because it's like last-minute booking and it's all coach I'm pissed you know like I'm like I'm not just like tucked in corners on the walls like everything I did fly liked of to Dallas then to Vegas or just to get there the quickest and I'm just like three flights so I get there hang out the whole way there I'm like my house is burned to the ground you know I mean that's such I'm accepted I'm I'm dealing with those whatever five stages of grief then like I'm getting to acceptance and then I get home and I'm not even at home I had my wife and kids are at my studio and like you know that's where we're laid up from you trying to figure out the fuck's going on I can't get to the house because the whole 101 shut down that way I have to literally drive up to panga hit the 118 take that all the way out to like the 20 whatever it is the 323 or the 27 I don't know it's one of those 23 it's like out there and you come back down to come around the other way and I was able to get to the house I got to the house like God in my house literally had twenty fucking cop cars roll in like cuz looting was fucking out of control dude in there like Ogura in Calabasas areas parked it was Oak Park and well that's that's I don't think that is gora and the same thing but yeah the hole over there was fucking like off the chain we're fucking looting so like I had mom fucks pull up on me I literally knew like I brought my lease in my father and I my my mortgage and my electric bill and I brought my you know I had all my shit so laters in my house and and they were cool but it was like so I pulled up and like saw most of the house standing and like broke down because I'm a I'm a big art collector and okay so I was like I had already like just assumed it was all gone you know and you know it was crazy it was a crazy experience till I pull up and like see like 2/3 of it there and you're like wow like maybe there's Salvage or like in the salvage shit like it was like a crazy experience man I I'm grateful that my my family is safe and all that and all the rest of it is replaceable stuff but I got extremely lucky ya know that the most I mean it's like such a cliche thing to say that your health and your happiness and your family is the most important thing you know that everybody knows that even a fucking psychopath knows that but to feel it to feel it like in the presence of a natural fury like fires like wildfires it's humbling and in the strangest of ways it makes you love each other more makes you nicer to people all my refugee friends you know when we're at the hotel that night you know the refugees from the fire we're all like closer we're like happy for sure you know in a weird way you know we're having drinks together we're toasting we're hugging you know we're in a hotel hiding from a natural fury and you you realize like okay we we have we have we get soft when we hit a soft spot and that's not necessarily good for anybody and occasionally these are horrific things that happen are good for us overall because they let us appreciate like there's consequences just consequences to live in here there's consequences to everything being so hot and dry and never fucking raining and the fact that it may or may not be getting a little bit warmer maybe though maybe who gives a baby if people have anything to do with it who cares let's pretend that it's not even a factor something's happening something's happening we have fire storms like every few years a goddamn fire storm you know craziness man well we survived your brother yeah this salon sure sriracha so much so much it think about right you uh you know you haven't gone through that man the view written shit that has like the the touch of that on it I'm like in in like a very kind of creative state like state at the moment like so weird I don't know what's there's this I'm sure there's elements of it when I'm like starting to play with right now do you sit down right like on a piece of paper or do you write what you're no no yeah for me writing is a visual process visual yes and I can't if I write it down it becomes two-dimensional and I've never I've written lyrics that I thought were genius and actually committed them to paper and saw them and they be and they could it's like they dissolve from this three-dimensional beauty to like oh it's two-dimensional garbage it's fucking bizarre I know and it's not always like reasonable but it's my process at this point how's it visual um its if you really listen to my songs they're like photograph like it's like flipping through a photographic album almost if you really listen to like what I'm doing that's like very visual I see the pictures I equate it to like did you ever watch the show oz remember the poet guy who could was illiterate but he drew pictures and that's how he recited his poems from pictures it's similar it's like but it's kind of reverse it's in my brain it's it's there so you're saying your visual in in terms of like the the stories you're painting like you guy outside the liquor store or the imagery yes or like you know there's a song like black Jesus where it's like just kind of cultural like fucking pop culture reference after reference leading you on a path of just like stream-of-consciousness pop culture references you know I mean I'll go on tangents you know I mean but it'll be all within an energy the inside the brain you know I mean like once I commit them I even like after the fact like when you turn in like music - like entities that shows or whatever they want to know the lyrics so they can know if they should put it on air or this you know if I hands and whatever if it's public never but even when it comes to that I have to have softer like recite it to somebody and have them type it I can't it'll it'll just kind of taint it to me Wow let see it written so oh in my hand you know what I mean and in another hand it doesn't bother me but like for me to come to - it it it it kid like it breaks a barrier of some sort and then everything vaporizes so do you how do you capture the various beats do you record it as you're coming up with it there's there's a few different ways that happens for me like you know if I'm doing like a hip hop ish or hip pure hip hop project I'll do be a beat involved always first you know I mean there'll be somebody have a track and will be like oh that's the track we're gonna commit to this and we'll write lyrics to it and it'll be just kind of like I said I'll I'll Drive around a lot with rap stuff and just let it bump and see what words starts popping up I like wordplay and bouncing wordplay but I thought it can't just be wordplay for the sake of it it has to like tie into some sort of like idea when it comes to a song it's usually I string together some simple chord progression and and start and and see and and if I once I've see something I really like it'll just like I said pictures will start coming up and you kind of just try to describe the picture a little bit and sometimes you you come across poetry when you're describing the picture anybody that's good I mean there's a lot of like not that's not good there's no that's not good there's a lot of that a lot of that it seems like a mere process to stand-up comedy the mere process except I get to hold on to mine even if they record it and make a special I still can play mine and that's that's what I was like man comedians are just that's a little bit it's a different commitment because like you're you're bringing your like it's almost like a child you're raising that you have to watch the life of it finish in a weird way I'm not you know what I mean we build our children that's yeah extreme but I know what you say but like you're you're taking this idea from kind of garbage the idea that you know there's a premise there and then like over a fucking series of fucking shows or nights or fucking maybe months you you find it you know with different audiences and then you got it and yet you get to rock it for maybe six months good in all these places and then you go and record it and make that special if you're lucky enough to be on that level you know it's almost like I almost envy the comma yi I mean I wonder if you guys ever envy the comic doesn't quite have that yet so he can like he has this you know bevy of material that he hasn't had to trash yet you know as they talk to Roy Wood about that it was just on right before you he that's one of the things that he said that he shouldn't do TV for 10 years I don't do it's like have a catalog man the first time you do anything that people get to see like be hardened like we polish samurai of stand-up you know but I disagree I say let him see everything let him see all the bullshit all the stuff that sucks all the terrible jokes who cares just keep going especially if the progressions there then it's like oh you see let's just keep going and it's good for everybody see people don't want to think you just like someone who just figured it out instantly no it's good to see these sucked it's good for everybody it might be bad for your ego but it's good for you when your ego get takes a hit it's always good it's always good it puts everything in perspective you know don't you think like as an artist to like the thing that gets in your way more than anything is your ego right the thing that gets ya in the way more than anything is for sure the way you view yourself I wouldn't you want people to view you I wouldn't produce my own records until like maybe two albums ago because I felt like if I'd me through an album without being like seriously challenged I didn't make the best record I could and then just being involved with a bunch of really seriously good producers I learned to challenge myself and and even the records I've produced for myself there's other guys involved producing with me that are that I know are gonna be the ones if that's something that's sucked I mean I mean you can eat that guy around or or even a guy just to challenge even how committed you are to certain ideas you know I mean how much time do you spend going over like when you have a song and you're like I think I think this song is solid do you do you outside of singing the song do you ever go over the song and ponder like what you're saying or how you're saying it like how do you cuz your stuff is so it's so interesting because you're you're you're telling these stories of your experiences in these songs and a lot of them and you're also having fun and you're also talking shit you're having a good time with them as well but when you decide okay this one is gonna be recorded like this how do you make that conclusion for me it's again if there's not like because I I can also even if I'm not doing necessarily a straight rap song there's times when I get a track from a producer that I just love the track and I'll build something around that other than that it will again start with a guitar and I'll either create a very rudimentary drum beat and lay down the guitar and maybe a vocal and I have a very unique voice you know it's not like it's so there between the guitar and the voice tones start appearing that like resemble other instruments to me like it almost starts telling you what to do oh that's not that sounds I can hear our roads in there or I do the bass line should do that you know you can hear that and the guys I surround myself with are beasts that hear the same you know they know oh yeah this I hear that let's do it you know it's you can start a song will tell you what to do with it you know if you really listen to it I believe that because I I kind of uh you know one of the things Santana told me you know that I always held on to was like you know and I've experienced this once or twice where I've written very similar songs to friends of mine or people I know that was like whoa I may be not sounding but like the idea oh wow I brought something that was exactly and he said like you know we're all just antennae that are like catching energies and shitting likes bringing them in and we're you know bringing take making some out of that energies and sometimes people catch that same energy and similar things happen you know and so I always look at a dad I look at my ideas like this but also because I don't write them down I equate it to like my children like this like my ideas are like little animals that are wild and I see them and I think they're amazing and I want to and I so I I'll play a song till I know it so well it has to stick around it like I train it to stay and if it stays the next morning that's this kind of answers your question the next day if I write if I'm on to some and I write a song I'll sing it 200 times if I get it close to done and then I'll go to bed and then if it's there in the morning in this in the same form I will record it if it's gone I didn't it wasn't mine and that's happened a lot brave move yeah I have the opposite coward's approach you know if I get an ID I'll run away from everybody my my fingers in my ears and write it down you know hear what I said I'll sing it 200 times you know what I mean so if I've done it 200 times and I don't wake up and know it it's fuckin trash I write everything it's not supposed to happen I have the total opposite approach in terms of writing common everybody how many specials have you made in your life whenever counted rough guess it's like all right that's how many albums I've done in almost 30 years yeah yeah I mean so I was like I'm not turning them out like that I thought you know and I don't again because of that there's not like this crazy archive of garbage that's gonna be released when I'm dead it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen because I even saw as I start to record if I get halfway through it in I'm like not even satisfy wait erased you know I mean there's a few things out there that then I probably wouldn't have released but they're not they're like from House of Pain days and they're not bad I'm just like they weren't for they didn't have a purpose I think it's good for people see bad shit from great artists I do I think good skins good family I have no problem een I'm the guy that fuck I'll fuck up live and talk about it for five minutes of the show and be like yo at least you know it's not on fucking tape right and I'll be like that's real shit you know no you know I'm with that I'm just like it's my process it's like just the way I do like again also I think I stitute I had some really hardcore producers like DJ Muggs and my man Dante cross these were dudes that would be like that fucking was garbage do it again it's for so long that that's i'ma write the first time now is gonna be decent yeah I mean so it's like I gotta push myself to for it to be better than decent you know otherwise I just clip it yeah well that's the only way you could be as productive as you are you have a right well-oiled approach you know but I don't put out a lot of music but when I know for a fact that when you put something out you're happy about it oh yeah um yeah I'm content that's when you put it out content with that stuff you're in a great position rather you can kind of sort of decide what to do and when do it writing three of the biggest songs of the 90s with what it's like jump around and put your lights on well that was 2000 I think so but that little period and I wrote those songs jump around with mugs what it's like and put your lights on totally on my own that that provided me with something that I cherished like some people cherish private jet rides which is I can do whatever the fuck I want and still live pretty decent not super rich guy or anything but like better than average you got a good life take care of my family but creatively I could do whatever the fuck I want and it's a beautiful thing man that's the older I get like I want my whole new shit my slogan is fuck it I'm 50 man that's my new shit dog I'm on like I don't you gettin gonna rattle me man I'm 50 I don't even care how's that if you're getting there you go she's just trying to have fun live my life go home hug my kids yes and fucking know that nobody fucked with them at school and they had a great day and then my universe is complete yes yeah fucking I'm 50 fuck it I'm 50 yeah beautiful we need more people to think like that man I had a heart valve replacement at 28 dude I didn't think I was gonna make 35 you know I mean yeah so 50s what's that microphone the chest oh wow so here this is a hobby time it's not a watch it's my hobby it's like a goddamn metronome you know it's titanium man wrap your head around that no I got alien technology in my chest mo together doors don't fly off that thing click click click that's crazy yeah it's basically a very simple thing it's like a ring that goes in the valve and it's like a spring kind of activated flap that is totally self propelled by the heart's pumping of the blood it pumps the blood out of the flap then the flap kind of snaps back and that's what you're hearing is the tick is just the springer there and it's all I mean I could take my pulse without we were just sitting here do you know I mean I can take my pulse without even thinking about it technology is so amazing st. jude's valve shout out the st. jude's people whoever invented that shit gleep glorp from the mother Vega star system whatever they can't figure out a way to make your heart work again with a fake valve click click click Wow that's why you're here that's why I'm still here man it's amazing often wonder dad was like why why did I why it what kid John Ritter what killed him was exactly kind of what happened to me but I was able to get to the hospital faster you ever meet that guy no but I know that like when it happened there like people pointed out like he isn't now what happened to you I was like oh yeah that one who's a special dude he was on an episode of news radio everybody loved him man like so nice like wandering around the set like friendly to everybody I get a weird way like uh like just so he's a genuinely really nice guy who just loved making sitcoms and when he died I was like wow yeah that's one of them things it's just so nice I don't know where when you find out that someone that's it like you feel like guys nothing's gonna happen to him he's so nice and then one day the clutch the potlatch of death I was told I by the people at the hospital when I went back to visit once that uh awhile after they had brought me in because it took them a minute to figure out was wrong me the only reason they figured that was wrong with me is because my actual doctor was this guy in Beverly Hills I'm not gonna say anything because I don't know if he wants that but he it was a member on the board of cedars-sinai so when they brought me in the hospital all his records are computer accessible to them so they found out about my history of like being born with this heart defect and because up until then they heard rock dude he's a musician they're like I am gonna count much cocaine did you do and all my friends are traveling he doesn't do cocaine no he's not and they're like coming out if we give him the wrong drugs we could kill him I in and then all of a sudden like the records came through and that's what saved my ass that along with the like the head of surgery they're like the guy who like did a double eight that nine-hour surgery came off on one told the guys they couldn't do my surgery because it was too complex he's got dr. William Trent oh he's an amazing person he will not mind me shouting around he like goes to South American does all these free operations on kids hearts he's a fucking Saint this guy's this I'll tell you off fucking show some other shit he did that'll blow your fucking mind like wow that's who does that but he saved my life and you know I've just been I'd like I said I don't expect to be here 50 fuckin I'm 50 man there's two little girls I've got it's like a whole my whole thing right now is I want to take my girls like in the like week or two over to see him just to be like y'all dude these people wouldn't even exist right if it wasn't for you to do like I think that'd blow his mind a little bit fuck yeah well shout-out to all the people who fix hearts all those people fix anything fix all things you know if you fix shit ya fuckin salute right that's a positive thing yeah fix don't care if it's a sink or a heart you fix it good Cherokee all anything in between do ya yeah and that weird fixing shit is good fixing hearts though that's like particularly good when that guy sees you on TV and shit it's really fixed that's been a minute but yeah he probably fixed it up nice fix it up nice you enjoys music thank you then you enjoy my work fuck it I'm gonna tell the story I'm gonna tell it here's the story okay a few years after my heart surgery like when I have my heart's which I didn't have I didn't have medical insurance was young and dumb didn't you know I didn't just didn't have it and uh so was it fuckin cause a real fuckin and it was like a half a million dollar if I can hit you know I mean but I'd you know I've didn't declare bankruptcy I paid it all and I think this dude heard about that and they are I think guys like this must somehow invest in you when they know they saved your fucking life there's something there's a connection after that like that's one of my guy that's one of my guys so a few years later my mom when I was young had believed Hodgkin's disease of what it wasn't she had radiation treatment she beated and all that but 20 years later that shit wears on your heart valves and she had to have a triple bypass like it was kind of like oh shit like I was out on tour I had to come home put her I was like I want that guy to do the surgery just because I had hit her and he done mine so he does my mom's surgery and this guy fucking I get to all the bills you know and then now I'm doing all right so cool hi could I get a bill from the fucking anesthesiologist I get a bill from the fucking operating room we get a bill from the hospital I get a pill from this I never got a bill from this man for my mom's surgery dude just was like not that one's on me fucking crazy who gets a surgery done on them right that's an amazing guy who's crazy dude that's amazing no this dude goes and then I like started looking into who he was and this guy goes and does like fucking tons and tons of like Sarge surgeries on kids down in South America and it's just one of them do this man saves your mom on the house what that guy saved your mom that gals god bless her god bless him god bless him yeah man it's um there's nice people out there that really are you know we were fed this false narrative that everybody sucks because so many people do suck but there's so many people it's just a perspective issues the same reason why people think the world is flat they don't understand perspective the perspective when you're talking about human beings and seven billion people were just overflowing with people there's so many of us there's so many stories of people sucking but it's all a perspective issue because there's so many goddamn people and most of them are cool and most of them want to be cool and they would be more cool if they knew you were gonna be cool we all agree to be cool we can be cool we can have a better time here we're wasting time with nonsense and arguments at all and and and conflict that all could have been disrupted from the very beginning by everybody because is why we need the alien invasion alien because a lot of people are invested in a lot and a lot of shit that's meaningless yeah you know we won't even go into it we can all infer what they what those things are between us and the audience can do the same but what I'm saying is like there's just too much fucking bullshit about dumb shit that we need some kind of outside fucking focus yes something that will take us with from outside ourselves and make us focus on something else or legalize mushrooms which might be global warming but that's that's not real right no legalize mushrooms move to Greenland Trump's on it no he canceled his fucking trip to Denmark because they said they're not gonna sell em Greenland is talking Chad now he knows what he's doing listening chops gonna get us Greenland good thing is is like gonna cuddle honey believe II said well then it's like what good oh man I can't it's bizarro world that's all that's all people go to Greenland to Bohan de bois ha I think they bowhunt that that gigantic fucking furry thing what is that thing called the musk ox a Google Greenland musk ox ever see a musk ox you want to know but I want to see one and I also want to know when I'm kidding you invited for an elk BBQ dude come on I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna put a kitchen in here in this place I might have plans I'll tell you I'll come please let me show you must have 100% success rate on bowhunting in green land on a muskox cuz you just walk right up to him oh you know what it is because they they have an instinct protect themselves against wolves so they all huddle together when threatened yeah but look what they look like brother it even look real they look like something out of Star Wars those are kind of interesting but look go to the side Jamie that some of those other images when you see yeah they like that perfect well you see that walking around you like what the fuck is that he's like a tauntaun that's insane listen I'll lion fuck the elephant fucked a mammoth look what is that a buffalo what is that the fuck is that thing those crazy-ass horns wild looks like a buffalo with a Tina Turner wig and duty could be a hundred and fifty million degrees below zero those things just chill they're just out there eating frozen grass Hornets come from like their cheekbones do the crazy looking barely looks like a real thing barely they're beautiful and apparently he's good the apparently it's fucking fantastic yeah that's awesome my friend Brendan Burns shot one in I think he said he got his either in Antarctica you get you can go to like really really cold climates and get I think it's like is it north northern Canada there's somewhere in northern Canada where you hunt them where it's crazy like you just get on you get pulled by by snowmobiles are you pulled by dogs and you go like way way way the fuck out where if you break down if your snowmobile breaks down or if your dogs all die you are fucked I mean you are so so so so so fucked because there's nothing man there's nothing there's the occasional polar bear and these fucking musk ox up there and they're they don't even look like real things and you're stumbling across like imagine going through a whiteout snowstorm to stumble across across this 2,000 pound enormous gigantic hairy prehistoric beast so you could just walk up to and shoot with a bow and arrow and eat that's that's what's up there right now like they're like a remnant of the past like to the same want to see what they like how with this the fight with those things that because use it to fuck up other males that's what most of those animals they're not fighting off predators with that shit generally related to breeding and all that yeah sure they think some of it is like in some animals depending upon how much pressure they get from predators like elk keep their antlers very late to keep their antlers like into March and April because a lot of them live around wolves and the idea is that they need those antlers to protect themselves from wolves so they hold on to them longer than deer do biology it's real crazy yeah dude we're so lucky we're so lucky we're out here out the food chain oh my god not only out the few chain you guys can go right down the street and get a fat steak dinner friend you just said on the agenda I cannot deceive let's do it soon you know our spot yeah I'm sparking this man oh you're crazy no we're dead you live on the edge you have to like you don't use a lighter yeah I'm saying oh it's right here oh okay there's what maybe you were one of those I only use a mask and it will play into the next Thun we're gonna do the morning top yeah they come off the top sorry I was I don't thinking the wig oh it's like a helmet II kind of thing I see I think they fucked things up with that that bony part in the front above their eyebrows they keep those for life - it's not like a deer you know good deer loses their antlers every year these mothers looks like a fucked-up hairdo it does this so beautiful though they're so beautiful like that one right there Jamie click about a day mom live there for church right there like above above that's a beautiful creature I mean it's so amazing that nature can make fish it can make it's a buffalo make that like Buffalo words I don't know man what is it bison related ox ox ox aren't they all related bison and on it kids facts mmm was it's a it's cattle often compared to cattle back now with a big coat yeah that's on northern cow it's a herbivore ago Wow Berlin cow part of the vote bovidae family all the species his family have two toed hooves four chambered stomachs and are herbivores so it's like a kind of cow type thing fuck it's amazing aliens mutate them nope those that's what we're supposed to be right now well we're supposed to be right now some sort of stupid fucking hairy dumbass has run around getting eaten by shit but the aliens came down and said listen let's just plant some of our stuff in these monkeys and see what we can do I mean dude when they come and bats what happened man so I'm saying when they're coming back probably pretty soon economy it's been brought up more and more in the narrative and every time we go to sleep we wake up in a new universe and I think along those lines that uh they're coming they're on the way right now we just not quite ready yet Everlast maybe you are but some people are not some people if the aliens were hovering over Universal Studios they are honest lose their minds moving down the 101 over the Hollywood Bowl amazing those little fucking time whether it was the end or the beginning or whatever it would be amazing it would be very interesting if the whole thing would go down you know I mean if it was the end of all cool yeah let's I mean I'm not incur I say hey break it off but I'm saying if that's what it is it is or if it's the next stage of like enlightenment and fucking you know all that goodness what do you think people do if one of them like hovered over every major city you know I think what we're talking about is what would the majorly religious do because I think that would affect religious thought the most right off top you know I mean besides the fear of like what are they what are they here for right the first thing was I whoa a whole bunch of ideology goes out the fucking window right now so that would cause a lot of panic and anxiety right there alone you know you tell them your your your whatever story or whatever religion I'm not gonna go there like we're up like that's not like that thing let's put blanket it yeah you know yeah it's gonna upset a lot of faux yeah you know I mean right away just like oh my god that's not what we thought existed we're the center of everything you know I think would happen I think people just start fucking flat earthers go out the window right away this is over maybe like the aliens travel here from another division they have a new explanation for it really the thing about it like being a flat earther or the thing about any kind of like thing that you could decide was already proven is that it doesn't matter what the facts are anymore what matters is what people agree to that's what's interesting about it like you realize that there's like a certain number of people you need to have to start a community and it doesn't have to make sense you just have to have enough people that agree to it if enough people agree to it you can you can push you can push some pretty preposterous ideas through and a bunch of people hop on board and they're happy to be on your group that's the problem with groups the problem of groups is people will just join isn't that the big lie the big lie there the big I think the whole mine comes yep the lie theory I believe that's the Irate over that where I'm quoting out from but I mean even what you think if you think about a country right you think about a country and you think about America which we both love and live in yes sir wait it's what is it you know it's an idea right it's an idea it's an idea that everybody who's in this thing it's cool to each other everybody's in this thing's part of a team yeah that's really what it is bring up your broken man so that all that stuff from the front from the Statue of Liberty some more but think about this thing's old masses is that that am I getting here it's just a walk it out 50 you know I mean right but I know what you're saying it's um look whatever we are like we are what we agree we are we are what we agree we are like we don't it's the most of but we're in conflict about his fucking stupid and as a country I think we're supposed to be we're supposed to agree that we're all in this together so if we're all in this together it should be good for everybody we could do that we could do that better than we think we can way better way better a problem is the conflict some of its unnecessary but that's a good sound effect for that perfect it's you know some of it is just unnecessary and is these moments man it's moments when we have fun moments when we get together moments when we hug moments when we have a drink together almost we'll listen to some music moments when we're all leaving a concert together or a movie together that we realize like growling this together we're all right it's just like we just got to navigate it better that's all it is we're crashing into each other honestly if you go eat moments we mourn together I mean I'm honestly I mean I'm hate to say this but you know I've see a lot of my older friends more funerals lately than other events and but they turn into celebrations if you know me because we all understand like all right man yeah damn isn't glad I am seeing you right now let's fucking yeah you know and whoever was that we're celebrating definitely doesn't want that they want this yeah for sure I don't when I go party the fuck up party fucks up him say like that guy did I yeah did I he's pretty good dad every you I made a few bucks made a few bucks that's Dana Manzana just play that song no matter what I'm in got love I got to get my 25 cents man I gotta get my 25 cents every episode dawg man come on you begrudge me my 25 cents I love it I was walking out of the Octagon I forget who who owes interview my favorite is this every once in a while like there's a few people who choose that song like Cynthia Cove the caballo well let's shout out to the first Marcus Davis yeah Marcus Degas he did the the first thing and then he went into the jump around but some people every once in a while I don't know maybe if they picked a bad song or something like out of nowhere out of nowhere one time like lyoto machida came out to jump around on a mic I texted Tina I was like who the fuck pick daddy's like I did and I think the go-to Jam if you fucking pigs like me doesn't like cuz I'll be like that was random and I was like how how did that happen it's funny it's funny when this is a song that plays all the time it connects you to one of your friends it's like as I'm walking out of the Octagon about six years where anywhere Dana was it could be I could be he could be on this side of world I'm sleeping salon I'd get a phone call and he'd just be a phone in the air at a club you guys nailed that song so hard there's like moments in space-time that get nailed just like you you you just hit something that resonates with people I I still Danny's quote Danny boy's quote of uh it's the Louie Louie of the 90s it's Louie Louie it's just there it's part of it like it's it's almost not mine it's think belongs to the universe it's weird every ballgame I go to any event I go to it gets played and it's not even like a big deal about it's like some place is a big deal like you get these football games college like Wisconsin's and stuff where it's like part of a tradition but I'm saying any event angels game or dodge became a Yankees game a Laker game a football game it's it pops up somewhere along the line dude you're right up there with Queen it's crazy it's wild I mean as you talking about salt like individual songs and the further their imprint on something it's it's bananas it's it's it's something to like I can't you can't almost invest your thought in it because it can get like whoa it's it that's it's really kind of a part of pop culture it's ingrained on Ana merits an American phenomenon and world why I mean like worldwide I mean yeah where did you can you go where they probably don't never heard jump around it's weird I mean it's - think about it on that level it's crazy maybe like one of them places where trump's trying to buy maybe open greenland no no they dive no they they heard it they heard it Queen had we are the champions and and and it also had we will rock you those are two of the greatest sports anthems of all time Queen nailed two of them like one of the fucking peanuts do of them we will rock you and we are the champions it's actually the same song - isn't it yeah they blend into each other but they're a different song they kind of they're technically connected like if you buddy had to buy them on iTunes you have to buy two songs I think is it a slash in there is it a we will rock you we are the champions they come together yeah it doesn't there's no space 3 or was it recognizes one individual song two different titles you're not you know you're not miked up people can't hear you so I'm trying to sorry yeah here we go sorry DJ man so yeah so that was actually one of the first albums I got when I was a kid but on the actual label which has like the titles of the songs they were listed as two different titles but on the actual vinyl the surface of the record it was one groove so the songs just went right into each other so so if you were in a diner and you put like those quarters in that thing and you played that right give you one song over to give you know it usually gives you both it gives you both remember man diner music I was listening to that microphone I feel like my memory I'll show you I feel like my memory I see like a we will rock you slash we are the champions thing going on yeah it's like I feel like you would have got both songs they don't remember there is no stop there's not even a clean place to edit it really right if I'm right that's crazy that it's two songs do you remember those wheels of the diners in the East Coast oh so it's two songs there's a two songs it's the two songs but it's one so I was just driving a 45 I was driving a u-haul truck last weekend I'm in the process of moving so all you had while we had was am/fm radio so I was listen to Kate Earth 101 and we will rock you came on and right away came we are the champions played it as one song well they go together you know perfect it seems like it's almost but it is clearly two different jams yeah right it's great this is similar themes it was a goddamn blizzard we will rock you we are the champions that band they were there were really sorcerers he was amazing Freddie Mercury was while it was amazing it was crazy he was so under vocal I was very on stage I mean it is just a masterpiece of Bohemian Rhapsody alone it's just crazy I know right look can you think of like rock albums and you think of songs and you think of that one you like like I'm I write these little three chord songs with a nice story over and shitting this month this dude was doing like fucking 16 part and harmonies of bismillah no we will not let you go like wrote like a rock opera like within four five minutes it was this fucking run man is how genius I should is it's great to listen to like it's super entertaining it's it's captivating he was a damn goddamn hero for sure right Freddy yeah haven't seen the movie I would say I haven't seen the movie though after they stopped having fucking Borat do it I'm like I'm out we're see cuz i like i like to show that guys on that mr. robaix I'm sure I'd like him to it doesn't matter all that that you tease me with Ali G and then you pull them away I don't know I I mean that's not why I didn't see I just haven't had the chance but boy I wanted to do a lot of like crazy anyone yeah you probably wanted to do all you know wonder have dogs flapping around you know I mean one dog leg one to go the other he wanted to go to the dark side of Freddy Wow I'm sure the guy who did it did a great job the problem is whenever someone gets attached to the idea of someone else doing it and then the new guy comes in he's forever tainted but if you haven't and you ever go on TV little show binges that guy's show mr. robot is really pretty fucking good pretty fucking good it's really funny it's fucking like bizarre like futuristic hacker weirdness that's fucking it's pretty dope this is the best time ever if you want to just sit and watch TV like is there a better time that's ever existed do you smoke weed it's legal watch 42 episodes of a show but occasionally I think it's important and and probably even therapeutical but if you could just sit down and watch something on TV there's more shit to watch today than the human race has ever seen ever that's a fact they're making new TV shows every goddamn minute but happening right now they're putting them out

baddest motherfucker was it 170 right yes yes yeah fuck cutting weight his need to cut weight but I love what he's talking about fighting for the baddest motherfucker in the game belt so that's the belt he's referred to okay this was for a belt and there's only three rounds I was like wait a minute I'm so confused thinking about I was so I was a little high and drunk myself no I was thinking about trying to get him to explain that to people but I was like well I might just let him go I don't even want to get in the way of that I'm glad I know now what meld he's talking about he's talked about it multiple times that's a great fight he called out he said that he said defend this belt and I was like he's talking about the baddest motherfucker in the game belt I thought he was gonna say it but I probably should have asked him what belt it was no it's more beautiful like that there's like this no it's perfect it's like an easter egg how would a great name the baddest motherfucker in the game belt we should be so happy that guy's a real thing we should be so happy and that fight it would be amazing yeah men that would be incredible Mozgov dolls are straight-up murderer he's a straight-up murder it's hos Nate that would be chaos I'll be chaos and then those two guys want to do it those are two mean just wild dogs don't want to add it those guys are both like to the core they're they're they're fighters to the core there's no quitting either one of those guys I mean that's a wild fight man especially right now like financially that's an amazing fight right now people would pay a lot of money to see that fight Maz vedalam Nate Diaz there those are two guys that are like the most exciting and most talked-about guys in the sport right now if those guys decided up fucking smash horns whoa it looked like they were more than willing yeah I hope they make that that would be doubt be an amazing fight hope to make that happen that'll be goddamn bananas and maybe water won't come out to come around if they pick some shitty enough no we're talking about weight but glioma lyoto machida yeah like what I want to know the story behind that one day I'm gonna corner Danny when we're like you know when this when he's not the fucking busiest dude on earth yeah and and be like what the fuck what happened what song did he pick which the other fight was I don't know

time I mean it's only good the walk to the Octagon is not a full song it's only three minutes but all those Brazilian guys always come out today here I mean like fucking come to the fucking wildest music some of those dudes not Dax murderer used to come out to some real questionable fucking like Dutch disco house he came out to a rock you crazy oh my god yeah that's right Dutch dis Swedish House Mafia oh my god you're so right crazy that's exactly what is coming out to that dudududududu like overtly like over-the-top to number one were so number one worst walkout song my favorite was when Randy Couture came out to Ted Nugent's stranglehold I was like if there is ever a song that's like design like that that seems like a fun that's us fight playing song you know you're about to have a fight that's song you want playing stranglehold michael Chiesa is that too couple guys used stranglehold now that's a salt like stranglehold and it's it's one of those songs anything by ac/dc oh yeah

champion came out to I know he definitely came out to an ac/dc song no question is it feels like right questioning that was big like right then - yeah ac/dc is like one of those bands were you hear like three or four chords like is it easy like instantly like for Angus Young again his guitar tone yeah just this one was called for those about to rock oh he came out that's what those about but didn't come out too - I think when he fought Anderson Silva c12060 did for those about which fight was that who was he fighting I think for sure he came out to thunderstruck Gugu is your footing was uh he was a sec dude oh when he fought Forrest Griffin he was a CDC dude you think about what walkout music is niggas in this is nice I'm when they're walkout music was a Chuck Liddell he beat with a broken like kicked him in the arm and broke I think ya feel like I was there but I might not have seen hands on where it was I don't hit him Chuck broke his arm in the first round and then he he clipped him with a punch with his other hand like when everybody's with his broken arm that was crazy yeah same song at a UFC 72 okay maybe that was a song for those about to rock hmm great song either way like III when everybody hit me apparently when Steve a knocked out DC like I there's a bad angle where I was like he saw me and then like recently I saw the did you ever see the meme with Kobe where he's like staring it countered like after knocking out fuckin I think it's Joe's a mm-hmm and like it's me like I'm like talking to like fucking Kobe but he's just staring like this like there's a meme that just like focuses in on him Mike it's fucking crazy so I like it's got me thinking like I wonder have like I said I've been there's so many of these fucking fights that I don't even you know I was like trying to remember and it's like I can't even remember yeah you've been coming to them I mean almost as long as I've been working for the USA yeah or classically yeah yeah close to not ask but close in the neighborhood and I mean a couple years behind yeah yeah but like you know you're the first guy ever smoked pot indoors worth in Vegas a little kid I think somebody made a meme this is something about Kobe even this concentration is I started focusing in on him like this she was alone that make that bigger does it make it bigger is it possible to make it bigger let me tell you something listen look Iike Bebe's face is there a harder man that's ever lived let me tell you though he came out like two fights before that fight and he was the nicest guy to everybody that came up to him he's like he everybody came to me engage with him talk to him as soon as the Conor fight was about to happen that was it for the whole he just was watching the whole time and I like and like we were talking I could he like in the whole time like I said we were engaging what I'm saying to him right there is like oh shit y'all probably fighting next kind of okay cuz he was like I want to fucking fight that guy and they got into it backstage at that shit but I just made me laugh and it made me start thinking like hey I wonder how much shit I wonder how much shit I mic in the background of a ton of them one of the best ones ever is Ari and Duncan kissing and when they planned it they planned it and so these guys Pat the camera past in front of them and they grab each other and started making out just so they could be on camera watch this look at watch this right here the camera pans of them oh my god and Dana Dana texts me afterwards did your friends fuckin

Instagram that's the only one I really do but I'm on the Facebook and all that with all the tours and all that but if you want to see what I talk about or what I do it's og Everlast on instagram my god Joe started on Instagram by the way that's a hundred percent and and he's kicking my ass all over he's got like 18 million followers I got like 98 thousand no always that's nothing your people always come and are always beautiful folks that's the but but the folks that always come after a podcaster always like fine folks and and and are enthusiastic that's awesome here I think we tapped into a river of cool people I think they're out there I think you put it out there and people respond in turn and they realize that a lot of a lot of the shittiest behavior that we all exhibit is because we're around shitty behavior for making agreement to be nice to each other we can change everything I'm working on it we are I'm a gay man you're Irish I'm a dick quick excuse to be one if you want to be an ass maybe but you know in all the years I've known you you're very very introspective guy man you look at yourself you know when people make mistakes they look at themselves like you're a you're a guy who looks at everything man you look at yourself you look at other people it's nice to be afforded the time and luxuries to do such things too let's acknowledge the some people hey man motherfuckers look like some people can barely look up from the grind man it's a blessing to be able to like have that those moments of like hey whatever it is Joe Rogan in the fucking brush you know stalking and elk that's where he gets his moment or you know you know or whatever me driving fucking Pacific Coast Highway listening to an A beat trying to fucking come with an idea you know yeah well that's a luxury you mean even though it's our work you might be thinking of a joke out there while you're fucking yeah I mean now we're luck super lucky for sure um well said that's so important to acknowledge you know for everybody and and we didn't used to be and that's stuff to grind you know and we're all okay we're all okay we just got to figure our way through our own individual maze the problem is in comparison ramp that's a big part of the problem I'm totally paraphrasing but there's like definitely a famous phrase where it's like comparison is the death of joy and I think we've even talked about it on they might I'm having deja vu so they might have been on here that we talked about I'm a repetitive fuck yeah and I say a lot of the same shit over and over again that's a Thomas Jefferson quote correct comparison is the thief of joy thief of joy I think we have talked about my deja vu is in high gear right now it's one of my favorite quotes because it just makes you realize like this is something you can't even control you're also in control I feel like it's like there's this everybody's not entitled to the luxury that we're talking about so it's like it's you got to be thankful for it on an extra high level because it seems like we're in this twisted thought age where it's like everybody thinks they deserve that and I don't even feel like I deserve it I'm lucky I'm a fortunate fucking man you know I mean I I sing songs I always compared to like this like you know when you talk you know what like people talking about in the old new music whatever whatever I'm like whatever happens if the lights go out and all the power goes out I can go from fucking little fucking prefecture to Prefecture and play a little song for you and get a meal for me and my family that's how I equate it like it's it's a trade you know I mean and and it's an imbalance society that gives that has I mean I've met teachers that I feel like should be making way more fucking money than me man like on real levels that I that I've seen do things for kids on like you know like my school has a mixture like you know kids that go there because they live there and then there's a lot of people trying to go to the school because it's very nice school but you know so there's imbalances and these I've seen teachers that come out their own pockets and do things for you know people that was like wow man that's you know I mean I like to think I do nice things and I think I do but I'm saying it's like when I see it on a level where it's like grassroots ground level it's it's impactful to me you know yeah it's think about teachers that's the one that's the heart string-puller you know how much teachers make it you hear about it should be roxtor how do you you're taking good ones babies you're teaching our babies and you hear about the bad ones I hear about the mean teachers that fuck with the kids head don't realize what they're doing some people are just angry they're just angry and me and it comes out on their teaching and if your teacher gets stuck or your kid rather if your kid get stuck with one of those teachers like that can have a devastating impact on the kid's life we're we're experiencing like something like that but not automatic I'll go on a very minor level of like you know like the way the school we just found out like today yesterday like what teachers our kids have you know I mean it's like there's the whole like cultural parents circle of knowing who's teach which teachers you want and which ones you don't and it's like I'm not gonna go into whether we got what we wanted or not but it's like the fucking drama behind it is it's hilarity to me it's like it's such a it's such a like whoa like you know they did is they're abuse going on or what you know and well and teachers a little more strict than the others in my day my parents would have said like that's the teacher we want nowadays it's almost like the opposite in that in old days my mom would be like that's the stricter teacher yeah put them in that class it's put in that class because that's the one that's not gonna take any shit and that's the one that's gonna get you know tell make sure he knows and people aren't gonna take shit from him and like you know what I mean that's I I understand that mentality you nowadays it's almost the flip like all that teachers like she just oh so abrasive channeling it's like well what does she do well she's raised her voice to the kid that was what was the kid doing he was fucking losing his mind in class so the teacher raised their voices I you know it's just give a general example here but well I was hilarious we got paddled yeah paddled at school I got in a fight with a kid named Preston banks we duked it out well no will I got battle I was like fuck I lived there from 11 and 13 so somewhere in that range they fucking whack me where was it Oh Florida floor yeah yeah Florida they used to be a lot of powder you this dude had a paddle like an actual wooden paddle and me and this kid got and that this I remember thinking even though it's probably like 11 or 12 or whatever I was when I got in a fight with this kid I realized this kid had been like badly burned when he was young and we were you know we're in school together and he was like missing part of his ear and his his neck was all fucked up and I was thinking like wow this guy like he's not doing so well like this is it made me realize like we got into this little scrap over nothing because it just he wasn't doing so well and I didn't realize that until I was in the principal's office with them in the fight like we couldn't fight in front of principal that was the authority figure we were both like subdued but I was realizing when I was around this isn't a mean guy he's a sad guy like he's a guy that just didn't get any love and he feels like he got ripped off by life because he got burned when he was a little kid for sure and it made me think like it changed the way I looked at people but the one little argument and fight with someone kid and then getting paddled getting power just cemented it like wow there was stamp on it I don't agree with it you know and the guy didn't hurt me he didn't try to hurt me and try to hurt the other dude either but he definitely paddled us East it used to be a legal thing put a sting on it man you know I mean that's what we grew up with you guys I got spanked turd is that good I think I think there's appropriate time and place I really do you I don't know about that that's different cuz I have two girls and I've never I've never spent my kids I don't think that's like threatened to to but I've never had to actually commit and do it so I don't know ya know it's it seems like it might not be the right and even with a boy I'm talking about that the physical justice for me she would be a rare thing let me give you an example of when like a time in my life when I definitely deserved physical justice and God my father you know he talked about using guns when I was very young we'd go out and shoot and like not hunt necessarily but he'd take us out and shooting mountains out an evangelist for us back in the day and like fucking I had a very good gun education and understanding of guns and one time when they were away I fucked around with his like pump shotgun and fucking accidentally fucking loaded in fucking bang a shot into the wall alright this was an apartment - this wasn't a house this was an apartment building now it wasn't a wall connecting to in another apartment but let's put the possibilities that you're having when they came home a few hours later that apartment outside was surrounded by police like the guns like they didn't know what happened the neighbors all called cops didn't they heard a shotgun but so after they all settled it down as I got my ass fucking kicked that last that knife on my father you mean and and you know some people nowadays would say that's fucking rough but no I fucking could have fucking killed a human being easily I just you need to sometimes know like okay this is because what you just did could have wound you up in fucking the penitentiary for the rest of your life so an ass-kicking doesn't seem as extreme as you think when you put it in the balance of that so when you're getting to like a level of that I think especially for a boy you know I mean I don't know if I then if a girl was going that wild I mean I would encourage the mom to throw the baby I mean the dad can't throw that beating you know it'd be a little rough but I think there's a time and a place where like hey if you're gonna stop and you know you you got to let them know here's this will be the rest of your life yeah if you keep down this path that's it's got to be that extreme to me for it to be a beating nowadays when I was young a beating could come from talking back right at least a smack in the face yeah well that's you know a shoe just a little my fear was mom after like 13 mom stopped using the hands cuz you know it didn't you know I had outgrown her she's my mom was little my mom was little I was a little woman like 4 foot 11 five foot tops just throwing shit oh yeah so after a while I was like it went from from the hands - like stirring spoons and shit and then once they'll started breaking it became shoes and and like you know whatever else broomstick and then it became like which of your fucking father gets all my mom might have like gently smack me upside the head gently like never like a real like wound no my mom was a Brooklyn lady like she might have been like what are you doing stupid tried to never drop me ma I remember being like 9 or 10 her mom's chasing me down the block Oh catching me no yeah so happy the worst had happened my mom was not chasing me she'd be like you're coming home eventually dummy my mom was that mean she wasn't having it no all word oh yeah my mom would have never chased me she'd be like I'm not playing your games little but she was fast she caught you beat your ass funny friends it's so rough when you're a young boy and you're trying to be cool it's like the most embarrassing like any day you could just trip on your own dick and fall faces do it offense like a fucking asshole just so goofy I think it actually made some more friends at the time understand me a little bit differently do like oh wow dude all right we get you now we understand kind of your whole thing like your stielike your yeah guys are nuts yeah for sure but I feel like when you think of yourself as like a musician and an artist like you're so fortunate this is gonna sound weird but you're so fortunate to come from a chaotic upbringing I feel like everyone who I know that comes from some sort of a chaotic upbringing has like a different kind of like horsepower to the shit you know like all my favorite people that I like to listen to and watch y'all on some like real fucked-up moments it struggles and chaos I'm sure madness you don't you don't get what you put out without that that's like the root of it all that's the seed that causes it all to grow I mean it's similar to a joke a song you're trying to find it depends on what you know when angular take from it I like to call it the highest common denominator like that I'm trying to find is like the the highest level thing we can all connect on I mean not the basis most lowest level or common denominator I'm trying to find the work what kind of elevated level can I speak to you on even if it's about fuckery can I raise the level of speaking about it and just telling a tale about it without it you know being you know again the most base and and easiest lowest hanging fruit mmm you know you know that's the same thing I think with the joke you're trying to find there's no real new like you're just finding new angles on funny shit you know what I mean like things are news when things are newly invented or when they're new events like an event or a new invention then then things open up new pathways other than that like you're talking about relationships you're doing a variation of exactly a take on it that everybody's had who's had a long life and been in relationships especially Larry King holla at you boy going on number eight was that number seven they just left eight divorced seventh wife I think he remarried long ago damn like that you know Larry King still alive you didn't know oh boy would write would Roy and I were looking at pictures of laughing I really didn't know why I'm impressed that he's still alive divorce at 85 haha Inge more power to him yeah if you got the money to get divorced at 85 go for it the shooting him up with steroids and cocaine and they're just gonna start viagra just having gals come over to the place he's over at Arts Deli just holding court imagine if over the last like year of his life he just banks an unprecedented volume of internet porn and just releases it all in one blast Larry King Fox I just called the docking Carl yes King sex tapes yeah King yeah just banging it out and just yeah that's how you get so much money if you really just want money now's the time to act that's wild poor Larry he doesn't seem like he has good posture like that's not good when you're an older fella and you like they have the curve yeah he's got that curve he was a very nice guy I was on a show twice I was gonna show twice for fear factor so he's very nice very friendly guy you know you kind of gotta be when you do that for a living and everything you're talking a person you got to be good at that you can't be like me I'd be like did they go to jail is there a Larry King we need to get a Larry King mugshot yeah get that Larry King mugshot order that shit up go to take the five unique photo Larry King mugshot how do we not have Larry King we just decided to get Pablo hey dude you need to get the mug shot of the dude who's still on CNN who got found out like in Central Park in New York like with math and like a like makeshift noose around his dick is they was like what's his name the English dude with the glasses CNN and Richard Richard come on dude you're helping my help come on ordering up for assured print Richard oh man you know his face soon as you see space you can pick oh that guy Richard Quest Richard Quest Richard Quest he's the guy I'm talking about I know who he is oh dude if you see his face she'll be like oh yeah he's like he's like the English guy on CNN he got caught in like Central Park were like madman like fucking some sort of noose or something around his dick I was as far as I remember reading we were we were slammed it for a while if you're a single gay guy isn't that what you're supposed to do I don't know you're supposed to have meth I don't know surround your dick that's like no thing is this not on the internet it do with that am I making this out there's no I was looking for a mug shot there's no mug shot but here's an explanation making this up right I'm not this wasn't like a drug induced by a hallucination or something right how hilarious is the way they put this see their personality reach requestors bus in Central Park early yesterday with some drugs in his pocket no big deal and a sex toy in his boot law enforcement officials say sources said quest was initially busted for loitering aside from the oddly configured rope this search also turned up a sex toy inside of his boot that means his asshole a small bag of methamphetamine in his left jacket pocket it wasn't immediately clear what the Rope was for I'm gonna talk about that on stage from now on do send me that guy do you don't know that guy he's all over the fucking CNN I do not know that guy owe me that article that we just said it to my ever no I hope it provides you something beautiful something there there's something was not clear it was not immediately clear with a girl or four and I'm like let me help let me help you out was it tied around his neck and his dick [Laughter] mr. quest at 64th Street and West Drive it of 300 the police noticed mr. quest at 64th Street and West Drive bail out 3:40 a.m. the official said as he was being escorted out he volunteered in quotes I have meth in my pocket according to an official briefed on the case the police searched him and recovered a small amount of methamphetamine in the ziplock bag and a rope around his dick and his neck and they stay on the farm when what kind of boots he had on us there's a snake in my boot asshole is this an English paper no this is New York it was Central Park I think they mean is asshole I don't think I think they mean is boot I think that's a whole new dimension that's your trunk bro you know in English what it's like this isn't this this is New York Times yes they're using proper British English that's America it's New York Times called boots aboot in America let's go with the better angle honor this day was in his ass that's the veteran new at post New York Times it was in his asshole his boot his boot is it's proper British for like if you watch like that is factual that is factual Clarkson and fucking Richard Hammonds and James May therapist rose rock is the best the boot yes it's in his asshole Wow guy the sex toys asshole hey no judgment Brown brought a whole new like fucking like dimension to that no judgment it's okay it's fine yes sir even if he didn't get caught with that in his asshole he's still doing math and talking to cops with a rope around his dick and neck yeah that part - I was gonna get so crazy if you had a fucking rubber dick is a slight wait what I'm finding that shit on I'll get you that mud shot I'm fine Roper and his dick and balls whatever whatever thank God for my white privilige dude is black as Wesley Snipes with dreadlocks I catch you with a rope round your dick and necklace yeah your pocket bro yeah yeah yeah I think so I think so 100 dismissed all right connecting your neck and cock and probably a sex toy in your ass at the very least I was gonna say a shoe which is weird enough it's my it might even be weirder but let's not jump to conclusions confusing interpretation of the American version of boot and them saying maybe they think she means ass those with another man oh maybe nobody's got a fucking rubber dick in their boots that's outrageous that would make you boot all fucking uncomfortable why would you just put it in your pocket it's in his ass bro let's just run because he had a meth in his pocket all the computers spread misinformation look I'm sure it was just an issue whatever whatever don't ever volunteer that you have drugs let them find the drugs let them find the drugs unless you want to fuck the cops first time I went to Japan with house paint what happen we're on you know is one of them things were we were touring from tora tora tora i would go home and literally take one set of clothes out of a bag thrown in another bag and leave so we got to Japan and on this particular trip I brought my girlfriend at that time and I think Danny did and lethal brought his own homee or whatever but all that we brought a bunch of guests and everybody gets through customs and as I'm getting through customs the guy reaches into this one jacket I have and he pulls his hand out and there's this little nugget of bud and he's like what is that and I was like well can you speak English because he said it in Japanese so I said okay okay what is that I was like my brain just was like well fuck man just it looks like wheat I said it looks like we you know I just fucking owned it they went and got this little tester put some shit in sort of returns blue it's weed I was like it's wait let's just fucking save a little trouble is we meanwhile everybody else had gotten through they brought everybody else back in right fucking gave him the fucking finger like I have like my lady everything at the time everybody got the strip-searched they never strip-searched me they searched everything I had all my bags everything right they tested one nugget weed whatever I end up after several hours the record label paid off whatever they had to pay off we got into the country and we're able to do our tour now the point of the story is everybody's fuckin hating my guts the whole fucking bunch when we get to the hotel I'm unpacking my bag trying to figure out how the whole fucking thing happened I'm looking at the jacket and I reach into the pocket that was I there's nothing in there I was like fuck that's crazy I reach into the other pocket of the jacket I pulled out a fucking ounce of fucking weed they never looked in the other pocket of the jacket Oh fucking ounce of weed I should show you know what you were without even knowing you were doing it you were like sending a small meal to get busted so that the big ones can sneak around inside I must have been rolling a joint somewhat at the last tour and I had an ugly over and just throwing it in the pocket not thinking about it on one side cartel does that but if they would have found that other one first I'd be in jail in motherfucking in Japan for a long time never but I got it I called the hole I called everybody that smoked in the crew down to the room after that and I was like yo check it out man I really didn't mean this to happen but I probably had more good ass fucking weed in Japan than anybody at the time you know what's incredible cuz all they had was ash and shit like that stop and think at that moment that moment if they didn't go in that one pocket and they went in the other pocket first and they found that giant bag of weed we wouldn't be having this conversation nope we probably would no I don't think so that's a lot of weed who knows though in Japan it would have been there we took a lot of money to get me out of that regardless a lot instead of I think it cost him like a thousand bucks and they're like you know which was like ten thousand or something yen or a hundred salary or post put your lights on no this was in house paint okay this was like when the only story like it was like Paul McCartney is banned for life because he got caught with some wheat that's that was like that well I don't know if it still exists but there was a point where he was banned for life cuz he got called weed over there well you used to be in Nevada you get sent to jail for life if you had weed and now it's legal there you know there's a bunch of dudes like looking out those barred windows bad yeah that's just got it something's gotta be done about that guy ain't that ain't working yeah that's the problem that's the number one problem it's number one problem with laws against things like weed like as long as you can buy some whiskey it's part of the double a problem a lot of it too is a lot of these prisoners are privatizing they don't want to let a lot of these guys go man a lot of these guys get money for the amount of fucking people in their prisons I got a solution those private prison dudes just start selling weed right a cleaner way to live your life man don't be a goddamn slave owner you know there's this whole like urban legend that I mean it's very believable about this letter that went around like a bunch of people in in the in the hip-hop music industry got I don't know maybe it was within the last decade where they described like this guy claimed to be a member of the elite a class of like executives of the music business in there in the mid nineties and whatnot and there was a time when the private prison industry kind of came and got involved and got a lot of these people to invest and then kind of help direct like things like rap music and then if you remember they used to be like public I don't know if you how bigger you were fan of music you were at the time X clans and Public Enemies there's all these proactive like you know counters to like the party drug dealer guys or whatever you know there was there was naturally another side to it that existed and was successful and flourished you know amongst it you know and that disappeared but and like there this letter that went around was like kind of claiming this guy was part of this thing and he left a meeting when they these guys it was like a whole conspiracy thing like that you know but it's like totally believable that they are poor that they could these guys with director music and and a fucking media in a certain direction to encourage fucking basically a cycle of fucking prison for fuck because if you look at rap music if you look at rap music and what happened from the nineties till now there is no conscious music anymore there's none it's again up it's some people will tell you it's fucking God's honest truth so I'm gonna tell you it's the wildest speculation in the world but you can dig it up easily music kanya has some conscious music for sure but like what like Jesus walk some that was written by a guy named a Rhymefest I think is his name I think is a guy from Chicago one of his partners from Chicago wrote that song you know I mean which guy remember these guys like Kanye's a producer and I'm not saying he doesn't right but what I'm saying is a lot of you know he's also like he will take a song and make the song because he's a producer a lot of people do I'm not just saying Kanye's like like a fraud or anything I'm just saying like as a producer like people Drake doesn't write all his records like they there's a different era of rap and shit like that going on from when I was young when I was young it was pretty much 90% you if you couldn't call yourself an emcee or a rapper if you didn't write your own shit there were cats that didn't do it it's always been there there's always been the ghost writing scene but if you wanted to walk in a room and hold down any kind of respect with people you dad to know you wrote your crimes you know yeah so it's like you know and it's not saying like oh you're not a fraud you're just a different kind of entertainer you know to me as far as I'm concerned I don't shit on it you know I mean there's a lot rake records I like there's a lot of other shit I like you know I mean it's I know those guys didn't write those records because I can look at the writers credit and see 20 writers credits on it so but I come from there of like you know you got to write your shit yeah I think some people feel the value of collaboration which is a legitimate thing and if your ego is good enough where you can like work with like Paul Mooney work with Pryor you know Pryor is the greatest of all time in my opinion and he he worked with Mooney Mooney helped him a lot you know and Richard Jeni worked with Chris Rock and you know another's as well you know like this it's not like some of the greatest of all time I've had people that work with the Paul Mooney is God that's he's the great he's like important important influencers for sure when I when I was at The Comedy Store because he was like the first guy that I felt like was a real I was scared of him because I knew he worked for Pryor and knew he was like he's connected to royalty and he'd be around the comedy store and I just they stood still sharp his or Iceman I stood right there though I was like my twins and he laughed one time I was in I was onstage and for like ten people I was doing my act and I heard it in the back and then he came out to me afterwards he said that you're a funny motherfucker he goes you did that shit like it was a sold-out room he was your real comic and I was like wow like Paul Mooney said that to me cuz I remember he was connected he's connected to the fucking the man he was connected to Pryor's made like all those like it's the contribution it's I mean I guess it might be maybe it's different in hip-hop but in but in stand-up it's similar that we disguise like Bill burr who writes everything he says everything he says it's coming from a Bill burr place of my son contributing with anybody he's not you know he's not collaborating he's just he's just being Bilborough you know Joey Diaz same thing like like everything that guy says coming out of his head there's something extra to that you know it doesn't it's not better or worse it's just like you're going to it's like difference between you go in a restaurant and everything's homemade it might be the same as if everything wasn't homemade in terms of like the way it tastes but not the way it feels right feel like you got like you writes your own shit like when you write your own you play your own songs it's like yeah I'm getting a piece of you I'm getting a little piece of you comes out of your art and that's that's the difference it's not like there's anything wrong with collaboration collaboration is look if you look at Chris Rock stuff it's arguably some of the greatest work of all time in terms of like the finished product of Stanwyck the stand-up comedy bigger and blacker it's one of the greatest comedy specials in the history of the world period end of discussion anybody that argues with you is an asshole so that came out of collaborative efforts it's nothing wrong with that obviously it made something amazing and many other bits and many other things that a lot of great comics have done but it is different man it's different you know but we're all like some will in some way connected to each other and collaborating with each other will we like it or not it's not like that how many stages into the game were they gonna collaborate with you are they gonna be there for the final product are they just gonna be influences all along the way in your artistic journey yeah I mean a lot of words even the most they'd be the thing that I would consider that I wrote completely by myself if you want if you get down to the next level it's like there's 25,000 things that have influenced why I think that way or feel that way you mean so that's determinate that's why that's that the whole angle of like there's really nothing new it's all about the angle and and I like and it's like when I watch too I like I like watching the old a dog town like documentaries dog town and the zeebee and shit and it's like the whole approach to skating was like everybody can do that but it's not the style you do it in you know I mean that's what it really starts coming down to this now for me again if there's no brand new invention or brand new event right we're rehashing yeah experiences that air that has been happening since the dawn of time and as you're just finding a new style and a new angle to dress it up and that makes people feel like it's new sure sorrow romance of those things you're breaking the boredom of the way it's been thought of before in a new way and and that's what becomes appealing to people but goddamn when someone hits it and they do get through with something that's a new way of describing some shit we can all relate to it makes you feel so good music makes you feel good in the way the comedy never can the comedy makes you laugh it makes you have a good time together we're all in a room laughing hoot it up but music when you by yourself man you can just be it just be you and that music and you get goosebumps you can lift more weights you run faster like it fires you up man if I'm running hills and I'm listening to music I honestly feel like I'm cheating I feel like I'm cheating because I feel like I take this like burst of like artificial energy it's not dependent upon my discipline or Drive it's not artificial though no it's not but if I didn't make it yeah no but again see I don't know if it's some grass is greener shit and I don't I don't even know if that's the proper phrase but like just when I look it as an art form you'd like that comparison when you're like it's good music is this I'm like comedy is so much more precious because you work it to that point even if you tell an amazing joke that lives in me and I fucking love it so much I take it and tell it to him for me the minute I tell it to him it's ends it's like that's the end of that joke for me you know I mean it's so it's like there's a preciousness today it's like a fucking to me like there's a finite you're creating an art that's like gonna it's like almost like a dude the only where creates art just to fucking watch it like yeah yep right really like uh some Japanese Lantern that's gonna just go up in flames and fucking disappear it's like there's a beauty in that that to me is far different and far more again precious because it's it's it's life is shorter you get you have to watch it in that's my point is like you have to watch an idea of yours come to a finite end whereas like when an idea of mine comes to a finite end and it's good and it connects it can't I can repeat it over and over and over and people accept that yeah you know so it's like as it's just but to me it's just the preciousness of it if you understand what I'm getting at is like wow that was that all that work mm for that for the much like they limp it's almost like the Olympic athlete training his old life like that's how each joke almost is when you write it when I the way I and I watched a lot economy I'm fucking them all over all y'all motherfuckers shit on the one they post specials bill all those dudes I'm Tony on mind all this shit so it's like I'm really a fan of comedy and it's just amazing to me like I said the finite this stuff it is is is precious that's an interesting way of putting it I've never really thought about that way I thought about it in the way that like you have to write new stuff but I never thought about it in a way that like the first time that someone hears it that's the only time they really hear it every every time after that they know what's coming yeah they never see it the same way you know it's like again like an Olympic athlete you're working that joke you're working that joke out and you're worth the joke skin better and it's like okay it's a bronze metal joke right now and it's a silver manager if you ever get it to that gold metal joke and then you drop it where it's supposed to be on that place in time of the special or the thing that everybody sees then it's done you know what's interesting now is there's a lot of comedy nerds they want to watch the process still watch it flip punchlines around and flip things around and they go hey you did that thing different now yeah I'm trying to figure out how amazing to me if I had the time to just sit and watch you guys go to the comedy club every night or whatever these two ladies from Arizona and they came down to the store they travel around the world they would to see our in Europe or Iceland or some shit but they're their comedy nerds and they come to watch and they like they'll see you like two months ago then they come see again conversations with them know like yeah I like I switch that up like you'd put that there and like yeah I'm trying to figure out where to put it my point is like there's a journey there until you get to that point where it's like dropped in that special or thing that's been seen across no local broad spectrum it is a journey they and they know that because they're fans of the comedy so they know this things that thing's gonna that thing's gonna build into some you know that's what I would look again that's that sounds like a fucking amazing time to me well it's also like if you're a fan of music it's hard to go watch people practice it's different yeah because you're practicing in front of motherfuckers and they're reacting I'm practicing what we do it we call it shedding because we're locked in the fucking room doing it by ourselves and we're gonna do it in front of you till we got that shit right right you know we can't do that we have to do it in front of people but the weird the weird thing about it is it's like like they can come and see it they can see practice no no people can't see you practice really it's not practice you're just fucking perform it's Kerry's performance art you know yeah for sure so it's like you're working it out you have the concept but the it has to be worked out has to be walked to a destination so to speak yeah I mean the other part of it is though there's so many more people doing music from their art doing comedy like the waters are like less populated what do you think like the numbers for sure right absolutely because a more great bands and there are great community know there's not a lot of great bands there's a lot of fucking artists like there's not a lot of new great bands named a couple new great bands oh yeah okay I thought we talking about like what's coming you know the most raw or addictive currently yeah do the Rolling Stones are still on tour what the fuck is happening they just waiting for someone to explode the funny thing it was I think I went to their farewell tour like fucking and everybody back then was saying isn't it amazing they're still touring Aerosmith - same deal they were probably in their 50s then you know now what they likes 70s 80s do David Lee Roth looks healthy as fuck I was fine when you were you had him in is uh in your lyrics oh yeah dude he's healthy as fuck man that guy has no connection to the outside world here's a lady he uses the lady has a phone she she tells David where he should go and when did she meet you and David goes there and David doesn't bring a phone I don't even know if he had a wallet I paid for dinner I'm like this guy's he's not connected at all fuck smiles at everybody couldn't be friendlier he just knows his vibration he figured it out and he sticks with it can't hate he's hilarious man he's a fascinating cat that David Lee Roth you know he lived in Japan for like a year and learned kendo which is the art of sword fighting trained under a Japanese master he brought his dog rented an apartment got a fucking apartment in Tokyo and just everyday went to kendo practice got whacked with bamboo swords my one of my drummers the guy he's the fish he's actually the beneficent one the namesakes and uh he's into all that like heavy jiu-jitsu but like martial arts but he's weapons trained like a lot we're into it how many people move to Japan to train with a Japanese kendo master for a fucking year he didn't even speak Japanese he brings his dog to the other side of the planet to learn sword fighting for a year and he's David Lee Roth he learned Japanese things no he learned a lot of shit yeah he can speak like a broken version I'm sure of Japanese but I bet his Kendall's pretty badass I don't want sword fight him he really went for it you know he trained martial arts and karate and kickboxing under Benny her Kita's Benny the jet or Kita's California legend a world lies in a gym Lincoln man is very nice when I first came to California there's two things that I needed to do I needed to go to the comedy store first and foremost number two is I needed to go to the jet center the jet center was betting the Jets place of vampire I think I shot my first album cover there did you really yeah I'm pretty sure that's great what year like 1988 oh my god I wasn't yeah that's crazy I was just this is the first ever last record with ice ice-t like had a sign well that's crazy to his label yeah I got here too late man I got here in 94 and the gym had been so badly damaged by the earthquake that when it started raining was a year after the earthquake when it started raining the rain was leaking all throughout the ceiling the ceiling was a wreck and they had a band in the building and I don't think they ever they started off another place in North Hollywood but it wasn't quite the same thing like the jet Center in Van Nuys was like one of those places no I'm positive no that's where it is it's like because it's summer rock sing ring-like and I remember the Jets on it that's where we shot that's how I knew about Benny's you know that's how I learned about it tough dudes man I went there I was so nervous just came here from New York and I was still sparring back then I had to decided to stop sparring and I just needed something to do and I was out here doing TVs work and I was training with all these gangbangers man I remember this one dude he had something on his back I don't remember what he what the name of the gang was let's like flat us or something like that and then it just said fuck the rest on his back and I'm never thinking Jesus and one of the guys like blinky Rodriguez who was a world-class world championship level kickboxer he knocked out Johnny Theriot he was like a like top of the food chain kickboxer he had a son that succumbed to gang violence and so he like worked really I'm sure pretty sure that's the story and he worked really hard to like help the the gang members in the community and bring him in the gym for free and teach them kickboxing and and and and show them that they have value in that they could work out their differences inside the ring like men and not get involved in gang violence she liked us and so it was a weird thing because we'd go there and like he was like you're taking kicked by a fucking kid from the suburbs of Boston okay and I'm a comedian and I'm like fucking 26 years old but I'm hanging out with gangbangers and there's like hardcore kickboxing gym of one of my martial arts idols Vinny Akitas and another one blinky Rodriguez who was another one of my martial arts idols and you know know didn't know who the fuck I was and I was just in there like training with them and then it went under and I was like I got this brief glimpse into this place that was in my childhood like Mar Mar arts childhood like that was one of the mecca's that I need to go to I needed to go there he's the jet center but it just it all went away real quick like within I don't know I don't know how many months after showing their album was forever everlasting that's correct me like in a corner of a because they had to Everlast add me in a boxing ring and so I can yeah that was the jet Center we shot that it's Benny the jet was yeah there you go there it is there you go that's actually my father my father on the on the upper right there dude I bought that guaranteed I bought that CD 100% 100% I bought that that was all at the Jetson Wow that guy was a legend man Benny or Keita's was a beast he would go to Hawaii and fighting these crazy mix tournament so they do judo on you and boxing and all kinds of crazy shit this guys were the originators man they were the hardcore second wave after Bruce I damn look at you handsome bastard god damn you dude I got like a little Hitler stache or something going on there well I think I was trying to grow it look like a quarterback in a movie burly asshole I was I think 16 right there man that shot is taken by a legendary photographer named by the name of Glenn Freedman man he took many many of the most iconic shots ever do shoutout to Glenn you would play a perfect guy
