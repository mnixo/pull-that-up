in a centrifuge or they spin it in a centrifuge and extract the medium-chain triglyceride oil Pete Holmes that's what we're talking about MCT oil this is what's funny everybody's been asking me why we've never done one anothers podcast because we have an absurd amount of things in common I'll give you an example okay I was watching some starlet like in the writers room the other dis starlet a starlet I don't remember her never used that word I'm from the thirty I was just flipping a nickel under a streetlamp but we were watching some starlet on Letterman and he was just one of those great Letterman clips was really just being a dick write that stuff you don't really see anymore and I loved it but he was making fun of the the starlet because she ate clay and all I was doing was googling edible clay like I'm that guy I'm a believer you know what I mean like I'm one of those guys that fucks up medical studies you know what I mean like they give me the pussy but I'm like that worked my vision was sharp for four hours you know what is eating clay do for you you know see that's the thing is if she had de Letterman was giving her all this shit and she couldn't do it but I could defend it I was like if you ate poison and you went to a regular Western medical doctor that give you charcoal activated charcoal yeah the same idea these earthy type of things draw out heavy metals and and poisons from your body that's not to say that I'm gonna go and eat clay but every morning in my smoothie there's a shit ton of uh we can swear right yeah shit ton of too much television fella goddamn the man the television man well fuck balls there you go a shit ton I'm swearing about how much cilantro I put in mind because cilantro parsley these do the same type of thing doesn't garlic didn't know Rhonda Patrick talked about that garlic I'm having some sort of an effect of pulling heavy metals or attaches itself to heavy metals was it her might be something they'd be believers so you're putting activate or whatever it is well all it is is healthy fats so this is super simple good for you yeah it's a medium chain triglyceride oil so it's the healthiest aspects of coconut oil yeah it's good just get some healthy fats in yeah I do you do coconut oil as well yeah I'm a big fan of coconut oil and those forks over knives guys have you seen them lately no I haven't they're off oil they look like they're about to blow away they're dying in front of their noses they're so hardcore now I like that movie but those guys didn't see that one I don't think it's about the China so many of us you know the China study's been debunked did you know that they who tried a bunch of scientists although the entire Breitbart news staff now the trend study is alternative facts yeah well references for years unfortunately they didn't they they used some studies it these confirmation bias these some studies that correlate them all the time into it but there's like legit scientists even vegan scientists who have debunked it oh really yeah I've looked at it and said well here's the issue they didn't bring up this they didn't bring up that yes this couldn't have been perfect it was just a bunch of Chinese Jamie and pull something up on it because there's there's been some pretty good scientific analysis of it and now CeCe's Zen word hypothesis that sounds like a wrong word analysis is it's like the plural of thesis two species which sounds too much like fear yeah it's one of those things you never say you know here we go rest in peace China study yeah he's brilliant busy yeah you spent on my podcast for two and he was a macrobiotic was I make fun of Chris Keslar and you know it haha I'm just doing it general but he gets fucked with online but one of the reasons why he gets fucked with is because he was a hardcore vegan and he was having some pretty significant health issues and then slowly but surely switched over oh that's interesting yeah he well it's it's one of those things like some people can eat that vegan diet and love great and be fine and healthy it makes me feel I'm I'm a fleein what's that cajun elite fish that's just great I occasionally get drunk and eat Roscoe's chicken and waffles the thing is I don't want to be militant or stringent about anything it's really kind of another thing that we have in common is consciousness and I don't like being rigid about meditating I don't like being rigid about any sort of practice including the veganism so like I tweeted or I instagrammed a photo of me at Shake Shack I made a meme that's had two drinks not vegan so happy I'm like I might look like this I look like I'm kneeling eating a double Shack burger it was unbelievable double murder I you know it's really funny because I mock vegans all the time I had this whole bit about vegans in my act but it you will catch me at a vegan restaurant at least four days a week you know what you do yeah I I don't know if you Aaron Rodgers is a not a friend of mine but a pal of mine all those NFL guys you know this I'm not gonna tell you anything you don't know about athletes they're all eating plant-based and meat like they clean protein and they clean I just do the plants I don't like murder and I don't like the way it makes me feel frankly I like putting things in my body that are readily absorbed and I said this on my podcast I wonder what you think about this I say you can't eat a steak for protein I'm very curious what you're gonna say about it okay cuz I bet you're gonna school me I say you can't eat a steak for protein it's kind of like drinking coke for water it's in there but you have to do a lot of digesting and grinding and extracting to get it as opposed to something that you might blend and get into yourselves more readily well when you blend food for sure it gets in your cells more riddle so you could blend a steak yeah you can see that but I mean if you blend like vegetables it's much easier for your body to process like a smoothie yeah like goddamn I drink these kale smoothies and they go through me like rocket not really the shit's it's not the shit's it doesn't get me diet unless you drink too much MCT oh that's something I should bring up because it has come up if you take too much MCT oil it it ultra lubes you are inside and your body's like let it go like one of those logging boats tips over in a very fast river well that's what I see I like that you brought that up is I eat vegan to get high that's what I'm do to get high like if you eat III live like blue-green algae great stuff he's gonna ask you about that that's really really important if you do have video food and that's something that Chris Kresser brings up yeah 12 super important you know it's just it's very difficult to get with strict super day out for me needs to be in the dirt on the dirt I used to get in that way yeah and now I take III it gets you higher you take there's this product I should have brought you something called hi like what like just feel good just like clean like like a river like you're moving do you think that it was like you're placebo effect idea to that like I'm doing good I'm eating healthy okay that I could shake shack burger but I've done it the other way I was not a vegan for thirty five thirty sixty right so I have the data of both ways well it sounds like you're doing it smart if you're using III live and everyone's well you'll be like Jesus Christ I need some fucking sushi I eat sashimi or would you be willing to eat eggs from like a chicken that you knew lived in like a yard like something that's like healthy where you know there's no suffering I can dig that and it's one of beefs I have a PETA is that they have this campaign yesterday I do and I don't I like Peter has actually retweeted my stuff a bunch of times because I'm really really against dolphin captivity and really against Orca captivity and I say I think it's slavery that we tolerate in 2017 I really do I don't think it's anything other than that I think those things are arguably as intelligent as people they just can't communicate the way we can and they don't have hands that can manipulate objects and create art we have a hate I have a bit about this doing why do we it's not about dolphins but it's like why do we eat pigs but we don't eat dogs and I'm like hooves the evil feet that's true but the dog with hooves now picture everyone applauding is I dropkick that monster onto a lit grill anything with a cloven hoof that doesn't eat its own chew its cud yeah yeah like if you saw a pig with paws it's right and if you saw a dolphin with hands or a chicken that could talk right well chickens are dinosaurs chickens are fucking ruthless little monsters all right oh yeah I fed my chickens mice before I have 23 chickens you do not yes I do I love it I get all my eight-five eggs this morning from my chickens shit yeah they're like pets though like I go out in the yard like pets to give any attachment yeah my chickens died and my favorite one got killed by a coyote it was awful you know coyote run ran over the thigh saw it jump over through its mouth Joe Rogan is after a coyote you know one man then I found out the coyote was a mother coyote that had babies nearby and I felt bad I was gonna kill her oh he's gonna set it up I was with some food behind and sniper from the roof well I just felt like she's just doing what she's gonna do yeah don'ts I'll tell you something funny I met with one of the women that like founded Cafe Gratitude obviously yeah well vegan restaurant that's deeply under fire you know the whole story behind that right I don't oh my god what's that they they started eating meat again who did Cafe Gratitude the people owned it oh really he owned a ranch and they started eating meat again and they started talking about it and they received death threats and people were protesting and boycotting the restaurant yeah and they were terrified that they were terrified see this is why you got to be a fleein as long as you don't stand anywhere it's a pescetarian estate okay it was Kosygin Siegen yep because pescetarian means you eat dairy cuz I don't fuck with their a pescetarian means dairy yeah pescetarian I thought Pescatore is just fish it's vegetarian Oh vegetarian and vegan so fish vegan none of these are catchy you have to Justice League and which means you can't touch me but well he told me when I met with her as a nutritionist and again I I might be wrong a nutritional list is it not oh really it is a word nutritionist yes nutritional list I don't think that I make it up all kinds of smoking dope you want some awful brain I actually I'm on four right now on Jesus for I love for but you take the liquid or do you do the oh thank you so much have some Cynthia off the boxes Cynthia oh really yeah it's awesome please I I swear but he's good too alright so go ahead Kathy said she was like look if you're not gonna do it if you're a vegan but she was like the perfect thing to do is in III in the morning and one egg she's like you should eat one egg every day yeah this was good for you clearly there's stuff going on amino acid wise and also cholesterol good you know cholesterol is important people did you did you see the study that came that was in the New York Times it was not a study rather but no it was an expose in the New York Times about how the sugar industry paid off scientists in 1950s to demonize saturated fats and take the blame off of sugar right and for like a really absurdly low amount of money like $50,000 yeah exactly for $50,000 these guys essentially changed the way with this bogus study yeah change the way people think about sugar yeah when sugar should be goddamn terrifying I know it's a horrible for you did you watch food choices is a good one then there's fed up there's that sugar fill that sugar film there's a lot of really good diet where you're just like oh my god Gary Taubes in two weeks ago he's the author of the case against sugar Calvin and Tubbs no different guy he's journalist and he wrote a great book called the case against sugar but apparently he's controversial too it's a bunch of people are mad at him well you can get mad at everybody these are big lobbyists this is going after like cocaine it wasn't not not that it was other scientists disagree with him other nutritionists nutritionists you make me get I'm sorry you put words in my brain of course I did why wouldn't I it's Sunday or something actually yesterday the day off I didn't but well I should have got high watch the Super Bowl yeah I walked away from the Super Bowl before the end I'm like this things done the Patriots won in the most record over time whenever what do you mean like 34 to 28 it was down they were down twenty eight to three in the third quarter holy shit yeah Tom Brady they say he's the goat the greatest of all time oh okay know that you don't know that I didn't know now sports fan area I met Tom Brady did you give a shit and I'm friends with Aaron Rodgers you didn't feel weird didn't around him my dad is always texting me paid our tower and he's trying to get insider info house in feeling today I got five grand on the so we are hilarious give a shit that I had an HBO special there have a show coming out he's just like how is your pal Aaron Peter I got a betting on tell me just wants to win a little cash so let's go back to Cafe Gratitude so there's Cafe Gratitude people they decided somewhere long long what it was really weird because they connected it to Jesus it was they they had this statement that they made yeah there Jesus II yeah they don't get Jesus but they'll do Jesus while they're older you know I'm gonna need a laugh for that mmm you know we don't do cheese's but they'll do Jesus I'm not gonna give you a laugh I don't understand it's a pun oh he must have not heard that's a Tony Hinchcliffe style upon human beings don't like jokes that computers would get I'll grant it no I like them I just I just that one I don't know it didn't get me I understand it is what it is Jesus I was gonna say is I think this happens to a lot of people's to get older they start thinking that it benefits them to have some sort of potential deity in the future you know they die you mean yeah I think they think of the future and they think of heaven and they think of Jesus and God and all the numbers on that like the conversion you know people that become like serious Catholics when they're 70 you might not even be Catholic they might go to an alternative sort of church or you know like just some sort of a worship place you see the door you know and you'd like a friend on the other side right well I I think gratitude is incredibly important and I think like appreciation is incredibly important and one of the things that helps people feel gratitude and appreciation is a sense that there's something out there bigger than you and you sort of submit to that and I think when people get older and their health starts slowly deteriorating and it's inevitable you know I mean as much as I'm 49 and as much as I exercise and try to take care of myself I definitely feel like it's harder it's harder to maintain a certain level of fitness and health as you get older yeah and it can steadily have an excuse I'm just a soft dude you can you have an excuse you're vegan it's tougher oh come on you've had some of those super fit vegans rich roll yeah you had him on yeah for sure that did fit he's very fit yeah he's different kind of Fitness just running for long periods of time not really no one's trying to kick your ass yeah there's a lot no one's picking up a tree stump but my point is that I think that folks as they get older and they feel they're their health slipping and they feel there's a lot of people that they're they really up their workload as they get older like I talked to Bobcat Goldthwait about that and Henry Rollins is the same way he's like he feels like death at the door and he feels like he's got to be more productive he's got to get things done before he goes that's funny you could go the other way yeah for sure we could go more of a Buddhist threatened be like death is coming why was I so sliced in this game yes the toes every time I drink a green juice I said this on my own podcast I like to toast and go it won't save you you know what I mean right it's something beautiful and a lot of people when they're nearing death Ramdas has a great quote where he's like most people do the most profound spiritual work of their lives in the last five minutes they're on earth well because they get it you know surrounded by everybody stuck and lost in the drama of this is important and Joe Rogan he called me an asshole on Twitter every day and we're we're suffocating you know and then they're free people that just go like dude it was just a game it was a dance it was a play is a dance it's an experience but doesn't mean we can't play it I think like creative people for some reason feel towards the end that maybe they haven't done their best work yet and it's funny that this book is just sitting here randomly but this book the war of art is uh have you ever read it no please take it I've got a bunch of I'm gonna leave here it's a great book a runner up on double dare steven pressfield's book Thank You Jamie let's take the one that's I'm one of them is signed and signed leave it sign okay leave that one yeah I'll get you one more part I bought stacks of them and I give them to people and pressfield's been on the podcast that's why this one's signs but it's all about resistance and about how it's very difficult for people sometimes to just get things done because they put things off and they procrastinate and there's this weird thing that artists do where a lot of times they have ask stuff and it's almost like the the pressure of creating something of expressing yourself of doing something that you really feel proud of really good it just it's overwhelming do a lot of people and I think for creative folks as they get older sometimes it they feel like there's no time left yeah it's time to get going yeah Liz Gilbert in our book big magic talks about how it's almost like there's a collective unconscious and there's the ideas and we're almost like fishermen for ideas and something that I find motivating like I'm trying to write a book I'm trying to do all these things is I'm like I got a reel in that fish before someone else that's quieter more attuned into that unconscious is gonna he's gonna get to it first you know what I'm saying hmm there's like an urgency that's interesting not an idea and then like five years later someone else has something very similar and I an idea or a concept similar yeah I'm gonna missed out honestly that's not something I do well on that much but I do see it the other thing you made me think of is Tarantino before he wrote Pulp Fiction was like I can't die he's like I just yeah he had a fearlessness where he's like he was on like a bumpy plane and he was like I'm not gonna die I haven't finished pulp fiction oh he's meticulous and then he joked when he finished well fiction he was like shit he'll bill he became very very nervous that he had kind of like fulfilled his destiny wow that's that's egomania gone wild but don't you think there is something do you ever get in manic shapes when you're writing or creating where you're just kind of like burning clean white energy you're just like oh my god this is just kind of coming through me yeah well the the moment I start realizing it as the moment it goes away he's an adolescent yeah you know what I was gonna say to you that I bet you would like what I remember being very little and just being so much more interested than my other little friends at what happens when you close your eyes and when you're when you're laying down at night I feel like a lot of people aren't doing a lot of people that I asked about it aren't doing the kind of work of like what are you seeing what does it look like McKenna Terence Mckenna talks about our dreams are probably far more interesting than we ever yeah and realize her remembered right and if you're closing your eyes as you're falling asleep in you're paying attention if you see something amazing like I remember one time I was feeling like I was on the bottom of a rocket and I just saw the the exhaust of this amazing rocket taking me to outer space and it was perfect it was pristine and as soon as I tried to hold on to it it goes away just like that yeah that happens to a lot of people when they experience lucid dreams yeah yeah when you experience lucid dreams like you're you're a boy awake in the dream and then you realize it but apparently and it's amazing that I haven't done anything to try to cultivate this but apparently it can be cultivated and there's a lot of people out there who do experience lucid dreams and can manage that dream Yoga I'm a big lucid dreamer are you in fact it's one of the reasons I saw a video where you talked about alfalfa bran yeah thing with lucid when I take it late at night I always have these fucking trippy dreams like last night I took alpha brain before I worked out so it was a few hours before I went to sleep but I still I still had some really bizarre dreams as it's making its way through my system it's wasted time I think there is a parallel to be drawn we were talking about the drama of life mm-hmm when you have a lucid dream I think there's something very in the ballpark of enlightenment going on it's almost like a play version of enlightenment enlightenment why enlightened mom tell you because I'll have a dream that I'm back in high school the classic dream okay and there's the test and it's a it's a night you're scared right I'm scared and it's always like some history or math class and and I'm going around is very realistic I'm in my high school the geography is correct the people are correct and it's so realistic that I'm not just panicking I'm actually the dream is long enough that I'm asking people to borrow their notes so I can cram and then what there's a lot of techniques you can do to cultivate lucid dream and one of them I do all the time as I look at my hands any time in waking life if something surreal happens you look at your hands because if you look at your hands in a dream they always look wrong it's a it's a giveaway that you're dreaming do something I look in your dream they look inflated they look like those sports fingers you know energy Mouse hands yeah they're just ridiculous for some reason your subconscious can create a beautiful you know NASA rocket taking you there but your hands it can't do really turns out you don't know the back of your hand that well and and this thing right here is actually kind of trippy because this is what clocks look like in dreams because it's left brain right well we're talking about this who makes out again this team one made it so I could Nix YouTube clock yeah what is the name of his studio it was a wrong clock no no this guy is amazing he does about my hands and hands I use his hands he does it all by hand everything including the walnut case TG TG t - ÿà TG t studios well thanks all you order them it does it cuts the walnut and he uses those things inside of them come from Russia they're very difficult to get what are they called Nick's YouTube what is the Nixie tube you right there you had the whole answer but when any clock will look like that oh really cuz it's the wrong side of your brain what do you mean any clock will look like that's that looks amazing I might mix these up it'll look wrong it'll feel like it'll be 17 o'clock it'll be 17 the symbol for infinity and then ideally so the clocks will be fucked up too because the left side of your brain I might get these left-right confused the left side of your brain is what's dreaming and the right side of your brain is what controls language and right now so another clue is if you pick up a newspaper or a notes and it just looks like gibberish that's a cone that you're dreaming so whichever technique it is I'm having that horrible very real very important highschool nightmare and then you remember that you're dreaming and so you're still there but you're liberated we're liberated soul ego right there's no test that's that's a little taste of enlightenment I think as you go oh my god I was lost I was in that dream so hard and then you went there's no test and then he lied to Milan and he have sex with Kate Upton you know what I mean like you realize Upton she's a coucher beautiful model I remember her oh she's the the one with the really big breasts kind of heavy she had a kind of heavy and people were mad this just took a strange left turn from Kate Upton Oh beautiful right she was also um yeah that's her yes you know why it was funny like whenever in my podcast form on my website whenever people would be bored with the subject they would start putting up pictures of Kate Upton it became a meme or a theme she came to a show I did a show with Jed and she's you met Leslie man she's very nervous look right at her and go home I yeah I did to kind of like that door yeah that through no nothing she did just just random genetic luck she has become like I don't know what you're her voice sounds like I don't know a damn thing about her but she's pretty much perfect yes she's very pretty yeah well you know some people think she's fat why do if she gained weight I probably would just like her more really because you feel like she's human soft soft I like the world to be safe speaking of Tarrantino there's a great line in Pulp Fiction where he goes it's a shame that the things that are pleasing to the touch aren't pleasing to the eye like you're a hard man I bet it's more fun to hug me no offense please don't don't lunch meeting depends on what you're into yeah but you look way better than I do so that's turn you for how you look you should feel like me it should be like one machine I'm a tempurpedic mattress I don't like those yeah just sleep on a slab in your bed yeah I sleep on a like pretty dense bed that's so funny yeah I yeah your Sleep Number is well when I sleep because I don't know what it is man but whenever I sleep on a really soft bed I just get like a crick in my neck or my back feel like I sink in too much or something I understand I don't have a tempur-pedic I am a tempur-pedic well you can get tempur-pedic beds that are more dense I think I think they did come in various density they do yeah there's a firm one mmm so anyway Kate up anyway she's a tempurpedic but like a beanbag I call them thicker thicker milkshakes I like thicker no I like thicker milkshakes - but women I understand My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard are you attracted to women that are as fit as you I like women to take care of their body because I think that they have more of a body awareness I think they're sexier that's interesting also you draw an intellectual comparison you go you have abs therefore you know the science not even that they have abs I think people who move their body a lot like people who do yoga people do gymnastics or martial arts or something like that I think they're more aware of their body because they're they're communicating without in an intense way we haven't really yoga yeah if you do yoga like all the time you're communicating with your body in a super intense way on a regular basis and I think you'll just be less awkward more confident more sensual I completely agree yeah and it helped yoga helps you breathe I remember when I did a lot of yoga the guy was like you'll notice that Yogi's always breathe they stay calmer because they know what it's like it's another sufferer there's another DEATH thing it's like meditation your ass is supposed to hurt when you're meditating because you're trying to extricate your consciousness from your body really your ass is supposed to Hurley when you're sitting down what I'm saying is pain is part of it of yoga or of yoga I know it is of yoga you're going to say there there's pain right and yoga and I'm over here the only reason why I disagree with you my best meditation by far is in the sensory deprivation tank which not only another thing we haven't got no pain it feels amazing yeah I wouldn't call that do you meditate do you I mean in there yeah yeah well I breathe yeah meditation is all concentrating on the breath it's deep in through the nose and out through the mouth I take these really long breaths where I'll breathe in for like almost a minute yeah and I'll breathe out for almost a minute it's very difficult to do oxygenating your blood well I don't know if it's that or if I'm controlling myself I'm exercising my personal control yeah because you want to just breathe you don't want to do it like when you take try to take a long breath like a one-minute breath in it takes it's a lot of effort yeah I'll for sure and to hold it and then breathe out slowly well that's kind of my point is monks in the mountains or you in the tank or whatever it is people doing yoga there's something badass about it is because you're doing something that looks like when I was a kid I just thought monks were relaxing yeah oh they just they couldn't take the world there were too many TV channels they went up into there those dudes are tripping out and they're denying the pain of their body just like I'm exactly what you do when you push through a workout I had a friend of mine who became a monk really yeah it was a regular dude Duncan no different I don't I haven't communicated with him in a long time I'm sure he's not I don't know I mean he might be just completely off the grid now because he dove in hardcore I was probably like 17 18 years old and he was a guy that I used to train with him I talked window schools name was Joe Joe Smith trying to remember his last name anyway he's a nice guy but an interesting guy you know he was like cool black dude and he started meditating because he would get real nervous before sparring Oh in sparring made him real nervous so he started to figure out a way to maximize his physical ability and his potential and he figured controlling his mind would be the best way so he got involved in meditation and then he sought out lessons at this Buddhist temple and he started meditating there and he got super serious and then he quit his fucking job and moved out of his apartment and lived in the temple and just cleaned up for his food and he became a vegetarian very strict vegetarian he would eat just vegetables and rice that's all lost a shit ton of weight and essentially stopped training altogether stop fighting and competing and doing anything like that and just would meditate we're talking about giving up your life to gain it that's like a Jesus yeah and you know like a Zen koan like the sound of one hand clapping you know meditate on that cuz there's no answer to that he had a really weird one it was a really weird one something about a dog barking yeah I know is how do you know your Buddha nature through the sound of a cricket and you then you're just supposed to be like hi well the crackhead is me and I'm the cricket and they're just like rock there in the corner but see that's pain - there's all this like we know in our life that suffering leads to growth and it leads to like a cleansing sure had all these things and and I think these turned on guys figure out that they can manufacture a type of suffering instead of waiting for it from the world which is it's going to come inevitably you can go and sit on a hard-ass floor or you can restrict your diet or you can breathe in for a fucking minute you're causing suffering because you know on the other side of it that's where bliss is that's where wisdom is all these good things it's also the understanding that a lot of or the desperate need to breathe is just your brain fucking with you and you're gonna be fine if you take this one binge in the I love the body yeah like what I've been freediving and there's a beautiful mood when you're low and you're like shit you panic right and my friend who was teaching me he was like he calls it second breath where if you relax you realize it's your brain fucking with you so your brain is like a Woody Allen character and it's just like we better get up right now you know to me and you just go shut up Woodrow and you realize you had way more oxygen and yeah and you relax and then that's medicine I feel like you know it gets this reputation as being kind of like a soft or maybe even like a feminine kind of meditation hating yoga not so much now but it's certainly my father doesn't think it's cool yeah has definitely a feminine reputation or a weak reputation which is insane because it's the most difficult things I do yeah I lift weights I do martial arts do all these different things and I swear to god yoga is as difficult if not more difficult than all of them yeah for sure and I'll say you probably wait I mean you look like you weigh a good amount yeah round 200 pounds somewhere on there I wouldn't want to throw yeah so if you're using 200 pounds and your that's your resistance it's gonna be difficult throw me what do you mean I you know I think I would hurt my back if I were trying to try to heal oh you like martial arts stuff so a mall pet or something I'm seeing like a friendly scenario where you go please like give me like a dwarf oh you uh throw me how you got from yoga throwing people I'm just saying you weigh enough that I wouldn't want to throw okay you look at someone I like to throw you you feel like I've a small fella this is what big folks do is we look around and go whoo in an order from one to ten who in this room would I toss first who could I throw the furthest I would throw Jamie first um but for me like there's there's moments in a yoga class where I swear I'm tested as much as anything ever in my life right you know where you you're holding a pose and it's you know you can keep holding it but you know you want to stop yeah and your your whole body shaking and you know you pose you literally see the sweat pouring off your face and pouring off your body especially hot yoga yeah all yoga I do is hot yoga yeah it's like sweaty guy in the class Oh I do cool yoga I'm still the guy with I gotta put out the special towels you know it looks like a dog but I've seen people do yoga on like hardwood shiny floors and you know like in very sweatin they're slipping all over the place that just doesn't seem smart no that's dumb yeah yeah it doesn't get it it doesn't get the respect it deserves but I think that uh you know it's also there's so many douchebags involved in it that's part of the problem well it's got so many douche guys ruin everything they do body sprays yeah I'd like to wear a bluetooth earpiece it's sometimes I gave up on them I gave up on them when I saw how gross it looks and people or what it's interesting because you could be having a meeting on a phone rather a conversation as long as there's a cord that goes into your ear yeah I would be like oh he's just having a conversation alone that's cool it's over you're standing there talking and you're moving your hands around you got an earpiece in like a yak douche bag yeah yeah and if you leave it on blinking during dinner you are a douche they really I some of them these diplomat glue right it's Bluetooth I saw the guy he's got the ear pods ear buds buds you know in that are wireless yeah yeah Gary Vee he was here the other day Gary Vaynerchuk just keep a woman loves him I wonder if when the cordless phone came out anybody was like eh that's do she know for sure what do you don't need a cord bro you fucking cool somebody has a bit about that I wish I could remember it's like the first person that used an umbrella they were like oh you're too good to go weren't wrister I got an umbrella like the latest technology was an umbrella I'm sure I wishes people people are always looking to be upset at cars that don't make any noise oh you're gonna look at your car you fucking balloon you're gonna hit a cat Oh what are you using the solar power instead of dead dinosaurs the dinosaurs not good enough for you although fossil for you isn't really dead dinosaurs just FYI it isn't mostly plants really yeah plant-based diet well it's some things rotten you know but there's a there was a book called black gold stranglehold that I read it was so confusing because like honestly at least 15 years ago but the books the premise of the book was that what we've been hoodwinked and that the idea that oil is a finite resource is not true that it's actually a natural process of the earth itself like it'll keep making its a repeating process and that wells that have been dry have rebounded when left alone really yeah no it's true though that never looked into it again maybe I believe we looked at maybe we talked about it once during a show but we're probably hi scatterbrained I had a great experience in a float tank the other day I've done it maybe four have you ever been well you have one don't you yeah I'm one basement that's awesome I went to a place called just float oh yeah I think the first one that I want to Pasadena yeah that's huge it's the biggest place in the world they're like best company for you the biggest they have more float tanks I think than anyone in the world well it's amazing because it's the first one that I was like oh this is like a spa like I did another one in Venice that some guy in flip-flops is my boy crash he's got my tank he's the best the float lab I couldn't get over the fact that he was gonna come get me he's the best in the tank how long have I been in here whose name is a sound effect it's good enough on the door and it's gonna scare the shit out of me it's only ruined it I just float maybe crash does this now it plays music it lulls you out of it yeah a lot of guys like to do that it's a good move and it's like a pizza oven like it's like a door in the wall and you crawl in yeah and I had a pretty I was trying to go like leave my body did you ever talk about astral projection yeah well no but I know what you mean I was spending most of it being like it would be so trippy if I just like went and visited my girlfriend right now I I remember I'm not saying I did it but I definitely didn't do it but I remember having this very clear thought where I was like I've always wanted to try a century deprivation tank and I was in it so it was somewhere else completely unaware that I was in it and then I like jolted back into it let you say my awareness I was lost in my mind so deep that I forgot where I was I forgot who I was mmm very relaxing yeah it's amazing and it's also something that the New England Patriots use on a regular basis how about that out huh really yeah believe the Falcons weren't used it too they put the goat in there they use it for all their players they use it for visualization the use it for recovery it's a really great source of magnesium too because the have some salts it absorbs through your skin yeah did they change the water yes they do they do and they also filter it out like the float lab has a really intense filtration system which uses ozone they use these gigantic spa filters and ozone and like to the point where it kills everything that might be in that water mmm except to you except come except common beats off in the water so your friend that went in went and he was like I had to pee I just let it go oh you want to spend an hour in your own piss and that is all what is that the gratuity that's an asshole that is a real asshole move that's the thing that people are fucking terrified of those things tubs and swimming pools but you think they're ruining the communal it's like when I was in high school you said this vat of coleslaw that like was free and I was such a hungry boy that I would love the coleslaw then you find out that jocks are spitting is wrong like that's art that's for everyone assholes ruin everything they ruin yoga yep yeah earpieces Bluetooth veganism that's why I don't want to be so um pull up the article on that that restaurant in LA was it gold again earlier the article came out in May of last year yeah six seven months ago they found out it came from a blog post that they had posted in 2015 so it had gone unnoticed for almost a year yeah then they were getting yeah they made a blog post about what was the ranching and farming and that they started eating meat again so they're healthier the animals yep raising cows responsibly but you know to vegans the hardcore at least it's it's still murder you know you're still killing these animals right you know I'm a are you a Joseph Campbell fella yes love them here it is return to meet by Cafe Gratitude owner spark vegan uproar uproar yeah really a really scary shit because they were getting death threats which is really yeah I mean just doesn't seem or it doesn't the right way to approach it yeah it's just but you get a lot of that man you get a lot of people like what's going on like you know that UC Berkeley the Milo gianopolous protest that was going on a few days ago oh sure I saw this guy there was a girl out there was a trump supporter and she was trying to I don't know if they were filming her or what but you know there's a lot of people out there that they show up these things they like they want to argue they want to make videos and argue with people some guy hit her over the head with us the wooden handle of a sign and she swung at the guy and another guy got in front of her a Meister in the face and there's a video this and you're like whoa you guys you guys are the kind people that don't want this man who you think is you know they keep calling him a Nazi it's hilarious because he's a gay Jew he's a gay Milo gianopolous this her doing it okay so she's wearing a make America great again hat and some guy comes across I know this is not the video that I saw I saw it from a different angle but they take her she gets pepper sprayed are they showing it she's they're not they might okay that looks right there she just gets a pepper spray like see you see it towards the end that's great somebody just pepper sprayed her just just because she's wearing that hat witches look at this look that's a fuckin man just walks up to her and pepper sprays her in the face it's crazy the idea that you think you could do that just because you don't agree with that person thoughts you right you can choose violence because you don't agree with that person's thoughts instead of having a civil DS not she's not in any way threatening this is not physical she's not doing anything violent we're missing a mythic hero you know a lot of people want Bernie Sanders to be that guy but we don't have Martin Luther King right that's telling us listen only love can draw out like route hate only light can draw darkness well once a us there's a lot of people that don't have a narrative or a story or or something in common and then you just have people kind of running it however they see fit and some people are stupid and they're gonna pepper-spray be well there's also this is this her getting this is another angle of it but front angle so she's got this hat on I mean it's fucking insane man that someone could just walk right up to her and pepper spray her in the face just because she's wearing a hat that supports Donald Trump you know if you want to talk to someone you talk to him if you don't agree with them have a conversation with them but there's this narrative that's going around and it's punched Nazis people keep saying that so well who the fuck is a Nazi who do you determine is a Nazi you decide there are not see and then you punch them right do you have evidence to this person to Nazi do you I mean do you you see them do they have a Nazi flag on them are they saying Sieg Heil do they have a copy of Mein Kampf I mean no you just decide wearing the Halloween costumes over now here's how it goes here's the thought processes if you wanted to follow like on flowchart it's like decide someone's a Nazi then you could punch him punch Nazis find someone are they a Nazi I say yes punch them right and so there's this there's a bunch of people like respectable intelligent people that are just plain upset the Trump is the president just plain upset that in their eyes and I think rightly so there's a lot of assholes that support Trump and there's a lot of assholes that are now gloating and they know they're like grow up you lost we won there's all this going on and their response to it is now those people are Nazis go punch Nazis and these really impressionable people are out there punch them do you see Jake Shields the former UFC fighters an MMA fighter is a good friend of mine he had to save some kid who was getting beaten up by a whole group of people just because he was a trump supporter he didn't do anything he was just there at this thing and there's a few you know people that were you know Trump supporters or mildly innopolis supporters and the rest of them were people that were mad that Milo was playing there it's it's so controversial and so fucked up and so wrong yeah because the left is now becoming the right like you're becoming a fascist by saying it's like you want to stop that it's like a weird twist yeah movie yeah I love the there's a Kabir quote where he says do what you have to do with another person but never put them out of your heart and I think that's a very great way to remember I was with Rahm das with Duncan in Hawaii and he said I hate Donald Trump here not here he pointing to his head it's not as hard and then the thing that I love and this has been a mantra for me for ever since I've heard it so it's been about a year but it's very applicable now I think is that hate is a lack of imagination so when you see somebody wearing a hat and then you make all these assumptions but you're not taking the time to consider maybe this person was raised different from me maybe this person is scared of this this or this maybe they had medical issues you know I'm saying there's this great David Foster Wallace thing where you in that great graduation speech he gave called what is water have you heard that no it's amazing but he talks about when you see an SUV on the highway and you just assume that there's some like piece of shit changing lanes fucking burnin gas taking up the world like a like a real Emma like a Schwarzenegger doubt guy that's a that's a dick and taking more than he deserves I mean he's like that's a lack of imagination if you consider that maybe that's a mother who was in a terrible car accident that was all but prescribed to drive a a big vehicle so she would feel safe again that's what I'm talking about when you see someone wearing a hat and you just go well that's a Nazi I'm gonna punch it you're not taking the time to not just have empathy but actually compassion and realize that we're all in this together I remember after after Trump won in the greenroom of a comedy show the way I did a show the next day and somebody was having like a full-blown panic and rage and talking about how the terrorists were gonna test him like the tariffs are gonna test him they're gonna they're gonna do this and this and really panicking and it really kind of gave me a little bit of perspective on it I was like if Hillary had won we not us but other people who were just like us would be somewhere else in some other comedy club and some other greenroom hmm complaining about how the terrorists are going to test Hillary you know oh she's weak she's a woman they're gonna test her and it just made me realize shit we're all in this together that's what I mean it beyond empathy into compassion when I see someone in a red hat I go there's my brother and my sister a different life a different path playing a different part but we're we're all part of one body and pepper-spraying that body you're just spraying yourself you're I understand rage and and protest you know what I'm saying I don't agree with Trump well here's the thing but violence is we're hurting ourselves I think you're right about a lack of creativity or a lack of imagination and being able to look at that person and say well how did that person get to that point what went wrong in their life and why are they here where they you know are you know whatever it is whether they're pepper spraying somebody or protesting against something or you whenever you have a cause and you have two sides people gonna jump on one side or the other it's just natural people want to be in a tribe they want to be on the team and when you set up the narrative and a really dangerous narrative that people on the other side are fools people on the other side are evil people on the other side do you you set up these two camps and these two completely different sides and it becomes a black-white issue but it comes a red state blue state issue and this is what you're seeing here you're seeing fights these are is this tribal because it's it's it is us as soon as we come and ask they become of them what her hat isn't even a trump hat it says make make Bitcoin great again it's a Bitcoin hat oh Jesus Christ what if I was suddenly on so yeah pepper sprayed her and he thought it was a make America great again hat jesus fucking christ oh my god it's just assholes you know and not only that most of them are wearing face masks and they're covered in there's a mob mentality that is a very real it's whatever condition whatever it causes it in the human psyche but something happens where there's this diffusion of responsibility when people act in large groups that allows people to do really heinous things and it's been studied you know there's been psychological studies drawn on it or done on it and it's it's really confusing but you know that pull everybody if you ever been in a riot type situation or in a group situation where there's a lot of people and something goes wrong it's really weird there's a weird feeling that happens when a large group of people in the subway going downtown to the women's March and it was getting so packed that people were like starting to panic oh the kid threw up and stuff and I was going shit I forgot what it feels like to be with a lot of us when we start getting scared yeah but that's the beginning of imagination that's the beginning of coming up with some sort of game plan for compassion when we can sit down and have discussion I'm not saying don't make signs and don't raise your voice but I am definitely saying don't pepper spray somebody that's in this world with you that's right trying to figure it out the best we can you know I mean this don't make signs don't raise your voice like it's it's always a good thing to discuss things right but what's wrong with these discussions with like the Milan appleís thing is they're trying to stop him from speaking if you want to get your point across schedule a debate he'd be more than happy to debate you and do it in a respectful manner where you can try to pick apart his points I've had Milo on my podcast I've picked apart his points I've had him on and we've gone back and forth on the like important shit like religion and circumcision and this you can have a conversation with the guy and what he's doing is he is getting a fuck ton of attention through the Streisand effect when you try to silence him by pulling him out of these these things just for speaking he's not doing anything wrong he's just speaking the university has allowed him to be there and then people are going crazy to do a hundred thousand dollars for the damage to the to the university and then the fucking mayor of San Francisco congratulate speak for speaking their mind he congratulates people for expressing themselves like that was a fucking riot man like do you understand what happened a hundred thousand dollars were the damage of people getting beat up and a girl getting pepper spray for wearing a Bitcoin hat that's not good man I know you want to be progressive and I know you want to be liberal and I know you want to be the the mayor of the most progressive place but this is all the wrong message the correct message is calm dialogue people discussing things well keep calm and remain calm and carry on so this guy Milo when you're fucking screaming yelling he wins when you stop him from doing that he sells more books you're also making a bigger point I think which is when we become us and we let them become them and we lose sight of the fact that we are all part of one body yeah I mean one we giant super organism yeah talk about wanting to belong to a clan yeah we do we belong to a very special group it's a trip that you're here that you are here at the same time I'm here and we're here talking that's beautiful that's what I like like someone's a hippie let's take it together I'm already on it I wish I were I'd be going off even deeper but I'm just saying when you take psychedelics you do get that glimpse into your like you know when you give some if I give you a gift if you give me this book it's really just the right hand giving something to the left hand it's all one thing so it doesn't work to fight against ourselves and it's not good to call somebody them and to be divided so well it's also there's no communication going on when you're screaming and lighting things on fire and breaking windows at Starbucks that's not communicating you know you're expressing your anger that this guy who says that feminism is cancer talk to him try to figure out why he's saying that have a debate with them do you disagree with him find out what he's saying that's not valid and have a counterpoint to it and that's how people get to share ideas express themselves and then the people watching get to look at it and go well he had a point but then his points better and then you figure out and that's the marketplace of ideas and that's how human beings communicate and as soon as you stop that as soon as you stop free speech you fuck the whole goddamn thing up because now you have decided that you're a fascist and you are saying that your ideas are more important than other people's ideas you I'm not a good devil's advocate person but don't you worry that some of the people that are making more based kind of dismissive generalizations like feminism is bad and right and Muslims are bad right aren't necessarily listening to an intelligent dialogue right therefore isn't there sort of like a cause and effect of like this is some crazy shit we're gonna do some crazy shit some of them is endorsed writing hyper spray you're right some of them aren't listening but I think you always have to appeal to the higher side of human consciousness and you always have to express yourself in the most articulate way that you are capable of so you should try to your best to get your thoughts across and it's not always easy it's oftentimes very difficult especially when emotions are involved especially when you think this cause is very important but I think it's critical because you're doing something in a very public way right because this is something that people are going talk about for months and months they'll be talking about the UC Berkeley riots for a long time it's very critical I think whenever you're dealing with something that is going to get massive exposure like that to do your very best to communicate your thoughts without all this extra bullshit attached yeomen anger and screaming and yelling don't get lost in it don't get lost in it and and figure out a way to vocalize to articulate the the reason why you feel a certain way and what you have thought about it not not not some knee-jerk bullshit that's easy to dismiss you know Muslims are bad and this is bad that's bad and feminism is for fucking pussies not that way no to express why you think milos wrong express why you think he's right and that's the marketplace of ideas yeah and you might disagree with that person that you're talking to but you've got to let him talk you got to let him talk and then you got to figure out a way to counter what they're saying I again not a good devil's advocate I think people worry when we let these people talk and I went to look when you say these people though Milo is not someone to worry about he's not a guy who advocates violence he's a really interesting guy to talk to he's kind of a troll I mean what he's doing he's fucking with people and it's really accurate yeah and it's really what he's doing is being very effective and he's getting people to buy his books he's getting people to come to his lectures he's getting people when he got banned from Twitter that was probably the best thing that could have ever happened to him he did like a hundred interviews afterwards there was on CNN even CNN they're doing our CNN supposed to be news right so he they have a photo of him ridiculous photos were in a fur coat with sunglasses on because he's so silly and it says Milo gianopolous is trying to go to colleges to convince them that hate speech is cool like how the fuck is that an article on CNN yeah how is CNN saying that because that's not what he's saying he's not saying that hate speech is cool look at that right there my only innopolis is trying to convince colleges that hate speech is cool how the fuck is that the news it's not the news that is heavily editorialized that that's a ridiculous you're taking a stance on his opinion that he would rapidly disagree with and it's it's not right and this is this is left versus right it's like CNN is the new Fox News CNN is the skies falling and the world is shit we're fucked and Fox News is now all the Satan's what the grass is green and everything's rosy we're making America great again with bizarre it's interesting because you're trying to zoom out and I think that's one of the things that's very integral to kind of getting through a time like this is zooming out and going yeah look looking at what's happening in a big way we're becoming what we don't want to become we're becoming militant we're becoming violent we're becoming fearful and I would I wish there were more opportunities to have I guess these these dialogues that could be done peaceably well I think there's an issue also and that people do not feel like Donald Trump represents what they think of as a leader in their mind and a lot of people's mind and in my mind Barack Obama was an amazing leader in the you know people will get mad and pissed at you especially conservatives would've ruined American listen that guy was smart he was articulate he was calm and measured and he always seemed like he wanted what was best for the country yeah whether you agree or disagree with his policy he in my mind was very statesman like I agree the way he would say when you're in when you're playing a part the president I'm not famous resident as a puppet but I'm saying part of it is the mythological role and the president and that's why people talk about acting presidential because how much of it is that yeah how much of it is the way you handle yourself and the way that you treat other people and and the way that you tweet or the way they tweet about The Apprentice sucking yeah sad period it's it's a strange just even the vocabulary I see a lot of the trolls using some of the same yeah there's things sad they do that - they say sad at the end of their surgery on Joe Rogan's podcast sorry not behind president you're not funny anyway sad Chuck how did what's it like to be a cock yes well it happened because that's what one and that is the response we tried one way we didn't like it now we're trying the other way it is it's a classic example of what human beings do yeah we don't well that's that's doomed out I like that well I don't think that the idea of a president is the smartest idea to run a group of 350 million people that are trying to integrate and communicate with the other 7 billion people in the democracy isn't the best form of government it's just the safest it's good quote they were like safest we have a patriarchy would be far more this is what they were like if you had a benevolent ruler like a really good one right that would be more effective but it's too risky to do that way too risky it's just contrary to human nature yeah absolute power and it corrupts absolutely doesn't wavy gravy as he was kind of he is I think he's still alive this like weird hippie guy kind of like the comedian of the time we did all the psychedelic kool-aid acid trip bus things okay he had a funny joke where he was like he wanted to nominate nobody for president we should vote for nobody cuz like nobody can do it but they had all these funny slogans where it was like nobody can solve our economic problems nobody cares about you funny things he's like and more people vote for nobody than any other candidate combined we got to get nobody in the office yuxuan neil degrasse tyson posted he said there should be an option for none of the above and then if none of the above wins we start the process all over again why I think a lot of people would have done that I think that's a great idea because to make this artificial limitation like okay how many people would have lined up and gotten all around every way they would definitely have tried to vote to ban like I'm voting that we need to go we need to go back to one for a for president all the other things you get to vote for and then for president vote none of the above I bet it would have been like 70% of the country oh and something about bet would have been something crazy you would have done it just for the novelty of it been like I was the first one to vote none of the above everybody went up in the first it would be no way I think would've been most of the country yeah because I think that even if you were opposed to Trump there's very few people who thought that Hillary was the ideal candidate for she was incredibly flawed she had deep deep ties to financial institutions she wouldn't release the transcripts ran and people get so mad when you talk about these things you're the reason why Trump won bro you're a big part of it man you kept harping all the problems that Hillary has said you know I'm supposed to ignore what's real and true and obvious about a person if the other person has flaws as well yeah that's not how it works yeah that's that's how you box yourself in and put blinders on that's not lifting up and looking at it objectively right right right through the reality is it's an insane job to put one person in power of all these people I think there should be a large group of people it should probably be chosen by a large group of people I think that voting should be far easier than it is I think registering to vote should be far easier than it is it should be something as simple as you have a Social Security number punching your social security number oh it shows here you're over 18 yes you can vote it should be that simple are you not a felon you're not a felon okay great you can vote light buzz on shouldn't there be like maybe some sort of a just up just a very light test to determine what your understanding is of these bills what your understanding is about the impact of these things what your understanding is about what this entails I always think it's the immigrants that understand that stuff because they have go through a very rigorous process and then you ask me what the Bill of Rights is and I'm like Oh Bob when I was a kid where I used to deliver newspapers when I say a kid I was driving you know when I was like 16 18 okay yeah like and when I was delivering newspapers there was this guy named Anan Anand n/a n/a n/a Indian gentleman who used to work he was a pharmaceutical expert in his country but when he came to America he you know his degree didn't translate over here and so he's becoming an American citizen so he would always he was a hilarious little dude he's just swear all the time we'd about a hundred pounds and he'd be like I could easily throw yeah you could throw him like a beach ball it's like you don't know shit nobody knows fucking shit nobody knows shit in this fucking country what you do in this fucking country who come here and then you go home you go to sleep you don't fucking know shit about your fucking laws because he was trying to read all this stuff because he had to become a citizen and so he was he would you know ask me questions do you know you know what the Thirteenth Amendment is do you know what the 14th amendment is yeah he was like and I believe I don't know any of these things he'd laugh yeah get the fuck out of here go to yeah this is a real where the kids children exactly you know what I mean we don't know the value we don't have to we don't have to yeah yeah and people tend to do what they have to do I think the way you become an immigrant in this country we have to go through a comprehensive test and you have to understand the history of the United States that test should probably be what you have to go through to vote it's finally right because I'm agreeing with you but what I'm agreeing with is we should simultaneously make it very very easy social security number and very very difficult very easy to be registered to vote so it's not something up you missed the deadline fuck you your vote doesn't count how why it would the line be to vote would I'll be studying like it's a bit like popped one random question and was like you'd have to do it online and if you did it online to be able to cheat but even if you wherever the cheat even if you ordered what's more chicken than that I'm looking it up on Google right but even then at least some of that data is gonna get into your fucking head Yeah right that's got to be better than the understanding that most people have whether its historical yeah whether it's just a comprehensive understanding of how our electoral process will say that because googling it doesn't stick that was that was times it does I don't remember shit like I have to listen to things about three four times before I finally but don't be thinking it's because they don't have like an emotional connection to you like if I wait and it's really important yeah well I had a bit about well where I was like the time between not knowing and knowing is so brief right there's no feeling associated with knowing like you don't get adrenalin and adrenaline is linked linked to memory like Adrenaline's linked to memory oh yeah it's this is right up your alley if you're ever trying to memorize something college kids listening get reading for a test dip your arm in ice water every 30 minutes or whatever really it'll become a traumatic experience it'll help you memorize this is why we have a hard time forgetting trauma so it's a very light trauma oh that's interesting you can see a lighter trommel just by just ice water which is not that traumatic at all don't get a big ol tank and dunk here they've done controlled studies and well what a great idea well that seems to be like you could memorize things really good in a cryo tank yeah I did like cryogenic yeah I've never done that of you I do it all the time oh really yeah use some unit you fucking feeling that's 250 degrees below zero is then that unbearable yes you do it for three minutes for some reason okay three minutes for some reason I was like they figured it out a way to make you cold but you don't experience oh no you experience the fuck out what about infrared saunas I did what I'm great I don't fuck around with that but good for you I spent messing for bloomix blessing for memory stress in the brain brain connection though the limbic system includes the hypothalamus hippocampus and there's only one chain he just throws it up on the board in the amygdala and other important brain structures that govern emotional responses behavior and long-term memory number release of adrenaline increases levels of activity of these areas the brain has been associated with improved memory isn't it funny like the words that he googled are bold this isn't we are living in the future it's so amazing but the bit I had was that Google's making I think it's one of the reasons I got to do a talk show after Conan and I did these two conan sets and i think i picked good material and the first one was about how google's like a calculator that helps you cheat at everything funny so you don't know anything right and the example I give is there was a time like I've been in bed and I'm just like where's Tom Petty from and I just look it up running but back in the day if you didn't know where Tom Petty was from you just go around and ask people right and they would lie you'd feel yeah that gal bro he was born in there Asia and they'd be that always long hair he looks like California maybe California then one day you'd meet a girl in a Heartbreakers t-shirt and to tell you Florida yeah and endorphins and adrenaline and all this rise things would light up in your brain and you'd remember that moment for the rest of your life and that's how you met your wife he's one of the few awesome things from Florida there's like Leonard Skynyrd yeah Tom Petty Billy Corbin who wouldn't cocaine Cowboys yeah but Disneyland's in LA what's better Disney World is supposed to be bigger right I like Epcot I'm 37 games over then they eat babies remember that kid got snatched up over there fuck alligators there's no alligator Disneyland I know there's Cougars though chicks yeah fucking lip jobs hi buy into Disney I'm embarrassed I want to be like fuck this shit do you have children no when you have children Disneyland becomes a magical place it already is but it really is if you have children I want to love some children in the big golf ball in the big golf ball what's that bro oh I have but I was really young I haven't been to Disney World I went and I went to I did a corporate show at Disney World and it ended at like 10 o'clock and they'll keep one park open till midnight or something maybe it's 11:00 and I went out but you couldn't buy tickets until they stopped selling tickets at 8:00 so I went up to the gate and I'm talking to the girl and I'm trying to get into Epcot and you know they're they're so trained to be good at customer service so they're just like I'm so sorry swear you need a ticket and you can see the town they're from right come on Daisy I know they raised you better in Grand Rapids she's like I'm so sorry and people are walking by going like hey great show like see and she was like I'm so sorry and I and then they opened the gate for a woman with a stroller and you snuck in and I just went like I just put my hands up and I was like Daisy I'm so sorry if anyone asks I'm gonna say that you tried to stop me but I'm going in what'd she do she was just like please don't please I was kind of being a dick but she was just like please don't please don't and I walked and you go over this bridge when you get in and as soon as I got over the bridge I felt like a refugee going back to Tom Petty holy shit one of the best nights of my life one heart closed we had some sake I was with this a young lady that was organizing the event we had sake sake or sake I say sake right I've never heard anybody say sake but I think you're right no but we drank it okay and everything in Epcot is unlocked so the park is closed it's dark and we're waiting to get kicked out and we're opening every door going into rides that have been shut down put your hands in the gears this thing work my finger would turn it on if it was going that way then I jumped fences and swam in every pool I pass no you didn't it was one of the best nights of my life you jumped fences you're just once you broke one law you're like fucking I'm a rebel you get a little sake and you know and then you get the the feeling of entitlement that Disney provides they make you feel so important mmm it's one of my theories why I think rich people are assholes is because have you ever stated like a four seasons yes then if you say at the four season and they love you in there and they're hello mr. Rogan we noticed that your room isn't quite ready here's a mai tai you know what I mean they just kiss your ass so hard right then you go I had this happen I stayed over four seasons in in Hawaii and then the next week I was on the road in Portland and I was staying at a best well just like this is why rich people their dicks cuz I was like like sorry your rooms not ready and I was just like could you call me when it's right they looked at me like I was insane they're like no I'm not gonna call you when it's ready go get a fuckin hundred grand bar and sit down nobody cares John Tulane and bar John Mulaney is the best bet he did SNL I tell the story like it's my own I don't even give a shit he was writing for Mick Jagger on SNL and it really helped me understand why rich people and celebrities can be rude because he's watching makjang Google like diet coke you know do you mean not being an asshole but also not being like hey how's it going Joe could I please go can I get a diet coke please that would be so great I'm trying to write a new song he just goes diet coke and Mulaney was like I get it you're not polite to Siri and when you're that famous everyone is Siri Chex Mix shuffle the whole thing so you know what I'm saying mmm do you know what Siri is Joe yeah I do know that you're talking to somebody you know they're not Siri but they become Syria if you have five decades of everyone kissing you need to do acid if you that's where you need to do mushrooms you need to do something you cookie I've said many times my fantasy people have like weird fantasies about getting Trump out of there my fantasy is turning him on oh yeah get him on some DMT and let them into my universe just texted me a fake photo it's Trump with a beard and it's our song isn't it says LSD saved my life I was like this is just a guy I just want want him to take mushrooms no more hairspray oh shit yeah to stop I got it wrong actually recorded I have it on my phone if you want to play it I recorded this thing I was listening around us in the car do you want me to play it sure what is it it's a clip of Ramdas from do you want to hook it into well you could can you do it or knocks okay it'll be better that way because I recorded it just just now in my car cuz I was like not what well you got one of them old iPhones it has an auxilary jack I like the auxilary Jack I do man I'm a little annoyed why would they do this lightning Jack now you're assuming I can upgrade my car but for my phone there's an adapter that allows you to use an ox Jack and lightning and there's an adapter to make Steve Jobs rollover more efficiently in his grave you think it's all right the idea is no adapters sticking out of your fucking phone like a second dick if you didn't have it people wouldn't buy it I might have the option for an adapter in fact this phone started sucking ass it's like crashing and shit and I was like if I funky one they are fucking good yeah they throw things in the mix right I believe that that's a true conspiracy yeah for sure I think whenever you get a new iPhone when the Newton brother a new iPhones released magically my old iPhone starts hiccuping as soon as that goddamn my operating system gets updated it's true and they force you into it yes yeah I tried to sync my phone to the computer and it was like you gotta update your software I have been resistant you fucking bitch and I was like fuck your ass so anyway I was looking around us and this was recorded in the 80s maybe early 90s and he talks about Donald Trump and it's pretty fun it's only a minute wallet you know figure within that mythic structure it starts I mean I called your attention to Donald Trump for example now you may snicker and not want him as a mythic hero figure but he is he is a hero figure in this culture and when I look at that it's a little like you know in those tribes where they take a maiden and they honor for a year and then they boil earth it's well we're off a cliff was something like that I mean I'm not the Donald Trump myth not Donald Trump he's just a Porsche lump that's caught in he's been selected to play out the myth yeah and he gets the feeling of wow I'm Donald Trump enjoy baby you can have it I mean Donald Trump this is an obscenity because how must a person close their heart to keep so single-minded on that while all around them are the have-nots and the people that are falling by the wayside just because of the way he is living that's kind of it mmm that's a weird argument just because of the way he is living because he is living in an opulent life but if he wasn't living an opulent life the resources required to make him live an opulent life would only help a certain amount of people there'd be a great number of people that would still be left in absolute poverty there's I don't like that argument I don't I don't think that that's what's going on I think there's a game going on and I think he is completely invested in the game and that game is acquiring money acquiring wealth and fame and he's really good at that and that's his game I mean he doesn't really produce anything else especially now that he's not the host of The Apprentice anymore right I mean executive producer yeah I mean without him doing I mean that arguably he's producing and I use this very loosely art because that's what it is it's you're watching my program what I like about what he's saying is he's just kind of stuck in the Donald Trump this somebody has to play that part the villain right but I don't think he's doing anything that's fucking anybody else over like I mean maybe he is as wise maybe is how many cars do you need you know I mean like when a holy man when you find out a holy man has 15 mercedes-benz like the guy who owns a Bikram yoga that's what I'm saying yeah he owns like all these did you see what happen with him but we see these other guys playing these other roles going like of course he has five helicopters he's a billionaire yeah do you know that guy's deal it's really funny he was being tried for tax evasion apparently and they they found all these he had all these Ferraris and Bentley's and shit and he his claim was that he was starting a school for children and how do repair automobiles so that's why he got these cars that's that's a good alternative fact right there that's B that's almost beautiful well you know such a unique case that Bikram guy because they did an HBO real sports about him I I want to see it oh my god you have to see how he's fuckin insane he's insane he was talking about these women that's our Bikram from Judd knowing a chud knowing he changed his name to hot yoga that's becomes hot yoga last name right he he was addressing these allegations of sexual assault and he said you know that women will give 1 million dollars for one drop of my sperm oh yeah that's what he's saying yeah aquiline they were like no the woman who's interviewing was like what yeah one drop of my sperm 1 million dollar and that's like that like oil we think maybe that does replenish you just really make a lot of much you imagine just a line of petri dishes and him just grabbing his cock like a bent garden hose and just dripping out little drops 1 minute 1 minute 1 million yeah this is about a billion dollars off my stomach how dare you this is the guy that's like responsible for this it's really so it's so interesting because it's so it kind of embodies what's bizarre about human beings because this guy is responsible for so many people's personal growth and enlightenment by him bringing yoga and hot yoga to the United States and making it so popular being this force because perhaps because of his eco because of his desire to achieve fame and fortune all these different things that he has gotten he's also spread this thing that's been amazingly beneficial to people which has in turn fueled his self-righteous indignation it's actually kind of goes back to the writing a riot is a bad thing this guy being an asshole is a bad thing right but it's a bad thing almost hoping to do a good thing it may be a bad thing that also does have you ever met somebody that's a real piece of shit but they also do a lot of charity work and the kind of charity work sort of masks the fact they're a piece of shit right like that was one of the things about Sandusky Sandusky was like this one of the things about him is that he was molesting all these boys that he was helping well he ran this charity for boys and he was fucking them you know it's horrible yeah but it's something that people do they run they'll do something where they're doing something very charitable sort of to mask how shitty their are or to justify right who they are and there is someone in this kind of fucked up scenario that did just benefit yes I'm saying someone who just benefitted from that and ya know anybody volt yeah under like it's one of the strange paradoxes of life one of the weird things that we have to deal with human beings are capable of so many weird rationalizations and this is going back to the diffusion of responsibility thing that happens in mob mentalities you know with all I felt it I've seen it before where people are running around hitting people and when I was a kid I worked as a security guard at this place called great woods your massachusetts guy remember Matt Mansfield mass great woods Center for them really yeah I used to worry that bob seger would yeah yeah yeah bon jovi us - Ben Debye I've been to great woods I think we see it saw Dan Fogelberg I saw I saw Rodney Dangerfield there Sam Kinison there I saw Bill Cosby there I saw Bon Jovi how big of a venue can you play before people start to go like Rodney you do get a lot of respect like we all paid hundreds of dollars this was in the great barrel of cash but my favorite Rodney days cuz Rodney used to go on stage naked with a bathrobe on Wow that's what he did towards the end he did he decided that he was going to perform with a bathrobe on so he and he has like a fuck you you can't make just what I'm felt like doing it that's what he felt like doing you liked it like that feeling look I like and he's naked he's naked was it could you see his peccable you compete guys who were working backstage saw his hog yeah cuz he's like this bathrobe is oh he didn't give you all the times you had no respect place he's like hey I put on the suit people respect me yeah no I just think literally didn't give any fucks zero fucks left he was deep into his 60s and he would go on stage yeah that's my dad I've seen my dad's dick more now than when I was a kid because he doesn't give a shit I talked about how my dad isn't deaf he just doesn't listen like he literally don't care cuz he doesn't care want to listening I told my dad to get a hearing aid and he goes what could you be saying and then resumed watching jeopardy on a hundred what could you be saying yeah in a rope I'm sure he was in a rope what had happened anyway um I was there and a riot brought up broke out I was working and I was in the real yeah you know great great woods has a lawn do you know that so they for people don't know it's an outside area so part of it is under like a roof and then there's his back lawn area and Neil Young was playing and you know fucking stoners and you know burnouts were there for Neil Young and they started fires they started like lilies little campfires they were lighting papers on fire and we had to break it up and I had a hoodie that I brought with me because I always knew like that I'd seen a lot of fights and I there was a lot of altercations and I saw one of the security guards beat the shit out of this guy because he stole one of the golf courts they hit him over the head with a radio I was like craziness I saw craziness at that place and I was always like this is not worth $10 an hour like it's a good job like to have when you're 19 ten bucks and I was like wow I got some this is good money was good but it was legitimately physically dangerous and I was working with a bunch of other black belts it was all like martial arts guys that were working there as security people right and I was at the back area where the fires were and we were told to go put the fires out and we were like you know there's radios we're going off like people or fires were gonna break up neat they cancelled the show they stopped the show in the middle of the concert because of the fires and then fights started breaking out and I put the hoodie up zipped it put it over my security outfit and walk right out the door this good for you because it had gotten to that weird place yeah where like I saw my friend Larry who's like one of the most peaceful friendly guys in the world I told this guy to put down put down you know put down the fire you know get the fuck away from here and the guy goes fuck you and he punches the guy and you know punched him in the stomach and dropped them and as soon as the Larry punch though I'm so nice okay I am gone I'm so out of here walked right the fuck out and quit see in life we need a Larry yeah you need a canary in the coalmine that you go if Larry's throwing blows well he was like a sweetest guy in the world he was a trained killer but he was like a super sweet guy so if him if he got to the point where he was so on edge that he punched this guy yeah I was like there's no way I'm fucking it the guy might have called him a nigger or something like that I think was it was so much chaos going on because he was black and the guy was white okay he blasts this guy and I'm like if Larry's hittin people this fuckin show's over yeah and then you know we heard something over the loudspeaker but the show stopping and people were going crazy we can no longer rock in the free world but there was this feeling there was this feeling in the air of like terrible things can happen for sure there was this feeling like don't get trampled screaming no no not people anymore it's not you in one person yeah so if it's like me and this other person they'd be like hey man relax we don't have to start this fire I'm gonna get out of here Joe have a good night that day when I got home I ordered like two months worth of earthquake food and did you read I was like I don't like what we become when shit goes sideways well we kind of do you see one of the things that studies have shown is that in natural disasters people come together they come together and support each other and help each other it's common it's real true but that blackouts in you yes it helps it people help each other it's really like some of the best aspects of human beings do come out what scares me is not that what scares me is these unique moments where violence breaks out and there's groups of people that's because I feel like there's a genetic memory that we have that's from war one on one hand to hand combat warfare because our ancestors for thousands of years fought like that yeah thought in these chaotic battles where you didn't know who the enemy was you're swinging an axe right that is so ingrained in our genetic memory right that I think when these riot type situations break out like when that guys sprayed that girl in the face right here they feel like that's the enemy and there's this like instinct to just start swinging at people that are Taylor sighs Bonz yeah I think it's a terrible thing to cultivate yeah it's a ferry and so you know like when you when you're establishing us-versus-them narratives i think you you set an incredibly dangerous precedent because i think you tap in that's why that ancient genetic memory that's why i'm trying to say it's not us and them i know it just sounds like hippie nonsense but you're right yes that mistake of the sixties was when the hippies were like it's us and it's that we need to get them when it when really we always need to be remembering it's all of us right which is why it's a real problem when you just want to when you simply put a label on something boom he's a nonsense right well these nefeli not a Nazi punch Nazis okay what the fuck first of all he's not a Nazi you're you're wrong and second of all if he was a Nazi how the fuck does someone become a Nazi right how does someone become now like we should probably probably figure out what makes a person like that the idea that you're just gonna fix him by punching them no you're gonna start a goddamn war yeah I'm trying to get a his name is Christian I think I'm trying to get an ex white supremacist to come on I just for what you're saying I think podcasting can be powerful and we need to have people that can offer perspectives that you know aren't great yeah I'd like to talk to somebody that's reformed in that way well long-form conversations do reveal certain aspects of people and you get we're serving yeah it's very difficult to tap into you know if you're doing seven minutes on a late night show like Conan or something like that and you see sometimes people do they sort of breach these controversial issues and you're like man boy you can't really do that service that's right in the next 45 seconds right I also love it because sometimes a joke has a two-hour set up holy shit it was like three tornadoes converging at the end and you and I as stand-ups are from a world where you have to get a laugh they have 30 40 yeah I can say whatever I've had some of the funniest things ever happened two hours into a podcast and it wasn't even funny up until the until the end yeah oh definitely definitely and also you cut when you're two hours into it with another person like you know you and I haven't had long conversations before so when we're having this long conversation I get to sort of explore how you think about things and you look at things right you get to see how I do-right and we compare notes so we compare ideas and then you know my ideas get enriched your ideas getting rich exactly four to sort of come together and it's fertilize each oh yeah for sure and there again it kind of goes back to my google thing it's like boredom is good how I had so many I mapped out whole worlds and and ideas and movie ideas he has a kid because I was bored as shit when I see the screens in the back of the head rests of the SUVs now I get it I don't have kids and maybe that is something you just have to be like shut the fuck up and watch are we there yet are we there yet are we there do you want to watch frozen put frozen on everybody cheers it was calm what is lost there is something some people do well with boredom I went to a summer camp where there was nothing and that's when I started doing improv you know well one thing for those kind of things you could put on educational programs for kids yeah they're going and they actually do enjoy it look I put on nature shows for my kids oh yeah they enjoy it but you know I think you have to engineer like when you say boredom engineer a certain amount of time in your life you're free yeah from all that stuff put your phone away well there's a Japanese word for it I'm forgetting but it's a value that they have called the word means emptiness like time it's not meditating it's not contemplating it's just alright for this hour I'm just gonna be open see what happens and I think that's essential we don't have that it's well we're jammed up man even more so jammed up when you have more obligations and you have a family and you have a job and you have careers ya know you have a podcast and you're also stand-up and you're also going to television show with a family because I just got engaged and we're thinking about having kids and stuff that's one of the reasons I want to be married and how do you find it managing because your business is you and your life and your thoughts and your ideas I manage it you know but it requires thought and work and effort and it maybe takes away from some of the things that I would want to do yeah more often and you have to short a you know louis c.k had a great quote about being dad one so I thought was really cool because I read it after I'd already sort of absorbed it and then he and I read him saying I was like ah he's so right I said let it change you interest yeah that's beautiful it's a great way great way to have it and not to resist I think because I know guys that do resist and they wind up getting divorced they wanna be in shitty dad yeah and they wind up being you know absolutely even if divorced because my wife left me that's what my HBO show is about with your first wife love yeah when you're jumping right back in look at you you almost - it was almost 2 - Jungshin how old you I'm 37 I got married when I was 22 oh yeah well that would work I went to a Christian college like a proper youth ministry major well that's when the sounds about is about a religious guy whose wife leaves and then this is kind of what happened in my real life I got kicked into the deep end of the comedy scene so people like TJ Miller and Nick Kroll John Mulaney like rescued me when I didn't have anywhere to go so on the show it's a fictionalized version of that every episode I'm crashing on the couch of a different comedian Wow so you were 22 you're hardcore Christian you meet this gal she's hardcore Christian - no how long were you married I was married for six years we dated for about a year and a half this is a true story I knew we were gonna get married when she went down on me hmm because I could because I was like you don't do that with someone you're not gonna marry it was it was our engagement blowjob Wow I'm bended knee hey so you were married and then what happened how did it go so that's that's what's interesting is is talk about letting it change you I remember before I had experienced any sort of suffering I had a pretty charmed life and then I experienced some pretty severe pain and and that's when I started to figure out who I was what I cared about and what I actually thought was funny so it turned out this this very unlikely thing made me into a much better comedian plus I had way more free time oh for sure it's gonna make you a better comedian if you could survive it like anything that's rough emotionally makes you a better comic if you survive that's what Artie Artie Lange is in the pilot and he's in a couple of the other episodes as well he's amazing and he's like it's good you're my wife left me funny now used to just be like kind of cute observational stuff he's like you're a man now shit happen and he's like true I'm I stabbed myself in the heart funny it's like a different thing did he hit his heart he started he stabbed himself in the chest yeah he seems to be doing better I mean already yeah he's been on the podcast he's amazing yeah it's good dude I was a college next book consummate professional because he showed up early nailed his lines improvised and killed it he's a huge part of why the show got so funny dude it's very funny and he's a good guy like he's a good guy yeah he has his crazy moments and all that chance but so anyway he's got a good heart speaking of stabbing I mean yeah really does have a good yeah he doesn't he's a sweetie so um so she leaves yeah yeah and how she leave yeah well she was fucking another day Christian of her who was the other dude another teacher that she worked with found Jeff Rocco this is all rock it sounds like a bad play she fucked a boxer named rocky and I actually was he wasn't he wasn't a bad guy we used to like we'd get along and stuff and then how long was he banging her for before you found out well that's actually because we moved upstate I was there's a lot of elements to the story but we moved upstate cuz she was a country mouse and I'm a city boy and then we were like oh let's just live in episode of Green Acres let's just live in Sleepy Hollow right behind the cemetery was so terrifying and I just felt this distance between us but I thought it was because you know she'd get home at like 4 o'clock and I'd leave at like 5 6 o'clock to get into the city in time to do like 5 minutes at some shitty open mic so how far would you live from the city when seeing each other Sleepy Hollow is only about 45 minutes maybe if you really lived in Sleepy Hollow yeah New York yeah that's all is it the Sleepy Hollow or the bits these dorian from yeah i believe that is a lot of sleepy Hollow's right that uh that author forget is it I remember and I lived there I believe he was buried behind my house whoa and I lived on Gauri Brook Road happening that made it seem like a dream I literally would lay on the bed cuz she's not there for me she's having an affair I don't know right cuz I was just like it was the last thing on my mind right and I thought I was dead I thought I had died and gone to some sort of weird purgatory because you're in this new place and you're in a small town and she's distant from you and your mom yourself up the steepest hill to come home from a fucking metro-north that took an arrow and a half round trip to do five minutes at UCB why and I come home and she's asleep and I just like get drunk I was so sad I thought I thought I was dying I thought I guess I'll tell you a story one time when she was having the fair I called her and she answered the phone she's acting really really weird and like looking back the dude was clearly there right who knows what they were they might have been mid boning I don't know right I was like you're acting weird and then we had a security question like you you at like in Jason Bourne you asked a question yeah that they know the answer to and if they answer it wrong you know they're in college right yeah so I go of all the questions I go in what city did we get married so now not only is she with the other guy Brian she's answering trivia about our love boy she answered it correctly and I hung up years you know when we broke up she was like I just don't know I answered the phone that day but I I thought she was being burgled oh right right I guess a burglary before and yeah that's how naive I was well I mean did you just consider it kind I worried ice try this maintain because I on the show crashing February 19th HBO I on the show I'm playing that guy I'm trying and it's kind of nice I like going back to that time when I was I like to think I'm still a sweet person but people used to think I was on ecstasy did definitely a sweet person why would you think you're not I don't know you're grown up now I've lost my temper yet you're an edge now I I wouldn't even say I have an edge but I mean I don't fuck around with some things like I sometimes like I'll get in a fight with my mother because fuck you mom do you see ever say that I've never said fuck it meaning that would be I've never said fucking mom they're another thing I raise my voice my mom I haven't raised my voice but I get angry in a way that I never would have because you become a grown-up at a silent and it's a bit of a bummer but you're like right shit yeah like my mom always asked about my dog right I have a dog and she we never had a dog so I honestly think my mom thinks I don't know how to raise a dog so I'll tell her on the phone I'll just be like mom we're gonna go she's like what are you up to I'm just like oh you know Val and I are gonna go get some lunch or whatever and she's like is Brody coming what are you gonna do with the dog like and all I'm hearing is like you can't handle a dog like it just feels like this attack and I'll just be like mom I've told you a thousand times so I try to make jokes I'm like well I'm gonna heave Brody into an active volcano and I'm gonna cut off his head so he doesn't have to suffer you know while we're gone and she doesn't like that so we butt heads in a way that we never did that's interesting now your mom was at her idea to raise you super-religious yeah there's there's definitely some latent resentment there you and I got worried because my mom was like you should get married that's just true we went to a Chili's in Burlington maybe you've been there chilton Vermont Burlington Mass oh right by the mall no Burlington Coat Factory they're more than great coats we went I had the nacho burger it's nacho ordinary burger my mom was like you should get married and I was like okay that's how much of a mama's boy I was Wow that was 22 I was moving to Chicago to do improv because III heard the story of Chris Farley he moves from Madison to Chicago he gets us somehow and that's what I wanted to do so I was like I'm gonna move to Chicago I'm not gonna break up with my wife or you know my girlfriend at the time and I didn't know if I if we could live in sin you know what I mean like no I can make that move so she was like just get married it's fine and I you know I I get where she was coming from but I do think there's some latent like hey maybe like just live and sin for a while see how that goes yeah it's hard for some people it's not an option you know some people that are really religious and the last thing she would want to do is tell her friends well that's the church yeah it's the it's the expectation of Leigh you can't have a son who's living with his girl like I was the golden boy I don't know how you were in your family but I was like her like it was so clear that she loved me the most like she's like obsessed with me and we're still close but she she kind of guided me in that way but that's kind of what crashing is about is like these things that you would never ask for taking you to the place you were afraid to go so she leaves you know how'd you find out she told me well she took me to dinner hallo she got me linguine with clams which was a favorite dish is it really good I love you know I still eat hardly ever do but when I do it yeah I know you means a treat I know we've been trying to eat the pasta but when I do yeah it's it's almost worth it looks awesome recently it's worth it so we got that and then it's just a sad story she also took me to a liquor store to buy alcohol for that night I don't know what's going on I'm like the puppy that's driven to the vet to be put down and then we went home and she had a less she had a script and she goes I love you I want what's best for you and I'm like okay thanks and she's like you deserve to be with someone who really loves you and I'm like I agree yeah I'm glad we're just not getting Jesus Christ number three was I don't want to be a cheating wife and I go so don't be that was my response and then she was dead silent and then I was like is there someone else I said it as a joke like I felt like I was in a TV show right and I was like is there someone else like as if that could be a thing her silence was deafening and then I swear to god Joe my next question was is it a comedian and she goes no and I go this is later in the conversation I go you're leaving me for a civilian oh I love comedians how could you date a comedian and hang out with my comedian friends and we go to shows if it's I love show business I love comedy how could you leave the best thing the best people Wow that's what I thought that's ridiculous so you don't agree with me you think let's do it whoa the comedians are fun well I'm sure there fun for some people by the idea that the only I mean obviously at the time I don't think that I'm sure I probably have thought it at the time - yeah or when I was 28 I think when you're really deep in love with something it becomes the only world that you can imagine yeah you know well that now with my current fiance French for a wife I know it's not no I know that's a comedy bit oh it's a comedy joke for bits I just laugh at that one too I will lunge at you you kill me but I will lunge at you I'll get one good luncheon I feel like any comedian is in a threeway there's something where there's this other thing and it really helps if Valerie likes to fuck comedy as well and she does mmm but that's interesting she likes travelling she likes the she's my friends she likes it if she can give me a bid or try out something together that's cool she actually can come up with some shit - that's really fun watch you do it that's got to be really fun there's nothing better than doing the show and you know my out Laura go I have a monthly show at Largo and she's sitting on the stage but behind the curtain and hearing her laugh and I'm riffing and she'll show I never asked her to but God it really made our love that much deeper she just started writing down if I set a new line she just Eve wow that's cool to me and I was like that's cool we should be married you know there's a weird thing that happens to a lot of comedians when they get involved in a relationship like at first the girl thinks it's cool when I'm dating this guy he's just he's a comedian he's wild he's so funny he's has funny things and then it becomes do you have to work every night that's funny you have to work tonight why don't you just stay home and stay home with me I have the night off I've been in relationships like that I'm - and this isn't I'm glad this isn't one of them but I've also calmed down I wonder if you have at a certain point I'm happy to report to our species comedians mm-hmm that I think there is a level that you reach where you relax a little bit you've you've gone in the fancy green room and you've eaten the apple pie and you just go like okay I've seen the strings at the puppet show we can keep playing the game but I'm not as desperate afraid as I used to be I'm like it's a marathon there's ups there's downs and there's a lot of other shit to life than comedy I don't do sets every night anyway that's kind of like oh I'm like a three times a week guy I think three times a week is fine I don't do it them every night either but I think that discipline when you are confident in your discipline it can mitigate some of the negative aspects of obsession mm-hmm because like you know you're doing the work you're putting in the work but you don't feel bad taking a night off that's right you know we got it you know what somebody said that really changed the game for me was live a life worth commenting on that's good you can't just go out and next thing you know you're just doing bits about motels oh it knows homes you know and fucking airplanes mm-hmm I get that but if I just go to a concert or just go camping or just go on a trip and have not and and not even thinking like could I get a bit out of this yeah I didn't go to a sensory deprivation tank and not go what's the bit here right salt on my asshole I'm not thinking that I'm just like this is life yeah and that's what that's I think that's the way we should be we can't there is the three-way thing going on but I'm not as starved anymore do you resolve balance it's definitely a balance but when you started it that's kind of one of the other things the show is about is that fervor that you have when you're starting mm-hmm where you're like it actually got cut but there was a scene we wrote where was like if you're holding your girlfriend in one hand and comedy in the other which one Lauren laughs guess who plays my wife did this really funny riff because she's like if you're holding me and you're holding comedy over a cliff which one you pull up like the good son mm-hmm and I had to think about it while I'm thinking about it she just feels she's falling and she's right that there's something I hope that people when they watch the show understand that I understand why my wife left me a new life and also why the character the kind of pretend wife on the show also laughs but I think that's the same with rock and roll I think it's probably the same with art I think it's it's probably the same with everything that you become obsessed with sometimes when people are involved in relationships especially when they're young it seems like your whole world to a person who doesn't have this other obsession like comedy like say if you have just a regular job you're working at an insurance company or something like that your boyfriend's a comedian your girlfriend's a comedian and you just want to get home and have dinner and sit down with them and they have to rush off to the city to do some fucking set they may not be home till two o'clock in the morning not great it's not good you it's not what you want it yeah it has in real life my wife yeah I don't want to be Pete Holmes as well yeah yeah and I was like I kind of get it I get it like even at the time I was like the sex but I kind of get it makes sense makes sense and then someone might want to be though that's the thing it's like yeah no matter what there is about your life it's about finding someone who can appreciate whatever that is about your life and help you yeah yeah I know it's typically something people say about kids but like seeing the world through their eyes like we go talk about the four seasons okay you do a corporate gig and they put you up the four seasons and you and I have done that before you bring the new person the excited person it's so fun to surprise Valerie with that it's so fun to go to the show together I just did a corporate and it was brutal I got the back sweat dry mouth it just you know they're never great I hate those things and she was there and we laugh about it's like we can share the adventure she has her own thing she works for a charity called real girl which is a female empowerment program I know feminism is a cancer I'm just kidding but that's what she does but he's flexible enough that we can we can go to New York and film the show and come to LA and do shows in Hawaii or whatever that's awesome man you you found some I think I've always made this analogy that people are kind of like the fingers of two hands and if they fall together like that where it's a perfect fit yeah you're you're in but a lot of times people get this thing going on we get those bottom two fingers with the top two things on the other hand there's a lot of wiggling and fucking a missed high-five it's yeah exactly you know it's funny the last person that did that for me again the crashing is about these stories that when you're starting and when it sucks I really think that's kind of the most interesting thing a lot of shows that I love about comedians are about comedians when they're successful and that's fine that's great this is a show about these times and when I was opening for Bill burr and this is 10 years ago I was in Peoria I actually made a youtube video of it called Pete Holmes bombing where I kind of do commentary on oh my god outside she was like you want it to be like this but you were like this like the whole time right and you describing it to people you want it to be like the hands intersect perfectly but the fingertips are smashing into yeah yeah and he was absolutely right you know when you're bombing and it just feels like the words are just getting sucked into a bank you know there's no connection well you have no connection with it so the audience is never gonna have a connection with it and it's impossible for you to have a connection with it cuz you know you're bombing and you're pretending to have a good time yeah and here's the rub is my comedy typically comes from a positive place like I'm I like to lean into my sweetness and my enthusiasm I wonder so if I like this happened I was at in Irvine and I was on stage and I had this bit about Lululemon this hoodie that I'm actually wearing is a Lululemon I just like Lululemon who fucking cares so I have a bit about it though like any gradient so it's my opener sometimes I go this is a Lululemon I just don't want you wandering the whole show and then the setup of the next joke is I think I think people like ladies like a guy in a Lulu it says something about them and then this girl this is in the first 30 seconds of my act first first row girl big table goes yeah gay right you gay and I just kind of whited out and was like it's 2016 oh you're fucking ignorant like just kind of like right well I were laughing but I was just leaned into her right I'm gonna have to try to merge back into my silly silly fun boy comedy routine I literally have a line in my act back then where I go I don't know how to be angry it's and that's usually like a big laugh right they'd already seen me be very angry you got mad when she said you're gay because of a Lululemon line yeah when you just assume that that seems like that's what someone would say maybe Balazs for 35 seconds but you left the gap right are you siding with this woman it's a heckle obviously never side with a heckler in the verse that's 30 seconds yeah and I'm doing this set up and you go yeag a loser was there someone on before you you have the two opener so they were drinking yeah so this lady's probably lit up you get on she's been hearing people say shit that's marginally funny because they're not as funny as you because of the openers and she's like I think I can finally okay it says your day hey I think it says something about me right that's so obvious yeah you're gay everybody would say that and 99.9 percent of the time people have the decency to go he's probably going somewhere guard against the guard against that 1/10 of 1% yeah come up with a better name you know what I can counter argue don't do that for sure remain vulnerable 100% get heckled yeah get some scars that's ok cuz I don't like bulletproof comedians well you're not we will you're never bulletproof first of all and second of all prepare for someone saying you're gay because it's coming again that Joe Wright hundred percent Ike so do you have did you have a backup line like when she said you're gay if I had been in a better mood maybe I'll go to bed mode but I don't know homophobia like I hate the word faggot but is that homophobic to say that it says you're gay there's nothing wrong with being gay so there's nothing wrong with being gay and gay people are very fashionable and someone says I do take offense at the idea that people into gentler or more flowy yoga meditation things are therefore weaker and being weak is like being gay and being gay is like being frou-frou or like a fairy or whatever you want to say if you make an offensive to a group of people that makes sense but you're making a giant leap by saying that someone who's into Lululemon which is really nice clothes they make really good Fitness clothes sure and that that somehow another is weak I don't think it's weak at all but it's called my lemon job lemon shirt but the point is that women assume that men who are really fashionable or into fashion and understand and appreciate fashion yeah but that time sexual then can we talk about black people loving fried chicken and watermelon my name fried chicken is delicious because everybody loves fried chicken and large groups of people that aren't gay like looking fashionable right right so why now to make then I discourage that I agree with you I'm also saying I defend my right to discourage I agree with you but I think that if you are a stand-up median working in a uniform that that sells alcohol I feel like the student being taught by the master that is true right I should have been like you gotta say well you left it open like I would if I was a transfer of a second too long well it's just natural okay you gay it's something it's like a natural wiseass thing to say by someone who has like any person at the AA comedy to do better I want us to do back I expect my audiences to be better I want the club's to be better I want us to elevate that's a theme that people always like to say do better you know it's another thing that people like to say that's really disturbing the worst is the worst not even close the worst is being eaten asshole first by hyenas okay that's the worst really stop calling it the worst that's really funny people love to say that Oh Pete Holmes the worst yeah that guy's the worst he had a joke about homophobia he's the worst it's such an overused term it's so stupid I think he cutter term that people are using today whether they just throw it in oh you're the worst I'm gonna join you yeah I think people have Arrested Development literally they stop for sure Bela ping so in fifth grade you realize you could win friends by keeping your shoes untied you're a bad boy and also being lately you didn't have the cool kid with the untied shoes no man never all right then let's just you're confusing this shit on me Jamie you with him on this jerseys you can't even just when it comes to shoes i untied shoe thing for sure yes I think you do doesn't give a fuck I'm older than you maybe maybe I missed that that's you the kid who didn't tie his horse to the stable and that was the guy that you know he's a rebel bro his horse just wanders around the neighborhood he calls it with a whistle but forget the shoot I can imagine you it's a stretch but these guys that learned how to win friends by gun miss Johnson sucks right right right and then they just learn like sarcasm can be so funny but I think so many people are just misappropriating sarcasm by saying whatever it is sex if I'm eating a burrito and the bottom falls out they go that looks like a good burrito like that's not funny you're just being a dick yeah but in their Twitter bio you see like sarcasm is just one of the many services I offer you're just an asshole that's not funny yeah Chandler are better with sarcasm right but they probably are trying and failing just like we try and fail with jokes no joke isn't but you know I'm saying I mean we all try and fail like your heart bad you you hate is a lack of imagination and you are stepping into other people's shoes she was probably lit she's probably trying to be funny she doesn't know it trying to be concerted effort of someone trying to fuck things up for me to actually experience hate towards them it was because of the you know it's just submit you could get look I could go onstage in a bad mood I don't feel like you're a friendly crowd it can happen yeah it can happen yeah and my opener who's gay Brett sullivan kind of didn't do very well and i was just kind of like you guys are giving me the wrong vibe I thought maybe it was a teachable moment but maybe but you know sometimes it's like you didn't establish the moment properly you know sometimes like you know I look back at some lines that I used to like but they were they just didn't do that well and I'm like did I just get attached to this line did I stop that did I have a rest of development in my standup yeah yeah because I I sort of got attached to saying something this way because I had been doing it like that for six months or whatever and then you realize like oh that's not a good way to set it up I need to just I'll actually kill my babies you know that expression I've heard to kill your darlings yeah kill your babies like in terms of creatively obviously you have to kill some of the ideas but you're attached to them because they're yours a painful yeah that's a lot of what writing is for yes I'll go one worse to shit on my own experience when you craft an act for fans and I know you know this feeling hmm then you go to a club where you know a vine I don't think the crowd was necessarily there to see me remember you're like oh shit yes stand up is more like boxing than I remember oh yeah because if you like if you watch my special it's all fans you get a standing ovation when you put ours yeah I love that yeah I'm gonna quote Sinbad say that he got I love I love this quote he goes that he's a very nice guy he was great he did my podcast Tony Hinchcliffe says he's awesome talk about leaving your body astral projection Sinbad does it he actually projects the astral project how's he do that he stopped doing well there's all these techniques there's books and stuff about it the long and the short is you get into a trance and you imagine a rope above you then please just don't or what he did I actually remember he was like I put something just out of my reach and then you're trying as you're laying there with your eyes closed kind of meditating trying to reach the thing and then he said he felt his hand wrap around and that's how he knew he had left his body whoa and he did it for months and months and months and months and then one day he said he was like in this weird places in the cave some like shadow creature came up hit him in the chest I know this is Sinbad remember and he goes and it felt like someone had cracked me in the chest with a sledgehammer he's like I never did it again whoa and I was like really you gotta go back try and find like booby island or something he's right though maybe he's ready to be snatched up by the demons and stranger things it is next dimension demon that lives in the wall it is scary if you read journeys out of the body or far journey is Robert Monroe in 50s it's like you read this book and he still calls black people need Rosen stuff like you can tell it's an old old book but he's telling that's how old this stuff is it's because way back he would tell stories about like seeing something fly by and being very concerned that that thing was trying to get into his body but more needed so it's kind of a scary thing it's anyway but don't you think that dreams and you know moods like like states of mind like the state of mind you have when you went on stage that time the state of mind that you have when you have a fucked-up dream it's like the ability to do you that your mind has to change stances and positions and that these stances and positions really greatly affect how you react to a situation so you're coming into something with so much baggage and so much good or bad like sometimes you come into something and you being the the best mood ever like I got rear-ended by this undocumented worker and he's a guy was illegal in the country who's from Mexico he didn't have insurance and I was my favorite car hmm I have this a Porsche 911 gt3 it's a race car to a car to drive I've had it for years I love it it's just like really light car it's sound and this guy fucking loud and the engines in the back yeah and I was like oh no I was thinking my car's fucked but luckily he don't like when he hit the brakes he was texting of course and when he and traffic was stopped and he looked up and I saw him look up I saw him in the rearview mirror and I saw his face I saw him slam on the brakes like this guy's gonna hit me for sure and he had a Honda Civic and his car went under my car because you know when you break dive you know your card Wow so his car literally like ran into my car but kind of lifted it up and I said never lying yes he sent me fine and crushed his car but it was luckily that he would had a light car and it did damage my car but they fixed it pretty quickly but at that moment I got out of the car and I was in the best state of mind that day I've been doing a lot of yoga and it just everything was going good I was feeling positive and generous and friendly and I talked to him and I was like I go do you have a license he's like no I go when he driving you know a licensee who's honest he goes I gotta work man I go okay and I called I remember what if I called a tow truck or if I called the police I remember what I did because we pulled out his car was fucked my car drove to the comedy store I drove that night but I was gonna get his information and everything and I was gonna stick around for the cops and you know tell the cops that you know this guy doesn't have a license and this and that and I'm like fuck this I'm like all right man have a good night I just drove away yeah I just drove away you know I got so nervous that you were about to tell me a story where you're like and then the cops came no no and so I signed autographs while they arrested this guy I bolted I didn't want to tell on him I'm like she's like it's 25 year old kid from Mexico is trying to make it trying to you know trying to make some money you're gonna do better demonstrated grace well I also I was in a good state of mind like I could have been in a terrible state of mind I could have been ramped up I could have gotten in some altercation some dickhead yeah because of this will fuck that car and this guy hit me man what the fuck you know you come into it already ramped up that's right and but that moment made me realize like you can go into a moment like and in if you could be it in the best state of mind you can do regardless of the circumstance that's right well you know it's funny that you say that because I have that kind of argue this actually just had an argument with my mother and then we went to dinner and I was in the best mood before that I was meditating I just felt amazing and then I called my mom because I was feeling good I was like I can I can handle a call home got in a bad mood immediately now and I were going to dinner and then we're at dinner and I'm just kind of complaining about it and then she's like what what if we changed your frequency a little bit she I don't even know if she used that word but she was like what are we grateful for and that's kind of like where you were you had just been doing yoga and stuff we just started making a list it wasn't like it wasn't huge big things it was just like I'm grateful that we have we have a car I'm grateful we can come to this restaurant that we have the money right now to eat this meal I'm grateful for this body I'm going for the help and you were talking about earlier gratitude man that's how to get you yourself into that place so important and to exercise gratitude consciously all the time but just to be happy and thankful and generosity generosities and other things really that'll change your frequency first yeah I think those those things and gratitude also shifts your perspective and gets you to understand like boy I could be in Africa right now living in the Congo yeah in malaria you know I could be fucked I could be in some worn torn part of the world where I'm trying to escape that's right you know this I think that's also one of the things that people find so disturbing about this Trump ban on immigrants you know now they're talking there's not calling it a ban anymore but Seth Meyers of hilarious thing where they were saying that it's not a ban then he showed all these clips of Pence and Trump and all these different people calling it a ban and van the band the van the van and it hurts people when you know that this is a country that was founded on immigrants I mean this is a country that everyone in this country was originally an immigrant that was in the Native Americans Native Americans by the way were fucking immigrants too because 10,000 years ago this entire country was covered by two miles of ice okay I mean this this everyone came here from somewhere else I mean is is - in terms of recent humans like in recent being the last 20,000 years everyone came from somewhere else when they do these genetic examinations of Native Americans one things they find is that they they share common ancestors in Siberia they can cross the Bering Strait yeah that when it was connected and this is just this is a price where people come that's our idea yeah so when you're blocking these people that are in one of the worst places in the world Syria you know and then there was like this list of all these Muslim countries where people are allowed to come into America no prophet there's so many fucking people in so many different countries that are Muslim I mean whether it's Pakistan or Indonesia or there's politics involved in that I think somebody pointed out that a lot of like Saudi Arabia remember these are places where there are Trump hotels I don't know well I don't know if that's true either but the real issue is Syria is the hot topic and I don't necessarily think this guy has the time nor does he have the inclination to deeply look into things with with a greater perspective than what he currently has you would think that you know Howard Stern had a very interesting thing that he said about Donald Trump and I would defer to him because I think he knows Donald Trump personally and he said that he doesn't think that this is good for Donald like his mental health which I thought was interesting Howard was coming at it like as a friend and he said essentially that Donald wants to be loved and he said that you know that's what he wants all these people to love him he's like I don't think this is a good job for him but for his mind they know it's fucking crazy I remember when Chappelle hosted SNL he was like I'm gonna give him a shot yeah that's what we were putting ourselves right those of us that weren't on board with him well we only have this one thing that's right now the starving thing right there's not really a lot of other stuff there's this one that the ban on immigrants is really it's an issue because there's families that are coming over here and they have children and you see them and they're sad and desperate it's scary you know you're leaving your home you're seeking refuge in America you have a travel visa and you can't get in yeah that scares the fuck out of people because you think that could be me that could be my mom that could be my sister right that was my mom my mom fled World War two from Lithuania there you go so I mean come on that's insane that is fucking insane I mean it scares the shit out of us when we think that we could be so xenophobic that we could just put this like this blanket statement but that's what you said earlier it becomes them it's like your seals it's them but on the other side you don't want what's happening in Germany you don't want what's happening in France you don't want we have these people that aren't integrating with the culture and they're creating these significant problems and you have like what Merkel is dealing with right now in Germany this culture clash and you're having a lot of problems between people and these radical Muslim elements and they're they're isolating and creating their own neighborhoods and you know when people don't want to integrate they want to bring a piece of their country here and they have extremely different values I mean whether you want to be critical of these people that live in the Middle East or not the reality and we all know this when you look at the rights that women in Saudi Arabia are denied the right to drive they have to wear certain clothing they have to have to look away when men are looking at them I mean there's a lot of shit that these women have to deal with that is a cultural standard in their part of the world that doesn't fly and if they bring that over to Germany then you see these men that are from that part of the world that are in their 30s or whatever there are they're grown adults you know whatever the age and that is their standard of behavior and now they're seeing white women in Germany these German women that are not behaving and not acting in that standard and they feel like these women are harlots they feel like these women are sluts and they can just do whatever they want with them and you're finding Amin is not how many of them how many incidents are there I don't know but there's enough where it's a significant issue there's enough that this is something that needs to be discussed like you have these the new element that you brought in and how do you mitigate that without being racist without being seen about like how do you how do you how you somehow or another encouraged these people to evolve their culture hmm yes that's a real issue it is very interesting it did make me think of the at we're both from Boston and the Irish you know segregate and kept to themselves and they were Irish name you know it gets tricky when something is so culturally different for us they do have a right to have their neighborhood be however they want sure but for some reason it could be racism it could be just a it's not normal to us the way that they behave with women or the women they want women to behave that well that's not racism that's a it's a huge issue I understand I don't want women to be yeah what's interesting is that you would think that that would be totally in opposition of liberal values mm-hmm but the Liberals are the ones that are like really concerned with these people with people not being Islamophobic which is also a good thing to think but there has to be some rational and reasonable consideration for the cultural differences that are vaster and real and scary and also they're incredibly restrictive on women incredibly restrictive and on homosexuals I mean what you're seeing with Isis thrown gay people off rooftops and Iraq and some horrible horrible shit that is the standard in that part of the world and when you're dealing with a culture that is just pro-gun programmed for so long to be oppressive towards homosexuals to be oppressive towards women like violently oppressive you know where they think you're allowed to beat women I watched one of the most horrible videos and I should have never watched it but it was a man and his daughter and the daughter had been accused of adultery and so he was gonna be the guy they were stoning his daughter to death and he was the first guy to throw the stone and his daughter was begging for mercy and reaching out to touch his hand and he wouldn't touch her hand and he hit her with the rock and then they all threw the rocks at her and I was like fuck this is just a religion just an ideology that forces people into this and if you take these people that are so deep in that ideology and so deep in that brainwashing and then you bring them over to a free country to a democratic country that has an open policy on religion and we need freedom of expression do whatever you want you're gonna have a you're gonna have a problem there's there's there's going to be some sort of a gap that needs to be crossed and I don't know how to do it I mean how do you how do you make those people evolve their ideas I just don't know hmm yeah scary I don't even it's crazy so when you think about people coming into this country yeah we're new at this and there's gonna be mistakes and there's gonna be things like that seem unsolvable problems there is the human life element of it we know that there's a basis of like people are dying and they need help yes and then we go what people that we may not agree with are dying and need help right you still go we don't need to take LSD to go well you still need to help people that you don't agree with you're right it's that's not the issue and the vast majority let's be really clear are never gonna cause any problems the vast majority are gonna integrate fine they're gonna have friends that are Christians and Baptists and Mormons and whatever and there's gonna be no issues the vast majority but there is going to be there gonna be a few issues and when those issues pop up then it always becomes highlighted oh it's their religion it's their ideology you know it could be mental health issues we didn't they just overturned something here in America though that it was like it's no longer a federal or I don't know I don't know the legal speak but it's no longer as serious of an offense as it used to be to beat your wife so no no that was actually in Egypt no where was it it was just it was just a law that was just hold on a second there was just a law that was just passed where the fuck was that goddamnit I I tweeted about it Oh Russia was in Russia's Russia yeah it was Russia yeah crazy like domestic violence is decriminalized in Russia that doesn't cause severe injury we also what I'm saying is we also have people here that are very backwards about women and gays that we have plenty of them and they're also here I'm just you know I gotta I'm not a great the Saudis and a lot of the Middle Eastern countries take that shit to a whole new level you're not even allowed to drive right I mean they have to have a male companion when they go out at night I mean there's there's some unbelievably regressive ideas that are just accepted because we don't want to appear to be homophobic or excuse me Islamophobe and then there's well I think is it Bob Jones there's a Christian University where there's blue sidewalks are boys and pink for girls yeah so everybody's fact what I'm saying but they're not stoning people they're not having a fight you just I mean you just scarred me emotional you're killing honor killing is a real thing yeah I mean this is not this is not like an imaginary idea that's never enforced it's a real thing yeah so is female genital mutilation yeah you talked to ayan Hirsi Ali about it and she gets labeled in islamaphobe because she talks openly about the problems with the ideology and she's a woman who experienced female genital mutilation I mean she was that was she had to flee her country and now she's here writing books and giving lectures and the the hardcore left the far-left crazies are attacking her as being Islamophobic you know what's interesting about these very very complicated and you've just illuminated me in many ways issues is when things get really really complicated we do take comfort in what I call like the Slingblade mentality remember Slingblade yeah so there's the drunk dad yeah some people call it a Kaiser blade I call it a Sling Blade yeah so that movie is like strangely Pleasant in this weird way because the boy has the abusive father and the mother and they're being held captive by this drunk asshole spoiler alert it's from the 90s you should have seen it by now right in comes a simple man who is a graceful character a compassionate character and he kills the dad he hits him in the head with a sling blade that's why the movies called Slingblade and he kills the guy so it is this complicated thing the drunk dad is a person we could zoom out on him and be like okay why is he drinking what's going on how can we help him how can we rehabilitate this guy but there's something about being a human that occasionally John wick style you just want got to go in and shoot a bunch of a bunch of people just clean the problem up in a simple way what I'm saying like punch Nazis that's what I'm saying there you go so complicated issues somehow attract overly simple response that's because people are lazy that's what that's where racism comes in you go I'm afraid that some people are dangerous well these guys say black people are dangerous ah I feel a little bit more comfortable right I look around this store and there's none of them right but really there's a white guy that'll fuck you up just as bad as anybody right in that same store but we're looking for these click moments where we just go John wick shot the guy go to bed and that's what I think and I'm actually trying to understand Trump supporters I think there's a sling blade thing going on where he's like look what are we gonna do these people want to come and nobody likes people dying but these people maybe there's this threat of this changing culture changing women being bad this way vile this way well let's just not let it it's like a panic answer ramen you know what I mean right and it appeals that was one of the things that I find not too many people like me I don't agree with Trump but when I would watch the debates I would catch something in my brain going oh this guy's driving the car you know what I mean like he was such a blowhard and he had solutions that if I was quiet enough I could recognize the part in my own psyche that went daddle protecta yeah there's the appeal of the strong man a strong confident man who stands in front of us and tells us he's got it but if we can't admit that and I'm trying to admit that as much as I can then we don't see my sister getting pepper sprayed right by my brother you know we're all in it together that's what I talk about good discourse we need to go like like Jon Stewart was like these guys aren't afraid of Muslims they're afraid of their health insurance premiums that was like such a great quote he was like this plan was fucking them they couldn't afford their insulin so Trump comes in he's like don't worry about it I'm gonna get you jobs I'm gonna get you this I'm gonna get you that and some other stuff some hateful stuff is coming along with it but they didn't have the luxury of being like well I gotta go with Hillary they they couldn't I guess well simplistic speak and when you're and it's coming from that holds the highest of high offices in our country it's very dangerous because if you simplify things and say them in sort of just a kind of a blockheaded way yeah it appeals to Blockheads ballgame we can't go out there and win it's all so they don't have to think now because you're not thinking you're the leaders thinking like a blockhead that's what I can think like a blockhead - when Obama became president and I loved Obama I didn't follow too close okay so I'm kind of a doofus in that way but I love the man that he was and he seemed to do a good job but he definitely inspired a lot of young black people to be like oh I could this could happen for me I could be the president look at my example right and now I do think there is a risk of being like well look at this guy who calls what's-her-name a fat ass and a pig and he began president right who are you to tell me not to bully this kid in my class I could be the president Bryan I called him a homo I could be the leader of the free world it's dangerous that becomes dangerous when you have someone who's the spokesperson who speaks in like again these simplistic terms right but when you look at what Obama really did there was a bunch of issues where he didn't buck the system where he did have the most drone strikes of any president ever where he did crackdown on whistleblowers right where he did the opposite of what he said in his hope and change website where he wound up pulling that down because he had this whole segment in there about whistleblowers from protecting whistleblowers who are showing that there's some sort of illegal activity going on well that's not the case at all because everything that Edward Snowden did was show illegal activity I mean he's kind of exonerated Chelsea Manning you know so this is gonna be kind of interesting that's why I you can't pick it up or lay it down you just have to look at it and allow that there's some bullshit right away because when I see Obama some great vine of him meeting a basketball player and they do the soul shake and we play some of mate and he's the coolest guy right he's articulate as you said and he's intelligent and he and he looks cool and all that stuff yeah that guy also that morning had a meeting where they decided how many drones to row up shit well not only that the Dakota access pipeline all that shit went down when he was the president when they were making those those they're cutting through private property in arresting ranchers because these ranchers did not want this fucking pipe going through their water system like that was all on his watch and could have stopped that he could he could have stepped in that's kind of it gets overwhelming and then we go geez everyone is corrupt everyone's bought and paid for and that's where you get people not voting and that's when you get people going let's let's light a Molotov cocktail and get somebody like Trump in there that's what he seemed like in the voting booth it was like status quo or brick through the window right and people were it gets overwhelming and there's nothing more simple than a brick through the window well here's the thing another thing you were talking about earlier when you're saying about Arrested Development and I do agree that I think we are in a sense in as a culture and human beings it's there's a great propensity propensity to exhibit signs of Arrested Development I think one of the reasons for that is that we have to work I think working like doing a job that you just don't want to do that you have to do because you have to feed yourself is one of the most soul-sucking and mind-numbing activities that a person could be trapped into doing and when you look at how many kids in this country are graduating in great debt and massive debt because of student loans and then they get into credit card debt that sort of balance out their student loans and you know they're deep into their 30s and they're fucked they're in prison they're in prison and they're working all day doing something they don't want to do and they have to behave in a way that's not natural because it's the only way to keep this fucking stupid job and they never get to express themselves and a really honest and true wet and make no mistake it's not a hippie idea we're all here to create that's what the world is the world is creation and we're here to take our insides and bring well it's certainly I don't know if we're here for that but it certainly feels better to do that I mean if you wanted to look at the greater picture of organic life on this planet and like why are we here well I don't I don't know I don't know I mean I don't think anybody knows I think you could come up with all sorts of rationalizations for why we're here and what we're doing and what our purpose is but is that purpose real and we have a finite existence and we'll give birth to other things with finite existences and during the time they're alive the entire organ the superorganism of human beings is going to innovate and constantly continue to innovate at this exponential rate where we're gonna be unrecognizable in a thousand years we don't even know what the fuck the human race is gonna look like a thousand years from now so I don't know if that's what we're here for but I certainly know that if you want to have a happy it feels fulfilling life yeah being a creative person or you know and it'd be by creative it doesn't mean like you have to be a musician you have to be an argue that you're a parent that can be creative it's it's just finding a way to bring something to be a painter the world executive loved making cookies you didn't like making tables or clocks like that uh that cool clock you sent to the left of us that guy probably feels fulfilled as fuck you could be a knife maker it feels really good to be a shit does it into it and or a carpenter or anything when you're doing something feels good there's lots of - I'm very interested in the idea of giving us everything that we think we want we want food we want entertainment and then you have people staying in their houses that become like prisons I'm sure you know I'm sure you've heard that sure yeah yeah it's like okay let's say it doesn't have to be the Illuminati but let's say this world certainly runs better when we can keep the cattle like occupied right and okay so we try to put as many people in prison as we can if you see like documentaries like the 13th and stuff and one way to keep this mass here well how do we get these meds well let's infect them with the idea of consumerism so it's never enough your happiness is always the next thing it's the next TV it's the next phone mmm the next computer it's the next meal whatever it might be the next movie that you're gonna see whatever it could be so you're always in a state of lack gonna keep you buying more money you need more money you need these things back in the day you know you read the newspaper and drink a glass of Ovaltine now you have to have a Netflix subscription you got to have Amazon Prime and all the shit so you're in debt you're chasing it and you're never gonna get it and then at night you deserve it after your shit job to sit on the couch and zone out and that's how you keep us in line as well yeah but I don't think that any one of those people hearing that thing I think that thing is a natural human inclination and I think it's also forced along by people that are trying to sell you the new Lexus you know do want you to buy these clothes or and you think wants can be encouraged I think we see that in other cultures where it's not as consumeristic is consumeristic is outward as ours is like we're certainly surrounded by advertising and all we're capitalist culture you know when you have capitalism you have people that want to sell you the new Apple laptop or the new Android phone they're gonna advertise that phone they're gonna make it appealing because they wanted to sell well and if you have a really good advertising strategy you can sell more stuff and so your your company becomes more successful but you're not outwardly thinking or even inwardly thinking you're gonna make more slaves they're gonna make people that are forced into this humoristic society and forced into this weird weird world where you're living every day just to buy new stuff and just to get new stuff it is sort of a symptom of the wrong way of thinking and these traps and society's set up for us but I don't think it's necessarily engineered in a whole this is a this is a thing that people gravitate towards this idea that this is cabal of super geniuses that are running the world they want to keep a stupid and cheap I don't think that's true I think I think it's a self-fulfilling thing I think we create these walls and we create this prison we put up these bars and then we put ourselves inside and we lock them but this is what's interesting about mushrooms was something that's free and something that has there's no mushroom 3.0 you don't have to get the new much but it is illegal it is illegal because good citizens don't take psychedelics right obedient citizens - that was Jeff Sessions was talking about marijuana good people don't use marijuana this young guy yeah yeah and but you take that and you get a glimpse of real life I know it's very kind of exaggerated and bizarre but you get a sense that what we are and who we are fundamentally can be very very interesting and worth exploring so to kind of also to your point the people that make the laptop and make the ad campaign for the laptop I don't think are trying to control the world but I do think they like us we're also indoctrinated into a world where you can justify the idea that I'm just giving them what they want because they too are stuck on that head oh yes no of like I need the next I need this job where I advertise this thing so I can go out and buy these things well that's the case with television you know I had a conversation with a friend of mine he was like a super hippie he was trying to tell me you know what man fucking in the United States man their programming people with these shows that they're hypnotizing you to watch these bullshit programs and you get locked into it it's all by design I go here's why you're wrong fuckface I work on those goddamn shows I don't tell you the pimple TV you're like there's no scale there's no cabal of geniuses running and by the way the people that are running these shows are hooked on other shows right there in the shows oh my god I've seen Game of Thrones and they'll start telling you about all these fucking shows that they want as much as I love a good conspiracy like Mad drainings in the in the Masons and they're these like clues about 9/11 and the Simpsons and stuff and that could be fun storytelling as so once I started writing for TV shows I was like oh this is just a bunch of not dummies but regular folks it's a strange manner it'd be funny if it comes in and he's got blue pants you know what I mean like right it's a strange marriage of art and commerce you know that's what it is so you creating something and you're trying to sell it and as you're trying to sell it then to make ads and they make ads those drugs make you stupid what they're doing yeah they're not they're not trying to sell like do you think Coco's trying to make you stupid no they're trying to get you to think that fucking polar bears your buddy and like you know just trying to sell more shits they can make more money think go golfing or whatever the fuck they want to do right and they don't realize while they're doing I do I think we want to enjoy this experience as much as we can yeah I think that's what we want to do I mean at our best right at our best we're toasting we're clinking glasses we're hugging each other at our best were laughing with friends at our best were or just having a good time together that's I mean my favorite moments are me and my buddies just laughing about something ah which is why Canadians are so fun to hang out with and that's why I can't believe she left me for a guy named Braco we probably had a giant hog well I bet he did ever do it Rocco you have a big dick well this is it when it's flesh stock stock up oh yeah yeah this is him called Pooh acid here comes that's probably him cold pool ruined er is there anything better than gaining perspective I think there's a Vonnegut quote where he goes the best way to get in get over a woman is to turn her into fiction and there was something really cathartic the sort of crashing is fiction my wife's character is is completely different from my wife the situations are different but it was still really fun there's an episode with my parents and I'm writing them saying the annoying shit my parents say my mom's in love with me all these things I was like they talk about zooming out you didn't have like this weird dominion over it they call cut and you just you know that was just pretend then you're in it then it's pretend yeah it was like ten years of therapy Rock wrapped into a couple months that's amazing do you still contact her no it's not out of hate or anything right I tend to be move on just move yeah I don't I don't talk to one of my exes is a very dear friend of mine but the rest of them you're just kind of like it's hard yeah because you're intimate with somebody and you know you have sex and yeah you kiss and you hug and you wanna it takes a big level of maturity but yeah to have lunch with someone whose breasts you've seen know and just be like are you getting the soup yeah it's hard you know and then you know they tell you they're in love or they tell you they're getting married or they're having a kid you're like yeah that's why I'm so glad my ex got married she's coming to my wedding it's and and my and my girlfriend is very very close with her so I love it when it works out I never thought I'd be one of those people but it's amazing when it works oh hey when it works out it's great and the the idea that it can't work out is all silly - of course it can you know I have friends that like one of my buddies dated this girl and then he broke up with her and my other buddy why not marrying her no way yeah and they're their friends it's like right it does happen it can happen it totally can happen yeah it's just everybody's not right for everybody else yeah there's certain people that will drive you fucking crazy but to someone out there it's the perfect person well that's a funny t-shirt it's like no matter how much you love her somebody somewhere is sick of her shit have you seen those yeah yeah that's an old old statement right it's true yeah Val and I have lived together for two years now and it's just it's just been the best that's awesome man because you found that thing right where the fingers slide into the grooves and yeah it works and it's like the idea that it's like if it doesn't do it it's because someone's a bad person no man there's me I can't say that that's something I try and say on you made it weird as much as possible is you don't have to hate someone to break up with them it's good point I used to think you had to be throwing plates and swimming at each other and know someone's an alcoholic and someone cheats on somebody it's okay to say I do love you I may regret this like just concede and be like but I'd like to go yeah that's okay I just like to be free I'll tell you this story I was dating this girl who for me seemed very crazy I know that gets thrown around a lot but I was like I think this person's a borderline personality all these different things I had this list in my phone in the notes file reasons to break up haha and it was thirty-five forty-five things it was insane and any one of them would have been enough and I kept adding it to it I go to my therapist dr. Gary Penn whose book is available now it's a joke I make on my podcast he's like Pete you don't need a list you don't need a list and that same week I had talked to a psychic I'm not like huge and denied even though I know I told you I'm a believer and this psychic is like someone is looking out for you in this regard in particular like they're rooting for you whether or not that's true I held onto that and I'm driving from therapy where my therapist is like you don't need a list of reasons to break up with her and I'm like oh you're right you're right but I get in the car and I think of another one I'm in the highway and I take out my phone and I start writing down the 47th reason to break up with this person phone crashes restarts opens up everything's the same that's that note was deleted isn't that crazy and whether or not that's actually mystical it just meant something to me it was like fucking a if that's a coincidence who cares but it gave me the courage to be like I don't need a reason I want to bounce right I'm gonna bounce right but I love you I love you too I don't like this yeah I want to be attached and connected to you yeah I'm sorry we had a good run maybe let me the fuck out of here I know you should be able to like people that you don't want to have sex with anymore you don't want to be intimately attached with and that's the other thing about people like intimate attachments when you have intimate attachments with someone like you have sex with them yeah you share carnal pleasure boy there's some fucking weird things that happened where people get angry yeah you know they get fucking like the best thing you can do if you want to really have a fun relationship with someone and I've never done this hold off on the sex as long as you can Wow just get to know them see if you really like each other see if you really like each other see if it's not just a thing you'd like shit if in a crash here it feels good inside their body that's what we do but he would court it's not the worst move the problem is we have this fucking desire for sex it's overwhelming yeah you know it's like this this ticking time bomb inside your body you'll convince yourself like Judy's great Judy's great you convince yourself woman let's just fuck I gotta do it in a bit we had sex before we got married but then it stopped again I know don't tell me stop for a while then we stopped because you wanted to be good Christians kind of and then we knew we were getting married and then we're like it'll make the wedding night special oh and you held off for a bit Asli for guilt and fear probably a couple months Jesus Christ did you guys cuddle or anything I think so no hand jobs nothing no I definitely gave myself plenty of here but I know that I got married I remember even my father who wasn't very religious saying to me it's good to get married sex doesn't feel like you're getting away with something so there's no latent guilt see I don't like getting away with shit that's part of the problem like like one of the things about married sex as opposed to single sex is like if you're just dating someone you don't know whether or not you're gonna hook up yeah like you don't know you don't know come back like my place my god yeah those are the moments I remember by the way of my single times it yeah I remember the sex but I also remember the moment where you put it out there and you were like I you want to get out of your like the early days let's go yeah my hotels great let's go get real service or whatever it is and then right or when a girl says that to you let's get out of here I'm horny whoa hi I remember one time I was in Montreal of the festival so I must have just gotten offstage cuz I just so confident and felt great there was this girl beautiful girl I wanted to hook up with him and she was like you want to get a drink and I was like yeah let's go let's get in the room just immediately get crazy totally work no drinks some people do and some people like sex with some people right and there's other people that you would have said that to and they've been really for sure and you know there's some people that would yeah afterwards we laughed about like who were you I was like I don't even know any right as soon as I came I was like I don't know who that guy was that got you out let's try on these sweatpants yeah isn't that funny man the the difference in the way the mind works when the cloud of confusion is lifted well that's why I'm interested in like werewolves and stuff those stories are so compelling I'm like oh yeah cuz sex makes so much sense when it makes them mm-hmm then there's other times every comedian writes the sex is stupid bit like every every comedian that I watch coming up at some point will have the like what's that all about you put your dick in the person you're going because it is stupid right but something like a transformation of a werewolf happens and for some reason you can't even eat you're just like I have to fuck it's a very it's almost violating yeah something takes over and you're like I gotta fuck I gotta see tits now well it's clearly DNA it's clearly the need to procreate right it's a biological trick what a betrayal the urgency of trying to recreate and trying to read a book and it's like ah-ah-ah but it's also enjoyable so it's like you got a revel and the enjoyable aspects of it I mean if procreation was just simply this like weird sort of pragmatic choice that you made well we're running out of people we definitely have to procreate all right let's plan accordingly and set up a nursery okay and then what are we gonna do it's wonderful it's a fun game to be stuck in the best game I remember though when when I was single and I would hit on people or whatever I would sometimes have to remind myself like you love sex like I would have to because you're going out here like I don't want to go out and talk to thee you'd be like like I could hear my it'd being like trust me yeah I'm doing this for us you want to really be happy once when it's actually and then I'd be in the bathroom like he was right yeah son of a bitch yeah but which is what the saddest thing when relationships deteriorate to that sort of maintenance sex place it's like that that's a lot of like a buddy of mine just got divorced and I was talking about he goes just we got to this point where was just like maintenance acts like just oh it's date night I guess we should do it now yeah and it was interested because there is I've heard people that swear by that sort of thing even though it's completely dispassionate and it's not romantic at all but they're like you have to keep fucking even if it does seem routine because it keeps you connected like spirituality get it out of the way when you're fucking like I knew a guy who was about to get divorced and he was like please we just need to have sex like I know we don't really like each other right now but just let let let's do it to see if it because you have sex with somebody I would have sex with somebody that I had just met and after you have sex you just she's kind of like right Oh woke to the potential of how great they might be you know you're just like oh I feel so close well there's definitely some strange and there's a there's a communication through sensuality right yeah this is like touching and kissing and licking and fun and just all that stuff like can contributes to the appreciation of the person yes you're you're bonding in some strange way which is why people get so angry when you break up because it's like you're taking away like a piece of them like they've invested in you and they've like they're there their roots of like connected to you they have you seen Vanilla Sky yeah I don't remember those time ago is driving a car she's breaking Tom Cruise is breaking up with her it's a real nightmare she starts driving really really fast they end up crashing into off a bridge and that's why I asked away that mask the whole movie anyway so she's mad at him for breaking up with her and she's goes it's such a it's like the perfect horror movie moment she goes I swallowed you and shits just like that film version of exactly what you're talking about man there's a bond even if it's casual mm there's something going on where it's kind of like hey fuck you yeah yeah yeah you're in that magical place together you can act like that was nothing I don't think sex is nothing I've had casual sex I've enjoyed casual sex I think people should have casual sex but their cat I believe people when they're like hey that meant more to me than it did you male or female well there's also this thing where people who are rejected where it hurts it hurts really bad like being rejected hurts like one of the things that I remember I have this friend and a house not being friends with them because he would get real upset when women would turn him down and it was it was it was hurting him yeah because he wasn't an attractive guy and he was kind of awkward and he would try to hit on girls and it wasn't working and when it wasn't working he would get angry and I saw him deteriorate psychologically over the years because like he didn't have a girl he had one girlfriend she fucked around um and then he just didn't he just dated for a while and he became more and more bitter and what was going on was he was associating women with rejection and with that bad feeling of just being turned down and despised like you and that like oh that that devastating feelings to him was his connection with women I think this is why we see a lot of degradation and straight-up aggression in pornography oh yeah we sure mad at ya holding women yeah it's kind of the grownup version of your mother's tit going dry I'm not even trying to be fryin colicky baby when I was single I remember very vividly because it scared the hell out of me to be honest and this is kind of vulnerable but you have you have good audience I remember I was I was actually Woo's weird I was with two girls and I was trying to make that happen and it didn't and I got in the elevator and I felt like a colicky baby like a teething baby I didn't do anything right but if I had if I didn't have the self-restraint I would I would have been like how could you not Punk me right right right put all this you feel like it's owed you you're like I did all those drinks and I was so charming and you feel like a kid that got yanked from love well there's also that thing that we were talking about like when the werewolf kicks in and you want to fuck so bad and you know that it could possibly happen so there's this moment where you're like it's the werewolf get to come out and you get to come out and they're like you know and also away will you love like I need you that's another thing that's happening in sex right is someone saying I see your animal side and I celebrate it right that's the opposite of a nun slapping you with like a bad boy they want you to feel pleasure they want you to come out and be yourself that's how let the moon do carnal and it's beautiful and you're there and if you have at it three-way and they're the more the merrier there's a witnesses there's like a notary you're fucking and there's someone else going like this is amazing you know that's healing talk about the other thing like I remember pornography I think guys and maybe women to have a certain shame associated with just the functionality decks are like why do we love dick jokes we love them they keel we we don't talk about it so weird that our whole species runs off of these fucking little tubes that fill with blood and calm and jet out from your body like a diving board for a mouse and little and when you're watching porn girls are just like so excited so into it it's all intact I'm assuming but that's why it's like I read this book called pornified and they were like men have ejaculation shame because anytime anything comes out of your body it's kind of gross you just got like shit or snot and your dick sneezes this where does this theory come from ejaculation shame I don't know I'm sure it was in the footnotes but I just remember that she mentioned and I was like that seems to make sense to me and that's why you have girls I'm not even trying to be funny guzzling cum drinking cum face comes oh come on my face I think it's salving take away even if it's just ejaculation it's something going I know you're a wild animal in IX do you know what I'm saying well I'm the opposite of grossed out I'm turned on by by what but you know I'm saying like that okay woman yeah it's just it's I wonder if it's the same if you I don't know I can't think of a female equivalent but like if you have if you don't care that your girls honor her period or whatever and you love them not in spite of that you love them through that I think that's also kind of in the ballpark I'm like dude I get it we're stuck in these things these weird spacesuits that have these shit comes out of here and yeah any blood comes out of here okay all right but at the end of it there's something going on somewhere whether it's between your eyes or somewhere where consciousness resides yeah and that consciousness is also trapped and these these desires and these these biological needs yeah that's that's that's where Ram Dass really helps me was like you just try and watch it unfolding you you're the witness you know what it's like to step into the witness and your tanks or however it is and you're like when I go I'm horny it's really the witness going oh shit we're getting the horny signal yeah I always thought that was my brain but I'm like there's something watching the brain yeah and interpreting it and the more I can be in that the kind of the Yogi's call it like the unflinching candle like you keep your consciousness still even in the middle of a heated argument or in the middle of like some serious fucking you're still kind of in the back watching it like television yeah like holy shit like Ram Dass is great thing I think this is helpful helps me is this you're anxious or depressed you go like who's noticing the depression and you try and sit in there and you go there's depression holy shit mmm I wonder if I'm gonna make it through this this is some fucking heavy shit but if you're
