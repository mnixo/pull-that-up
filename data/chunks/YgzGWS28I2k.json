three two all the way from Down Under why your brother what's all good good to see you again man hell yeah you're on a wild a magical mystery tour of the United States of America here it's been amazing with your kids you cute little kids yeah Victoria you know [Music] I love kids but you you're taking them too you took everybody look at you're here for how many months five months you moving tired of Australia no hell no it's a big trip no it's better it is I love America is it better can't say that they won't let you back in yeah probably not they're very different you know the American landscape how unique the landscape is you know if you Rocky Mountains you know to the desert it's just industrial you have any mount yeah hey chair everyone winks Australia's just like this fucking flat piece of sand yeah yeah but it's not this heaps of mountain ranges and shit really yeah yeah how tall they get um I don't know the high but they're up there like a real mountain like Rocky Mountain welcome rule me out and like rocking me on yeah really yeah Wow dude let me tell you something you're 28 days that you did in the Braga mountains out here that we put on Instagram you know that yeah yeah we're promoting it constantly yeah that was like one of the most talked about that like every I got calls from all my friend Bert Kreischer was fuckin obsessed with you he wouldn't stop calling me about it he's like the fucking guys boy himself took the video with him with the grizzly bear and he's pointing the gun at it Jesus Christ fucking weirdest thing is it's that's normal shit it is that's very normal society so removed from it now well if you're out there it's normal to get false charged by a grizzly bear yeah it is you know Luke night you one good reason not fucking the algae I was talking with came about this when we hiked into the back of Montana to the spot that's usually got a bunch of grizzly bears that I go to and we're talking about you how you won't come out to Australia honey things are just scared of everything the difference is when you're walking around the mountains here that can happen at any point because yes fucking grizzly bears got feet they walk on land in Australia you pretty much have to go into the water so you're only worried about that when you go to click water or you're thinking about having a wash or something here it's full-time for whatever reason it doesn't bother me as much to get killed and eaten by a bear then it does a giant saltwater croc I reckon the crocodile would be nicer what yeah it'd be nicer I'd like grab you drag you down you drowned anyway you know and then it would do what it wants we've got a grizzly bears gonna fucking Moliere scratch your face off bite your neck take chunks out here it's gonna be longer dude yeah but it's American no foreign shit there's some about uh grizzly bears it's most terrifying things that they just eat you they don't kill you first you just hold you down yeah eating you yeah they treat you the same way they treat a salmon you know you see them hold down salmon and they take big bites out they don't make sure that kills no no I thought behind it you know like y'all finish it off first and then no did you say the mountain line that I end up hunting yeah yeah and like mountain lions usually kill their prey but obviously grabbed a calf and it was eating his calf while it was still alive like a beef cow-calf yeah I saw the video yeah pretty disturbing and then I see mine not long ago someone shared with me with a mountain lion dragging a mule deer down it's like chomping on this mule deer before it actually dies you know and it's like there's just not that thought process there there's not that human you know as long as they make sure that they have it as a meal and it's not going anywhere that's already done yeah yeah some friends were elk hunting and they came across as elk who these wolves had torn the back legs apart and we're it was in the river and the Wolves were eating it while it was in the river and the thing was moaning and screaming it couldn't go anywhere yes bull elk yeah in the water in the water and it is pretty pretty horrible for us but standard for them yeah have you encountered any wolves when you're out there yeah plenty of tongs you the first time I went to Canada was Northwest Territories and there was a pack of wolves that they were chasing a caribou bull and they pretty much chase this thing to like a lover a sweat you know like the cat this is in winter so the bull the caribou ball got really hot and they chased it into the freezing cold river and they sort of surrounded it in the river and then they just left it and they walked off you know and it wasn't that they were walking away from their kill they knew the job was done the Wolves went back up high and they got onto these rocky benches and sat in the Sun and were like drying out their cells and cooling down and drying out this caribou never left the river it was like just quivering in the river and then that afternoon when we come back that caribou was just a carcass weave like flesh hanging off the ribs on the side of the river so they come back down once the river had done its job and a smart as hell life that's that's really crazy that that intelligent that they know it's over they're like okay he's in the water and children dry off you yeah that is bananas crazy they're so wise people that I know that I've seen them in the forest say they look at you a different way did they look at you there's a way they look through you they look at you in a way like almost like they think that that's the reason why the myth of the werewolf exists is it people that have these terrifying encounters with wolves they swear that it's part human yeah Kenickie is an interior yeah they're looking into you they're figuring you out you know you gotta think what it would be like if you're just out there you know if you're lucky live five years old yeah you get this hardscrabble life out there chasing much larger animals than you and you got to kill them with your face yeah my god yeah a pack of like 30 wolves this last trip that I was in BC and they kept coming around can't wear horses and that in camp and one day I ventured out to try and get onto them and get a better look at them and they just without seeing me they just kept this perfect range you know like that hell back to me I was trying to call them you know it's hell and that hell back to me and I just keep this perfect range and you could tell the whole time they were communicating because it there'd be another war for a couple of wolves that were like a couple of miles in the other direction and you could hear them move the same pattern that the rest of these wolves were and I got eyes on them from a distance they walked across a nice lake and other than that I never really seen them but I guarantee you those wolves looked at me a bunch of times like they're just a different hunter dude yeah they're probably just trying to figure out what they can do with it yeah that's such a Jiri feeling - so it's like snow and it's like way in the backcountry of British Columbia and like I'm going up on these mountains it's like big pine trees and everything like that and just every direction around your howl and dude you'd hear him howl and you'd hear them do it sounds like a bark it's not it's like like this short hell and then every now and then you'd hear one how different you can tell that that was the Alpha this the sound that it was letting out dude just like earrings awesome place to be if you're in the nature like crazy place to be if you're not in into nature fucking you're like yeah well the thing about them that's so fascinating about them is they're cooperative and they almost are they know what to do without without even communicating they know what to do they have plans and strategies they know how to how to box someone in and circle around like if an animal's running in a certain direction they get out in front of it they know it don't know what to do yet so they end up being a set of caribou tracks that I end up getting onto and following and every wolf track was a certain you know section apart from that and now funneling into this big drainage I'd end up returning back to camp because it was getting dark but I would have loved to have kept following and seen if I actually like they're efficient he's a good chance I end up catching that caribou you know and killing it yeah well it's it's really interesting seeing them adapt to once in 1994 when they got reintroduced to Yellowstone seeing them readapt to the whole west and really expand and gentleman I know yeah it's rising we were talking recently about Wyoming there was this one surplus killed these wolves had run across a bunch of cows elk cows and they did kill like 18 of them he's killed them just slaughtering yeah they just they got they caught him I think in high snow they could get away and so these wolves just one after another just killed them all and didn't even eat them it goes like this I think it's good practice and also think well it's snowy out they probably figured look we'll come back to this yeah and leave it in the pile office your yeah it's that whole nothing ever goes to waste I suppose if they don't eat it right grizzly eats it if the grizzly don't eat it birds are a Badgers there's something eating it yeah that's a fact yeah an animal like I mean even if a hunter hits an animal and doesn't recover it that it's not going to wait that's right everyone everything goes back to the earth I think we've spoken about this before you know what the world's ultimate predator like everything's fuel in the world you know the growth on the earth yeah really is a just a fascinating cycle when you're out there and you realize that it doesn't care about 4G or CDs or called Forte's shit I remember when 4j was good 3G yeah that's a good one yeah yeah well you're out there in the woods and you're doing these live streams or these these Instagram stories how are you how are you hooking up when you're out some of them are saved so some of them are like I think that last year and I did the solo hike for the autumn land like the Northern Territory of Australia that was like 13 days of like I think where every day I was still documenting it but it wasn't until that I got back into civilization that I was uploading at each day so when you do it on your phone it just saves it on the phone I'm just filming it in the normal camera mode it's and then uploading it but a lot of places especially here in the u.s. when you're up high like usually I've got hot decent reception I'll do a little bit of research what's the best provider in the area a te you know Verizon whatever it is and I'll end up getting a SIM card for that you know provider and then usually if I'm up high it's not too bad but it just depends where you are like that's absolutely see nothing at all so yeah there's no Northern Territory Australia like Arnhem Land like nothing at all yeah what about satellite you can't upload data really well from satellite oh yeah that's the issue and if you could you'd want to be free in rich because it would charge you an arm and a leg mmm yeah yeah I saw these things at REI you put them on your backpack it's like an extender I got ya and it's somehow or another extends your cellphone range I used to use them back in the olden days so they're legit the ones in Australia were they'll 3G like Telstra 3G they provide a back home now pretty good we could have like a big antenna and hanging off your back and I'm not that into it yes wasn't that bad it was like the size of this caveman man yeah pretty small yeah it would just clip on and I don't remember exactly the mechanism behind it that'd be handy if I'm just trying to communicate with home I've got like a Garmin in reach mmm sort of thing and you can do you do texts off your phone because it like actually goes into your phone but as far as data goes it's too slow to do something like insta stories right right well one day what wasn't it a Mark Zuckerberg wasn't he trying to like put satellites in space to make internet for the whole world yeah it feels like we need it they stopped doing that once Congress I know what I know for sure one of them they had in a one of the Tesla rockets that went up that exploded I pretty remember one didn't make it or something like that yeah a spacer and they had stuff in that one I believe I don't think that's ruined it but it probably put a big like halt on them yeah that makes sense I always think how you can be so much unorganized now like with work and stuff because of where phones and that are but I remember like in the construction industry that morning that you left to work you had to be highly friggin organized because there wasn't if you had to go back to a payphone if you wanted to call some I know I wanted to do that especially from a work site that um now it's just that whole I just remember when emails come on the phone I was like holy shit I can save some time now like that was a massive breakthrough for business being able to do that and then but it's also nice to step away from that every now and then like some hunts I'm really looking forward to going to because there isn't any reception you know and you get away from me my husband us work phone calls all the shit's just your nature you know yeah it's sort of nice to be like that but just even life we're all spending too much time on our phones too much time being connected and two of my friends Ari Shaffir and Bert Kreischer hired companies to take over the social media yeah they don't they don't look at their social media at all what they do is they'll post something by sending it to them like say if he has a tour coming up like hey you know I'm gonna be in Sacramento blah blah blah he sends it to them they take that they put it up he doesn't see it at all he doesn't doesn't pay attention to a second of it that sort of hands no yeah I'm thinking it does you know I've been better at it over the last like a couple months than I ever have before but just leaving the phone alone yeah you're not touching it and just hanging out yeah I'll do certain posts where I don't even look back on it just like posted the contents out there people want to look at it they can look at if that I want to look at it change the channel gone look at something different but then every now and then there's one that I like to look at the engagement with and stuff like that which is good yeah but you know there's always like there's 10% fuckwits out it's true there's like 10% so but how many followers you got like how many people would tune into an Instagram post of yours each day I don't know mister guess I have a couple hundred thousand at least I have 5.5 million Instagram files so say one percent of them wakes up on the wrong side of the day just one percent wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and wants to be fuckin Malfi that morning that's a lot of people and then your post is the first post they see you like you're gonna get some shit there and you know we're all ignorant if we think that everyone's just gonna get a lot like that's never gonna fucking happen is it and it's never happened but I feel like it's getting worse really yeah because there's you can't punch someone in the face anymore like it's true if someone gets Malfi especially in Australia was only going back so many years ago someone gets mouth but you confront them and if they want to go at it it's go at it I'll get in trouble if I do that now yeah you know you're the one that gets in trouble even though they're being a smartass now you're the one that gets in trouble so you can't do that and people know that something it mal fear there's no repercussions for calling someone a Khanh on Instagram that's true like I'm not in favor of people running around punching people but I am I do like the way it turns out I do people realize let's imagine bait like when you were in school and say you don't get along with someone and they get mouthy and then you have a fight you usually ended up friends after it a lot of times a lot of the times you ended up friends over or math beef yeah yeah but a lot of the times that was just sorted out then and it was done yeah you know and then other people knew not to talk shit yeah well it's a weird thing like when you see UFC fights with guys fucking hate each other and they beat the shit out of afterwards I can either hug in and yeah yeah it's a weird thing with men yeah like sometimes you just need to get it out of your system yeah I don't get fucking it's primal it's like human nature it's definitely too easy to be shitty to people mmm it's too easy and people do it's also so new the other thing is so new I mean any kind of internet interaction is only twenty years old mmm that's it yeah basically 24 years I think I think I was online in 94 and it was like a 56k modem it was slow as shit my 9 be in 56k it might have been 14 4 and it was uh you know where you would use it through the phone line it was great back then like this is amazing we thought it was the most incredible thing I remember I showed up to news radio one day the sitcom that I was on and I couldn't wait to tell these people about how I got online last night I was downloading all these things and printing them I was printing up it was all about UFOs I was really into UFOs back then and I was uh reading all these files about UFOs like government reports about UFOs I'd somehow not have found some I don't know what the fucker was a message board or something that I was such a big deal it would take so long to download one piece of paper like one piece of paper that was filled with text would take like 30 seconds to download yeah crazy that's crazy and now we're here and I'm lucky if I've got 3G for bottom like what the fuck yeah I know you're mad yeah it's like this is so slow well the what's uh you know tone your kids or about the Virtual Reality setup that we have back there that disturbs me that disturbs me it doesn't disturb me that you know it's bad for you anything that's so fun and it's so immersive and I know and I know where it's going hmm I'm like it's gonna keep getting better and better just like it was 30 seconds to download just a simple piece of paper filled with text you know 20 years ago 20 years from now that is gonna look like crayons Oh totally I mean but that is you got to put that thing on your own freak out there some archery games too there yeah it's pretty cool you actually have it's called haptic feedback so as you draw the bow back you actually feel like a vibration handling yep yep and then you let go like that Clint Tesla suit Jesus Christ Tesla yeah it's not the same company but there's calling it that fuck you other company Tesla suit unveiled at CES 2019 takes virtual reality to new heights yeah they're gonna have haptic feedback suits is that what it is yeah there's like 68 sensors in there and you know supposed to feel like up to the grain I guess you girls gonna have a haptic feedback one of them artificial machine guys this you get shocked no but there's a couple of different things this is just a test but she takes like a hard front kick to the chest here what's yeah I mean I don't know how it felt to her that suit okay let's see hard front kick to the chest hot explosion right here hot explosion oh do I really want to try yes I do [Laughter] what is a boxing game that you can play it's really cool and the boxing game you you see this guy in front of you like a big 3d cartoon really but really cool graphics and when he punches you the whole screen goes bright it makes you nervous yeah yeah like when I'm sparring with him and he he punches me I'm like oh Jesus gonna get my hands up I feel like oh and you get exhausted because you're moving around you're punching just it's harder believe it or not to punch air than it is to punch something oh definitely yeah yeah you get tired ya get tired easier throwing your hands at this thing and you know you're and then she goes down your feet hurt from moving around squeaking around the floor I'm really interesting yeah yeah so there's for sure going to be a weird world for our kids mmm when they get to be you know our age yeah the world is gonna be unrecognizable yeah I feel like it's taken the edge off things too it has at it it really takes the edge off things like you haven't actually done that like you haven't actually climbed Everest but I sort of have I did it in a virtual reality game and not really though not really like you didn't have your life wasn't it sank yeah I've been actually talking about this on stage that I'm worried about this I'm worried about people being able to have experiences that they didn't earn you know like if if someone if there's a virtual reality game where you you play it and all of a sudden you're in a NASCAR and you're you know you're winning some gigantic race you're in the driver's seat and you're moot shifting the gears and you mean feels like you're like indiscernible from feeling like you're winning a race that's gonna happen again they're gonna be able to do all these different things and it's gonna it's gonna make people more and more dependent on technology and weaker and weaker weaker and weaker that's how I feel too yeah yeah it's like it's like going to the gym and working out and getting all these muscles but then moving away from any manual labor yeah I mean and not I'm not saying don't be fit but I'm saying if you're building their muscle fucking use them is true there's a lot of guys that go to the gym and they'll work out hard for 45 minutes an hour to gym but make them work a construction site yeah they carry lumber all day and dig they'll be fucking complaining there for protein shakes and the real problem is gonna be sex yeah that's the real problem you gonna be able to put those things on have sex with anybody you want like anybody Scarlett Johansson oh it's fucking weed sir they're already doing these things where they face swap with computers so they take beautiful actresses and they put their face on porn stars bodies and it's hard to tell man I mean it looks like a sex tape with a famous actress that's disturbing it is disturbing though the jogger everyone sure there is so um there is no not we mentioned about the gayest thing that's ever lived but I think the real worry is that not just like see it but do it yeah like you're gonna be able to like the matrix you're gonna be able to put this on and you're gonna be able to like this haptic feedback suit that's just one step eventually they're gonna figure out a way to make your body feel it and then you're gonna be gonna be able have sex two people done yeah yeah like anybody you want okay you're never gonna have to be nice to people again yes everybody's gonna fuck you you know that's one what am i my point was kind of on stages that like one of the reasons why it's hard like it's hard to have sex with people like you have to plan it out I mean it's not that hard but it's you know you have to agree that you like each other you know you have to hope that she likes you and you like her or whatever and there's you develop your personality like to get people to like you more yeah that way it's more likely be a nicer person you get rewarded for that you realize oh it's nice to be a nice person and then it actually makes you a nicer person if you don't have to do that yeah in the future we're gonna be able address this my intronic Kate hi Janie can be nice and then yeah everyone just turns into a fucking slob because they're gonna sleep with some pretty actress anyway oh yeah and in that virtual reality they're gonna look like Ryan Reynolds anyway you're gonna have a full six-pack and look beautiful and then other people gonna meet you in there they're also gonna be pretending you're gonna have some disgusting human beings and then in that world they're gonna be perfect yeah but then to be people like me that I'm like now I'm traditional yeah I sleep a real real my wife real humans yeah is that that's gonna be old-school Dan really riding a bike like it's crazy yeah I just I posted a photo video actually which is like seven hundred images stacked together at at Joshua Tree I saw that yeah and it's like the Milky Way cruising past but then there's just the air traffic dude is insane it's just like constant ya know I'm like anyone looking in this must already look like the future you know that's look so futuristic already and I'm like well it sort of is maybe this like we're living in it now here it is yeah so the air traffic now is at about this point here look at them all just back and forth and that's all air traffic none of that is Astra nope every bit of that air traffic wow that's such an amazing yeah it wasn't until the camera stopped early hours of the morn that is and for anybody this is Adam dot Green Tree on Instagram and you still have your photography page yeah there's man image at first man you made first dot man image and these are some amazing photos yes that's right that's about 300 photos stacked together so you actually get a star trial that's in Australia so that's the southern star you know that middle point so that's like the South and then if you go back to if you go back to Adam Dahl green tree Jaime that one if you go back to like that star one that's the North Star so that was pretty cool so once taken from Australia we got the southern star which is like you know the turning point and then this is from America like Joshua Tree there California and that's like the Northern Star I think Joshua Tree is closed down right now because of the I don't know people like did the federal shutdown affect you at all nah no I didn't even know about it until you mentioned it just and yeah it's uh it's gonna be a while to really yeah they I think didn't they shot down Joshua Tree because poor we're gonna shutting there were chopping trees down it wasn't just because of the trash that's what started because the trash and then over like last week people were actually going in and like chopping some trees down like June so assholes yeah right so they was sawing there was signs up that it was closed and I wasn't actually canting Joshua Tree itself I was like out of the tourist section just off the side of the road where I could but someone was saying about you know that the government or whatever the federal government you know we've all the trash but the federal government's not leaving the fucking trash there that's people signature trees are among the shutdown Wow there's only a few trees in Joshua Tree these people were chopping them down just to be dicks because they know there's no one there they probably don't they're just probably trying to be assholes god damn it and that is feel Joshua trees a massive place to it says there it's larger than Rhode Island yeah it's beautiful once you get it out of there that's a real you know this is the thing about people that don't spend much time in the wilderness and don't appreciate the wilderness they don't they don't they just well they're not connected to it they don't understand so I heard a bunch of people in the city cuz you know I spent the last five six days here in no lace you know and the bad whoever's come in they're like oh this is disgusting weather and I'm like fuck no the bush is loving this well the Earth's lovin is she's need rain especially after all these horrible fires that you had like rains a good thing they're just so complaining yeah it rains out here literally 10 days a year yeah yeah 10 days a years normal yeah I mean it might be exaggerating I might be exaggerating but slightly yeah slightly yeah like I wouldn't I don't imagine it rains more than 50 days a year out here yeah crazy I think that's no that's not exaggerated instead is probably about right yeah that's I've lived here let's say I'd be a little more at the drought time but let's take a guess how many days a year on average does it written la I'm gonna say 25 25 days a year 16 16 I bet you're right that's 2 per month that's a lot yeah but sometimes it's a bunch together like this is like seven already so far in the last week and a half let's bet on I'll bet you that Kanye I doll no fucking way bro Oh shoutout to shout out the plasti so that's cool this dope ass Kanye West doll says rain days is 35 damn 35 Wow you'll closer you can keep I know this is it's tough to get a good I have like every 84 sunny days per year just means yeah I don't know 39 inches per year hmm tough to figure that out 39 inches per year's not a lot though so that but the problem is it's California right it's like Northern California fucking rains every day mmm if you go like near the redwood forest that's a that's a rain forest yeah yeah yeah constantly we spent some time up in medicine oh it's beautiful no I far the ocean you know fucking trees are so big they're stupid yeah any trees as big as this room yeah a 2000 year old tree yeah you're in a desert stretch yeah yeah a thousand year old tree is like a normal tree up there yeah yeah I've noticed around the city there's a lot of Australian natives like gum trees and eucalyptus and stuff like yeah yeah they must have been imported at some point just realize I do well in the harsh conditions well you know the palm trees is sort of the Hollywood signature treeoche it's from Hawaii yeah but it's so funny that like that's sort of indicative of what California is like we don't we don't have a real yeah you know just the diversity I mean everything comes from somewhere else here there's no like native Los Angeles people you meet one of those you know like whoa you're a test-tube baby oh yeah rockin Disneyland ooh yeah what's it like wandering around there that's hectic so especially like because everything I do is like wilderness and out look at that fine like that's not an issue but I don't like it just because I adapt doesn't mean I like it but um Disney's a different place like I went in there yesterday like fucking dress as a man you know jeans on a flannelette shirt you know and a camo cap and walking around and then the kids talked me into go onto that what's the splash mouthwash me and my oldest is like sitting the front that is that there's a place you'll you won't get so wet in the front and I'm like okay cool I jumped in the front and we come down and like I'm fucking yelling so my mouth is open dude I know he fucking drowned I still owed that much water I'm like fuck I've got AIDS for sure fuck so a whole gollup went in my mouth I can soak me drench me and then it was cold dude it come over go so I've walked around Disney for the morning thinking like look at these fucking fruit loops and the way that dress and all the Disney clothes not only clothes you can buy in this fucking Disney clothes yeah I'm wearing it was pajama pants we're fucking Mickey Mouse's head all over them this fucking this shirt that's got Disney fucking written all over it fucking walking around they're like I fitted perfectly in after that and it's like fucking actually look like fucking who's the owner of Disney Walt Disney if I can shot his load alone Mickey Mouse and sheet alone me we were there the other day they have warming stations set up outside of Splash Mountain well you can step into this like it looks like a phone booth and you get warmed up but it costs money yeah everything costs money Indies yeah but yeah I'm like Jesus Christ you can't get people wet no charge them to dry already and brutal yeah I I think it's all fucking beautiful skin it is but let me touch it amazing place is a hundred percent my kids went mental on those rides have you been to Florida yet yeah six years ago I went to Florida when you go to Florida again you got to go to Disneyworld Disneyworld Disney World is way better than yeah I think we went there we end up going there once a it's way better because Disneyland's pretty amazing yeah but Disney World has the best ride of all time they have this avatar ride what is it called flights of flight to pass on it and you ride one of them avatar dragons it's all virtual reality yeah you put these goggles on and you climb on this thing that looks like a motorcycle and it straps you in place and what you're riding is one of them giant dragons it's fucking incredible this is the best ride of all a bunch of friends there and I get text messages back from like holy fucking shit yeah yeah yeah there we go yeah you feel the breeze you smell things yeah you see these animals you're flying over it's why I'm real that's all HD whoo three-dimensional amazing god damn it's good yeah now let's take the hunting and well at the end of the day Steve Rinella said it best this is uh this is a quote that he said that I think he was talking about someone else told him this that there's two different kinds of fun this fun that you have while it's happening like you ride the roller coaster it's fun but you don't look back on that from now that was amazing but then there's things that suck while you're doing them like your 28-day trip in the Rocky Mountains pointing a gun that you don't even know has a jammed bullet in it yeah a grizzly is charging at ya like that will be fun for the rest of your heartily yeah yeah you'll feel that when you bring it back when you talk about it yeah there's like shallow fun oh it's not some things are just shallow but they cool to do it there's nothing wrong with doing them yeah but they're just they're not real meaningful exactly and then the shit that you do that's just really meaningful you know it builds character it's something that you always look back on you know memories and shit but there's feelings that you get when you come back to where you appreciate things like Kalin and I did this trip with Rinella in Prince of Wales and we were up there for we were supposed to be up there I think for seven days but on the sixth day a storm was coming in and so we wound up bailing early because I had a gig in two days and otherwise I would have been stuck up there like you get stuck it were raining every fucking day and it didn't just rain every day it rained all day every day there was no it was like if you had a break it was a five-minute break yeah like well look at the Sun and then pause yes real misery so inside the tent I put my headlamp on and there was see this is what fucks you up you sit you think well when I'm inside the 10 I'll be dry no no there's no dry because the airs wet and when I turn my headlamp on I realize the entire inside of the tent was moisture particles yeah floating around the air and I was like fuck me I'm in this wet pound bag and I'm looking around like you're never gonna get dry bro that's okay yeah you know he accept it but then when we came home after the six days and I took a shower and then I was we were in the car and it was sunny out I was like this is the best I've ever felt I'm so happy I don't think you get that happy unless you feel miserable that's right yeah so you know the misery in there oh you know the little things that we take for granted in life everyday like fucking Wow yeah yeah Kim did this hike in Montana with men it's just like it's like 14 miles and there's just like not a flat bit of ground on it it's just continually going up and it's in the snow and she she had an issue with the leg and anyway we got at the top and we set up camp and it's been miserable but even a fire there you know like we lit the fire and she's fucking smile and she's loving it you know and then we come back to the trailer like we're not even in a house he was just traveling around like a Winnebago trailer and we got back to the trailer and you get to flick a light on and turn the tap on it's hot water and she's just like you know I've got a week goes by and then you start taking that shit for granted again some people you know anyway you know oh yeah yeah you certainly can but I think a guy like you you're in the wilderness so often that you know it's almost like you have a permanent appreciation for yes oh it's hardly yeah I actually miss it I actually don't like this side of life as much as that side of life yeah I see it I get it I like both obviously I'd need I mean I make a living in cities yeah yeah oh for sure yeah that's what I do but but it's nice to go ahead and dabble in it living it and come back out of it I'm saying I love it though those the the few hunting trips that I get to do a year when I'm out in the actual wilderness wilderness like we're in the mountains of Utah elk hunting I just like sitting down sometimes just sit it just sit down take it all in for a couple minutes I mean even though you're in the middle of it you're running around looking for L can you hear him I just like oh it's the best you start you start knowing yourself you know ya know the wilderness in the real world you know it's like because you always say I see you said on one of the podcast I don't know if it was one with me or someone else that it's so funny that we say the outdoors because everything's outdoors like fucking everything's under the ceiling of the earth you know that's what it really is yeah but it's so weird that you don't really know the outdoors unless you stay out in the wilderness or something like that yeah unless you and I think also being out there at night out there at night by the campfire and you hear things he just seems in the campfire somehow or another seems to be able to protect you yeah most animals don't want to fuck with campfire yes may I took Kim and the kids we traveled around Australia and it must have been the end of 2007 and early last year and we camped out on the Tanami desert which is like one of the last places to really be discovered and explored in Australia like there's there's no artificial lights out there at all like whatsoever and we camped out on the desert no anything that was around us was like dingoes and camels like you'd hear moving for the night camels yeah yeah but we sat there at camp I just had the mic my truck my you you know with the camper on the back like real lightweight setup and we sat there no lights on the camper of it or anything so you're sitting in the pitch-black moonless night and the media's dude like I reckon we counted 40 50 medias over like half hour an hour just their naked I see an imperfect dude sitting there with the family I'm like this is this is the best like this is it was so amazing just to sit there especially with the kids and Kim as well it's a little unnerving when you find out how many times they enter the atmosphere oh yeah there's a I think you out there yeah Jamie could probably look this up but I think a hundred tons of media hits the earth every single day 100 tonnes dude but most of it enters in dust form because it breaks up but so last year I was up at my cabin just chilling out by myself woke up in the morning needed to do a Pierce walked out and I'm looking up and this media come for and it was so bright that it actually lit up the ground dude like the most incredible media that I've seen I had a time-lapse photo going in the opposite direction I quickly turned it around and you see that the media's dust for like it lasts for 25 minutes half an hour in the in the camera and it's just drift and changing shape in the atmosphere it was insane Wow so it's just like every now and then there's like a real good one so then I started looking it up and I seen one that wrecked a whole village like in Germany or something like that this asteroid comes through wreck and shit that it didn't even touch but that comes so close to it it blows the walls and the windows out and everything I'm like this is fucking scary we live on a little speck that's like turning in one of many galaxies you know my friend Randall Carlson put it best he said we live in the middle of a shooting gallery isn't it insane it's just the time the perspective of you know hundreds of millions of years it doesn't seem it doesn't register yes because we're only around for a hundred years yeah yeah yeah so when we look up and we see the moon I mean the moon looks like a fucking stop sign in the most janky redneck town yeah you know people shoot at signs just fucking shit yeah it's just getting nailed all time especially with no atmosphere yeah all those things make it all the way through nothing gets slowed down by the air or burns up in the atmosphere isn't that crazy everything just slams into it yeah boom boom boom magic being up there it must be oh yeah all day long it must people slamming things it was only uh I think it was like ten thousand years ago there was like a big bang like like a big media hit hit the earth yeah and I started looking into that and then I started really looking into Aborigines in Australia indigenous how long they've been around for and stuff like that and there's now evidence to say that they've been around for 70,000 years they live through like three of those big medias hitting the earth you know like it's crazy to think about like why didn't we she had video cameras back to him you know and they could have recorded them we could look at it now like imagine that well Randall Carlson the guy that I talked about earlier he is a proponent of this theory that this is what ended the Ice Age and he's got some pretty compelling evidence to back it up in terms of like massive massive fields filled with dead woolly mammoths and died almost instantly some of them with their legs broken from the force of the impact yeah he's you know it's really interesting because he's a guy who I don't think he has a degree in this stuff but he's so well-read in it that he has these debates and conversations with peoples that do have these degrees in it and he can tell them things about it yeah and it's hard in those fields to be taken seriously if you don't have a PhD and whatever disel and it is but man his his work on these things is so compelling in the podcast that I've did with them are just mind-blowing but in terms of like the evidence it points to some event that ended the ice age very rapidly and caused the disintegration of the polar of the the ice that was over North America you know North America had something like a mile-high plus sheet of ice over the list of it ten thousand years ago I think I was driving through Wyoming and they've got all these signs up in Wyoming that are really interesting and it was there's a rock formation that'll tell you how old that rock formation is how it formed you know cause like you know Rock usually embeds in layers like this it's formed in layers like this and then you'll see it rock like that you know all the lines like this there's some of them there that are like hundreds of million years old you know and there's a sign there showing it and it's just it's incredible to think how much the earth changed and you just said it we're around for a hundred years at a time max yeah you know and it's just like we're dropping the freaking ocean like even the whole human race is a drop in the ocean compared to like how old the earth is and it's just crazy to think of it like it's hard to comprehend that there was that much ice over here because there's none now yeah you know but it's been that long you know and that's yeah it's mind-boggling to think of well this they find shells in Montana I found some on top of friggin some big Mesa out in the desert dude like there's no water for miles and their shells there there's there was like starfish fossilized in the rock send it to like coral bed you know and that was like that was like the bottom of the ocean that was a reef bed yeah it's the Great Western inland sea yeah they had sharks out there I'd say I think they had megalodons in Montana shit they find dinosaurs there all the time wanted Dudley's friends and what Dudley knows a guy who has a ranch out there in Montana and he found a bone in his and his ranch just maybe something protruding from the ground and he wanted someone to get a look at it so he got a hold of some I guess what would you have paleontologists oh yeah yeah they went and they said you got a fucking t-rex here bro holy sh t rex on your property unbelieva yeah I think they gave a million dollars for it really yeah this is like a fully intact or close to intact t-rex fire apparently monster charities Colorado what you got there Megalodon was found supposedly in Texas Jesus Christ what the fuck that's fucking great what shocked boy that's a stupid movie the meg the meg watch that shit I watched it the other day yeah I could take what am i stupid there wasn't just one there was a bunch of them did you can you find out him how much media yeah I have I was struggling to find that and then I think I found what you found so it says here's from NASA's website there's a hundred tons of dust and sand sized particles every day hit earth every day but every day doesn't it seems like it would put the balance of the earth off you know like it's you know the main like oh we sand and shit back out into space if we send in a hundred tons of shit back out in the space every day to off load this look at this every two thousand years or so a meteor I meteoroid the size of a football field hits earth and causes significant damage to the area that's very once everything be in the next ten minutes an object large enough to threaten earth civilization comes along not just that bigger than that impact craters on Earth the moon or the planet or E but planetary bodies are evidence of these occurrences yeah they don't even know you know that's the the most buki thing like Neil deGrasse Tyson and said that we are decades away from being able to do anything about one of those things coming our way and I said why the area think that like they could stop it when it's happening is like not happening he goes there's nothing you could do what about Armageddon birth the Mersey Bruce Willis yeah we yeah yeah there's people have a real distorted idea of the technological capabilities in terms of life first of all NASA is so under budgeted they barely have enough money to put you know satellites in orbit they don't have enough money to stop coming in I mean you know the amount of money you would need is so fucking massive it would take a cooperative joint effort of every major country in the world yeah it's such a force of nature and you know a force of nature usually can't be fucked with yeah scary well they're all they can do all they think they could do in the not even now but in the future is move it off target slightly yeah yeah somehow or another give it a bump send it into Mars or something at a certain distance and it completely misses yeah approximate instead darkness nice white for forever yeah it's scary space is scary and you don't really see space unless you're out there with no light pollution you know the I don't think people that don't camp or they don't go you know you look up at night like last night well not last night but a couple nights ago when it wasn't raining it was a clear night and I saw quite a few stars because there was no moon I was like wow so pretty but it ain't shit but you're not saying the volume of it yeah it was photos you have yeah out of my farm you can just sit there with the naked eye and you can look right into those there's so many stars it looks like a dark spot of the Milky Way because you can see so much of it you know you see color in it and everything gets an amazing spot now the color is weird right what is the color what is that I don't know I was I looked at some photos of it oh not my own photo someone else's photos and they will show on the like the rori images and the color that was coming out of these RAW images they look like absolute pillars like painted pillars dude yeah you know and it's I don't know I don't know if it's a depth funeral if it's something like that Jamie but go to atoms of that the first man Instagram again like these this Emmett like like the ones of oh look at that one from BC go down one strip that that one there that's what the Northern Lights in it Wow but yeah that's so no light pollution out there obviously oh you saw the Northern Lights yeah see I don't know you could see him in BC yeah I thought you had to be in like Iceland or something that was cool I've seen him when I was in Northwest Territories I was lighting up the ground like and right in front of the eyes I would just like dance and constantly right in front of your eyes that was awesome in the Northwest Territories of Australia no in Canada oh okay northern territories of Australia right that's what they call it yeah the West is yeah okay so where is it at the best though is it the best place to see it in like Iceland or some shit or Norway I don't know I don't know I've seen it so I've seen it in Northwest Territories I've seen it in BC but I think we didn't say it in Alberta when will there no no but I think we had shitty weather wobbles yeah it's got to be a crazy thing to see though huh it's like green smoke in the sky yeah if you go down a couple more Jamie please there's the dead time there's the farm go up one yeah hit that one in the middle there Wow look at the color in that one yeah that's amazing and is that what kind of you have to do something with the aperture well for starters it's open for a longer right oh it's gathering in more light you know like the human eye you have to actually lay there in the dark for a fair wall and just like stare into that sort of to get a good look at it how long is it open to get that image that's like a 13 or 15 seconds oh wow yeah you can leave it open for 30 seconds or you can put it on like an actual jammed open for a long time but it's way too much light for what the farm has and you start getting a lot of distortion as well that's such a cool picture with the the cabin as well the light coming out of the cabin yeah isn't that crazy that there could be infinite earth see out there yeah that's what's crazy is that each one of those is a Sun yeah and most of them are bigger I mean apparently our son is a little bitch-ass son thank God for that otherwise it'll be fraud we just have to be further away yeah fuck but the big ones don't last that long apparently our signs a good one it's a it's like it's like a Toyota Tercel fucking last Hilux we don't have that over here yeah I like that the Como yeah alex is like a small Land Cruiser right yeah it is yeah yeah got a bunch of wacky the cruise is probably better I'm about to buy Land Cruiser that's the Hilux they're the new Land Cruiser yeah the tray back though so like a dual cab so like five seats but it's got a tray on it and then a tray you mean like a pickup truck bed like a pickup truck bed but we usually rip the the the one that's on it off we usually rip the trip the pickup truck bed off because it's like it's bulky you know there's not a lot of room in it really usually rip that off and we'll build a steel tray so it's like a whole flatbed um you might call it a flatbed and you can just feel a lot more on it and it's a lot more rickety you know you can throw firewood rocks on it whatever the fun one well you guys have to have vehicles that you could drive for like a day before you hit a gas station if you doing that EP doing those hunts that I do yeah so one of the first things you do is you rip off the fuel tank and you put like an aftermarket fuel tank on it that's usually like twice the capacity yeah well you throw a second fuel tank on it and go from there so I don't know what are these in gallons but like say a fuel tanks like usually 60 litres 20 gallons is what usually a fuel - yeah yeah well then would double it to like 40 or 50 or 60 or something like that right and because there's such a market for it in Australia there's a bunch of them that you buy ready that are ready to mount onto your vehicle why is there a market for that in Australia because it's fucking hundred miles - anyway that's why for drive-ins like different in Australia as well you know it's like so where my business is the nearest city which is purse like 18 hours drive you know know we feel teen I don't wanna drive to the nearest city yeah 18 hours 18 hours what is that Jamie the slide too far but what would it take us to get that's like Colorado um I've driven a cry of driven from Ohio to here twice hold on 33 hours and 24 hours get you from a Columbus to about Amarillo Texas now 24 hours straight driving straight driving like Western Australia's like a massive state it goes from the very top of Australia to the very bottom of this drive does it feel like when you get out of the car for 33 hours of driving sucks so bad one time we ended at 4:00 in the morning right on the Sunset Strip right at that hotel too high it why 5:00 in the morning but when you get in LA at 4:00 in the morning you're right into traffic again you're like tired of shit you're like oh it's time to go you gotta go cuz you're about the wrecker at the end of the trip but your palms your pump and Kanye the hallway like it's a hellish drive and there's just you know to some people that's nothing the whole way but it's beautiful country like if you're in the day outback you yep you're like you're staring out and you're happy the whole time it's not a very popular thing to do in Australia's to go out into the outback and it is yeah between like full drive and like touring enthusiasts and like we call them the grey Nomad so like older people that have retired with gray hair like old mates be they're great young Jamie ain't looking so young but um a great nomad we call them you know they'll get like a normal description and right now in Australia so if I said yeah we saw these grey nomads out there people go okay yeah down at the gray Nomad so no no yeah yeah but if you said it went to the gas station like you see anybody out there yeah yeah huh yeah now do most people that would do this do they are they just going out there camping like just camping getting getting a good you know influx of the outdoor sort of thing you know getting it here it seems like there is quite a bit of hunting in Australia though like particularly there is hunting seems to be on the rise yeah it's just not really promoted well except for you know the boning community itself whereas you come to AmeriCorps and there's like towns with big sign up saying welcome hunters you know it's promoted Italy yeah it's not it's like it's not part of our history in Australia even though it is signs that say welcome hunter in America having a scene there yeah yeah there's none of that so I think it is on the rise you know and I think there's like this bit of a trend at the moment you know go and kill your own which is good I love that well so specially because Australia has so many non-native species that you can hunt exactly yeah and I mean you don't ever have to buy meat in Australia no no do you ever buy meat if we're eating chicken yeah yeah that's about it but just to mix it up yeah the fridge is full I fill all my friends fridges my family's fridges speaking of chicken what's that mountain lion tastes like fucking delicious that's why I keep hearing it's delicious yeah and people get angry it's so strange to me how angry people get if you kill a mountain lion yeah because I think they think that if you kill it it's different than killing a deer or something that's a normal thing to eat yeah even more than a bear yeah yeah they get more angry so kitty cat yeah yeah I mean while that motherfucker will kill you yeah I had a bunch of people saying you know you shouldn't have killed or don't see mountain lions like I see deer I'm fucking no shit cuz have you seen mountain like lines like you've seen deer there'd be no deer mm-hmm it's as simple as that you know I don't know what the numbers are but there's probably supposed to be like one mountain lion for every 500 deer or something like yeah when there's one a day yeah that's right and they're a snaky creature you know you're not supposed to see them they're not like that listen you you could go your whole life not seeing them and they could be around you all the time yeah that's a fact that you live in the wilderness if you live in Montana or you live in Colorado and you live in the woods you might see one every few years yeah you might not yeah few years and they'll fucking everywhere yeah I'll see prints all the time but I'll never see a cat like I've actually never seen a cat in the wall except for the one that I hunt and that's like that story I was telling you before like it was eating a calf but they typically kill a deer every single day yeah you know so it's fucking deer this the human brain allows us to manage things in a certain way you know it's like these biologists have put all this study and research in the you know gone okay you can hunt males in this area so that's all I could hunt where I was I could only shoot a male how do you know it's a male well that's when the dogs come in handy so like I've always met I've never really wanted to hunt with dogs because I'd like to do all the hunting myself but there's a special bond between the hunter and the dogs when you're hunting that's for sure and it was actually a really good experience I really loved it but a lot of people frown on using dogs but the best way to to determine the sexes is the dogs will track it and the line will take refuge in a tree and then you can have a look at of genitals and make sure it's a male with binoculars yeah yeah well sometimes if they're low enough you can tell if the human eye so the first thing we established was well it was the line I wanted the line that had killed that calf or was eating that calf alive we end up getting a getting the rancher to come in the end up putting the calf out of its misery it couldn't be saved and then we put the dogs back on that mountain lion track and they chased him about seven miles and they end up training we got we marched in and hiked into the tree and up determining that it was a male and then man up shooting and it wasn't really good death it was quick but um if it was a female would have had to have left it where we were some states aren't like that and counties aren't like that where it can be male and female the population is too high what they're trying to do in that part of Colorado is just keep that might mountain lion population healthy and how they determine that was by shooting males only that could change next year they could have a rise in mountain lion a decrease in the mule deer and other animals so they might change that again but we could only shoot a male so yeah the problem in America particularly in California where they outlawed hunting with dogs is that the perception of using a dog to go after an animal the perception is that it's not fair mm-hmm what people I mean this is gonna be hard for some people especially animal lovers to understand but that is the only effective way to hunt for mountain lions because there's no way you're gonna sneak up on them you're just now that truck you're not gonna see that's where numbers start to bloom and other animals like mule deer and stuff start the Plumber which i've heard a lot that's happening in california is the mule deer population just been decimated because there's no control on the mountain law exactly well they do have control the mountain lions but only government employees killed in the mountain kill ironically the same amount of mountain lions they were killing when they were high he's insane it's insane but instead of people paying money to do it and getting retires back in the conservation and getting to eat the mountain lion which i know again people like what are you talking about eating mountain lion I'm telling you folks I haven't eaten one but I'm telling you and you said it brunella said it's one of the most delicious animals he's ever eaten yeah I wanted to bring you some but it's actually illegal to bring it in to California good thing we always abide by the law dramatically and then one day I'll try it yeah so then I've cooked it up and I'm feeding it to Kim yeah and I was cooking chicken as well just in case her and the kids didn't like it I had chicken on the grill as well and I served the mountain line first and now we're eating the mountain lion and I'm like what do you think of it and she's like ice I've got the chicken and I'm like no you don't you've got the mountain lion and it was delicious dude it's tenderized I felt like it was a taste between like chicken and pork or chicken and even venison like I found it right in the middle there it's delicious and I'm not saying everyone should go and hunt a mountain line because you can't do that but there's certain places that you can go eat a tag for the benefit of Wildlife and go on hunting me on the line people just have a hard time with the idea that you are somehow another helping to control the population by killing an animal that kills other animals yeah yeah they would rather let nature take its course but what so even if like like let's go to Africa now even if the lion population way outweighed something and was running it to extinction these people would want to see it back and just let that happen and it's like humans have got a brain capacity that allows us to study input research into an animal that's like actually what would be more healthier for the whole ecosystem would be if we come in and hunt these animals and what we'll do is we'll charge people a certain tag fee to be able to do that and we'll put that back into conservation which will help this animal and there's just this beautiful healthy ball that keeps turning yeah for the people that know it they respect it and they appreciate it you know people like backcountry hunters and anglers and all these different organizations Rocky Mountain Elk Federation a lot of different organizations they have the United States that really appreciate what they're doing to promote that that that idea here in America but people that don't hunt and don't don't go into them it took me years to kind of wrap my head around it and really truly understand it and become educated yeah as to how it works a wildlife biologist set these standards and do it based on healthy populations and how much time they spend doing surveys and analyzing the population how important it is to you know that these reports and hunters send in to wildlife organizations and the Department of Fish and Game it's really interesting and I'm not a blanket killer even because I understand where those people are coming from as well yeah we need a certain amount of that because it could go the opposite way where it's like let's just go out and hunt everything can right not the case if something's not in a good healthy population I'm not interested in hunting that overall myself of course ya know I want to see these animals stay here for forever I want my kids kids kids kids to be able to see those animals in good healthy healthy population yeah like when I hear about limited entry tags for like like for moose or something like that because a small number and they'll let a certain amount of people whoa what fuck yeah what is a tally no I'm a slob that's why the towels here I fucking spill everything I've ruined two laptop at least right at least two laptops during the show it's angry that's like it's angry America's dangerous yes fucking kombucha if I found out like like in some places they have a small amount of moose and they'll let you hunt a moose but it has to be like one moose and has to be over 50 inches and like I'm out yeah I don't want to shoot that moose how many of them are there there's 200 of them walk out of here my shoot not interested no what if what if the winter comes and kills a bunch of a fight which happens what if wolves move in happy yes and that's why these tag limits and that change from year to year as well like I've seen them constantly change because they'll do their research or the kill wasn't big enough last year all the winner was too harsh and you know they start limited in tags yeah that's very sad think in most cases in most cases we've got it right yeah I think so too which is one of the reasons why one of my favorite places to hunt is alone I fucking see little demons that just jump out why arrow is constantly it's crazy of an animal that evolved to get away from Tigers you can't believe how fast those guys and delicious yeah you think it's a it's it's kind of a weird coincidence that the fastest animal you can hunt is also the most delicious yeah totally yeah yeah yeah like it's kind of weird yeah because they are delicious they learn to move faster I think a deer so you know we say jump the string like when you shoot like the deer here's the bow go off or something like that and we call the jump the string which you'll know about this but a lot of people want they don't jump out of the string when they miss your arrow that actually drop to bound away so they drop load up their legs and then Jen jump you know but it's actually the drop that's when you usually miss them well that moves at over 1,300 feet per second a really good bow shoots at about 300 feet per second in a hunting situation so you can't beat them 1313 hundred feet per second that's how fast they start dropping that's insane yeah well the thing about access deer as opposed to any other animal I've ever hunted is they don't just jump the string they get out of the way yeah like a whole body link their guns like yeah like you have to date they have to not know you're there yeah yeah like the first one that I killed this season had no idea was there no idea no idea was there and there's a nice wind so when that arrow hit him he was quartering away when that hit him he had no idea it was coming and yeah the perfect yeah it was our trip or do that one yeah that was when I got out of the car and I saw 115 minutes don't ya big velvet head yeah yeah so I try and it's the same with fellow deer back in Australia like they're really fast off the mark I'll try and shoot him when they're busy you know when they've got other noise happen and they're raking their antlers they're stepping forward or something like that and the few that I shot in lanai one was scruffing with another buck so he was all busy and he didn't move at all and it pegged him the other one was in high winds in the grass and had the grass like moving around it and he didn't move and then the third one was on a really still day and I actually aim for his heart and he dropped and I end up hitting in double lungs you know it's just they're so quick it's like you need to come even right at the moment when you're like I'm going to shoot just like you need the wait for something extra to happen hmm you know yeah well it's a great place to get accustom to stalking and and hunting animals with a bow the opportunities are so many yeah you blow on your luck I'll move on to the next one there's twenty thousand deer and three thousand people a tiny little island yeah did you did you ever go out at night in a car when you see the inside of the road I think what I think I was in the car with you and there was like 400 coming across the road and it's just like all these little eyes just cool it didn't even make sense and they hire people to go in there with sniper rifles and just take them out one after another it's crazy yeah and then something that's always got to me so like one of the property owners that lives beside my property where I hunt he'll go out and caused irreversible they classified in those game animals for a year or a couple of years now they just declassify them because the numbers are just exploding so you can shoot them on the lights you can you can do anything you can feed them you can bathe them you can do whatever you want wow they just want to get rid of them yeah and so this guy he raises cattle and so that's what he has he'll go out at night and he'll shoot these deer and just leave them right where they lay not take any meat off him or anything but then kill one of his own cattle to fill his freezer or in fridge and the first time he'd actually eating venison was when I shot a I shot a deer on his property and I cut it up and I actually gave it to him that was the first time he'd ever eaten venison deer and I'm like John you like killing your own cattle these delicious meats hidden right there there's this wild resource and it's renewable because they fuck each other they breed yeah and so he's eating his own cattle and selling them yeah another thing is this another way that I've always looked at it is these wild animals are there whether you like it or not they're there why place another cow or another sheep in the paddock to put strain on the landscape if you especially if you eat in your own why not just go and shoot a deer it's a wild animal and you're doing the ecosystem a service by doing it and there are some of the most healthy animals uh very delicious they're super healthy for you they're so rich in vitamins and nutrients and protein and the tape I prefer it for everything yeah I really do yeah and it's not just the taste it's a whole feeling thing like I went and got this I earned this I killed this I know where this comes from you're attached to it we're spoken about it before but when you get meat that's served in a package at the supermarket that goes through past hundreds and hundreds of people's hands and breaths and stuff like that you know and it's just like having sex with Scarlett Johansson in the virtual a guy that's the next detachment that's it fucking it's gonna be made better mate it's gonna be sex that's the next attachment well there's these people that are making artificial meat now or not just artificial shouldn't say artificial it's real meat but it's meat that's made in a lab and that's that I don't know what they're calling an ethical mean or whatever the fuck they're calling it but it's the future of meat production and you know this is making animal rights people very excited because they're basically gonna have just lab me that's so fuckin yeah so you know it's gonna happen no more cows no more domestic pigs and I'm the shit that they love like the reason that cows there is because there's a demand for meat so that cow gets a life because there's meat right no one's gonna let these cows and sheep and domestic pigs and shit run around on their landscape and take out real estate if there's no market for them or pigs are the weirdest one because pigs like my friend Whitney Cummings she adopted a pig that what she hid that pig I think it was from the fire right yeah and she actually wound up driving it to Texas she drove in her car 24 hours she's a fuckin maniac when it comes to animals I think her and her fiance drove to Texas with this fucking pig to drop it off at this pig shelter and damn dude when you she's with that pig that thing is like a dog it might as well be my dog yes is like hanging out there intelligent animal yeah but when they get loose and they're out in the wild boy they fucking breed three four times a year they'll have big piles of piglets and those piglets will distribute everything for everything too devastating to plants and ground nesting birds animals everything everything in front of them they're pigs yeah and I hate them no I gotta hate them I love pigs I think they're an unknown animal pot the bigger picture is I need to be controlled they can't go out there and just ruin the you know ecosystem like that well there's you're seeing in Texas Texas is probably in the United States is the biggest example of what happens when or the best example of what happens in these feral hogs are just completely out of control they just devastate these agricultural farms yeah they have these farms and they're just getting destroyed yeah I mean it's all the wildlife I've a wild life as well because I eat frogs and now lean lizards now yeah anything that's on the ground that's edible thou ADA yeah I wrote an article years ago it was called killer at the pass it was a place in Australia and the the property owners like the ranch has called me up and they said you need to come out and shoot some of the foxes like they're devastating our lambs and I end up going out there and when I was driving in with the forward drive at night it was the high beams on I seen this massive big black and white boy walking between the flock of sheep with a lamb in its mouth it was this pig and it got a taste for meat and it happens all the time like so a big boy especially a mature animal will get a taste for meat in harsher conditions and they'll just stick the meat after that and ain't no catching up with this pig the next morning and shot it with the bow it actually attacked me with the first shot wasn't perfect and it charged me and I end up like stabbing it to death I was on a slope like this on the mountain cheese and it was really a battle like for any he end up hooking the bow out of me hand cuz when he charged me I put an arrow on and shot and just went down one side and like hit one lung and it just infuriated this boy and he was on me and when I was fending him off with the bow he stuffs went into the bottom limb of the bow or the cam or something like that and ripped the bow out of me hand and I end up getting me knife off me and end up like stabbing his Pig was like trying to run me over holy shit how big was it it was a big boys like big meeting it made Aiden boy like this and like how many pounds you know I fucking big that's how many pounds 300 probably not 300 mountain boys just get real solid yeah probably 200 or something like that and anyway I end up stabbing this thing to death and when I end up cutting it open its whole insides like its whole stomach was like lambs hocks like the feet the bottom of the feet where they can't swallowing skulls and just like little bits of wool and stuff like that we've just been going around and just picking these lambs off and killing them yeah and it's a really known occurrence in Australia now that if things get harsh I'll just go know just because they're they're just absolutely ruthless they'll just walk right between the Sheep and just fucking grab a limb walk off of it children up and eat up by anyway first thing in that morning that I found was a pig spew and it was like this fucking spew like this and it was the same as lambs hocks and with a special vomit oh you notice a spew in America yeah you do but I wasn't I thought maybe it meant something else to you yeah what fucking spew on Mike yeah spew I spewed out yes that's why having that Disney yesterday you told me so they just threw up bones just throw up bones and stuff that I couldn't digest but yeah in a lamb killer destructive animal and they're so ruthlessly efficient in terms of like how much food they get so a deal will walk along and it will pick you know this it will just pick the tops off grass and the grass regrows you know a pig will go through and eat that grass and it'll turn it over and eat the roots and everything well coaches causes a lot of erosion and then there's no regrowth because there's no roots in there cuz they're greedy pigs they're greedy pigs there you go you know they're the number one cause of death on farms really yeah apparently with domestic animals people falling into pig pens and just into them they just they just devour and you know when you're dealing with these giant domestic pigs they get fucking you massive yeah hundreds of pounds yeah in like Western New South Wales when times get tough which is like seems to be fuckin all the time now but um they'll get so desperate like you'll shoot a pig you're going for it for the farmer and you're just shooting them you're not even really taking any meat often because they're like they're connote they they're eatin meat their self and they're like skin and bones and disgusting it's more of like a cull mission and you'll come back in the afternoon that pig will be completely skin and bones because the other pigs just get in there and just and you'll hear them you'll just hear him just screaming that's the most god-awful sound there is the cannibalized they cannibalize yeah I was in to hone ranch and we were walking by this really high grass a grass like five foot high and you we were only like maybe ten yards away from these pigs fighting and then and I said to Rinella I said no come on man if you didn't know those are pigs if I told you there was demons in that grass you would you something yeah yeah yeah it was great but it sounded like Lord of the Rings it sound like some horrific scene no monster movie yeah it sound like a or it really did mean there's there it's just how is that the same animal as those cute little things that Whitney Cummings is yeah yeah because the one that she had was like all fluffy and sitting in her bed cue loving it did she taught it how to go outside was it a cake me pig no it was a pig that was the other thing she told me apparently those little pigs are not real all they are is just underfed yeah that's pretty fucking that's fucked up like when those people have those little tiny pigs she's like that's not real yeah they're just oh it's a baby pig it's a tiny little pig it's just gonna stay tiny No if you don't feed it will stay tiny it about where now remember when they had the kittens in the jars I think it was a Japanese thing or something what you never seen that no they had the they like a little glass jar and they'd have a cat in the glass jar I think I think they're always fake but people will advertisement like this is how you can have your cat holy fuck look that up James that's real there you go no they photos ones that's fake oh look at that thing's eyes okay some of those look real so is it just for fun there's okay they just for fun no I thought there was some real ones with I had to lead on them and everything well you can guarantee something you go those fuckers that I've got they face blurred out they apologize for stuff and kitten in a jar sorry yeah yeah yeah people are capable of incredible cruelty yeah that's why we need divert into things that's why I say I can understand it you know you need that other like I'm not extreme where I'm just like hun everything but I'm sure there's a few people out there like that I've never met them where they just like kill everything then you need the other extreme where it's like no all animals that sacred don't touch any animals you know they can't be killed you know and then try and find that middle ground where you're like well that's fucking ridiculous and that's ridiculous this is where I am I couldn't agree more I think that's a perfect way to put it yeah yeah I think I think a lot of those animal rights people they it comes from a good place mmm yeah that's how I feel too they care about animals it comes to a good place but their understanding of population control and wildlife management and just the reality of human beings it's just they just don't think they're getting in with the mountain lion thing one of the things they found with mountain lions in California is that almost 50% of their diet is domestic pets there's go to nature's metal go to nature's metal calm my all-time favorite Instagram page so you guys page back either you guys page back or they he had to open up another one but that guy has the most fucked up Instagram sensitive sensitizing some shit at the moment deep him Kim had a video it's only like a 1520 second video of her it was carrying a white-tailed deer out in Texas there was no blood on it or nothing you couldn't see that had been gutted or anything like that and they removed it said it was violence okay this is nature's metal underscore backup account I don't you follow it though but yeah the other accounts not up anymore I well click on the most recent one that lion image when is that from yeah December 20 no it's new Mecca its new see if they're back 9 page right yeah don't go to nature's metal underscore just go to nature is metal Oh metal I thought a segmental metal like metal um so that's it that's the real one so scroll up keep going and that's it right there with the car this is the quick and the dead this is a Florida panther in this guy's driveway snatches up a house Pat watch this shit this is what the fuck you have what the fuck happens this guy's got his security camera running pal damn that's a rap it's a rap a little fella it's not a dog or a cat fucking nearly looks like a cat it's a kitty cat yeah kill the cat everyone likes a bit of pussy there's how dare you there's a there's a growing population these things they're endangered but they're there and you know basically I mean it's a subspecies I guess but it's basically the same things a mountain lion yeah alright so the first time I did a little bit of research in Google it just comes up that Cougars endangered in America and but when you start looking into it they're not at all there on the Least Concern list in America because the populations riving yeah and then when I spoke to DNR in Colorado about you know the the cougar as well they were saying that their populations continued to rise even with the tags that they've given out their population just continues to rise yeah and without dogs you're just not gonna hunt them maybe the people would not yeah you might get lucky and stumble across its not paying attention to you I'd love to them you'd want to have limitless time though you know like to actually that's the difference you know yeah I'd like to have limitless time and then just be like okay I'm dedicating a whole month to stalking Cougars you know yeah but that's the knock on bear hunting as well bear hunting in the 1990s they outlawed dogs in California you can still hunt black bears I guess black bears are more accepted as a nuisance if the population grows because you know they'll they'll find your garbage yeah and then once they will see them as well but yeah it's not just that once they find your garbage like that's where they go they come by and day out they're there they have a pattern and they develop these habits but they stopped using bears stop using dogs rather to hunt bears in California and then they stopped using baiting so those two things are illegal there's no baiting and there's no dog so good luck bear huh yeah yeah especially with a bow yeah pretty tough yeah the baiting ones another one like people don't like baiting and I get it you know we've done it it's it's it's not the same no it's not the same some pills it sounds good yeah I did it that one time with you and then and I was sort of like that it was it was still good it was still cool now and there's a tag in place and there's Conservation Act in place but it just I don't I've got no desire to go back right I've done that now that's cool and that conservation is very important for the elk population the moose population the deer population cuz they they kill an estimated 50% of all moose calves and elk calves deer fawns it's all black bears yeah yeah and they're cannibals too they kill Cubs yeah crazy I've watched this one the other day because you hear people I give a bad charge of male climb a tree and the black bear climbs a tree like I mean fucking high ones you've seen it yeah there's a cinnamon black bear and she's got Cubs and she goes so fast up that yeah holy you can't climb up a tree to get away from a bear yes get the fuck yeah you're done the big ones just don't want to do it anymore yeah I think it still they can still do it ideas like oh the big ones won't chase you up a tree yeah when you see the speed that they go up a tree then you can imagine the speed that they come across land you know and it's just like I always say I always tell people about that one that was sleeping on an elk kill that I had at grizzly we showed that video the other day did yeah yeah yeah we showed it on the podcast and I remember I yelled at that grizzly the one that would sleep on the elk carcass and it fucking disappeared so fast and quietly dude and I'm like if you don't have eyes on one coming out you don't know it's gonna come at you until you're hit until it's on you fucking eat in your face their pads are so soft yeah the pads of the feet are so soft in order to sneak up on things I remember the first time I went bear hunting with Cam and one was walking and he goes right there right there right there I turned to look I'm like no he's like there so wow this is that video yeah cow lowing up runnin dude galloping up the tree running yeah and the fucking scary cheetah doesn't stop there everyone ends up fucking hang on and that's a black bear with Cubs so you can imagine that situation with the grizzly and her cubs so fucking scary and so that's a collar phase that looks like a colorful one on the top is the black bear is the cub no that's it looks like a full-grown black bear the color phase has got a carb back up the mountain we thought yeah that's fucking boy boy crocodiles don't fucking climb trees that's what I heard when are we doing this someone started the petition I fucking joe rogan needs to han Australia you got snakes too though bro yes let's fucking let's go over some shit here the whole season in Australia the whole season in Australia I've seen two snakes one of them not poisonous is it like a red-bellied black snake not going to harm me a friendly snake the other one are barely poisonous snake a bit not very poisonous might kill a kid or a dog biters you guys have though no I didn't like no no this giant they're not good thank you talk to him fucking stay out of it one thing I want to ask you about is the thylacine the Tasmanian tiger yeah I read that there there was credible reports by people in the woods they might have seen one I wish I don't think so though but it's so remote right there's so many cameras now those guys are scouting cameras that are putting it over deer wallows and stuff like places that they would come in the drink it was a big animal right wasn't it yeah a big do they get 100 pounds something like that what baby it bigger than that what a cool-looking attitude and the mail was coming like this there it is scientists hunt for extinct Tasmanian tiger after sightings in Australia yeah that's probably what I saw I wish the air article from what year scroll over 2700 really interesting solid the extinction was driven from people all right I'd like because they fucking meat-eater said come in and start eating sheep or whatever they get shot by farmers and right off like that which is a shame and I'm sure they didn't realize how doing it at the time but that you know they push them to extinction you know if there's one thing that we should bring back from extinction if we if it's possible I believe they should be brought back if it's possible right yeah you have some DNA because I mean we do it would be nice to have some sort of an animal like that that could knock down some of the populations are kangaroos and like probably wouldn't they probably just come in and devastate like livestock let me get back to why you need to come to snakes all year in Australia and fucking 17 snakes in the first month in America dude 17 aaron schneider got bitty yeah that is boot really yeah I think he was in North Carolina or some shit I forget where it was somewhere in the south my buddy J's so this is the first hunt that I did when I come to America we flew in the Idaho when we drove straight down the southern Colorado the hunt prom on and we're driving into the property at like 2:00 a.m. in the morning and there's a pronghorn just standing on the side of the road you know it's just like it's dazed you know so my buddy Jay spools up he walks over to it and like literally touches it on the head like it's like it's just like walking down the road and we're likely to get hit by a car next minute I seen him jump bark a rattlesnake had bit the pronghorn and he stood he had a leg on either side of the rattlesnake and it strike him it actually striking twice at missed both times Wow I know I had a cake question him like did that bite you and he's like nah I'm like have a think about it did a fucking bite you and he's like no it didn't because I watched it in the headlights go for him twice and once we set up camp we went back there and that prom home was dead it had killed that prom on yeah I'm like fuck America this dryer is so much safer a friend of mine was hiking and he still almost stepped on a rattlesnake and jumped back and then realized there was a nest of them Halloween it was a little one surrounding them they were all over the place he was like fuck yeah jumping hopping around one leg after a noisy yeah I actually had apparently that happens yeah it does yeah and tarantulas there dude everywhere those tarantulas walking over the ground everywhere I was saying this so a bold the bold effort to prove the Tasmanian Tigers still out there wildlife biologist Forrest Galante has brought one species back from the dead and he wants to do the same with the Tasmanian Tiger what the fuck is he brought back from the dead this goddamn Frankenstein unable played the the Cuban saw Leno Don is one of the most curious animals the planet small shrewd shrewd must be shrewd like creature mammal is a mammal but a highly venomous one fuck you bring that back very specimen found that was thought to be lost forever then unexpectedly three were caught just a few years later the extinct species mark Don so that may be the case with the Tasmanian tiger hmm it'd be awesome okay here it is gallant is a wildlife biologist made his life's mission to search for animals that have wrongly been deemed extinct and among those species on his list is the tasmanian tiger duh the difficulty leads to these like who the fuck has seen one squid keep scrolling see if anybody like legit scene 1 he's been traveling around the world searching for evidence species like Tasmanian devil Paki L'Amour and the Newfoundland white wolf still exist 100 species deemed extinct worldwide annual annually this process isn't foolproof and every now and then animals are rediscovered after they were thought to be gone forever but proving the animals still out there is no easy feat hmm I wonder huh I'm sorry yeah captured footage of a Zanzibar leopard which is thought to be extinct for 25 years due to persecution by local hunters in the Zanzibar archipelago in Tasmania Tanzania rather excuse me wow that would be fucking pretty dope if they actually did find that thing it's cool-looking animal you know yeah they can't be in good numbers anymore yeah like an animal like that like where did they live Tasmania that's what it tells me in target and has meaning is where down the bottom of Australia the bottom yeah it's a separate island that's that tiny little triangle that's down the bottom absolutely beautiful Island like that's the only place they lived I believe so how big is it yeah actually they might have been on the mainland and I think that's where the sightings have been yeah oh wow it's big tazzie how big is that place I don't know fucking big enough they don't allow any bowhunting there so I've never gone do the hello hunting yeah I think you can hunt with a gun for fellow deer why they make you use a gun I don't fucking know Australia's got some weird rules ones oh yeah you guys like have they bought up all the guns after a mass shooting right well not all of them if you were a license holder like a shooters yeah the shooters licence and you had a reason to have a gun then you can still keep your guns so you had to be like a member of a gun I don't own any guns but you had to be a member of a gun club I don't own any guns in Australia you had to be a member of a gun club have or perhaps mission on a property where you're hunting and stuff like that to keep you guns it's that they keep trying to make it during titer I think it's tied enough because criminals are going to get what they want right you know it's like how many people have been killed with baseball bat fucking heaps are you going to be in baseball bats right how many people have been killed with a kitchen knife you're gonna be in kitchen knives so I think if you've got a legitimate reason to have a gun you know like you don't have a criminal record you don't have a mental illness or something like that you should have a right to have a gun so you do basically do a safety course and training in Australia and if you've got that reason to have a rifle then you can have it no semi-automatics there's a bunch of rifles and there's a bunch of guns that you can't have in Australia that's pretty much like bold action lever action and those rules might have changed as well no expert on obviously hmm whereas in America every fucking one's good yeah like everyone Amit's got a gun I've got a gun too because if everyone else has got a gun what a fuckin gun - it's true isn't it true and my guns for protection when I go into the wilderness for bears right or if I'm fuckin in some weed destination someone comes in and tries to fuckin rape or murder my family I'm gonna use it alright and yeah it's just funny like that but it's crazy to think and I know it changes from place to place that you know anyone could have a gun because you know it's like you're right and to a certain degree I agree with that but as well I think you lose that right if you've got a criminal record you've got a mental illness or something like that and fuck yeah exactly what good guys with guns not bad guys with guns but banning guns isn't gonna stop the bad guys from having guns well it's just weird it's like trying to take pee out of the pool yeah it's fucking so that's just too much yeah when you when you hunt in Australia you're not allowed to use a bolt-action rifle you can use the bolt-action rifle it's like the automatic semi-automatic Oh like an AR yeah they are yeah I think pump actions are being taken out now things like that yeah huh yeah because I want to feel like if especially with population control something like fallow deer if you have that many of them yeah I know there's places that are just erupting with them you would have to shoot them right yeah totally yeah there's no way you can a lot of places it's like the whole Californian thing you know they still getting killed but it's just a hit professional hitman that's doing it now there's not the rake recreation behind it and in Australia a lot of the times as they like a good example is actually across the pond in New Zealand where they're like fuck we need to shoot 30,000 tile you know toilet live in the mountains yeah and because they're introduced I reintroduced and I don't think there was a lot of hunters arguing at the time and no one was really arguing that we needed to shoot some tar but we weren't like fucking shoot 30,000 of them because I shoot him from a helicopter and they leave him rot on the mountain yeah they don't use any of it it's just a massive waste of resource you know and it's like you they're never going to eradicate them all anyway and why would they want to shoot 30,000 of them well they're introduced for starters right and fucking politicians work off money and fucking having a job to do so they make a lot of these things up you know but I would think that the money would be in hire or people paying to go hunt them some of these towns leave off hunters like that any reason that town is there like all their income is hunters coming in and hunting these destinations and that's the reason why the animals are there in the first place yeah in Newseum yeah that's right zealand they were all introduced as by wealthy Europeans they wanted to make it like a hunting distance yes that's right it is so crazy they just threw a bunch of yeah this is our playground yeah what's up fuck yeah well New Zealand's happy for now because they've got something hunting they got game animals yeah but if they're truly causing that much damage then yes obviously like fin out the population but why not get hunters involved to do it why not no hunting you know where the meat gets used you know with it where it's done properly and you know benefits the communities and well there's a lot of hunting destinations in New Zealand where people go to that are high fence places which is a little weird yeah like just I mean even if it's a couple hundred acres or a couple days they're fenced in and that animals aren't going it's just different it's like what we're talking about before where there's like shallow fun yeah like oh I've never done it but see that as like a shallow fun and then there's meaningful funds fucking what walk them out and find your own spot yeah you know well be axel actually go into the wild don't fence the wild in and make it the knot while don't make it the drastic the hard bit the hard bit about saying that you're a cock rate if you do it is a benefit some wildlife like this oh yes yelling shit that have been walk back from the concern list or nearly extinction because of all I fence operations like in Texas and Africa oh yeah so it's like I suppose it has got its place but it's just there's different there's different sorts of hunters well there's also different sizes of these partitions so like if you're in a place like there's some places in Texas that are 10,000 acres like look that's so far beyond that animals wild range that you might as well be in a wild even if there's a fence you know 80 miles in that direction what the fuck are you ever gonna get to that family or a deer you're going to yeah it's true I think I'm maybe I'm a little bit Chloe's more than it's a it's like ideologically the same thing I agree with you it feels I've you know I've seen those places it seems weird yeah it's like Jurassic Park you go these giant gates and inside those animals are fenced in they're never getting out yeah yeah you know they're in there yeah there's no mystery no there's no mystery that's yeah and I like I like the file you're in hunting as much as I like the success if you call like killing an animals a success bit yeah you know I like that the opportunity and you do everything in your fuckin power still you work your ass off you know your fuckin feed a bleedin if if they have to to get to the end of it but I like the idea that you can still fail on a hunt and I like failing on a hunt sometimes because it makes you realize fuck this is hard so the next time imagine everything you shot out you just smoked I fucking give it away in a day right I wouldn't be interested in you know well like do you like farming that's right I like that value because it makes you realize how fucking awesome it is when you get something well it also it's different between hunting and any other way that you get meat because because it is so difficult and it requires skill planning intelligence you have to have knowledge you have to know how to play the wind you have to know when to move when did not move it's a tactical situation where you have to use the right tactics to get in on this animal it was gonna smell you or hear you or see you there's so much involved in it that's not involved if you're just acquiring meat in the other way and that's what it should take - yeah that's what taking an animal's life so it should take that effort you know and it's like yeah you put so much heart and soul into it that even if you cut the meat up and it's like ruddy and Tuffy like this is delicious yeah well you were talking about your elk hunt in New Mexico this year and how difficult it was and you guys were out there for over a month yeah yeah what we did we did Oregon we did New Mexico and we did Montana for elk and we're just like busting our ass the whole time you know and then I end up getting one that it was like the one I actually really just wanted him to get a shoot a bull her first ball you know because she's been going at it and the one afternoon that she took off because she was doing some home schooling with the kids and trying to get on top of all that the perfect opportunity popped up and you know shooting is born and we never had a good opportunity again you know yeah which sucks but the thing is that's made a hungrier for it next this season you know like she realizes how hard it is how difficult it is and you appreciate it much more that's what it should be well it's cool that she is determined that it's not discouraging her then the difficulty oftentimes for a lot of people that difficulty because it's you know you're out there seven days ten days your feet are killing you you're exhausted and you're like I just gotta go in the fucking soup yeah yeah Kim's actually a really good example of what a lot of your audience would be because Kim's really been that city girl you know like that's that's just been her life you know and then I had it took about seven years to convince her to eat fucking venison game man really yeah yeah when how I did it was I shot a deer and I was just like a nice healthy young deer and I cut the back straps in the cutlets I think you guys call them tomahawk steaks I say we call them cutlets I cut it in the cutlets and it just looked like lamb cutlets dude and I cooked up these lien cutlets and I served it and she fucking loved it like her and the kids were just like this is delicious I think I actually only had my oldest boy hunter at the time like this delicious and they loved it and I'm like that's venison that's deer because it was just the image they hated I had no idea what the meat tastes like you know actually shooting a cute little deer yeah yeah and now it's the opposite where she doesn't feel as comfortable eating an animal she doesn't know about hmm you know because if if we put venison in the fridge freezer like it ever goes past just Kim's hands on my hands that's here you know where the animal come from you know that it was healthy you know everything like that and and then coconut and heat nur and she feels a lot more and I'm not trying to put anyone down it buys me because like I said I still buy me too and there's nothing wrong with that that's the population of the world it demands that but there's something that you don't feel as guilty about cooking your own mean yeah there's some sort of connection there that goes way beyond my birth yeah you know whereas like a real connection with hunting and eating the meat my littlest daughter loves fishing loves it and loves that we go fishing together and we caught yellowtail in Hawaii no I cooked it well I had the chef actually cooked it and turned we stayed at a hotel and you know they bring it to the chef and the at the restaurant and he would made sushi me out of it and made ceviche and it was so good but she loves it she just loves that she caught something and brought it in and she wants everyone to know that you're eating something that she caught yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a good feeling well it's also I'm connecting her with the what what a fish is you know you go she likes sushi she's had sushi before but now she's having sushi that she was there when the thing died she caught it she pulled it out of the ocean you know we took the hook out of its mouth we filleted it like the whole dog she saw shot every step of the way you know so I think there's still like a connection in people that's like it like sparks up again when they do something cuz we've done that for so long forever forever when you catch a fish when it's on the like the excitement like it doesn't necessarily even make sense if there's not some sort of a genetic component to it yeah because the excitement is so visceral so like its genetic without that it's like what do you do I'm pulling in lawn it's got some white on it something's been you know tickling on she's freaking first of all she wouldn't let anyone help her mmm she like wanted to do it her she's fucking 80 and she's got a 10-pound yellowtail on this thing and I'm helping her by holding on to the rock yeah that's all I'm doing in the world for hand you know so I'm holding the rod to make sure it doesn't and she's got two hands on the crank but she wouldn't give up again what do you want me to help you it's like no that's awesome yeah she so determined because when she did do it and brought it in the thrill was so powerful she wanted to be the one that brought it in yeah it's so cool yeah I really believe there's like this ancient connection 100% yeah and it's like with hunting I do a hunting a lot now so it's I feel like I'm in my element but even the first time that I shot something and I was cutting it up for meat it was I felt so comfortable doing it right away and it's like I'm it's it was like I've done this a million times before a lot of people say the same thing a lot of people say the same thing that they're Bryan Callen in fact said the same thing and he and I went hunting for the first time and he's like it just seems like something we've always done hmm like it's there's a memory in our DNA man this is how we've survived it was a great thrill if you caught if you shot a deer you know 10,000 20,000 years ago and you managed to bring that back to the village holy shit everybody's eating good yeah we're gonna get by we're gonna survive our children you're gonna get nutrition yeah this is a deep and meaningful feeling and it's not like you shot something like yeah yeah fucking shot it well not that feeling no you you feel excited you feel you like yes yes yes but it's a different kind of excitement it's it's sustance you're you're gonna get nutrients you're gonna feed your family you're gonna and it's all because you did it the way you did it especially bow hunting you know how difficult it is and you pulled it off there's this thrill of success and then there's this deep connection with your meat you know when I get an elk I love eating that stuff so when I get one I'm like now yeah good now I've got meat I've got meat from months yeah and I my friends have mean I have a fucking I have a gang of comedian friends that are eating alcohol because you know I give them sausages and steaks and I teach them like my friend Tom Papa he taught him how to like cook elk roasts you know like he calls is like what do I do I'm like you gotta keep it low and slow you want like 275 degrees get it to an internal temperature around 135 somewhere run then then you pull it sear it on the outside let it sit for 10 minutes he calls me up like a couple hours later holy shit it's because the hunt starts will the hunt probably starts here for you because you practice and shoot your target and then you go through all the preparation you go through the hunt you're successful you kill the animal the hunt doesn't end at killing the animal that hunt continues to go and like you're eating that animal on your plate yeah like that's the feeling that I get you know it's like and that that sometimes I'm like it's like why people call me a hunter I'm just a human this is a human thing to do right like go out catch your own cook it eat it survive continue it is weird that it's so is rare now yeah so how rare is it in Australia like population wise I don't know I fuck all there's not a lot of hunters I feel like there is because I'm in hunt the hunting community so I know a lot of hunters but if I go to any given person's house that's not most of my friends are hunters as well now but if say I go to one of Kim's friends houses there's no hunters in that house right you know and then I'll go to a workplace there's no hunters in that workplace like it doesn't come up no one's there like all it's so weird that what you do you know it's not it's not like that even though it's a part of my family's heritage like like my grandfather he'd go out trappin my uncles would go try and my dad would do a bit of hunting not bow hunting it was different you know it's and alls almost like it wasn't even called hunting back then that's what I always think about our ancestors like hunting's like almost like a modern word that we made up yeah because it would have just been something they do it was just been normal we're hunting but everybody does exactly when you wash your clothes do you call yourself a clothes washer pull this thing in front of you yeah it's like if you wash your clothes wash no fuck no one washes clothes unless you're a dirty prick you know everyone does that because people know that I hunt like people will find me like like if there's a guy like somewhere and you know like he wants to meet me somewhere it's like the first thing that comes up almost exclude like instantly we know each other yeah dude you bowhunt yeah where do you go I was like oh you know we go to New Mexico every year how cool none your fucking business yeah you and John Dudley had that talk about public spots and you're like cuz I agree it's not yours like you don't own it like everyone owns public land yeah but I'll take this story back up for John but um to share that spot is not the done thing because it's like everyone should put their own in a sense to go find a spot yeah they go for the spot yeah and even if you're happy to share a spot cuz I go to a lot of different spots and social media asked me to tell these spots and I never do because that spot could be someone else's paradise that they're fuckin spent ten years to find right then you give that information out to the masses so don't fucking ask you know that's the thing yeah that's the thing right it's like even though these spices are beautiful and everybody owns them the last thing you want is what's happening right now in Joshua Tree right well that's one thing I really like about what you do - you always make videos of these trash that you pick up you could bring a bag with you and your well I started the things I brought a bunch of gear with me and I'm fortunate I've got really good sponsors and they send me a bunch of gear as well so I could do the trip over here without bringing everything and I was walking around New Mexico actually and I was looking at all the trash sitting around and I was like fuck it I'm gonna give away all my equipment for this trip virtually all my main hunting gear backpack buh friggin Yeti cool whatever you know and for anyone that tags me and an image of them picking up trash and I'm not going to say the the description of it now cuz it's pretty much ended I've given the bow away and all the gear and because these hunters are doing that anyway but I just thought I'd really drive at home you know and thousands and thousands of people tagged me and them collecting rubbish out in public lands or wherever you know those people that were posting me they'll picking it up on the beach right here in LA you know collecting rubbish so it was because it's disheartening when you've got that connection to the wild you see that you know like fuck that doesn't belong here you know those loans those balloons that float away yeah holy Sh they need to ban them fucking things because they drop don't where someone walks out they let them go then they end up somewhere it's usually on the mountain you know the mountain ends up catching up you know yeah yeah it just doesn't belong there I was out in the trail yesterday with my dog and this came across this Bud Light can and I just stopped and just staring at this candy on the ground I wanted to find the guy who did it and shove it down his fucking throat what person does why would you see this yeah I always think of that and like who would do that this is such a beautiful place and just be like suck it leave it behind I see it everywhere like because a lot of people like I want to apologize on behalf of America I'm like fuck that's not America that's everywhere that's people everywhere but there are certain places that people that there's different people New Zealand's one of them so New Zealand has like hundreds and hundreds of public land cabins yeah like No Fee pretty much nothing but if there is a fear it's like five bucks and you can hike in or drive to these cabins and you stay in there and they've got mattresses in them they got beds they've got the fire woods cut for you it's left there by the hunters or outdoors people before you and they're in pristine condition and there's a gas book - yeah yes you're signing that a guestbook if that was in Australia if that was in America would be so fucking vandalized it's not funny but New Zealand's got a certain type of people that go into the out the bush the mountains and there's a certain respect that comes with it and maybe it's from Maori culture or something like that and that goes with it where where that just doesn't happen the person that's there before you cleans it out they sweep it out they clean it they leave a bit of tin food there or whatever they cut a new firewood they stack it where it can stay dry you know things like that and that's it and and it's something that goes about saying with me and my people how we sort of do that's how we are respectful the land but there's so many people that aren't that's a beautiful thing if you find a community like that that everybody agrees to respect that area everybody agrees to do that and take care of things I mean if you can really come across something like that like we're you talking about New Zealand there's a just a great feeling of community that can hardly there's a there seems to be a tight hunting community in America as well where obviously none of that thing would happen but there's so many people that go way out into the outdoors that they belong there so I don't want to say they don't belong there but the truth is as soon as you litter or something you don't fucking belong there all right yeah fucking trash you know yeah yeah it's just it's so unfortunate it's unfortunate that people do think like that they think so selfishly they just throw a water bottle on the ground yeah they're yeah no one's gonna notice it's out here in the wilderness that's what it is it's that so so self-centered that it's like no one or nothing else matters you know there's so much of that so much of that things get worse once people doing a poor job of raising people hmm you know they're not paying attention yeah you know they're raising shitty humans yeah I want to fight it like I've constantly been fighting it and that's why I have a social the social media and stuff to keep promoting the outdoors and good things in life and things like that but another part of me is like and I nearly did it last year just like fuck I want to go off the grid like like really off the grid so solar-powered you know a couple of thousand acres of my own stuff like that and just because Kim pretty much only hates game meat now as well like that's how we've gone so we just want to gain meat it's like the next step would be having our own chickens collecting our own eggs growing our own vegetables like living off the land you know do you want to have like a phone out fuck nine so how long would you live out there for forever forever and ever and ever yeah how am I gonna get in touch with you fucking I'll ever find out your number and I think I just felt like cutting it all out you know like fucking cutting bills out cutting all that shit out cutting contact yeah yeah I get that do you still run your company to a degree I've got really good people that run fortunately my business partner she's an indigenous woman in that area she just passed away a couple of weeks ago I'm sorry yeah which is pretty sad but I'll have you know no she's uh she's my stepmother so long home yeah so it's my dad's partner and so the indigenous then like they don't really live to a long age they're just that they're sort of they're unhealthy in a sense because they're so not used to our process you know refined foods and things like that and because you know indigenous how old's Australia it's only a couple hundred years old right and so you know to get the sixty it seems like it's a freaking miracle for him so I'm not sure how old she was but she wasn't very old and so unfortunately she passed away she was on a dialysis machine and her heart was really struggling to end up giving out but um sorry where was I where was I go on you know you just you were just talking about being off the grid and whether or not you still run your company yeah so I've got really good people that run the business for me and everything's done by emails and phone calls and I hardly do any of that anymore I've got my hear from them once a month if need be but I'd even look at sell on the I'd probably look at sell on the business especially after this has happened after she's done yeah yeah probably sell on the business but it just depends her son her son's gonna take over her partnership you know the joint venture with her and stuff like that which would be really good for him and still you know allowing income into the family and things like that so so we'll just see where it goes but yeah I was really thinking about going off the grid and just like I've always wanted to be like that I thought you know I just I love that lifestyle time seems to go a lot slower when you're out in the woods yeah first out if you're doing is I thought you didn't want to do you know I like being in contact with the world though I like that it's like I do appreciate off-the-grid times but for me I like them as like vacations yeah but I like being in contact I want to know what's happening with the world I like I like being I like being aware of cultural change I like being it means also be caught up because of what I do for a living is obvious yeah I sort of don't I don't care for it like we don't watch the news at home we don't tune into anything like that we just sort of live our life and it's like what affects us unless it's affecting the greater community in a sense for the worse you know because the country is run by fucking clowns that's how I feel your country as well yeah what's worse they stir these fucks are too busy trying to look good in Parliament and argue with each other to get anything actually done you know like what are the big issues in Australia I don't know because I don't tune into it anymore well you guys have crazy immigration laws you don't let anybody go over there it's like people who think that the United States is rough with this whole wall thing oh yeah Australia takes that to a whole new level this shit people to an island Yeah right it's a fucking nice Island is it yeah well think about what you guys are I mean you guys replaced the the British side all their prisoners to a better place exactly I did all the security fencing around some of the detention centers so you've pretty much you're on that island you know and then you get shipped to like the hottest most fucking arid part of Australia like it's deaf and I did the fencing around there and then I believe they're there for so long and then they can you know they either get shipped back home or they can go out to the broader community in Australia which they get treated very well obviously so is it just an assessment please like were they trying to find out criminal violent yeah I think that's that's the important thing you know that's why you can't just have open borders you know some terrorist comes in right some guy that thinks fucking rapes fine some guy that thinks you know crazy shits fine you know assess those people and we can send them off all yeah but the if you did that in the most arid part of America people would be so angry because people start dying well people are angry in Australia as well I think and stuff like that what are you supposed to do it so technically you know it's a very it's a hard situation yeah it's not something that's just like no just let him through no fuck no and not like just don't let them through right now it's that middle ground again you know let's assess them let's work it out because I always think what if I was in their shoes you know I've got Kim and the kids or whatever and now we're in a country that's war fucking streak and I'd be trying to get the fuck out of there too you know no matter what it took yeah you know well not no matter what it took but but you know of course yeah I mean I always say that about people that are talking about people sneaking over this country I'm like this country is made out of immigrants yeah it's an immigrant country yeah and what do you expect when you go good Oh fucking countries immigrant yes yeah I mean that is that's like people in LA saying they don't want anybody moving to LA yeah bitch where you from look at this dryer like where if you're fucking why you're an import right and by the way if you are one of the original people that came here I mean the one of the original European settlers you're probably a fucking slave on yeah yeah your grandparents were slave owners like if you if you didn't come over here as a recent immigrant like I'm third generation my grandparents came over here from Europe if they didn't then if they were here for 10-15 generations they're probably fucking so I actually I never feel a real good connect with anywhere I go including my home Australia because I'm not indigenous you know it's like weird and so I've always looked at because you know I don't worry about fucking flags or borders or anything like that I've just always looked at the world the world home well specially so much time with unions people in Australia yeah cuz it work and not you know like I no disrespect to any flag I love the flag and I love what they stand for but it's only someone's design a board is only something that someone's put on the map yeah you know it's it's like a real weird thing like that it is a weird thing but also you want to protect people from people that come from it's unless the whole world was the same unless everybody whole world was on the same level you know we're not going to do this we're not gonna do that this is illegal this is fine let's the whole world was like that then borders be easy to cross well that's actually what Amon cares we've been talking about this a lot but America is essentially like Europe but everybody who speaks the same language but you can go any country mmm like New Mexico is fucking way different than Miami yeah right Miami is way different than la la is way different than Seattle those are all almost like completely different plates oddly but they're all you could go to him I mean ideally that's where it would be it would be you could travel anywhere where the opportunity was we thought you can get a good job and you want to better yourself your family you'd have an opportunity yeah the fact that currency and life values are different for starters you know he's you know why that can't happen yeah yeah it'd be nice well be nice it would be nice if one day the whole world rises up and you know when you look at the Western world whether it's Europe or the United States and places where things are going really well or Asia it would be nice if the whole planet was like that if there was no third world if everything was fantastic if everything was just basically just like we're talking about here hey you can live in Phoenix or you can live in Billings Montana or you could live in Massachusetts whoever the fuck you want that's what we have here we have a real unique thing in this country and that's why people want to come in yeah it's fucking good pretty dope I hear a lot of because you always hear the negative things and I hear a lot of people ragging on America in their own country and stuff like that you know this is fuck these fucking America is brilliant Australia is brilliant these countries are all so fucking lucky to be here yeah you know because you look at other parts of the world you're like fuck yeah I can't feed their baby yeah do you not I mean yeah like yeah yeah I think Africa like always frettin my kids and it's not a threat because they love it but I always say I'm fucking taking the Africa because I have a long ago when I went to Africa like I was watching little babies in a village crawl around in like three four inches of dust you know every second person you met had fucking war scars on their face you know in Mozambique and Zimbabwe and you're driving down there's a roadblock there's dudes with fucking ak-47s at a duct tape together there's a guy on the side of the road with a fucking bazooka or a rocket launcher you don't know if their friend or foe you know and this is just not at normal everyday life going for Africa there's a tourist bus on the side of the road it's fucking burnout and there's just bullet holes sprayed through a line of the windows you know and shit like that and it's like fuck this isn't Australia this is an America like this is different and and sometimes and my kids that they're grateful but they're on a different tune than me you know and I'm just like fuck they need a trip to Africa and they can see not that I'm trying to expose someone else's life so my kids realize like but just so they can feel you know like you've got a good you know you've got a good life you like appreciate it like it can be a lot harder it's hard to appreciate right it's like we were talking about going into the bush if you go into the bush for seven days then you come out you appreciate hot water they appreciate sunshine if you've been out in the rain but it's hard for people to appreciate it without actually experiencing it because you can only conceptualize it so much in your head unless you're actually there it doesn't do it no does it you know and that's virtually at reality's never gonna touch on that AVU no no no it's gonna turn us into this some weird spongy looking fucking soft jelly bag yeah exactly yeah I'm worried I'm really worried about the future but I guess that's just what happens and because it seems like look what my old Nana and Papa Devine saying the same thing about our generation now well we are soft as fuck in comparison and chimps right our ancient ancient ancestors were something like chimps they're probably looking at us now look at these pussies with their shoes they need houses can't even sleep in a tree fucking dummies you know I mean like they totally but we don't want to live like that either you know maybe the matrix would be so beautiful like this Adam green run a fucking gun that doesn't work if I'm hunting and it's raining I always what gets me out there and continues me to hunt neurones I'm like it's fucking water like I have a shower every night when I'm at home I get the dry off afterwards yeah I'm like have you ever seen animals in the rain like an animal would be like feeding and it's sunshine just feeding and it will start pissing down raining it just keeps feeding yeah it doesn't even fucking like what it's just fucking life you know that's life and always think I'm just an animal like what's the difference I'll get hypothermia and die well yeah gore-tex you're fine then it's like but even if you don't it's like fuck whatever you just wear just water well the technology today like what they figured out for outdoor gear so good you where you don't merino wool which even when it gets wet keeps your body warmth in this the the water protection yes this gear so good there's so many different companies to make outstanding stuff now you can be fine in the rain exactly yeah yeah and yeah I just think we just cake it and so removed like as soon as it rains like everyone runs to the car run about a year here they don't even know how to drive yeah oh my god a little bit of drizzle it was like yeah and then accidents everywhere people don't know they don't realize it gets slippery you dumb fuck change your driving fucking la has been it's so goofy it's nearly upsetting because I'm like people have to do this every day to go to work on traffic some people's lives like what the why the fuck would you do that like but people they fucking caught up in the whole system if you drive out to like like you go up to five and head towards like Palmdale or Bakersfield or any place out there and you see traffic at like 6 o'clock in the morning bumper-to-bumper just reaches all people making it to LA so they drive an hour all the way out to Palmdale our 15 our 20 because the rent is cheaper and then they make their way or home that their law yeah their life every day's three hours plus of driving in the car Orange County people that live in Orange County that place is fucking dense correct dent it's beautiful out there it's a great great place to live but god damn if you have to go anywhere like if you have to drive to Hollywood every day good fucking luck keep sanity that there's probably a clock right now listening to us I 5 reopens in the grapevine after what is this snow last month snowed like this is the power you're saying like Palmdale area this is it was snow in a Palmdale just shut everything down someone's got a goal in their ayman towards that goal and they're doing a job to get that goal then fucking good on them but other than that if you're doing this for a fucking dead-end job vehicles just sitting on the highway covered in snow yeah that's what you want a four-wheel-drive truck with some good fucking knobby tires no that's what you ring up and sound not coming yeah that damn yeah yeah I feel sorry sorry for anyone that's caught up with that it's so rare that it snows out there too no one knows what the fuck to do when it snows I grew up in Boston and in the snow I had to drive every day in the snow because I delivered newspapers that was my job from time I was like 17 till I was 22 ish somewhere around there maybe the last time I stopped 22:23 I got up every fucking morning so taught me two things one it taught me discipline because I had to be up at five o'clock in the morning no matter what even earlier on Sunday because it was a big thick Sunday papers you had to make multiple trips I even had a van I bought a cargo van just to deliver newspapers in some shitty cargo van I forgot to change the oil and just seasoning put it to the guy I go what's wrong he's like you didn't have any oil and I'm like fuck not good with cars no everyday man so if I'm in this note today I'm and I feel my ass and kick out I'm like whoa hey I know what to do yeah yeah you don't panic I don't slam on the brakes like I drove a lot and snow did you remember having like a set goal at that point doing that job no I just wanted to not work yeah and nobody could tell me what to do when I was in my car because I like the thing about it is I had a job this was my task I had hundreds of houses that I delivered newspapers to but I didn't have anybody with me while I was doing it while I was doing it nobody's telling me what to do no one's yelling at me I'd listen to you know on the radio listen to a talk radio and this was some music think about jokes and shit and just throw newspapers out the window yeah it was nice yeah it is I was nice did not have someone that it was better for me I would way rather work seven days a week and it was only a few days a few hours a day so even though it was every single day it was only like three hours a day you know I was done by 8:00 and I'd go back to sleep now you got the biggest fucking podcast mm it's crazy I saw I've been self-employed since I was 21 really yeah yeah and I had a big media company reached out to me not so long ago and the biggest thing that turned me off because the pricing and everything was right was I'm like I fucking can't take orders I can take orders podcast types yeah pretty much own a lot of my content and unfortunately a part of that would have been changing some of the companies that I'm with and and like I'm friends with the companies I'm with I'm with those companies because they're what I want to eat like hunting companies yeah yeah and but the thought of happened to be on someone else's timeline then mm-hmm like I was like I fucking don't want to do that I can like right now I'm just doing me and whatever happens happens and it's like your situation you know yeah if I even had a guy that I had to check in with once a month yes a so upward trend fucking phone call yeah and I'm such a spur-of-the-moment guy yeah like this hunt come up on going there right I want to do this with the kids or keep the family on Duke Ellington doing it I really like that so relaxing dude to be like that and that's why I built the business that I've got to where it is as well where I don't have to be at work continually how often you putting out your podcast right now I've put a hold on it since this trip because it's just been so even though this truth would have been epic to do it on I just I just haven't done it because I'm everything's like so fast forward it's insane plus you have the kids with you that's out exactly yeah yeah but as soon as I get back home which is like middle of February after the Western Expo then I'm gonna start pumping it again I love doing exponents yeah yeah yeah a lot of people's that what is that sorry I think it's like 15 16 17 for February maybe you should get along I've been there before Oh February 14th February 14th the seven is Western Expo in Salt Lake City Utah dad it's free but daddy's not free on the 14th of the Valentine's Day yeah pick your battles you got to know what to do like I make sure that I take plenty of family vacations around hunting trips yeah totally we just went over to the Big Island didn't you um no we went to Maui I did yeah oh we did that for New Year's yeah yeah I decided to stop working on New Year's yes right now I can't really work anyway like legitimately for a couple months because I don't have enough material because I just did a Netflix special and I want to make sure I don't want anybody come and see me and I'm half-ass oh yeah you know so if I'm doing sets around LA like right now I could rock it for 20 minutes or a half hour that's easy I mean that's not easy but it's it's doable it's legit I don't feel like I'm a fraud like if I do a half hour show that's a real half hour show but it's not a real hour show there's a big day because our show like in a theatre or an arena I really need an hour and 20 because I know I got to make sure everything's good it's just there's a giant responsibility you don't want to leave anybody people get babysitters and they they take time out of the day I gotta be prepared so I work hard at it so I was thinking about New Year's and when it came they were trying to set up New Year's gigs for me and I'm like not only am I not ready I don't think I want to do it because it seems like such a big event like New Year's is like it's I can't believe it we're celebrating it's like Vegas on crack yeah you know it's like the whole thing is just ramped up so far past normal show show I would say we were out in the desert we just make him and the kids on New Year's and to everything else just fucking turns like normal but to the human race it's like because it's written on a calendar it's like this big deal you know yeah and it is cool but fuck New Year's seems like such a good time just to chill for me yeah it was a good time to chill yeah we went to the you know we were staying at a resort and Maui and was beautiful and the food was great and it was big the beach was great just fucking just chill yeah I need more of that my life I need more chill time just everything I'm just doing so many different things like I have to balance it out with your nothing's yeah there's because when I'm go go go sometimes I'm just like fuck I just want to sit on the couch and I feel lazy as fuck on my dogs I'm so used to go on but that's sitting on the couch and watching a movie and just chilling it's like you retire holy shit yeah you recharge yep it totally is and it makes you hungry to go go go again yeah sometimes I need that I need that for that took me a while to figure that out with stand-up - so like sometimes I need to take little breaks just to recharge my imagination recharge my enthusiasm for it there's a balance in life like you can't work out five hours a day every day you back your body totally you need breaks and I think you need breaks with your imagination you need breaks with enthusiasm with everything yeah let them on reset yeah yeah so so what are you doing while you're in LA like how long you gonna be here for we just like how we did Disney with the kids and just chilled out we're leaving tomorrow heading back to Utah Salt Lake City we ran you up there pretty much getting organized to go back home so I'm gonna drop the I've got that Winnebago trailer I'm gonna drop off there and I visit declutter yeah I'm gonna go visit Hoyt yeah yeah I'm gonna send out a bunch of this shit that I said I'd give away and stuff like that then we're going back to Utah Utah has been our base pretty much some friends are up Utah gonna go back to Utah and pack up a bunch of stuff and then I got a bison hunt that I'm going to do that's the last hunt while I'm in America and then down to the west and x-bow we've got a like West screen and one of the movies that I did there I did a movie over in New Zealand and the boys from bow hunt down under in Australia filmed it for me and they did a fucking awesome job well the one you guys did with cam the underarmor one was fantastic they finally do then what fucking movie is because you know they want to cut it cut it down to 20 minutes I made that one pretty long it was 20-some minutes but um because men can add like two weeks together fucking running around going while that's awesome and there's so much that they can't show in that twenty minutes of course you know and like some really cool shit but um I'm hoping to get cam out again this year I've got those two Buffalo hunts lined up and yeah you need to come out too which would be fucking horse this whole the city out this whole trip I've been no know what I've been doing in America I've been collecting fucking spiders and snakes and shit like that and I was gonna let them all fucking go in the studio dude I was gonna let them all go in the studio I'm like fuck you'll never have me on again if I do that but I was gonna bring one in here with me to show me just fucking now I was just gonna let it out halfway through this I didn't say if you could carry on I had it all fucking lined up and then I got changed because I had to go to Arizona I didn't get go back to Idaho tapes it was fucking amazing that's Idaho might be like the undiscovered gem like the gem in this country there's fucking no one there there's no one there's no one but Boise is fantastic yeah fucking love that city I had a great time there man it's beautiful and the mountains out there so glad it is it's a pretty place so our friends are basic so every time we fly in every year when we fly and I usually fly in the Idaho first right up high near Spokane like near Washington and then we end up driving from there to southern Colorado southern Colorado New Mexico New Mexico back to southern Colorado cuz came out of Hamelin tag stealing's you end up tagging a problem on then this is how much shit I fucking done on this trip I can't I had to get Kim the fucking write it down because I'm like where have we been it's been hectic and I think I've been to Idaho like four or five times in this trip like back and forth back and forth Wow you ever go to Coeur d'Alene yep yeah haven't been my friends near Coeur d'Alene it's beautiful water is so clear you can see like a hundred feet down there it's a fucking nice spot I gotta bring up this message and read it out that's yeah it's been crazy yeah so we end up we flew in the Idaho and we went to southern Colorado then we went to New Mexico back to southern Colorado back up to Idaho and then I end up flying now now we end up driving the Eastern Oregon hump bull elk then I end up flying out to Arizona to hunt elk as well on the Navajo Reservation which was really cool then we then I flew to BC hundred moose then I flew back then we went to Kentucky I drove all the way to Kentucky with the kids which took like four or five days fucking insane we took our time all sort of checking it out you know where there's nothing where where there's absolutely nothing well Nebraska dude holy fuck we drove for hours and hours through Nebraska and like seen nothing but like cornfield or something like that sorry anyone from Nebraska but Nebraska was born people under Brassica right now oh my gosh did you know I'm sure there's some pretty places yeah I don't think so they know about it yeah that's right yeah wasn't that what was it oh what Kansas was Dorothy where's it evolved yeah then we went to Texas we drive down to Texas how long you guys been here four plus months your kids are holding up remarkably well yeah they awesome yeah yeah least in front of you there's been some good arguments on the way but I'm J pretty good I'm like fuck they like even locked in a trailer or locked in the car or we're in like a air B&B or something like that and they're all gathered together and and it's not until you're around other people's kids that you realize how good your own kids are like that's because I'm always like they're naughty you know and then that you're an occasion like fuck how kids a saint Santa Claus yeah you're ugly haughty but yeah then we went from Texas to Utah hung at Utah for a wall then I drove back to Colorado come back to Utah again what's ironic is that you as an Australian and your family as Australians are getting to see more of America most Americans ever do I sound like fucking get out there and do it get out there and do it out there in just a beautiful place we live in yeah I think some people don't have the means to yeah you know like and that's why people are driving for this fuck traffic every day to try and make the means to do that you know yeah yeah that's a grind out there fuckers yeah it's a grind yeah the traffic does my fuckin head in concrete does my head in math people do my head in like I'm walking around eating you like fuck yeah but isn't it fun to do like every now and again it is yeah to go to New York City every now and again yes go Jesus fuck that's the trickiest trip in all of this fucking wild ass country I think I know the reason why hunters get so much flak from a lot of people is because they are stuck in that they don't know the other end of things yeah you know they don't know the wilderness side of things because they're fucking jammed in there I always think like that's why I love promoting it as well so much like people don't even know about this they don't know to exist they don't even know this is something you can do they don't know the rewards from them also they feel morally detached from the food that they're eating like they don't feel like an obligation to their food they don't feel like they don't mean it's just a steak yeah there's no there's no connection and because of that they don't feel like they did anything wrong nah that's wrong whereas you know if you shoot a fawn and you know and you could like oh you shot a baby yeah you know what do you think your veal is stupid what do you think lamb ASA the rack of lamb yeah you ordered a baby that's a baby rat lamb is a baby sheep you fuck but most people that's weird I don't so I don't hate on a cuz I understand it like that the population of the world demands a yes but if someone hates on me for it then you've got a pointer there I'm still not hating on ya I'm just pointing it out oi you're doing the same thing but someone else is doing it for you yeah it's out of ignorance yeah yeah and even if you're a vegan or a vegetarian you know that still kills animals like have a look at the cleared land to be a vegan they need the clear land you know so it's like that's a whole middle ground again Jannik form yourself if everyone went vegan we'd fucking have to clear mass amount of land kill mass amounts of animals and everything like that do you not I mean well then if they're on went hunters then fucking would slaughter the fuck out of so much wildlife it's not funny well on top of that you wouldn't be able to just let those animals loose like you'd let all the cows loose you know all slamming in the fucking cars on the street you just devastating yeah like you know ground that can't be trampled on exactly yeah but it's that middle ground yeah some vegans and vegetarians are good you know some hunters and that are good and then there's that middle ground which is all the normal cunts you know that just understand like I've got a mate it's not actually damaging you know I can eat some vegetables that's not damaging like it's just everything in its place ya know I think your perspective is very healthy that it's good to have these extreme animal rights activist because it balances everything yeah we need balance yeah yeah yeah I agree just don't fucking mouth off of me about it don't mouth off why this cunts and so much better with an Australian accent cuz this is so normal in Australia just like normal yeah yeah normal so at our friends seem so whole which he put up a post and was about some politicians yeah there you go beautiful he makes an awesome shirt publicly and I know that's it but I don't know oh yeah boy so he put this post up and it's about this politician that you know he he goes you know it's a pretty decent fucking riding that he's done up about you know how the guys not doing his job and stuff like that and they're gonna take this public what land away from us or close it and and I'm in the comments on like so basically what you're saying is either cunt like we can get there a lot quicker this dude's a cunt doing these jobs and fuck some people took offense to it you know my advice and finding is like either destroying it's a prison but here it's like you're Satan oh yeah you know it's like saying I'm not even gonna say it okay yes it's a bad word it's a bad word yeah it's not like over there it's like a gentle it's like fucker hey Jamie if Jamie walked in here hey fucker yeah if you said that to me I'd be like hey what's up normal there's four things you can't do you can't say anything bad about whitetail hunting can't say anything bad about fucking Jesus you can't say the word cunt and I can't mean what the fourth one wasn't about the American flag like fucking done yeah all right dude we just did three hours again Wow just flew by well it's cuz it always does Brady coffee its coffee this rooms rooms in goddamn time fuck I wanted Kanye to be in here at the same time so he can gang up and even talk him into bowhunting we
