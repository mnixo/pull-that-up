the gyro can experience yeah that's amazing man know when you go and you do these these Mexico trips do you do you have like someone who guides you and keeps you safe like how do you cuz I thought we had Anthony Bourdain on he said one of the things you got to get a local guy when you go to these crazy spots you get a local guy who's like you know a handler and that guy takes care of everything anytime you pay him you guys do that yeah yeah yeah you definitely have to have local guys I don't believe in security or definitely not like you know for sure not like Western bodyguards or like pilgrims or any of those obvious visible big guys walking into the resin shit that's just stupid cuz they're just gonna attract attention what the fuck is going on here let's get them you know but definitely you need local fixtures in Mexico we have 34 offices around the world so we have our own guys local guys pretty much everywhere and then you have like local fixers who you know know the terrain know the language know you know what's going on and you know how to get you out of shit and you guys started this you were doing a magazine called voice yeah and then you took it over and took the out and just called advice yeah was it was called voice of Montreal and it was a it was sort of a welfare project in Canada run by Haitians and they were doing a Black History Month thing and that they figured they could get more money out of the government by doing an English language cultural publication and so we were all working there I wanted to be a writer so I was like I finally got a job and meanwhile Quebec was trying to separate from the rest of Canada so like english-language publications became illegal so they you know no audience and so anyway eventually they couldn't pay us our wages and stuff so we said ok well we own it now so we dropped the oh and just called advice and like it was like what a great name how do you think what a fuckin hey how do you think of that more like we just dropped the OH you know and it's a perfect story yeah and then we moved to the States and then we then we start expanding now in 34 countries where you guys based out of your based out of New York New York and London are two are two of them were our biggest office next year in China and how long you been doing this sixteen years holy shit yeah oh man god damn now it's music it's you even have a clothing line in everything now it's a record label and films and TV and AG and online and all our different verticals and events and and was this a plan from the very beginning to branch off in all these different directions it just sort of naturally happened yeah no there was we never had a business plan we never knew anything we never thought about it really what happened was you know we wanted the outlawed English basically in Quebec so we we went national in Canada we're the biggest magazine in Canada but that was like being the biggest magazine in reykjavik or something we're the number one podcasting camera really I love Canada I'm gonna swear I'm gonna move shit gets bad yeah well we came real close in 2004 I was looking at space in Vancouver really yeah I was thinking about that I wouldn't I wouldn't go to you got to go to the because it's gonna get real bad you got to get to like one there's north of where I grew up in Ottawa there's like a million lakes you can just buy a lake for like a hundred bucks you got to buy a lake and you know build a cabin on the lake because when she gets bad you go to get far away from the cities when shit gets that bad though you might want to just die yeah you want to live like in Liberia you know I don't want to I don't want to no one I'd rather take a bullet you know I'd rather take a bullet than live like that a stump odn Flintstone yeah I don't think he can bro yeah you can I think that's wrong so you so you guys started now how did you get started from going from a magazine to these incredible in-depth on scene investigative pieces that you're doing well what was the first one heavy metal in Baghdad so we for about a decade we were kind of a style mag so we were really just interested in cocaine and supermodels and these jeans are weird and we had it was because it was fun it was a lot of fun and we were kids and and and then when we started expanding around the world we're like you know and and we'd ride about it and people like I've never heard about that it's crazy so that happened as well as the sort of failure of mainstream media during you know the Iraq war with everyone saying like weapons of mass destruction just lying and they knew that there was no weapons of mass destruction all this shit and so we did a thing where we went to we snuck into Iraq and we went to hang out with the only heavy metal band in Baghdad across the coda and it was supposed to be like a seven-minute piece it was the first piece we launched the BBS with and you know eventually we shot them over three years and we turned into a feature film that won Critics Choice in Toronto and won Best Documentary and Berlin Film Festival like it got picked up by the BBC by cannot play this well you know friend Eddy raves about it any problem raves about that movie and so everyone's like you know oh that's like news you know we're like what we're following a band but you saw the whole thing unfold like how everything was fucked up shit and people could relate to it because like oh I'm in a band and then their band gets their practice-based gets bombed by a scud missile and you know they they they're gonna be killed because they were like Iron Maiden t-shirts or like they head bang which is seen as Jewish so therefore they'll cut your head off and shit and so that was the first thing and it was so successful that and we loved doing it that we started saying well why don't we the whole everyone's like what's your been your demo and what's your business plan all the shit we're just like we have none all we do is stories that we like so if there's a story like general butt naked in the 2pac army that's the fucking jaw drop or we're gonna go shoot that you know and so we started shooting it and people were like I've never heard anything like this what the fuck and so more and more and more people started watching and and and we started doing it more and more you're a fucking human being
