I'm mad about yeah well that will never get repeated in Comcast history well we fucked that up we thought we were recording we were saying how Bert is the only person we know who's both funny and a great promoter like usually you get one or the other you get someone who's really funny but we're talking about Bert's we saw all this is dream record with so much better video is being recorded oh I'm just that video so I can leave that in the mp3 or breaking download that everybody the audio we're gonna stop now we're gonna double rapido sauce so a bunch of people birdies to have a show called Bert hurt Bert and that one disturbed me the most because I remember this one at all Bert he would do a bunch of stupid shit and get injured but he's really getting hurt he's dude you just see with some kid and some red belt kid who's with Elson girl Horry and Gracie really that when he was that young he really reminds me that frat guy yeah but he was I can't really see it now but this is him like four years removed from that this guy keeps arm bar enemy hasn't know what to do here kids 108 pounds I think part of it he's also going along with it enjoying he's got to take the offensive fuck that wow this kid I'll never see it he's played duck twice possum twice right a video that I showed you that Bridget fantasy showed me it's a video of this guy who's on a school bus and it just it start to the bus driver rolling it all kid off the school bus screaming at them and then a bunch of people like what the fuck are you doing man he's a back onto the bus the bus driver gets back on the bus and then they check are you okay and they realize this little kid with like a lunchbox and everything that actually a grown midget and he's pretending that he's a little kid hanging out with these little kids and the bus driver found it through the look at everybody's faith with like when they say wait he's not a kid and they're all yeah oh I was mad I'm Steph you lunch box he throws out his lunch box and he grabs them throws them yeah it's crazy cuz he's got a little bit way to beat his ass beat the bus drivers ass they saw him chuck off of little kids five year olds body people raised his karma cops and then they get to him to see hey you okay now watch this they go that's a grown-ass man that dude was pretending to be everybody's confused look how confused I was bad before I don't know what to think now that's crazy they thought okay there's a David Blaine that's crazy why did we bring that up why were we talking about that that's a great question that's nothing to do it's nothing to do with burp I don't know what that was it's what I did no no no a kid the kid was beating up Burton jiu-jitsu I don't remember member yeah this is not sober November November November I definitely don't remember what the fuck we're talking about dude you're uh you're on an iPhone now tell me what that's been like okay it's been pretty interesting yeah so I've set myself in October to see if I could pluck and do it again you told me about that app that's on the thing mm-hmm limits your screen time there what's your screen time yeah another for your kids yeah yeah that's what I was looking for like five six years ago there was nothing we just give you alarms and you can lose enough yeah yeah you know it's sort of like remember when we had to do those 15 yoga classes uh-huh you had to do it so because you had to do it you just fucking knew you were gonna do it the wishy-washy Ness was gone of what the wish you watch this I don't have to do this I could back off or just I'm kind of tired anyway let me take the day off that shit was gone you couldn't do that yeah that's sort of the same thing with that app because you could always say I'm not gonna use my phone much fuck that mean dude I'm an observer of the other people our phones everyone who says that is on all the time yeah it's so easy to be on and you could with me I found myself just reading Google news stories for no reason just looking and a lot of them aren't even like an interesting it's like oh this car sold for this much money or oh you know just like yeah wasting time wasting time hungry bored I'm lying to myself because I'm always thinking that I'm gonna hope but there's material in this I'm gonna find a story that's really funny yeah but you those kinda you find out anyway you know I'm saying like you people who are forced out you really good ones like that guy getting thrown off the bus yeah the way that thing would have got you you know years before the internet ass the horse want God to us well the internet was around but it was years before social media what was a joke I went haha no special what yeah why Tommy central said it was too rough it's pretty rough oh you just house it the early days of the internet were like this yeah yeah well it was a true story - yeah I did have a friend of mine that I go back and forth with he was so fucking he was one of those dudes that just knows everything that's fucked up like he can find all the video the Budd Dwyer video you know he was one of those guys and he would send me this videos like batters up and I would like batter up but the fucking says I opened up the email and it's that porn star with a baseball bat up her ass belladonna yes it was her I was like Jesus Christ and then you know and then it we would go back and forth I would send him something fucked up he would send me something fucked up the baseball bat was surprising it's bad know we're batter up I was like what is this I'm like oh my god girls asshole must be a wreck dude interesting fact about belladonna that first storytelling show we ever did at The Improv 12 people were there and she was one of them oh wow well she used to go to the Comedy Store no she was cool yeah yeah it was crazy they offered me some gaping porn they had some DVDs they were giving them away I'm like I'm good man thanks guys like why didn't you take it I was like hey man it's not a disrespectful thing it's just not into your art also I'm afraid I gotta go down this line husband this hole that wouldn't like gaping porn is the weirdest shit ever because it's people want to look inside people's bodies you want to look in the hole they want the hole to be gaping yes I guess that's a style of porn beeping and why the drip out you ever see the drip out at the end like why is this still recording and they shake the clothes up you know what I'm talking about clothes they just love a John and wait for the gins to come out yeah I agree with that face yeah it's not for me I don't know why it's still on appeal like it people like weird shit right people like feet they like they like everything and some are like what's really weird is a some things that some people would hate other people love mm-hmm yeah with food too and movies and shit like that intelligent well-respected woman all right well I won't break up her name was on stage talking about how she likes taking loads in the face now she might have been saying this as a joke but it might have been true some people just like love it like some girls like that right that's why it's or was it guys like it and that's why it's a thing or girls pretend they like it so the guys do it but for some girls would be like fuck that get that away from me other people would love it that's what's weird about humans Yeah right there's so many people that are in this such weird shit I Spit on vagina once you once whatever and I'm like oh man he didn't like my vagina like I well I won't do it again Wow but a guy would get mad if a girl spit on his dick I don't think no they might be like whoa they're just shift away but maybe if you were like having a really hard time staying hard anyway because she's you know she's intimidating you you've barely hanging in there and then she spits on your day you're like hey what the hell might lose your bone what if it's like real cut yeah a full gagger right away yeah you're kissing and then she's long is the next step when you're like whoa slow down fuck down was this type of porn inevitable or like yes Larry question ever did the hustler stuff it never went through all the court cases would those Larry Flynt guys are important that they help move the needle for sure no doubt I mean that guy took a bullet for the freedom of expression whether you like porn or not we've all jerked off to it and if you say didn't you're a hypocrite I mean I'm not a liar not listening really crossed the line that was that exists yes he certainly did but my point is I think that there was a-there like they already done deep throat before hustler right wasn't deep throat when was deep throat deep throat was a porn film that people went to see like a regular film it was like a movie it was ex same time wasn't it also a nickname like a codename for someone like yes like that no no that's post that's during Watergate well that was one of the insiders in Watergate and their nickname was deep throat but that was because the movie had already been a 70 they named one of the Nixon Watergate people fun yeah yeah for sure fuckin look man those CIA people or whoever the fuck was involved with all that stuff SP FBI yeah they're there a lot of them are Bros yeah do you think one grows and that's guys like oh really because I went to someone who's running for president I program office dude I'm sure I'm sure there's some of that some of that there's there a lot of I mean they're like cops yeah like military people you know they're like a lot of them are just men guys guys men they probably watch porn yeah probably know deep throat is they you know if you're working for like one of the biggest police I mean it's essentially our police organization none of them major in English with a focus on Shakespeare FBI's law enforcement yeah yeah that's what it is they're bucks yeah not not disrespected but that's why they would probably throw a group group of women that are you know from University of Massachusetts Amherst yeah the call fuckin yarning they're definitely not gonna call deep throat yeah that would be contributing to the patriarchy Manic Panic but that movie was in 72 so Wendy hustlers start hustler was around 75 76 are you aficionado I remember Lewis collection Kevin Smith this you remember like that's it larry flynt started in Columbus the first health rights were that's right that's right my oh yes right yeah man I had to go to the hustler office once to review porn there was like an article that they were doing where you review porn it was so weird it was like the weirdest thing I forget is like early in the days the internet right like more than 20 plus me like trying to figure anything out yeah they're just trying to figure things out and try things out so you watched a porno over there I don't remember what it was I think I was reviewing magazines I was reviewing porn magazines I'm trying to think that was what it was or maybe they showed me a little of the porno they showed me the magazine I don't remember it was the same time hustler started same here the Nixon ended 74 mm-hmm versus the deep throat was 72 yeah so that's exactly where it came from you and Stanhope and stand-ups mom review boobs or something yes stand-ups mom reviewed porn on the manchild that was it yeah that's what it was Sam hopes mom would watch porn and give these fucking hilarious reviews if it was one of the best things we did it was really his mom was really funny too really she's like Hinchcliffe mom you seen hence cliffs mom dude she's his hands up mom did stand-up he wrote the bits for her and she did him she had cue cards she did it at killed Tony packed main room and fucking murdered I'm telling you dude she killed and one of them she got me with a zinger I forget what it was it was fun it was all shit that Tony wrote it was funny shit man and she did it with like authority like she hit the punch lines like he coached her Lee yeah yeah it was great it was great she had never done anything like that before I hear she murdered at her son's show and he brings her up as his mom there it is right now there's his mom okay that's it is she's amazing I'm telling you dude she fucking murdered it look at all over him dude how dare you how dare you she was really good man wow that's cool I don't play any of it because it's their stuff but people could see it what's the video killed 25 year anniversary episode 270 so was da my rare who's the best at those who don't look he's the best no one's better than DOM at those uh roast shows Hawking shit or like something like kill Tony where God does it one minute of terrible comedy and he gets the job he's just a master at dissecting people ironically have you ever seen him do is open my character oh yeah arrow is arrow razor it's something like that oh he does is so good he's so nervous if you interrupt me have to back up and start from this from the beginning like over and over again he's so good on kill Tony he should be a regular he really should every episode he should be on every episode and then whoever the guest is on top of it he's is so good he's just so good at talking shit to people when they do terrible things and do it in a way we can't even be mad at him what were you watching last night's episode of kill Tony no I didn't see it you'll have to watch it when it comes out it Ari was on yesterday Oh was it good I think you that's what I do I get standing oohs wow dude I just came out that good comics how's that work for you - they have to blur out your cock and balls I don't know it's something they should deal with I'm just there for the live show it should be they should have like a little a little like button you can put a little Ari thing that come out surrounding your cock why doesn't YouTube let me say i setting it to light on the youtubes just so if you see a cock blurred out did you see the new release that said something and maybe this is people freaking out for no reason maybe it's not skipped over words people are freaking out about some new terms that they have where they can get rid of any channel that they don't think is commercially viable is that the quote they did update their Terms of Service but I don't I haven't looked into this I'm just going off of what I think I don't know that that's like new in the terms like Facebook can delete your thing I think Twitter can do I kind of think that's kind of in all of them so they always have the ability to tell you to fuck off you can't delete your own account but they can delete yours I mean come on dude they run the fucking world run the world well Facebook they're bigger than the government Facebook's giant yeah there's a natural national don't go anywhere they're bigger than the government they're giant you know what freaked me out docker Berg on TV in China I think you speaking Mandarin I was so impressed I was like look at this fucking guy how smart is he yeah you know the same schools he went to I mean that's that's beside the point yeah yeah I what's he doing why he went to that school that can't do it you know speaking Mandarin that's hard you got if you're learning that as an adult apparently shit and he does it on a talk show and people are laughing it's really funny man so he's on this show and the guys speaking to him I think it's Mandarin what understand yeah no he they understand it tells a story to the crowd and they're laughing so he told it joke he told a joke at Chinese did he know it already he knew how to talk in Chinese from colony learned no I think I think his wife is Chinese so he learned you know either well yeah because I was out of that movie mm-hmm so I think he's he's just one of those dudes it's just a little too smart for his own good he's Ryan Facebook they're trying to fucking of course they are they definitely are but it's just that the influence that one person can have you are a kid who starts up a social network you think you're just gonna connect people that want to like say some captions from school yeah you try to start making some cash and then the next thing you know people are using it to shift democracies and then people are putting filters in there to try to control the content and then people are biased against certain political ideologies and more submissive or more permissive of others and then it becomes really weird like this a free speech so I'm like what is this is this like you decide who are you who are these people to get to decided they deciding only for money like how did you engineer this you wait a minute.you engine you didn't engineer it specifically to create conflict but it's more monetarily beneficial for you to create conflict and your algorithm is sort of conflict it's it's it's sort of gravitates towards conflict right like if you're if you engage with things a lot of people like say if it's enough if it's a topic that is a very rare time at got you a met abortion abortion if you engage with abortion threads your fucking your feed will be filled with those things oh yeah yeah and then coming back what yeah it's much comment but if here's my question if you're a person that instead engages with only positive stuff would that make your urine your I mean is it just what you're engaged yeah so I did this as a test to myself whatever on YouTube you see how much YouTube was influencing me you know with that algorithm you look at fucking one video go down a hole yeah you go down a hole Tim Poole kept coming up for fucking you know five months after that after that pockets who did and then it was like so I was like from now on for a month I'm only clicking on puppy videos mmm I'm searching puppy videos when I see one like oh viewers or if somebody's that I want to see or music something that pops up before I'm like nope not touching it only searching and clicking on YouTube buddies up or puppies sometimes it gave me dogs but it was just more and more that shit soldiers coming home when their dogs greeting them and then eventually you just start hitting me with only fucking puppy videos so that the algorithm just recognizes what you're interested in yeah so you can't blame people then no but sometimes it makes you think this way it makes you get mad about something you ever talk to someone who's like woke about something and you want to be like I don't really believe you I don't believe you're this mad about this thing like somebody made you this mad it doesn't doesn't quite make sense you know and so then it's like I think they've been influenced I think a certain way by these dumb algorithms so kind of you've on to be upset about things too one of the one of the things about like being into anything left-wing or right-wing stuff is like when you get into it it's fun yeah other people are into it's fun too when when you got action shits happen and you yelling to each other you know you go into that fucking Facebook every day what the fuck these assholes have to say about the First Amendment to do right you know you want to get work with us yeah but you proved at least on YouTube that if you just gravitated towards positive things like most of my YouTube feed is like MMA fights and pool matches I watch a lot of pool pro pool like my end muscle cars my YouTube feed is pretty it's it's pretty much what I look for I don't look for a lot shit I look to YouTube for fun only does still hit you with shit that you're like this about occasionally they'd sneak some gossipy stuff in there some celebrity stuff in there you know weird weird ones get in that don't seem to make sense yeah often why but I don't use Facebook so that's the most evil one yeah I use it in a sense that it's connected to my Instagram but I don't actually use it use it I don't get in there I don't read it I don't there's a little controversy this week that instagrams gonna take the likes away from yeah I heard about that it's gonna take the lights away to terms like viewing two minute buys you can see how many likes you got for a post have include how many views you can see it all but I can't see how many likes you got if you put up a picture and your picture got 40,000 likes I can never see that wow so they can still make their money off it but everyone else won't come to a contest of like speculation is that it's going to drive advertising dollars into giving money directly to Instagram instead of people those fucks those funds really but if you were an Instagram right and you had people making sure tons of money off your platform just by posting things hey this is my new butt cream or whatever the fuck you're selling yeah and they don't even get a piece of that they got to be like hey what are we doing we're spending a million dollars a month and fucking bandwidth probably way more than that actually and way more than that they have videos and shit till you get upload videos it's got to be millions in bandwidth for every month and then I can't know that I get it though people go there they'll get to my other ads it's dude they still monetize them but you'll be able to show like if you if you have you know if you have a screenshot of your phone do that I also think that it's gonna de incentivize people to like photos exactly because you don't see you're making a difference right who's made more money than those but doctors because of Instagram like if you look like the percentage of like uptick in revenue yeah like but doctors like guys who just specialize in jobs better its Instagram made them they put them on the map this dudes out there with but don't going drugs they're robbers do pata and that suddenly do you know there's a theory that that I think is true that women are just hotter these days because they're always on the verge of being on Instagram so even to go to the supermarket they're putting makeup on their put a nice nice clothes on they're always looking their best because they learn to a friend they might get uploaded this is a tough time to be frumpy yeah you know if you're a gal there's a lot of competition out there and there's a lot of a lot of these hoes go for it okay they don't they go for it they're pulling their panties aside and at 38 percent of their pictures you know I mean there's a lot a lot of like strong competition out there now they're changing the bar and this is by the way for sure yeah one of the reasons why prostitutions illegal why one of the reasons why prostitution is illegal it would completely flip relationships on its head if guys didn't need to have a relationship to have sex just sex and relationships were only love it so you can go know get sex from a woman for money just like get a handjob or just like you can get a massage rather you can get a handjob yeah I give you I can how can I get massage for that they can't besides your dick yeah well if they did if they could there was B so people would change what they want out of a relationship yeah it would be different you you would you do would be it would be way like any women are not saying that all women are like this but woman any woman that is sexually manipulative or like she won't she withhold sex from her man if he doesn't do certain things and goes away that goes away dude that people my friends in Bangkok I met people in Bangkok they were like they don't play those the regular women here the non-working woman right they don't play the game right because they knows I could just walk down the street right like a bodega in New York they're everywhere you just find a woman yeah so this like I'll make him wait that way it's like shut up with yeah you're interested just go for it the problem is shame for the girl that's the fucking problem if there was no shame for the girl if you didn't if no one really cared if she hooked up with you on a one-night stand it turns out she fucked your cousin a month ago no one cared that's almost gone it's almost gone yeah it is almost gone right it's changing yeah no conversations people didn't talk about this shit and we're kids you two figure it out on your own it's so casual no dude nobody taught you about jerking off nobody taught you about drinking nobody taught you what to do in a relationship those are the three most confusing fucking things you're just guessing yeah guess can I make a PSA real quick for children who are gonna start drinking your parents are never gonna teach you about alcohol use there's a thing called coasting when you have a few drinks you can switch to water if you're feeling drunk you're gonna throw up if you keep drinking like a child but you're a child right so you don't get how to do it yet you got a coast one water one beer one water what beer here's a great time don't have too many don't have if you're gonna drink and I don't advise anyone under 21 to drink cuz that's illegal but if I was gonna advise them I would say have two drinks don't have more than two two will fuck you up man okay you're sure gonna get drunk but if you're 16 years old maybe 16 to put you in a fucking a goofy mood I would say wherever you're at if you're feeling good just stop for a while top for a while it's good right there you still got more going down - the problem is you lose your inhibitions right they go out the window and then you're having fun you want to have more fun you know you got bird on the table oh he's got his butt crack you're underneath that he's porn asshole shots it's just because you can have two or three of those in four minutes and get blasted and suddenly you're like what happened your mainlining alcohol right - the old hatch one shot you feel it like like instantly like whoa you're ready to throw up you still got two more shots that haven't hit you yet whoa that's what's up you know what else is up our ship yours are given be with me at the improv tonight at 10:30 sold-out show fuckers okay great oh yeah it's gonna be good time how this shows it good Diaz is on the first show oh really yeah like fun times can I ask my specialist fuck yeah I'm finally doing my special yes you know which which theater did you choose the Skirball Center New York we talked a lot of bus I'm so glad yeah the back because tell everybody the whole jet the whole you went on a little journey there job trying to find a venue I was I was it's a lot about Judaism my upbringing you know if I couldn't do that comedy club funny be done with that shit yeah you know so that's what I've been working on for a while yeah it's been a couple of years right been a customer the longest one two and a half years hmm but it's also the first one that you did like a theme and it's essentially to what she did was like there's a lot of guys who do that I've never been to Edinburgh but that fast it is like that's how it is right oh my gosh it's like a lot of people who do theme yeah come in so you decided to do a theme but to do this theme with american-style stand-up yeah that's exactly it dude yeah yeah the fur I went two years I went with my storytelling show one year and then I was like my plan was to go show them what a fucking American hour was which is my last special just like hey here's just stand up you fucking fools trying to do some fucking hot hire thing where you're like tying it all together but they're not funny right they do like 20 minutes of unfunny mm-hmm and so I was like everybody here I'm giving you an American hour and it was just that and then the next year the plan was and it became two years later was like now I'll do one of your stupid fucking themed hours but I'm not gonna do or I'm just fucking serious for 20 minutes ridiculous how would they do they really do when I don't get it I don't get why you have to I get the theme I don't get why you have to stop being funny did you see until theaters you see Hannah Gatsby is your life because the video is off the net the net yeah I saw that was her name you didn't see I didn't see it like the people I know saw it live was like in the room they're like to him it was like pretty powerful because that shit goes a 10 Bert so people see four or five shows a day for five days in a row and she's so but her thing a lot of is not funny some of its funny but a little funny yes that was like legit powerful stuff where you're like you're caught up in the emotion about a lot of them is just forcing in and I've seen people do my storytellers sure like forcing in some like lesson or something seconds not there it's okay you just have a fun story for seeing lessons is gross yeah I always like the moth which I like them off but like they'll do the moth month is a storytelling series Mikey D did one on there about about maybe I'll get an AIDS oh I just don't know and about his aunt or something but usually it was like comics did it was just funny and then when normals did it they would like they would have something they'd be like that's not just the day I lost my watch that's the day I lost my innocence oh they just got overdramatic yeah and that's what these do in Edinboro allah some of them are really good right but that theme thing was that and i was like i want to do that better when you say american-style stand-up I almost wish I wasn't an American stand-up so I could fucking wholeheartedly agree with you it's but I wish I wasn't an actual American stand-up so I could have all that be one opinionated point in this cuz when I hear people say like America's not were the best and I'm sorry I'm like it's fine they're doing great they started behind us I'm sure a lot of you are out there in New Zealand and Florida and other countries Florida's not America some of your genius and some of your amongst the best in the world doesn't disqualify you for being amongst the best in the world but if you want to say that there's not a greater number of hilarious fucks female and male in America add weight disproportionate number you're out of your fucking mind the greatest ones are here you're out of your mind it's not even close it's not even it's there's no race yeah it's a median it's a non-starter Yeah right exactly there's a lot of great comics other places but overall they're just like behind us take us completely out of the equation take our friends out of the equation yeah this place is filled with assassins this is a wildness built up fucking rebels Wow especially now with the internet I mean you can become a legit national act with no one's help like Andrew like Schultz is doing yeah he is doing everything everything through YouTube he's selling out theaters he's murdering it you don't need anybody anymore these fucking killers like him all these assassins he's turned the corner to people talk about it and like not about draw but just about like there's material on stage yeah he's working at it so funny fuck me he's a smart dude but the thing is like these guys they're they're blossoming now there's a bunch of them man they're all over the place yeah yeah great fucking economic people get so worked up too which is also fun it's just a fun time overall he'll definitely get more mad than you ever have before but they also get happier that you're willing to push the envelope it's a little bit of danger again we talked about this can dangerous again it's great yeah you said that to me on the phone once I'll never forget that I was driving home I loved it you say the wrong thing like I think I can go a little darker and they're like nope you're done no we'll never be written off to each other exactly we're fine but that's the reason why we can kind of we have freedom that maybe people in 40 for short TV shows don't have oh yeah you don't have any freedom they don't have any freedom well not but also right they can take away a level of money we can make but like they can't take away the ability to do stand-up yeah unless every club says we won't book you or even the workout clubs won't happen you guys just still do stand-up right which is like the main thing yes yeah and you just have a few clubs it'll be like it will never gonna fucking get rid of him for anything he says but yeah and also the fans like if you did something I mean it would have to be some horrible shit real-life shit yeah you'd have to murder somebody yeah yeah do you think Oh Jay could you stand up for sure oh my god how do we make that happen we could get to charismatic I think he's friends with norm yeah I think Norm Macdonald maybe I shouldn't say friends like norm knows him I think norm has actually talked to him about doing his part really yes do you know epic that would be that would be crazy I wanna show you something the stand wrote a long time ago now that we're talking with this if norm had if norm coached him Oh Jay Simpson on his podcast hey juice this norm has this norm has whatever the fuck the opposite of having a filter is it's not having no filter he's just got like like weird crazy shits got come out of his mouth he doesn't give up fuck did you see the uh did you see the Sacha Baron Cohen with OJ no I did not oh you gotta watch it yeah I know I know I didn't see oh it's the best and he's just this Italian guy and he's like you gotta watch but he's like yeah ya know it has some assistant women you know I wish I could kill them but I guess I could not the guys like oh jeez like oh man no no no he gets him oh he's just so convincing he's so ballsy yeah to be able to do that shit in front of right in front of those people they don't even know what's happening yeah and they've signed up yeah here read this is what I mean by like they can't ever take it all away from us because you have clubs like this the stand is when I got one of my ear ages everyone can understand posting hateful messages and emailing hate speech to us we never respond to such irresponsible protest despite what you feel about Ari Shaffir we have the right to book or hire anyone regardless of their views on religion race or politics Ari's a comedian and a performer just because you view his creations is something that is not humorous but hate speech that is your opinion lower assing our establishment and will not deter us from booking Ari to perform at the stand please refrain from engaging our staff furthermore unorganized protests over a over a something that is out of our control okay is not only morally wrong but as viewed as a crime we will find out what special interest group this is and press charges if this continues that is all that's a public post that's what everyone else is backing down it's like well it's a tough time right now you will always have a few clubs like that they're like get the fuck away yeah we're not doing that so you'll always have a place thank God thank you God yeah yeah Odin praise Zeus yeah yeah man we need them we need people like the store we need many places that you know in some clubs they don't recognize that I used to admits you would do this they used to like right like full letters about Paul Mooney complaining about him and we're like what are you do and she was like call Paul read it to him and then decide if he wants the letter or not tell the people who complained that he's going to be severely punished he did there's a call ball we're just laugh about it goes really get really got I love this and we read it back because what was safe for my day yeah and then and then we call

told not to show up oh my god but like there were idiots back then - it's hilarious always yeah they're never gonna back down you know what I love looking at Yelp reviews when I find someone else like a one-star for a restaurant that I know is good all right one-star then I'll read the review Mike let me check out this dude's profile everything sucks every waiters rude every fucking food is cold my house more like you're off White House wash it some people are just twat yeah they're just you know did you see that New York Times review they gave the fucking Brooklyn steak house that we love what the hell's that called Peter Lugar's they gave Peter Lugar's one star one star that remember we just went there yeah it was fucking amazing my god it's dude those potatoes they gave it one star three stars you're like well maybe something happened I don't know it's smart because look if you're a provocateur / journalists and I know how much you love trolls yeah that's one of the most delicious restaurants of all time and he made a one-star rating it's either that or he's a moron so either he's really clever kind of or easy he's got to be a twat up on top of Google when you search Peter Luger review so now it sputters I can't why star I can't count on Peter Lucas take I wasn't booking to produce certain sensations and then I don't know well it's a very very popular restaurant right there's a giant waiting list last time we were there and we luckily weaseled in and had to grease some palms but it's a fucking sweet spot India's went with deers in town he was like get a reservation like getting look you're on your mind you can't get one so we had my manager assistant call and say were part of Obama's staff they said we could do 3:15 and that's it oh my god Obama's down yeah that's hilarious that's hilarious the food's there is fucking amazing once our restaurant you've come not one star after troll you're absolutely right that's that's more than he's not just he's just he's one of those writers there's certain writers that are just trying to be assholes with everything they do they love being assholes they love accentuating you live the art form of being an asshole an art form of being an articulate asshole they're an asshole with good you know how to say that you know put the right words in the right order what just sounds juicy and pops and makes you seem terrible but we don't know or something like Peter Lugar's like you lose that all that one star means that's not what one star means know what one star means your face you go to the Olive Garden and the fucking guy works behind the counter his heroin problem zero stars zero they didn't give it a one as the zero star that's what I haven't even there's no zero stars what is the lowest come on really it's a Photoshop see it's more showing this guy's trolling anyway look we're talking about it's grey and he's a smart man it's uncover him though we uncovered him look if you want to make a fucking splash in the restaurant review business in 2019 that's what you do yeah shitty place it'll work negative you know you all love this well I hate shit in your mouth yeah I mean he was talking about the the state not being flavorful your fucking minds they dropped it on the floor picked it up on the way it's still a two-star he's good he's bullshitting and they're all buying it hook line us he got us hook in the jaw I'm fighting against the drag uh-huh it's so much more fun to be angry at something low though he first tell you might special oh you're special okay so since it was this whatever this themed thing I was like we should do it in a synagogue there's this place that I was like this works because it's like like a performance space that was a synagogue and then they didn't want me to do it because my material and then we kept trying to find new synagogues that would let me do it the one that would be good for performance and then also they would let me do it and they were all like no fucking way mm-hmm yes something like you have a Holocaust Rose I'm like yes and they're like no my dad to survive I can see what are the fuck I want or do I have to be one no I think you can say whatever the fuck you want to say in front of him your dad is a fucking Holocaust survivor this is a real thing you know I mean the Holocaust was a real thing itself thought I'd deal with it as a people but yeah that's that's the thing it's like that's one of the rare things where only Jews can talk about it in that way I mean anybody could talk about anything right but only Jews can talk about the Holocaust from a position of hey that was my family that was killed that was my dad who was in the fucking concentration camp you can give us some seriousness to want to do it the only people that can say that that that is my family are the people that were the only indigo so if anybody the armenians got fully wiped out dude the I mean yeah I mean there's plenty of them go to find out but I not only did the Armenians have a genocide but there was a denial of their genocide like a serious denial of their genocide more than a drew one yeah like open and recent well not that not that long ago people were still denying the Armenian Genocide yeah and so that's a very touchy one with that man I didn't know about until many Gambier Ian told me about it the other head the Turks well they hate the people who massacred their ancestors they also just hate the Turks do you think so yeah at this point they're probably not delineating fuck all yeah it's turkey not turkey to them is that one of them countries like Japan is Nippon right we're like man don't like it Japan twork is a few countries I think Greece is not Greece I don't believe they call it Greece Israel Israel it's close enough yeah it's close enough Greece is not Greece I don't believe Greece is Greece door closed yeah that's close enough what is the Iceland's probably not Iceland they have a whole different language maybe right yeah what is Iceland but what is what is Greece in their language what's the what's the word I might have made that up let's see if I made it up let's see well I'm my brain is falling apart lately anyway my special is February a hard question to Google easily why well what is Greece called in Greece like it's time for Greek Greek I don't but that gets not that's not that ok what is the real name of the country Greece ok that's right Turkey thing and it's too close to Thanksgiving Oh turn off for safety um turn on your heart light what is what is the country Greece all day what is the real name of the country Greece the real name of the country Greece what is it the ancient or modern name of the country is hell us or helada is the Hellenic Republic Wow that's better then it's tougher it's not something you put on an axle it's not some you mix up with dancing yeah that's better Hellenic Republic yeah I know so so that's one we fucked that one up I'm pretty sure we fucked up Turkey I don't think they call turkey Turkey Germany is Deutschland right Deutschland yeah yeah yeah Trey adopted it they took they adopted it's a name known in English as the Republican I bet the butter on this tree bribed him this is probably some cross-promotion with Kellogg's that's hilarious never Kazakhstan got mad at le G fucking real mad and I'm real mad and I'm furious he was

the Ali G movie you made a movie that was only available in the UK I actually bought a special VHS player just to play it really yeah because it was one of those ones that was they used to be true though to formats no VHS do used to be to formats of VHS there was a format they used over in the UK and there was a format that we use here and they're not compatible and you have to get either get like a universal player one that plays all formats or you had to get a separate one so I went and got one that plays both but I got it specifically over the Olly G TV shows - you used to be able to buy the THS oh those are great ones from England yeah dude I'm telling you man this fucking boys got it yeah it's so silly especially if you're high it's really funny it's really fun and I heard

especially if you're a STONER and when the baby was in the umbilical cord I did he like lands with his house in like the desert somewhere that's like it's kind of sure to be over and it's like he's still going and then everyone's greeting him him and his dad like Rip Torn or something agreed even one of the signs says why is this movie still going this whole fuckin show was crazy that show was amazing that was an amazing show at them yeah it was the best it was like I didn't you'd never seen anything like that jackass he took him Scott damn yeah there's a lot of people taking serious risks on TV back then yeah you know yeah how about what's-his-face um the fucking damn it the ex experience what is this name that does the fucking the guy who would do the right on people and put makeup on and shit get there Jamie Kennedy experiment sees is crime sex am I not getting Jamie Kennedy out of my mouth no weed my tolerance that hold my dog my tolerance is through the fucking floor yeah I have nothing I was smart this time I went into her going like give me some like 14% this is for whatever this or that goddamn Kevin Smith shit he gets obliterated all day Jamie Kennedy had a great show yeah that Jamie Kennedy experience experiment is that what it was experiment yeah that was a great fucking show he'd had some whole life how about the ones we talked those guys their own to be engage hip and ales dancers remember did some good stuff man we liked that what it was guys gone nuts yeah it was like he was a sleazy producer and he was telling these guys they were gonna be in this new show called guys gone nuts and then eventually it got further down the line he made him dance and stuff but then eventually got further down the line they were gonna have to do gay stuff and they were like he was getting them on myself saying how much gay stuff it was it was ridiculous and he's this sleazy promoter treating them like they're you know male prostitutes it's very funny it's very funny it's another one that's real these are not acting everybody got Holtzman to wipe his feet no I don't like her deep breath somebody got an actor for it no no no all's been no idea this was happening yeah he wiped the guy's feet because he thought she was like in my country is supposed to wipe some of his feet we used to open mics with that oh my god so Holzman didn't know yeah just for full makeup the accent the makeups amazing and then he's wiping his feet and then he's just like wow those guys who put that crazy latex shit on your face when they can give you a fake nose and fake cheeks like you can't tell you can't tell especially not someone with vision problems yeah for that I'm looking for it yeah you ever hear that Jim Carrey after yeah the moon no he got those people that did the makeup for him to look like Andy Kaufman Kaufman M zmuda right Tony Clifton right yeah yeah he got them to make him up as whatever and that the rumor is that I heard so well obviously have no idea I love put us put him up in just makeup and then he drove a cab around and drove fares around just so we could hear what people actually sign when they don't know it's Jim Carrey in the room oh wow yeah yeah I could see when you become someone like Jim Carrey it's gotta be weird as fuck you probably wanted to go anywhere vacation with a fake face yeah yeah if it was real easy to do who didn't take hours to apply yeah you probably want to do that just to see everybody treats you just be normal oh yeah that's great what a good idea especially if you're that big you can't go anywhere in the world well he's also now he's become some new thing right psychedelic yeah it's not really a an actor anymore he paints and talks about things and he's in decided Alex way in like everything he talks about is like he doesn't mention the psychedelics stuff he's in that new Sonic the Hedgehog movie I saw stuff TV show recently - what is it side to hedgehogs your voice is a bad guy no he's a human yeah yeah oh oh so it's a live movie yeah I got it okay controversy but trailers came up to that swath and he was on a TV show like yours owners mad that's a movie they were mad yeah of course they can't be happy that they're making Sonic into a movie and getting Jim Carrey one of the biggest actors in the world they're taking it seriously yeah okay when when would the Nerds be okay when they hear movies coming out they're never okay with anything Batman the first Batman with Michael Keaton they were I don't I remember we're happy when there was one of the biggest controversy I ever heard about a role was when they were gonna have Tom Cruise play in interview of the vampire really yeah when he was the lead who's Lestat why cuz Yeah right look Anne Rice did not want Tom Cruise to play Lestat this is like this super intense character and these excellent books you've read those books uh-huh they're very good um and she you know had this vision for what her vampire King character was like that what she want in the vampire she wanted someone who's just more depth and intelligence and just someone who had more layers and she felt like Tom Cruise is like Top Gun you know I mean yeah he's like color of money but that little crazy fuckin act his ass off was he can act his fuckin ass off and he was really good in that movie I mean he fuckin nailed it like when he's like an angry vampire in that movie and he's yelling at that little girl you like holy shit like I'm buying this madness he was excellent he's good for a long time he's good he's fuckin he's crazy as fuck but he's great yeah he's got to be you know wondered sinker sinker with the fucking sci-fi reality but but his that's what it is yeah but his acting is fucking still he can go for it man he knows um that those thought was that edge of tomorrow it was run over again people already given up on for the movie or two before and then that movie came out nobody saw it but he was oh fucking good so good that movie is so good it's one of the most underrated star the same day over and over again and every time I'd be like no because they would do this and then they would cover that but yeah oh yeah okay right yeah it's amazing I've been on rabbit holes for YouTube I've been on a rabbit hole of groundhog day so I came thing of living the same day over and over again and one of them was how long did Bill Murray spend day after day it was a total amount of time what was it they think it's a wrap because they were like it's death he had to do this many times it's right you know bowling a perfect game all these different things they said about 30 years whoa living the same day over and over again you don't I used to think yeah and then you would do everything yeah as I was getting older one of the things I have thought I was like why don't why do I have this expectation that at some point in time a person stops learning and growing like I never expected people in their 60s like being better people and learning more they're done and yeah they're done whoever that guy is he's done because people do stop right but but but why so my thought was like why do I have these expectations for people instead of just being open-minded I almost assumed hit a certain age they're fucking done they throw in the towel but I didn't meet some people who don't do that right who were like taking an art class somebody's mom or grandmother that's like oh I'm learning archery it's like well that's cool when Bourdain was 58 and he started getting seriously fucking in did you just like seriously look at you motherfucker I love it well that's how you mean like love it went flake taken lessons do private lessons every day for an hour and then training and rolling with people for an hour every day oh really seven days a week like heroin like how he was it used to be addicted to heroin he got addicted to jujitsu all in a six-pack got really act dude jacked there's a picture I'm walking down the street in in Italy full-on six-pack yeah I mean you're looking like this is the guy that I used to know that was on high he was on high cholesterol medication he was on statins because of his diet cuz he's on the road drinking wine eatin fuckin this and that and fatty foods and a lot of sugar and just drinking whatever the fuck he wants right yeah and then he's and he got fat you know I'm not fat like a big fat guy but he definitely developed like a little belly then boom yeah yeah that's what I'm saying it looks like Dan Bilzerian dude he got in jiu-jitsu and completely transformed his body lost all the weight stopped eating sugar started eating and stopped eating carbs started eating really healthy cut way back on the drinking and developed a goddamn legitimate six-pack super healthy he's gonna live forever I think that's a nine that's a seven pack that bottom one is a solid one yeah all right so you got one two three four five six seven it's a seven package if you've always liked to say eight pack but I don't ever see a separation in that bottom one to try to be like some kind of turtle person you know yeah it's like the tan line point is like the dude transformed his fucking body completely strung a lot of dick route there though I'm not happy but I mean it's low up I think about those shorts like 20 pounds ago no maybe it could be that where'd you get that ball um who brought that in Oh David Duke yes David Duke is a let's weigh champion he's he fights in the most brutal form of stand-up striking with a headbutt and they really soccer pick each other on the way down and where do you get that Thailand probably he got it or Burma and I think it was Myanmar Myanmar Burma yes yeah dude they play these games he showed us the volleyball game yeah yeah oh my god they they get above the net with the rest of your leg yeah it's and they play first of all barefoot most of the time mm-hmm I saw a guy play a one on three for money oh my god he was like amazing good yeah and these other guys were just like laughing about it they were trying to like fuck he was spiking it spike sit down with his foot yeah that's my second day in Yangon you're seeing this stuff like how are they doing this and barefoot on concrete I've seen it only on a dirt floor that they're a barefoot that's a lot of dirt Wow it's nuts that is crazy it's so cool it's one of the coolest kids I've ever seen well and they keep it going to have circles where they just get going and like yeah they do the kick this way I mean I'm sure you talked about it they did this is fine I get that but when it goes over your head doing this yeah hit this straight and go how to pop it right back up right I've tried it a hundred times at best I can do is kick it that way I think it's one of those things that if your body doesn't develop throwing your legs around like that yeah it's really fuck that was the thing about Taekwondo like when I was teaching you would get people that were like in their 30s it was really hard for them to learn it really hard for them to get good you know they can like whip their leg around but if you get those little kids when they're like five and six no teach them how to whip their legs into things yeah here they go oh my god they're so good verse three oh that's a one well I don't know if it's the one you saw by this is it yeah you can use your head one verse three guy well this seems like these guys are fucking it up well they're also Americans know they know there are Americans that are trying to play they're playing good God look at him oh he fucked up oh you fucked up loser dork helmet no it's a bandana this is a wild game though man very oh my god haha you got beat and you're not better than everyone yeah stupid killer game yeah oh man if you can learn that how to whip your legs around like that when you're like eight or nine years old as you get older you'll you'll maintain that sort of leg dexterity yeah I sent one of those back I have one of those in my apartment oh really yeah I sent it back I took it from from Myanmar to Thailand and then I was like I need to send this to myself back in Iraq yeah and they're like I can get it done in two days I'm like no I don't need it there I like slower than that that's cheaper they were like I mean a week I'm like you do it up I'm in no rush I won't be there for like months like we get you in three months for like four dollars and I'm like yep that's the one no rush that's the deal three months for it was like so slow who's my mule or something and I was like I'm not there so don't had somebody muled it away and I mule meaning someone stuff in there the whole fucking box it's a weird game it's that's one where like you need a certain specific kind of athleticism yeah like someone is an outstanding basketball player or a football player you're not gonna be good at that right that's not just pure athleticism that's a weird leg dexterity skill oh my god do it I mean they think about like what I can throw a lot of crazy kicks I can't do what those guys are doing no I don't know how to do that I can kick over my head I could do a split really go on a wild shit still look at kicking fool yeah yeah you'd have to learn how to jump up and you're you whipping down your leg up but it's up and I think you know it'd be crazy flexible too it looks like you got to be crazy flexible like I'm watching their legs fly up there's no resistance at all how's people have a lot of resistance when you try to lift your leg up they're doing it all the time all the time yeah what are you doing you're not special I don't think I'm thinking about it good I'm right now just riding yeah just enjoying performing and when I get the bug when it feels like moons is there I wanna you know I was thinking about I actually talked about this with Malcolm Gladwell in the last podcast I was talking I was quoting Jeselnik the Jeselnik he has a three year process he does it in the clubs just around LA develops an hour worker and then he takes it on the road for in clubs and then he takes it on the road the next year in theater so it's a three year process right that might be the way to go yeah Louie had that with but not in the three year just like in the was doing I'm like you know he's doing for months yeah he was doing he was doing a new special in a year yeah which I guess you could if that's all you did and you just really dug into it but I think things need time to cook also I find there some times where it's like I want to tell a lot in New York he's like the best I was just saying that to Malcolm Gladwell to really he was the guy that I said if there's one person who's like at a super elite level where he doesn't get enough love it's Dave Attell and it's like you see him on a regular basis being like Jesus he's just on another level above even the highest level people yeah super dedicated to only his craft yeah he has zero motion in him yeah and so when he does a he has a topical bit he's not thinking like well on time to work on this for three weeks until people don't know the reference anymore right because I got to work on a special he's not thinking that way he's like oh I got three weeks with this fucking topic right so he hits a harder than anybody and then when it people like starting to like lose the memory of the of the topic he's just moves on yeah but he's having fun though right and like doing new cool things he's also guy says the best example somebody got better when they got sober yeah yeah the best example right nobody else does right everybody else gets sober and then they get serious it's like oh come on yeah exactly think anymore come on that's a beautiful thing about podcasts - one of the beautiful things is that you don't have to like ideas that you have that aren't funny you don't have to bring them to this day just fine on podcast yeah yeah they fit for that yeah because remember there was like a point in time after Hicks where a lot of people were trying to do bits on stage that meant something yeah you see them doing that you're like okay it's fine if you have that but like I just always feel like that's like why you're not being funny why are you pushing that right and the other Hicks did it and honestly I don't I have the same problem with him hey how dare you it's just like it's so much not funny but but a lot funny to men a lot funny yes a funny shit and you got to also take it in the context of the time right if you were alive back then and watching it back then it would be really funny shit you know when I saw him was like 90 yeah you got to put in context at the time I never got it really well I saw him in like the first time I saw him was like 88 but were you laughing when you heard it or were you just like whoa yeah right on man both okay both I was laughing and I was saying wow this guy's he's out there you know he was like railing against capitalism and fucking Tiffani in the mall with Jimi Hendrix yeah that's crazy bit like Tiffani like think I'm alone now running into Jimmy Hendrix at the mall you know he just had all these like counterculture bits yeah you know a lot of it was mocking ridiculous trends in American culture he just had some very very YOUnique takes on things that didn't necessarily fit with our idea what we thought comedy was like you never thought oh yeah that's you make comedy out of that too and he that's what he would do so he was like making comedy out of like weird ideas like anti-war ideas and he was doing stuff that other people weren't doing and it changed people's opinion a comedy because there was something about when Hicks would go onstage you would feel like why Richard Jeni said this to me well Richard Jeni back then was the master he was Brewin he said every time I see him I say why don't I write more she liked that that's what Jenny said to me well after he saw Hicks he's always think why don't I write things because he was so deep Hickson and various jenny was just funny he was just writing funny things he was just that weird when some master looks at somebody else I'm stuck tomorrow I can't ever be more like that it's a dam you're not happy well jenny was never had oh yeah good point he was a guy that for whatever reason thought that he had to be like Seinfeld with the television show or Jim Carrey with the movie career he had to be that and he was like the most probably underappreciated stand-up in my opinion one of the most underappreciated ones ever but definitely from his era yeah meanwhile he has all these specials that you can go watch watch how good the guy was and when I saw him live again in the context of the time cuz I saw him live in like first yeah first time I saw was 88 but I saw him a bunch of times but I saw him murder at the Comedy Works in Montreal oh you know that room is like a hundred people max right oh that place honey ass room upstairs he lit that fucking place on fire and I remember he was doing it he was doing a bit about a some guy trying to sell him a car of some car salesman selling him a car and I was like this is like the most standard bla premise how could he extract so much comedy out of someone selling him a car but it was like a murderous bitch just crushing just punch line after punch line bang bang bang like fuck but again it's like I've said this so many times about him you gotta be there in that moment stand up on TV is maybe 60% as funny as it is when you're seeing it live maybe that's why people go war they're laughing cuz they're there it's funnier it's funnier when you're there right comedy club is the funniest theatre second arenas arena just gets crazy the arenas are weird it's like you're laughing but it's also like wow fuck it people are here there's like this weird feeling to it there's an extra energy to it yeah watching it show you if you watch Richard Jeni today you know I didn't think it was that funny listen to me weird you have to be the room and second of all we're in 2019 right this is 1990 right Wow almost 39 years I mean the first time I watched him was I think it was 92 or 93 on on stage at the comedy works but the first time I saw him physically I was an open mic er that was in 88 I paid to see him at catch a rising star in Cambridge hello and I was a half-filled room it's like a Thursday night you know he was like a guy who'd been on The Tonight Show and I knew him cuz he had been on The Tonight comic and I was a comic I was you know maybe a weekend or something like that yeah and I paid to go see him and me and my friends hat in the front row and he made fun of me it was excellent but he was great he was great and he was like so casual and loose with like punchlines and I remember thinking god damn like this fucking guy he's got it made he's just traveling around the country doing stand-up but he didn't think that way he wanted to be as I know where a movie star he's looking at people and you're like you know you would have killed for your life and you're upset about it right now I killed for like 20 years ago oh my god I mean forever dude what I wanted to do from the time I was a beginner in 1988 was I wanted to make a living doing comedy yeah that's about everything's gravy everything's exactly it's gravy yeah listen I've lived in a shitty apartment the only thing that sucks about shitty apartments is bugs and crime roommates that's it you get used to everything you do it's fine it's really fine it takes like a week and they used to it prison may be a little different everybody we're all different but if you got freedom if you're in a place as long as you're not your life's not being threatened and your fucking things aren't getting stolen all that other stuff was mostly bullshit if your house has two bedrooms or four bedrooms you get used to it get used to everything man $88,000 theory everything over $88,000 doesn't yeah it does not improve you're happy your might happiness doesn't prove with more money up to 88,000 that makes and then it's like a new Lamborghini gives you the same happiness as a new you know BMW Honda probably the thing about the Lamborghinis you can't leave it anywhere you know that's the thing about those if you got a stupid car like that you don't just pull it up to the mall and park anywhere you now you feel weird you know I think that the thing was to get a lever I was driving down the highway and this guy had a Lamborghini in his driveway but he didn't have it in his garage he just had it parked in his driveway and it was kind of like sticking out in the street people are whizzing by a wham wam in Malibu yeah I'm like what a weird thing Malibu is were these houses that are on the fucking highway like on the Pacific Coast Highway it's a highway yeah and there's a door that's five feet from a speeding car yeah I don't have to get the car into those driveways do they barely get in there without dying then how did they get out flying by Wow yeah 60 in there and they're just turned off yeah and there's a ton of bars on that fucking road oh yeah that straight at all I mean you have never driven to have allegedly known the drone ever you've never driven drunk on that Street when you see cars coming right Mel Gibson's he set the tone in his footsteps that's he wanted a crazy anti-jew rant right are you sure did mmm none of us cared I chose we thought it was funny well it's just the worst one was the the voicemails that the wife brought up the one who saw mark yeah that was shut up and blow me she fell no I didn't want to support her ability to do that how does she do that how are you allowed to do that there would be record someone's voicemails and then play it on the Internet yeah that she'd be like really illegal especially if you're married to Mel Gibson you know and he's drinking even my hobby he's a fucking nice guy man I met him at home with dr. Neil Riordan talk about stem cells stem cells like severely helped his father his father's Oscar my wife's doctor come a blow job whoa I don't think that was on the tapes okay it's like blaming the Jews is a weird one it is a weird weird one it's all mostly so antiquated it's a when you when you that's your go-to things to blame the Jews yeah taking our jobs is a lot more obvious but what jobs I know I know that not the right but it's more like I don't agree we back it okay I can see it but the Jews it really is a throwback thing right it's a weird one it's a weird one because the the it's almost always there's some sort of intoxicant or some sort of a psychological issue yeah it's always like when your when your default is go to the Jews because how much has the Jews had an impact on your life like I'm not saying that some people haven't had bad situations with people that happen to be Jewish but I want to know like if we could have a chart to show all the people that rally against the Jews find out how many Jewish people have actually had a negative impact on your life what did what is the numbers pretty goddamn low Mel Gibson would be like the Jews are the ones who were taking holy my money back that the producers is that what he would say maybe cuz I'm saying that's what the Jews he's come in contact with didn't he told the Jews it was at Christ and I think like some ungodly sum of money I think he did that on a ballsy move though I think one of the things he did was he took ownership of the film so he financed it passion project yeah yeah yeah I felt he I think I think that's the case if I remember correctly The Passion of the Christ he's a very religious guy and his father is - was - yeah right very right yeah not Catholic oh okay no no no I'm thinking of Schwarzenegger Austria yeah baby yeah I don't think he has Nazi roots either but maybe someone in the family some was that guy's dad dad grandfather dad yeah somebody meant might had some questions about the Holocaust Mel Gibson someone's family I don't know whose family it was I remember something I don't remember what it was but he so when who made Passion of Christ yeah he like said look this means a lot to me I want to do this movie I'm gonna just pump it to any IDE all that loot from Braveheart he put his own money in pretty sure it said the case it's a production company spent 30 million to produce wow that's a lot of money it's a big that's more than spending on Ari Shaffir jus taping February 8th to the Skirball Center in New York at tickets are re the great calm right now what's a smooth segue are you doing sets in town the week of that you're doing that yeah probably do other material those those notes oh really you wouldn't want to run the set like constantly been running it out for so long not so many times that's a good yeah it's just in groove I did it last night at the store that was like three days I was like hey give me a belly room or and she was like I ever made was like whatever I'll be fifty people in there yeah so yeah I'm just running the shit out of it all the time beautiful yes nice that's a good place to be where you just have it down yeah yeah that's nice the Skirball is a good place to what we talked about it we're like some of these synagogues were like I was back in bending over too much to like make it work in a synagogue you look cool this was there and was worried about the sound yes worried about thus the height of the ceilings this place was massive yeah beautiful synagogue and filter oh but anyway after agonizing over they came back a week later but you don't want you to do it didn't even matter like yeah they probably googled you wolf shot there she said there were good shows she really liked that place Oh at the synagogue no no yeah yeah so I'm excited I'm really excited about yeah this girl balls legit that's a that's a spot that a lot of people perform at yes that's a time-tested spot you don't have to worry about that part of it cool part of town to doing something on a synagogue man like who knows what's gonna work what kind of sound you're gonna have what kind of echoes are gonna be the people gonna get in the audience is gonna be weird when it comes through on the television is worth it was it worth it it's right that's what I had to agonize over is it worth what percentage worse might this be the laughter versus what do I gain from look to the things you talked about that anything are very important ones to do it in New York I think that's huge it's a gigantic Jewish community the it's where the Jews in America yeah Boston is like maybe second but not as prominent New York is where it's at yeah and then on top of that like that's where you perform most of the time you to snowy's audiences yeah yeah and the Skirball dude come on man you can't go wrong there yeah I'm pretty excited about it perfect it's because the theme like it is Suffolk once you get past with the theme is people just want to hear the material it doesn't matter if you're in a synagogue okay so that's what I did yeah but that's what I did with this thing so I was like I'm gonna work out all the shit this theme stuff in clubs in New York and LA you know just regular club sets fun right follow big J you know talking about some relationship in the crowd or follow some Bobby lead doing whatever right and then just like I'll just do this and it has to be as funny as those guys yeah with the theme that's make people like not notice a theme yeah yeah and then be stand-up yeah it's just stand up and then that theme is on top of it but since it is that it's like oh yeah that's awesome so yeah I've never well material di no you haven't how much material do you have outside of it a year ago at Edinboro a year in three months or something like that I didn't had on show after my last few shows we're done was sold out that we did an add-on show in a tent and I was like this will be the next specials material I just ran all my love because I the problem is I go crazy with just this theme shirt mm-hmm like it it's like annoying after a while right you don't want to talk about one subject well you also get like you know bits come because you get like your mind pops off you see something so you almost got picking shit out of his ass you know and this is a bit you know or that ladies on Sunset every comment gotten at the store had a bit about that lady dancing in the street on Sunset because they all felt like they just saw her even though she was posted up there things make your mind pop off so I still had that and I'm like well I got to do this for a week you know or two or something and just get rid of that you know and then when I'm done like are I expressed myself she'll like that then I get back to the material mm-hmm so November what what's the date February 8th and it's already great calm are they great calm yeah yeah so it's available right now right now I'm telling everybody right now today that's why I came out to fucking LA dawn dawn dawn yeah February 8th that what you said February Manhattan New York beautiful that's plenty of time you folks get your shit together you should have get it make your plans don't dough sorry as payback either you know that you're plotting I know we do right before a special switches water ball I'd be crazy to get the exact same water bottle switch like an old spy are you and Buerkle did everything yeah we're all right that's right yeah we're flush yeah that's the tough month yeah there's a rough one I got weird yeah yeah yeah I think the lesson is don't does anybody but yeah that's definitely the lesson you know but I mean definitely do your free drugs to people but but on only if they ask for it yeah it's more trouble than I thought a bit yeah taking consideration he's on medication either like that's the big consideration yeah there's a bunch of issues there oh well everything worked out I'm just never allowed in his home against his newfound zest for life yes giving him this about that promo what drugs you've been on since the UH since was just pot just pot yeah I was anything oh yeah booze yeah booze and pot yeah Figg me too no no I took some Molly a little bit mmm just a little bit yeah there's a dance-off but that's it how do you feel I feel good yeah me too but I felt good sober too yeah me too I enjoyed it how do you feel being sober for the month I died enjoy it I enjoy that there's no choice like sometimes I wanted a glass of wine with a steak yeah but the reality is doesn't matter I don't really need it doesn't difference but like yeah no you don't need ism you can enjoy the things out of life like we smoked here but it's like we don't have any pots like it's alright so the podcast yeah but really liked it yeah we liked it too the thing about alcohol though versus pot is you pay a price yeah but you probably pay off right so wine or two beers no you pay a small price for a glass of wine or two beers small price it's very small you might not notice it maybe it's a quarter worth it but if you have like three drinks you pay a few dollars you lose you're gonna lose a feeling you're gonna lose a step yeah it's a fact it's a fact if you get hammered if you put you drink like seven eight drinks you get drunk the next day you're gonna feel like shit you know yeah well that's true but also that day if you're with friends drinking all feels really good have you worth it yeah have a good time your friends getting a little loopy yeah it's good point that's why I miss it the most not in moments I didn't miss the drug I missed the drug enhancing a moment that should have been Yankee games my brother coming to town a glass of wine at an Italian meal you know where it's like yeah they wonder what's a happy Italian meal it's like oh yeah wine would be great here yeah for sure yeah it's like it's a technology they figured out how to alter your state predictably you know a small glass of liquid it's pretty great it's pretty amazing yeah the first few days I was struggling that's a spy locked cabinets of like liquor at hotels in picanha but it's like everything else right so you can abuse virtually everything that everybody enjoys whether its food or sex or anything or electronics or anything television there's some people that watch television 12 fucking hours a day so just sit in front of TV and watch TV all day what do you do to limit yourself on there on TV no on that fuckin stupid thing I've been really good with it lately what I mostly do is the one thing that I do trick myself with like I said is those google stories I read too many I read news stories then a wine I'm reading like scientific stories about like fucking space and all these different things a because it's interesting and too because I'm getting to look at my phone so it's like I'm tricking myself into saying oh this is but this is a crucial information I need to have like I could also because of the feeling I need to check this and yes yeah banned for three days Instagram for something should happen he said during that time he was banned where he's like oh I'm banned sure he checked his phone like 72 times check his Instagram little bit like he's just reflexively we end up going because the lights and colors or what I don't know but it's not good for you the parental control it shuts it off after I use it for an hour whatever you want to set it to you know my girlfriend put the code on there yeah so I can't I can't override it yeah you know even mo if I need to if I need to promote something big I'm going to be on there all day I would tell her take it off but like although it's mostly here now it says you got five minutes left if you got to make a post about a show do it fucking now right and then you're done then it's over yeah and so it's like and then I end up using it a little less because I don't wanna waste that in case let's say I want to push something later right or I want to get on there you know so I want to save some time and then I end up only using it for like whatever but I need that parental control it's very rare that I really do need to answer emails on my phone rarely and you do it an hour a day and just get it all done or doing on your computer only the only time it's like say if you were in the middle of a deal like you're about to sign a deal for your special and you going back and forth and all the Skirball the Skirball february 8th it's called sorry the great calm but if you were gonna do that like that kind of makes sense you would check your phone during the day right if you have the time most the time no I check it in the morning just to make sure it's not some nonsense that I forgot to have to do during the day and then I try not to check my email at all until I start doing podcast ads ok so one thing I would say for that is what I like is not checking it for the first and I fail first hour or two of the day that's good that's my best so my phone don't even look and I set a time of 11 or 12 if I wake up at 9 or 10 great look up 1130 whatever but like until 12:00 like don't touch it you know my favorite thing to do and I've only done this a couple of times legitimately is don't look at my phone at all and go right to yoga class great and then your mind race if your mind's racing it's oh it's a whole night before I even see ya the whole night instead of back bogging it down and like does this deal sound good for this club and what do you think for t-shirts it's just like just let your mind wander weren't supposed to no one else but hi it's fun for you at high as fuck don't look at your phone get high as fuck before yoga you come out of there a different person from another dimension a different hole in the time-space continuum you'll just drop out of there Boop you start thinking change your universe life you ever space out when you're doing like a background you're back thing and then all of a sudden you're like you come to like not not asleep how long was I out yeah you can get zoned out man you're messing with your consciousness when you're doing that you're holding those poses and breathing you're messing with your consciousness and I say that in a good way they did a new Netflix special about that Bikram guy really yeah I haven't seen it but I saw those ads a lot of people are changing the name of the class I know the one I went to two years ago they just call it a hot yo yeah she was like yeah shoot nobody wants to be associate with that they're hippies I got this full rapist he definitely has some issues why would that rape those women I know what movement would pay a million dollars for one drop of my was your of my serum yeah why rape one drop of my sperm yogi guru predator I like is a bunch of Rolls Royces that's my favorite part he he does yoga with a Rolex on hollow do you think that's on his card yogi guru predator now it is now bro now they probably put it on that he's a fuckin character man in the worst way possible but he's definitely a character he's a thing man when when you're around a bunch these freaky people nervous I'll see that movie when you're around touch these freaky people and everybody's half naked and you know you're the guy who's the one to teach them how to do yoga yeah you're the master you get to fuck dude isn't it weird when you see somebody who went all in with yoga oh yeah it's like they shave their head the only where the Oh keep it's like that is their being but if that's what me what I start wearing yoga pants everywhere Oh Joey yoga Joe oh wow where do you wear a fanny pack what would be the problem the more different world than yoga Joe what would a Bikram t-shirt on if you're allowed to wear a bee cream t-shirt you gotta wear it now right so it's but I think the specials out this Netflix documentary I think it's out is that the new status but don't know about it yeah really or abroad that's after Paul Rudd they just went right to Bikram one drop of my sperm we've been spend 1 million dollar we're like show me one woman who spent a million dollars in sperm you'll get one drop yet for a million it was a whole load I know someone who runs a yoga studio and that was the fucking final nail in the coffin when he said that yeah one drop off my sperm like alright changing the name but I think back when he started getting crazy right how old is he now 7 8 8 is that whole he's probably pretty fucking all reported back when he first came here in the 80s and they're like doing you remember girls wear like scrunchie socks and it was you remember like they were like Olivia newton-john let's get physical let's get physical girls taken there taking aerobics classes buying those Reeboks aerobics shoes with the velcro everybody had a little the socks had a little poufy ball no that's right a little poufy ball at the sock not about that that was when good that are just slinging so he came over here from India shorts with leggings underneath oh that's right that's right colored leggings yep so he came over here from India and started teaching and just let Neos snake out of the basket whoo to make like Indian music sounds and say he took the snake out of the basket insinuating his cock but yet he's a snake charmer definitely got joke wise you got two levels you know joke wise you're clean yeah it's okay yeah but at Fort fuck structures great is it racist because that's because I make the noise too because if you say something about someone from China anyway oh my god you're racist okay well well definitely I would say there is an argument for racist see how valid that argument is yeah maybe you could smoke you could go in on me oh yeah yeah if you were really woke you can take a swing looks like yo know who have fucking that's the woke swing you know who fucking never never get stood up for its fat white guys I know you can shit on fat white guys they're not even human nobody gives a fuck about the way they feel those me but I would say please do are you talking about Burt No what stuff he's not fat anymore he's not a beast anymore he lost a lot of weight just overweight he lost a lot of a lot of ways looks good yeah that's very good hey there's only one guy you know it isn't the hope good Tom did you say Tom no I heard you say Tom I didn't say Tom well I was it looks fine to me oh yeah Wow bet Bert's winning now yeah well I told Burt if it makes 205 he gets the belt yeah I textile at any point I text anytime I text

now you can cut that they cut the weight yeah I would love to see the fucking fool no no this guy was this is a wrestler that guys very good granting in a ring I think he's in Australia what's your ranting about he's like look big J's in the background hulking shit to the crowd like for those that are watching you can't see this but they're like just 10 15 to the end here what's happening he's teased me in the heel he's great what is he there's a guy that yells out he calls him Tom Segura oh it does I'm sorry too fucked up no sorry I play it back my fight will find it alright yeah no I enjoy your failure here oh hey girl rapid random rule that might not have actually been said it sounds like someone inserted that sound oh maybe I'm not buying it alright oh yeah good point I know what they're doing they found some guy doing that and some some other guy yes that's me hear that again play it again yeah I might be right sounds like that's an echo a room that sounds like I did in his bathroom yeah his mom's like why are you screaming at me in the wind why are you screaming with Jimmy not buying it there's no gimmicks no gimmicks as well that'd be a good way to do a good gimmick yeah it's not the law is not strict on the no gimmicks claim bro that's a lonely road right well we're talking about the road of being a stand-up and traveling and doing stand-up being up a pro-wrestler that nobody knows like trying to make it on the circuit who like doing what that guy was doing yeah that's rough that's tough that's rough coke Cabana he ever talk to him no yeah he's like a legit wrestler wrestler just on the road all the time it's hard right yeah is your friend Tommy still bowling professionally no his legs are shot out he if I'm polling from bowling yeah I guess so Jesus Christ think we used to be cavemen we used to be able to fight off saber-tooth tires nearing ranked fifth in the world in bowling this how great stand-up is right now he's like fifth in the world and bowling and he made 35 grand that year behind them yeah that always comes up on reddit cuz that sign so um his knees are shot from bowling I think so I don't know what do you do that in bowling that makes your knees go let's see well here we go bar that torque I think probably okay yeah I guess right yeah that makes sense if you twist harder you break torque are but you're on those slides use your shoes you slide in slide grip with your yeah I do know that some pros are playing do they like their 40s and 50s it seems like slighty shoes wouldn't be the way to go like if I didn't know better no you don't wanna stop short right but I'm saying I do know that slider shoes the way to go because the pros use them not stupid but I would think that if you had more grip you could wing the ball harder oh I see what you're saying I think it's that movement that got going speed there's like momentum and a whips yeah let's watch some strikes they almost all says it's arm injuries except for MCL like just Colin bowling injuries throwing this out yeah yeah do you know how many fucking Marines are laughing right now you fucking bowling you've been you've been Afghanistan bruh have you been too hard work planes over how to learn that's a hard lane there's a lot of dips my adepts they don't grease up the rails you know they like the Carver balls will carve a groove you got to find the groove so he says so this how the tournament works you play the whole week and the top five going to the tournament mm-hmm starts with fifth place fourth the winner of that place third the wonder that plays second wonder that plays first for the championship so if you're in first place for the week you guys play one game whoa if a lefty is in the fourth fifth game if that left he wins he's already set a groove that only he's gonna be in whereas the righty has to use the other guy's groove and so it's like he's not set in his own then lefty will go all the way and win Wow yeah begin it's cuz the oil was because they proved up that the fucking lane their way exactly no one's worked it up to righties like IRA but it's true for six-year-olds that's what it is it's like it's like pool if you only broke the balls and people get mad at me how could you sure put buoys to scale with a rook think it's so angry 35 K for number five yeah what are you hoping for just shut your mouth it's a child's game they have roommates on tour my ball is 15 pounds I'd like to see a six-year-old throw away that they have roommates on tour yeah the best guys have a roommate for the week and they have two dude there are bowling groupies that are hideous every industry has a groupie and the moles groupie is not great every industry must have groupies yeah yeah where they're like I know you from the scene yeah even ones you would think no fucking way bowlers like you used to think no fucking way for like guys who played video games but major for shirt ninjas getting his dick sucked Wow right now yes for sure but there's other guys that ricca-san for sure technically your wife could suck your dick yeah I know but she could do if she really cares yeah I can do it really yeah it's um there's a lot of money in it so once there's a lot of money in something to get groupies yeah under percent but not even if it's just well you had pool groupies didn't you did you have Lounge Lizards and hung out there there was a few really hardcore drug addicts that would hang around the pool room and then some like really lonely ladies and there's a few girls who played pool and they would hook up with guys - because I saw like these guys are the best yes yeah yeah yeah there was a few of those girls who'd get really there would be pool players maybe really into like the pros they would hook up with the pros University yeah yeah right and they'd be like hang out waiting to like score with ya that Tommy neither man that the only thing that saves pool is well there's subtle games there's no there's some tournaments to be played in America some but in other countries there's a lot of money there's big like they go to Qatar they play billiards in China and you know you can make like real money in tournaments out there but you have to be like a Shane Van boning or you know it's a deaf one yeah yeah yeah he's top of the food chain you have to be like him you know there's a few of those guys Jason Shaw there's a few of those guys that are like just straight-up killers they could travel the world and they're fucking bitches all the time I would imagine if you look in elite pool player and you're a handsome fellow you probably get a little tail get a few players go to pool and you're the best that's the thing about if you want to eat anymore might be like yeah yes yes yeah but like in the Philippines pools huge Philippines is gel like there's this guy Aaron Reyes he's probably the greatest pool player of all time and he's from the Philippines and that guy is a star over there he does commercials and all kinds of crazy shit everybody knows them like people see him on the street yeah it's like pick like a like Tiger Woods I got Tiger Woods is for golf and that's how Efrain ray is is for pool Tiger Woods goes anywhere people know who Tiger Woods is people if Efrain goes anywhere in the Philippines he does commercials with Manny Pacquiao like in Manny knows many actually plays really good pool better than me he plays like professional level pool yeah how come you could say Filipinos or standardly way better pool than us because of the you can today America is clearly the best comics in the world you can Corsica Americans sometimes just as good and I mean pool players are just as good like van Bowen the top one but overall overall Filipinos have a lot of great pool players they have a lot of killers but there's a lot of kills just Killers over here - now there's killers from Europe there's a lot of killers from Europe pool yeah pools different but would stand up get the fuck out yeah you know what I think I think England it came from like a theater and here it came from like storytelling just like campfire well it came from a lot of variety shows - like Lenny Bruce used to do is to do stand up on between right yeah there'd be like a ban would come out and like you ever watch marvelous mrs. Mazal it they have it that way like someone comes out and they got an act they do some kind of an act they have like a fucking puppet act and they introduce the band and then they introduce the band the band will come play a song and then Lenny Bruce would go on and do some stand-up and I mean and then you know that's that's how they did it back then they didn't necessarily have comedy clubs we talked about that yesterday with the ice house that the ice house is the oldest comedy club technically but it really didn't become a full-time comedy club until 1978 whereas the store was the whole time in 72 yeah so they were a full-time first what kept saying it was older but it wasn't a customer not really it was but it was a variety show they'd have magic and fucking bands and all kinds of stuff yeah that's a said one of Mitzi's biggest decisions was going like we're going all comedy we're not doing music comedy magic we're doing all Konami was the lights out of your mind she was the best what a crazy loon thank God yeah we needed her you need some jazz and people oh my god you needed her yeah you needed her to do it man I knew how to run a fucking a comedy club she let people fucking figure it out in their own no just wanted you to kill she just wanted you to develop and come better just be better yes and then she'd always find a good spot to put you in the beginning she put you on early you get it with a fresh crowd after a while you develop a little promise she puts you on after hard people and if she liked you every set you're gonna go after a murderer right every set you go if she likes her doers murderers and then she would give you advice that wasn't funny thanks for the advice lady Wow stop doing it man she throw me a gem just tell me how much she loves me yeah yeah just hear there man what are like a fucking abusive parent and they just give you a little bit I was you know 27 years old and I expected it going in I was happy just to talk to her you got there when you were 27 yeah whoa yeah 26 really I went through the first time I when I was 26 yeah it was before that show hardball I came out here with Breuer he was on that show too yeah he was Breuer was the mascot in the first episode yeah he was a mascot of the opposing team the the pide pide he had a fucking flute and shit he got beat up by a giant baseball that was our mascot it was really funny Brewer but uh bruised fucking hilarious still it sir he's hilarious but he was out here with me we were doing that pilot and it was like I was like 93 somewhere around then yeah 93 yeah we came to the comedy store and we're just sitting in the back of the room watching that play I remember thinking I can't believe I'm even here can't believe this is really the Comedy Store and then maybe six months later I was out here living because the show got picked up maybe not even six months probably four months you know you do a pilot pilot kit scene got picked up came back did six episodes and there's just hanging around the store whoa that's when I got to meet Mitzi and she said you can perform there yeah I could be a non-paid regular first time auditioned as a non paid regular and no bullshit I was there every fucking night I didn't have a life man I had nowhere to go and I didn't have any friends so all I would do was go to the comedy store after work so I'd work all day on the TV show I'd go home to my shitty oakwoods apartment and when the oakwoods apartments in Burbank you know one of those ones with it's a pre furnished apartment before people were coming exactly and then somewhere around episode three I'm such a fucking genius I figured this show is gonna take off I'm gonna get a lease so I got a lease for a year an apartment in North Hollywood a real apartment and then the show got canceled immediately I was good but it's good that I got that least because I was gonna move back to New York I did not like it yeah that's what kept me I couldn't move I had already spent in I don't remember how much it was but I remember had a pool table in the living room there was the number one thing that I did I got a place that was big enough for me to put a pool table in the living room Jesus so that was my prerequisite I'd walk out every apartment at one two three four five six seven eight nine that's five feet with four on each side so it's a nine by five right a good table is four and a half by nine so you want to give yourself like 15 feet width and then you want to give yourself a solid 20 feet length so you measure out five on the front five on the back so you don't knock it with a stick in an attic yeah it looks for yep that's what I look for wow that's great that's like me when I go to places like the smoking is allowed right pot and they're like because I want to know now or I'll just move on yeah yeah but I had a neighbor they got mad that I was playing pool oh yeah I'm sure plywood late at night threw up no no no he asked me to not do it until they don't use the living room because the floor was creaking and this guy was like the superintendent of building I want what I said so I'm walk you don't like to be walking upstairs and he said well you're walking around the pool table when you're playing pool I go what have I just walked you don't be walking you told me not to walk in the living room he walked like what kind of floor is this like what do you here's the floor that dude it was a carpeted floor too wasn't like I was like I had fucking cowboy boots and I was running around on a hardwood floor stall it was a

it's so hard to put in like the real consistent fat burning time there's some muscular though I don't know how fucking how you lift all that weight around I do it I force myself yeah I know I understand deterioration it comes with aging it's very it's one of the most important things for your health as you get older to lift weights it's very important muscle mass has some sort of there's some sort of correlation between health and muscle mass when you get older they say that you should do some resistance exercises and weight bearing exercises just to keep your bone density and your muscles strong yeah my thought is like you're bigger yeah sorry boys yo use this fucking thing why you got it cuz you don't see a lot of seven year old dudes that can work out hard right so what's the point the point is like don't work out hard when you're 50 so that when you're 70 you you're still alive like what is that oh well you like working out I'm fucking going for it yeah I'm going for it Ari I like being exhausted makes me feel better I like those 90 minute yoga classes I like running hills I like kickboxing I like G Jitsu I like going hard I like going harder when I can't go hard anymore yeah I'll stop right now I can still go hard it's amazing that we're friends because I really enjoy the the not moving moving to enjoy not moving but I've got caveman genes dude there's this is something inside me I got a squash yeah you're like part part wild well I try to be as nice as possible but there's there's definitely some shit in me especially for my my childhood all my childhood I grew up fighting in martial arts tournaments that is not a good way for your brain to develop with violent combat sports every day the week I devote time you're 15 to the time you're like 22 just that's not good it's just you can do it with proper guidance and become a nice person and I'm not not down you can but when your whole life is about kicking people unconscious for years it's only about that yeah and that's what does also the time when you're going through puberty that's also time where you're learning about my art yeah yeah yeah so for me it's like that that door is always open you gotta throw water on that fire all the time you gotta get out there with the hose everyday doesn't matter if you feel like it or not just don't let that fire ever just want to strangle somebody in like life no no it's remarkably not I don't know that's also cuz I do it all right dude you Jitsu or lift a lot of weights beat beat beat up the punch of my energy bags probably but you don't even think sometimes you're like as you pass somebody cuts you off of traffic and just like way too close you don't like well someone was talking shit and getting mean to me yeah it's very nice to know that you could fuck people yeah it's very nice to know it's very it's very nice like if you see some guy like some average body dude who thinks he's a badass cuz he talks shit he's mean and stupid and he might take a swing at you and you see one of those guys it's very good that you are the one who gets to decide what happens yeah and you could teach someone a very very severe lesson and let them know hey motherfucker know there's people like me out here I'll break both your arms and leave you here that'd be so bad I'll just snap on both crack crack good luck well good luck fuckface hope you don't lose them there's a lot of mean people out there I'm a nice guy nice yeah so if I run into a mean person I want to be the one who gets to decide if you're because I get I know I want to be the one who gets to serve somebody gets hurt there's too many people out there that'll just take sucker punches at people and hurt people this I see it all the time online right I'm sure you see it there's so many videos of people hating people and doing fucked-up things to people for no reason oh yeah sorry punches yeah knockout videos too did not tell her old lady there was anybody was an old lady that was waiting in line like a grocery store it's when he punched her it was like knockout and then punched her I don't remember it I just remember a video of somebody some kid hitting an old lady boys one person takes it too far it was a horrible one of some kids they knocked out this guy's he was getting off of a subway I think it was in Chicago and just crack this guy and he fell face-first out cold on the concrete bounced off the concrete I was like oh my god and the guy was old - it wasn't a healthy person like that is something that can literally change the rest of your fucking life these kids are just doing it and laughing and jumping on a train whoa yeah there was a lot of people doing things like that for a while fuckin Harvard kids that's what it is it's all those Yale fucks you know know their money and their fucking fancy grades they want to rebell they got crack old people I see people studying at NYU all the time it's so weird look at them in the library why is it weird it's just like a different time of your life okay like studying all the time right and grind yeah it's just like I don't know they're College it just look like they have a whole world ahead of them it just looks so fucking enviable just learning well it is in some ways but it's also like this is a weird time to go to school you know yeah my friends a teacher at a liberal arts college whoo she's like people just aren't very happy yeah it's all about change and progress social justice and you can't just have like a fun time it has to be for a reason why is what happened there what happened to having an 80s night party can't do that it's camp rotation no yeah culturally appropriate I mean they had to suffer with no internet that's right we had fuckers but I mean just not in terms like who they're offending but just in terms of like they have to be fighting against something and you know it's a terrible existence are you allowed to dress up as a civil war soldier if you're from the north you can't be a Confederate soldier are you allowed to carry swords exact hearkens something in harbin powers you can definitely be a Union soldier right you could be ulysses s grant that's another I can see going both ways I could see somebody going that reminds me of this a war which is my slavery so that's that's hurtful and someone else could be like no I'm honoring the people who fought for freedom and then they're like then they could go back to why is it only the white experience to be able to fight for freedom do you realize that if you went back in time you around the Civil War you'd be a giant you just run over people and stomp them because they're all shorter but they're so tiny I already had good food oh yeah in the 1860s I think the average size for a man that was in the Army was like 125 pounds well I could definitely be one of those doctors I'd be like cut it off have you tape yeah those doctors had it made nobody made it cut it off doctor it's a bloody toe cut it enough a leg it could get a disease or we could all die you got these uh glass tubes glass tips you put them on there or that's Paul they came with it tallest average in the world at the time was five seven right during the Civil War for American man third tallest average yeah was that mean that means like the first average is like six feet tall astute all estabiish a verge tallest person third tallest was five foot seven I understand what you mean the average like if there's an average what's the average the tallest average height I got the peak what is it is it six four five yeah average eyes from all over to the year average for the people that are alive so what year would that be 1866 Civil War time period the average is five seven does the third highest third highest height average that we've ever had no during that time what do you mean that was thirds the people that lived during that time during 1866 that was a third highest average average so if you had first highest average like I mean first highest average well the average height of people what is the highest like four so England couldn't hire those you can't adjust like you have 30 like say if you have you only have 90 people right yeah just average 30 of them are six foot one and above thirty of them are six foot one two five foot ten thirty of them are 5 foot 7 foot test out that means the univers are high what are you choosing the 30 30 30 it's just no no no tight right but the number of humans the overall number of humans see what I'm saying when I said that's why I broke it down to 90 right so you have three groups if you have 90 people if it was a third highest average like we're the third tallest in the world they're even did she understand what I'm saying all right hold on stop third percentile is in the oven if we have 90 people if you earn 30 30 and 30 and 30 right if that's what you have okay then that's obviously the third high you're almost even in the numbers that are represented by each individual category of height so it's five ten to six foot two is one group that's 30 people live outside it because you 30 I'm just saying this so you can understand what the third highest percentage means it's based on the number of overall people so if there's 200 mm so as only three percent n instead of 90 people let's say there's 90 million people okay well 30 million of them are 5 foot 6 foot percentage what we'd have to find that out highest percentage was 5 foot 7 which means that out of these millions of people that were alive back on top the 3rd 3 hours at the lowest confusing stat no fucking way you might be confused on the word 3rd it's not a 1/3 it's third place yeah a place for average male in America 37 that's why you're not getting it where I split over at 37th as of today Americans the United States so right but you're talking about the average height was that for America in 1866 American soldiers were tall by the standards at the time for a mother-in-law yes country but people are so tiny back then that third highest height the third highest category was 5 foot 7 oh we were just the ranked third country we were the third of all that that's not right I'm confused on why you guys are not going on the same page here I think you're both saying the same thing the third grouping of people average is 5 7 which is what you were saying with that I thought you were saying average height of people in 1966 the 3rd average height of people was 5 foot 7 does that what you're saying wait wait wait like yeah America ranked third of all the countries yes that's what it is and we were average height five seven at the time the average height of a male was five seven the third tallest males in the world today it is thirty seventh oh that's a cute fuse ecstatic yeah it is we ranked third of all the countries Americans were five foot seven on average but the average height in 1918 66 was five foot seven they do that I guarantee you that's food nobody had any goddamn for women were five thirty will starve to death back then probably a lot it probably is a lot as people start today and if everybody's that little it's the same genes how the fuck is in a hundred years plus what is 150 years how do people get so much bigger how do you get photo make you months here - no one gives it up I wanna do a mini stand next to someone like Alistair Overeem or someone yeah how do you make Holland the old Dutch dude how do you get that house someone get that big those are the Vikings right oh yeah Rico Verhoeven he's the glory heavyweight kickboxing champion it's Breeden he's fucking giant dreaming that's how you see a giant fight all is fucked adult yeah that's how you get a Brock Lesnar shit isn't magic it's real simple the conquerors fuck all the hottest women and then they make babies and then in 2015 you get that guy what it is German Shepherds in Chihuahuas and you have like red BAM that's to me why CRISPR is so fascinating what's CRISPR CRISPR is gene editing technology that they're they're currently using on live human beings now they're doing what the first test now on live human beings yeah it's gene editing technology that came up with what well I know I'm gonna butcher this but they it's a tool that they recognize that bacteria carry like certain signals and they figured out how to edit genes using what they learned from how bacteria carry these signals I know I'm butchering this but they're getting better and better with the tools and they're getting to a point where they're able to isolate certain genes like in China they were able to give people HIV avoidance resistance to HIV and it really the code but it also had some sort of a positive effect on their intelligence with it for one and is yeah as a bunch of weird like good but I think that's speculated but there's a bunch of weird chain reaction things they're not entirely certain of that's why I'm saying it's unethical this experiment on people but they're doing it about your ethics I'm gonna have a super kid someone's gonna have a goddamn incredible hostage or ethics well my kid fucking smashes your village well you once a country decides they're gonna pull the trigger on super people everyone else has to keep do you imagine what it's like the troops is twenty troops what if all porn by the year 2050 is Chinese guys with giant hogs oh it's all because that's all they are that's not the world I want to live in every Chinese guy is seven foot tall and they'll have a giant hog Wow they're like we're sick of it we're sick of it revenge they're all seven feet tall how's it feel now giant Brock Lesnar bones and huge hogs like like twelve year old kids legs and they're just banging everything that moves just fucking their way further they're better the world I mean once if one country pulls the trigger and they decide they're gonna make super people everyone would have to catch up but it's it's almost like the internet right if we said hey we can't allow people to communicate openly and freely we can't allow an an even distribution of all the information in the world it's just too much power we're just giving away to people we got to stop this we got it we got to make this only for a few people if they did that what would what would the world fucking be a totally different place but they didn't do that and if someone doesn't stop them before they make super people real they say listen we can't do this super people because then there's going to be everyone's gonna be a person and no one is gonna be no one's gonna have body issues no one's good because everyone's gonna be perfect yeah we can't define ways will find other browser too big I don't like the way your nostrils flare yeah yeah and then everybody might be a super person yeah that'd be great that's a hundred percent possible that's that's within a hundred years they're probably gonna be able to engineer most things about people as something catastrophic happens to us remember that Van Damme movie which was a so soul John you know Universal Soldier is that what it was about yeah I was just like look I think that genetically augmented soldiers with enhanced self-healing abilities and superior strategy bien jean-claude van damme ahead of his motherfucking time he had a scene in Timecop remember there was like a scene where he went back in time with a machine gun it was fucking people up like in the Civil War days or something like that do you remember that well somebody else did didn't see that movie yeah yeah yeah somebody else did that's what was somebody else in time cop was like a bad cop I think that went back it did bad things they were like going back and stealing gold and shit and coming back with the gold yeah it's the guy he's going after it oh wow that's right so that dude see if you find the videos in civil war injury yeah yeah yeah Civil War this is fucking great because I've always thought like man how cool would it be to go back in time like to the you know any any time and you know the fucking the history of the Spartans and and see somebody show up out of nowhere with a machine gun so he's asking these people asking for the gold and they pull out their gun and he's just fuckin guns him down two fists with machine guns or laser beams didn't shoot the horses though interesting how amazing accuracy very good my strained yeah probably trained didn't look like it though didn't look like he had like real solid tactical training with the you step but that was that scene I was thought like that would be a cool scene in a movie dude what are our lives we sit here and talk talk to everybody you it's like that's our jobs now yeah and then you just do stand-up at night yeah we just have our own fucking stupid radio show you just do acid would you do it's crazy yeah you made you pay your rent off through fucking ads yeah yeah it's amazing it's way better than a job job oh my god what people ask me why do I keep telling people to do it that's why to do what to do podcast yeah and people you told too many people to do podcast why so there's more choice are you fuckin elitist cunt don't be silly everybody should do this you should do if you listening to me and you're upset that I'm saying it's probably cuz you need to do your own podcast you know I'm right that's just a many not everybody should do podcast don't ya you relax it should be but a lot of people could a lot of people could it's a viable job option that's all I'm saying it's a job option you can control yourself to bill you so you go fuck fuck do it you got lucky you got in early although you won't be this big but fun time anything can happen you just sit around talking shit you fucking record it yeah yeah that's amazing yeah and this is uh it's also a lot like the internet and nobody saw this coming nobody felt like the biggest broadcast show is gonna be something that someone just

first fight did that it is for this wait he fought twice looking Paul they got it a year ago yeah it was a amateur fight that time and this is a professional fight yeah it's professional six round fight huh and it was the headliner of a card where Billy Joe Saunders fight Billy Joe Saunders one of the best fighters in the world he's an elite fighter world champion he defended his title on the undercard of to YouTube guys fighting know how much of an insult is that for him I'm sure he's just like I'm getting paid we got a fuckin views too more views it's good for him wow that's crazy what a killer it's all about the fucking dollar nobody gives a shit about the art do they're two youtubers fighting yeah there's no art Brian I mean there's there's some art to it right it's a creation there's some drama a lot of shits going down yeah but I'm saying the other guy's a fucking Billy Joe Saunders yeah buddy for him people don't know who he is you didn't know he is right now you do see it's like it's good so one by knockout he won by knockout so it was good good showcase for him he's a vicious he should a challenge Logan Paul next oh he'll kill this really I was a winner of this fight can't do that like a lot more money no not the same way class Billy Joe Saunders is like 1 or 2 with he's light heavyweight what is he is he super middleweight Google what he is I think he has Billy just on his beat him with his right arm tied behind his back it wouldn't be fair at all it'd be horrible but that guy is an elite world champion boxer and Logan Paul had one fight splint on his leg right arm tied behind his back you know something will be for Logan Paul someone did that jason Ellis is so crazy you had a fight where who did he do it with Shane Carwin that's right oh my god that makes it even more crazy that's right Shane Carwin who's one of the biggest punching heavyweights in the history of the fucking sport he made Shane Carwin tape his arm to his body look at this so he's got his right arm taped to his body and he's just blast him with lots and - Shane Carwin was a fucking murderer a murderer dude this is such a ridiculous idea friend there's so much lighter dude that guy's a giant oh my god he hasn't even really tried to hit him yet dude when I was taking jujitsu in Boulder yeah um I was on the math he's just got left this is only needs man what he scooped him up for some reason at one point time just to joke around to pick him up but uh when I was there I was training at uh there jujitsu school and this guy walked in there as a left hook fucking terrible idea yeah look at that watch that punch again he's so big man he's so big one backed it up a little bit look at this oh right on it he was trying it till he got him he's so bit a little bit of movement separation he's just way too strong a way way way way way way too strong to him anyway that guy walked in when I was doing jujitsu I was rolling car was that I was like it's not a cartoon person what is that he was that at the time was probably close to 300 pounds he's so big it's ridiculous - he's got like a body arms like where your body is that's his arms and deferred Ellis be so crazy these will be willing to have a boxing match punched in the head that's words he's a fighter with Jack a spurts fuck all that noise you can get some neverending headaches would you fight now what I no no listen to what I'm saying I know but like not one of those guys some of the celebrity many people that are having real problems with their head really yes a lot of fighters like post-career are having real struggles it's not it's no joke man you got to know when to stop and head injuries are that about head gear that's worse well head gear doesn't help head gear makes your head like a bigger target it's easier to hit and then also when you get hit it act it's like it's unnatural fulcrum all its fucking weight on your head yeah I think you're probably good thing about it is you're trying to avoid cuts that's what head gear is good for it's good for your warning card okay but you can get fucked up with a punch or a kick wearing head gear yeah big gloves help a little bit yeah big gloves still get your fucking brains rattled sure I talked about having a fight but he won't fight me no don't get your brains rattled dude it won't be me I guess he's worth herself not hurting himself yeah I couldn't hurt yeah and his mom was worried about it too what he trying to say trying to talk shit says his mom's worried about him no I know I love him he's worried about where he's gonna fuck him out was that were you saying yeah I think that's overall I stepped away from the fight yeah if I had a fight against I was trying to figure out what's going to try to find me won't find me why do you want to fight him you guys work together yeah I know but he's talked about this fight forever and he won't fight me forever yeah you would do this I know you would know for sure do you think you would not fight higher sober probably no I don't know maybe I trains high all the time with that he encouraged it yeah always it's great would you um I'm not sure see if I was high that'd be a negative bear muck bare-knuckle you think I was not thinking about all those thing the big gloves but that's W one way to go I don't think bear not going down bare-knuckle open hand my combat slap I poked in the eye trust she Lewis said break his hand stop fighting today did he really broke it's a quick fix though I think so what he hit it Jane head real hard he's got a super wide yeah he's got big bones @j yeah how was gangster you went on fun yeah we were so high though dude and it was the day after sober October was over uh blitzkrieged and they kept rollin blunts and passed him around and I was and I had to pronounce some Russian names two hours later you know cut for the way ya do the weigh-ins two hours later so this is them slap fighting Jeremiah is ready Oh him and Jeremiah that's when he brought them I just let him up Jeremiah changed stance he knows how to use that fucking he goes for the block - he goes backhanded uh-oh he's toying with them whoa another round two - Jeremiah slapped oh my god oh shit Louis what he fake boxes he touches you you learn had a box from fuckin Catholic school I thank you to Kansas somewhere yeah for real yeah this hit a slap cattle on the fucking he learned Louis's outclassed by this 130 pounder he's bigger than that Oh losses - angle dude this is a slap Tom saw this is a real slap fight this is real slap fight yeah this isn't like some guys playing silly Gomez cracked oh that's the kind of fighting that got your dad stabbed to death region of skanks slap boxing oh my god say something kinky ko'd slap box and don't get confused look at him he just had a fire that was like a fight fight y'all go out for this he had some of the famous round - are they gonna go - oh it goes you know what like this keep going please what are you doing Wayne you shut this off I'm not that wrong oh my gosh honey Luis is so serious right now well what Jeremiah's doing I mean it's telling what they're doing but he's waiting he's putting his hand out they spawn and Luis throws these combination Jeremiah's waiting him he's catching him as he's coming in where'd you compare him to enter silver a little bit a little bit the way he's like baby powder fighting yes counter fighting and he's also being very smart with his defense and Luis got a little feel for that right hand a little worried about right hand doesn't wanna that thing's coming down it's a good he's got a good reached a keeps blocking on the side of jeremías not touching you Oh Oh Louis can't help but want to close his fist yeah getting real close Jeremiah circling that's a good move as well but Luis is closing the distance he looks very angry who's serious he's going back to his room Iowa crying oh he's getting very aggressive Jeremiah might be losing steam oh he's taking big reaches there's another round after this jermiah doing this yeah that's gotta be one more Oh keep it moving please let's see the next round oh my god so I just kept doing rounds look he's got his back turned and shit this is hilarious guys I'm so glad these guys are alive they're just so ridiculous yeah they're they're pushing wild comedy dude right now go as far as I go on they just course not it's just such an open environment for doing whatever it's also in support of like like I said wild comedy but you need that one need that you need two people gather round ratings out obviously people love it oh but good German soul a key takes away Palm Springs Lewis is relaxing a little bit more now and he's starting to use some technique that was some nonsense right there hey look like you just punched him in the seat well if he looks like he's closing his time he smacked him hard in the head with that right hand I haven't slapped Jeremiah got twice yeah you can slap I mean you could jab Oh Lewis just smacked him loose well he went to the body with a punch dude he's he's punching do de Souza he's is he slapping to the body punching to the body can't help it he's an oath he's uneducated which is a lot of his problem the concept you recommend to him what what books would you recommend him he'll play soccer up with that right hand - he got lit up he got lit up oh my god revising the metric he's trying hard to come worse the round is over at Lewis still punching fucking trash oh wow is that it I mean he won that fight he's all he's got Jeremias heels Jeremiah won the first round second round I say was a wash I'm definitely not I didn't judge it no people are saying one more round okay was to see Jeremiah takes it I can see it is all who would want to Wow well listen he did crack him with some papers all based on round two and that was close big shots look at Jeremiah slap boxing people that look at Ain full as fuck like his face is raw oh my god they might have to have a rematch this whole way nobody let me taste em about slapping people in the face slap me view of the face is open hands open hands hitting your eyeball you gonna scratch your fucking eye and you gonna have a real eye injury that's how I'm not saying I'm not saying don't get shot at your job you do whatever you want but I want you to know that open hand slapping and reaching like that you just ask as someone who's seen probably 500 people get poked in the eye up close you're gonna get poked in the eye too great that is the best way to incapacitate someone don't do it though and what don't do that don't know don't flies yeah don't do if you need to win use this like I like your technique walk goggles those little slits come on your eyes and that's a good way to get those things whacked off growing our nails out - maybe if you had some eye goggles like legit little welding goggles or some shit some school guards there you go but they don't beam it would almost be worse for you because it will fuck with your peripheral if you didn't get used to slapping people when you have things on this one thing I always hated about headgear you put them on you can't see things here and here good your window of your field of view gets narrowed yeah it becomes a problem when you get close you don't see where punches are coming you know see what the goggles yeah headgear that's nicer coming you don't see things coming so I would think that would be the same thing with those goggles yeah swimmers goggles I think these fuck oh yeah yeah we fuck up a lot don't fuck with your peripheral all those things would fuck with your peripheral yeah no way you don't see anything coming but unless you trained with them on if you trained with them on maybe you could do it but also used to but still cuts you down you could also just touch your goggles with their face then we get their sweat all over your goggles then you wouldn't be able to see as good another good technique yeah they're both wearing goggles though so it's fair but they would both do that it was fucking you up you wouldn't be able to see that good what your wife but we should see what what's in front of you I'd like let's just fight let's just cut this shit put some gloves on and fight you already say that if we're gonna slap fight let's just let's just fight I want to be able to take you down strangle you this is nonsense for amateur in the eyes you know smearing each other's fucking God think we've been enough just straight jujitsu fight between you and Louis cuz he thinks him that's hilarious he's watched over a hundred UFC fights he's a big fellow though he is so bad probably good at it yeah he's a big tough he lay on you weigh 330 he's lost though that's a lot he's lost over 20 pounds no he's not that big oh well he's back he's ballooned he trying to start a fight with him I am NOT I'm just saying he has ballooned I was guessing a high weight at Sodor special when he taped it I was like what you say I said what are you like 248 he goes like 250 I was like I was guessing high I thought it'd be 220 that's a big fellow yeah face big period like that guy just you know if he died it down and got ripped he's still 215 220 pounds the big fella yeah he lost 45 pounds he'd be 215 see that big Matt seems big coach I don't know sometimes you like don't

that is hard that as long as you're a good person who gives a shit if you grow up yeah what is happening what are we doing we have a finite time here we're deciding we want people to behave in a certain way all you want people just don't be an asshole doesn't matter if you grow up or not grow up yeah this guy's like dice are having a great fucking time it was somebody like one thing he's gonna die and I hope he dies in the middle of a prank I know people don't realize how would you make him happy make him sometimes stays dead never we're just kept waiting that's what's the option and what's option number two nobody's living forever folks it's not happening this is as good as it gets I will tell you if dice dies on stage and your comic in the area and you have to at some point people start to realize oh fuck this is not a prank you know yeah if you get up there and realize he's dead right you should say okay and then stand up black its fucking gag and then just leave it up there for a while longer yeah see how long you keep it going he would have wanted it that way yeah I think so yeah for sure yeah yeah he's nuts he's just funny it's just a way to live he made Norton and and and Florentine introduced him like they go into a Subway sandwich shop in the black ladies and gentlemen avert your eyes the ledger just coming in and he was like walk in for a Subway sandwich shop that's hilarious yeah there'll be a great show you have just dice on the road and someone announces him like that everywhere he goes yeah peasants please the legend clear the floor he banned me from his house for a year once would you do I didn't do he doses kids I did not know I would never do that mostly I'm scared of dice he said he had a gun in his in his desk drawer and I was like no you don't no way you would never have him around your kids because I do and he said he'd bet me $200 and I'm like you know I don't have $200 so I can't make that bet and he goes on it well I do and then he threes all left his thing goes don't look in there and I'm like I'm not gonna look in there you just don't fucking look in there but I won't and then Freddie Soto fucking fuckface Freddie Soto fuckface told him I was just in the office told him that I went into his drawer he said I was rifling through his drawers and dice like that's it it's a lie was a lie by Freddie total endives like you're out you're banned from the house couldn't go to barbecues anymore yeah I was rifling through his affairs which never happened dice I never did that I was in the room why do you think Freddie did that well of course cuz of that reason cuz he's that cuz he got me banned he wanted to get you back yeah why do you why do you think Freddie would want to get you man I think he was jealous of my upbringing and how I had a foosball table at home and it always bothered him they didn't have that growing up in Texas interesting maybe interesting I'm not sure but the point is I never referred those Affairs you know what Burt said once it was really freaky no he was high too so don't take this with a grain of salt Burt goes I don't think you ever die I go what are you talking about people died it was prove it you haven't died I don't think you died prove it's a good one though here's the thing prove it's a good like good point sorta yeah but what are you saying that like I've had enough people come on this podcast that have you semi convinced that you're living in some sort of simulation what does he think happens that's a good question what do you think you think that when the when we have seen bodies no longer have life in them right right but that's not you it's not him so those people are all just the players I don't know I don't know what he's saying is he saying he's that he's the only thing in the universe I've heard that theory or is he saying like none of us died what if everyone was the only person in their own universe and everyone's universe intersects with other people's universes and that you think that the universe you exist in is the same as one that I exist in because we hang out together yeah but the actual universe in your world is revolved around you and in your worlds dun dun dun my Rahl's army kept it to move real quick yes once one guy becomes realized that he's in that he's able to travel to other universes has to kill the one person from each universe that could be a person yeah time travel space no one will find him yeah it's it's been made I believe where they're finishing it now it's coming out next year with Ryan Reynolds which plays an NPC character in a video game that realizes he's oh yeah yeah in like oh whatever hilarity ensues oh that's funny it's a comedy I don't know character that's like the older diss right there called someone an NPC that means you're just like a dead on just like a walking like walking into a wall yeah it's got pulling nails out of wood yeah by the way if anyone makes that movie you're welcome to we both give you permission yeah go ahead we want tickets to the premiere yeah we want and say it's based on a conversation between Ari Shaffir and Joe Rogan the Joe Rogan experience and Ari Shaffir is taping of his new motherfucking comedy special will be February 8th New York Manhattan right near Washington Square Park at the Skirball Center and re the great calm I think I turn around for tickets I'll post up my Twitter my Instagram and and dude yeah February 2 shows like after all these years you still are slurring your words together like you would almost like especially when we do tag-team when you're introducing people's like your fucking words I'll make four into two sometimes I'll get 7 into 3 that's uh that's a punch-drunk thing to you know do you think I'm punching no I don't think oh I but that I know you're not in fact but some people who are one of the things is they start slurring their words together they say hey they're all of them they all sound the same like they started talking about like yeah but they can't get their mouth to move as fast as their brain something's wrong there's just yeah this shit's not firing right brain damage son that's we were talking about earlier I know too many people that have been hit in the head no it's just after a while man and the thing is you can retire now and you start getting headaches like three four years from now thinking depression might set in five six years from now yeah seven eight years from now you might have memory issues it's not a simple like it's really like here you are right now like as if you stopped fighting like right now today I think I stopped fighting in a good time I got my faculties I'm all fine right now yeah maybe but maybe all the times you've been hit over those years leading up to that is going to start to kick in years from now that's why you see some fighters they're fine when they retire but then you see them ten years after they retire and you could barely understand a word they're saying that's what's going on there that's when it's kicking in people that I have heart disease like years after they stopped doing coke is that true yeah that makes its their hearts just go weaker yeah that makes sense I long for the day when they figure out how to revitalize brains when they figure out how to whether it's through stem cells or snorting stem cell snorting it yeah yeah suck one of those Chinese guys giant monster dick and that's where the best stem cells are Matterhorn that was the only way to fix TBI you had a suck a giant they didn't stick that's right we have their pure and also a cat we have shot it right into these monster cocks that would be the Chinese porn film these guys that would be the debut the only way to cure brain damage would be you'd have to suck one of their cocks and I get these old football players they're bad knees and suck these giant Chinese cocks and they're like what if but what is sucking this cock the act of it gave me more depression and they're like well no no the cure is so good so yummy you're gonna love it you're gonna want to suck all the cocks it's like the first card what's hard is like just go ahead and jump in the queue you just get in there and suck that Cup first one is the biggest once you already a cocksucker yeah worried about just suck suck to your heart's content now he's happy cuz it tastes good the shames gone it's over yeah and it cures all of his brain damage fixes he was getting these treatments all the time you have women like Botox women that are addicted to it you have that I'm gonna feel great that's where all of the best stem cells came from they came from a dude's dick and if you really wanted to get them get them right from the tap because you can't have them in air they die instantly yeah so you got to literally take it from the cock to your mouth sorry there's no other way Oh Jamie Jamie's like I'd rather have brain damage can I picture a movie sure okay so do with cocks yes it does it's a lot of that so these Chinese guys are actually bred in a lab to make they're not out in the streets but then they get there but that's just some milk them for their fucking produce juice you know right but super sperm and they get out they get out a lot one didn't lock the door oh yeah then it sees moths or guys and that people want to kill him but also don't kill them we need their sperm right so that it's first they try to capture alive they're also massive dudes and then people want to suck a dick so when they were about to be caught maybe that ought something to do with it right the cops in the backseat sucking his dick when they're arrest and that's how they'll get out a bunch I got a bad back you mind before we go in there come on I get it come on back here I'll ask ya that would be the greatest fucking gay porno of all time that would that's a really shit well Superman engineered Superman with the giant hard dick and everybody wants to suck his dick because it cures all of your ailments yeah and he wants out to live as free life I better not add a CL since 86 it's too important I'll suck it oh that's all you have to do that's they've done research they know but imagine if that was the only way get curious stem cells it was like Jesus touching you yeah yeah I mean it's the labs he would constantly escape like yeah how much do you make a year officer fifty grand all right what are you hurt you got stabbed and you want mmm I can I can just open your mouth a jerk-off and you don't have to suck it you wash got the cancer yours go cancer you can shotgun it for ride you don't have shit on a second shotgun it take when just pretend you're sucking on your own already go through no spitting in the mouth spinner
