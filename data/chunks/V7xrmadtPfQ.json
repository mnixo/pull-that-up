hello freak bitches so ridiculous but women's bantamweight division is filled with fucking killers now there's so many good fighters it's like they're trading titles and they're the main events which I'll use I like that that's a big big deal women's sports you know they don't well it's definitely a big deal for the biggest pay-per-view ever I mean obviously it wasn't going to be if Jon Jones didn't test positive for something I get it but because he did its yeah so to it yet is he saying what he did no no he's not he's not saying anything GOP son and leaked the information during my last podcast it's out now has leaked out information could be is that what he said to me out there I know nothing I didn't hear anything about honestly I'm in a weird position because I don't think you're supposed to I don't think he's supposed to anybody's supposed to be talking about the medical results until like it gets released I don't know how it works I really don't want to plead ignorance right I plead ignorance all day rattled name I think he probably took boner pills because that's they have all that shit in them you know like they have boner pills have steroids and home date because I just found a Jo's gas station over here it has like the best right I've never seen these right on is known for his love of the boner pill he's what you call a boner pill connoisseur he's actually read blogs about boner pills and directed me to reviews of boner pills yeah terrified but they mean these things have steroids in them they have a bunch stuff and if you already it wasn't the last thing he got busted for cocaine or something if you bus if you do cocaine a lot of guys take these because you can get hard off I haven't cocaine and so if he takes boner pills then he's gonna test this is a little too much speculation deeply respect
