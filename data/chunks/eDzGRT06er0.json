you know well scarves guns like that who does Jesse James remember Jesse James that the chopper chopper dude yeah yeah that dude makes guns now in Texas that's all he does he's still making bikes I think he makes bikes too but it makes a lot of guns like dope guns like engrave and hand carve them yeah fancy fancy guns yeah they do that we were talking about he's a he's an LA guy but he hand does them he's a Mexican gentleman Mexican dude a Mexican man's carves into the guns yeah it carves any does beautiful artwork all hand design and then people pay him to do his design they don't suggest a like here's what I want the whole deal is you give him the gun and he just does it it's not like I want this on here he's like no no no you give me the piece I do the art I give it back you know what's interesting about Bernie Sanders what is this is this the guy yeah this looks like I was gonna say what's interested about Bernie Sanders is his real close relationship with killer Mike killer Mike is a big Pro Second Amendment man I mean he believes in guns he believes he should be able to protect yourself and protect your family and one in Bernie so against then well I don't know Bernie so against it because he talks to killer Mike they don't scream and yell at each other killer Mike in good montt we don't need guns I don't think we need guns in the post in the Northeast how did he do yesterday he won Vermont California Colorado Utah and then is that it and then Biden Biden still in the lead right is Biden number one now he's ahead 435 to 381 as of right now that's pretty good Elizabeth Elizabeth let me tell you something I worry about both of them because they're older gentlemen but I worry about Biden more he looks like he's like it's almost like his skin is thin well I think his brain seems to be skipping do you mean it's almost got like an old scratch DVD well you got to realize he's fucking tired dude just forget about just being old doing the pace that he's doing he's fucking crazy he's got to get on that Trump speed sudafed from Germany my poppers again he's got the best shit already ranking on them it's already hilarious you see what he did Mike for Mike bloomer he hid under the the podium he pretend he was Mike bloom tiny Mike yeah and he's called him sleepy Joe he's doing stand-up that's really I say it on stage he ripped he fucking rips did you see the clip from the other day where he's like this guy this guy Mexican he says he's max can you really Mexican Mexican he's Mexican like I'm Native American I'm Elizabeth Warren I think he was ripping and they were losing it he rips he's funny he's funny his funny shit and yeah we were talking about this yesterday Mike he's got a lifetime of experience at being in front of the camera he knows how to do it he's a showman well it's like everything else like podcasts or stand-up or I would imagine any kind of public speaking the more you do it the better you get at it the more you realize your mistakes and where you tighten up your game right the more practice you get and he gets a lot of practice I mean he's doing public speaking all the time and when he gets to do something where they're all on his side it's probably fun like those things he did that he does when they're all on his side so some good times that's what you ripping an arena that's basically what it is he's not playing the club he's playing a fucking sold-out arena that are like bring out Rob if he brought other guys to do ten in front of him you know like a muppet shit bring jarrod and the table but once he's out of the White House he's gonna be more popular than ever a hundred he's going to be a hero cuz let me tell you something people forget this but they they didn't like Ronald Reagan when he was in office George Bush well but Reagan is a big one though because Reagan became like this hero afterwards but during the whole iran-contra thing when he was going on television say he doesn't remember do you know what Jimmy tingle is a great stand-up comic from Boston but he had a joke I remember I was an open mic back in the 80s when Reagan was brought in front of whoever was it Congress said he had talking about selling guns to Iran when he did it he would say I don't remember that's what Reagan was saying and he might not remember because he really did have Alzheimer's remember I said Jimmy tingles mr. president just here's a little tip if you ever sell guns to someone who hates us shot it down [Laughter] on the refrigerator yeah he got love let me I have no recollection of doing so but and could be my memory I I don't remember well as you sit here now do you have any recollection of the proving for John Poindexter to send these specific letters to Congress well again it's a case of memory I I don't recall they read it or not and my question to you is would you have approved the sending of these letters to Congress by John Poindexter if you knew that they adopted false information that had been previously supported that's crazy that's a problem - there's so much rhetoric involved I don't even know what that question was he they pile on all these things and then you go I don't know I have no idea what you're saying what are you asking me right there's so much legalese right at some point at some point he does seem trapped in too many questions it's kind of like I watch that clip of Betsy DeVos and that Wisconsin senator going at it about how she doesn't know the numbers for charter schools you know I don't know if you've seen this but she's unaware of the numbers presented of Cha how many charter schools fail but he's throwing so many statistics at her how could you even keep up I mean she does sound like a bumbling Dumbo but that's what you just bury someone with stats they're gonna go I don't right how do i where am I I don't even know which one you want me to address and I don't have any information in front of me to fight it so when they do that sometimes the politicians I'm always like of course they're gonna drown how could he fight out of that yeah clearly that's like a combat strategy unless you're Trump and then you just he diverts he's so good he'll take in all that stuff and then I go well he's never been in this kind of a situation where he had to answer question yet in a court not yeah that would be interesting if fuck yeah he I think he'd probably get in trouble cuz like a lot of his stuff is like shutting things down and he could get out of order but my point is like we both know like even if someone's good at that right if they do that and they hit you with a bunch of stats and fucks you up so hard you can't answer their original question and you know you're supposed to be grilling them mm-hmm we know what you're doing are you're not communicating in a way that you you are actually trying to communicate with the person you're playing verbal warfare you're trying you're fighting you're trying to back them up in their heels and smother it smother their their reach and get them in a corner and write and pound on them that's what you do and you're overwhelming and when the barrage of information just like you would overwhelm someone with a barrage of punches it's the same thing when you see their weakness feel it's not the same thing because you're not supposed to be doing that you're supposed to be having an exchange he's supposed to be talking to each other you know he's supposed to be you someone get into the bottom of it but we know that he doesn't want to tell the truth he doesn't want to go yes I did so guns to Iran I sell guns and I sold cocaine in the inner cities of Los Angeles because I was trying to crack crack crack I induced crack into the streets I mean all that stuff really did happen yeah that's not a conspiracy theory anymore no the CIA or whoever was working for the CIA sold drugs in the inner cities was brought in through Freeway Ricky who's the original Rick were real Rick Ross the real Rick Ross didn't even know what he was doing while he was doing it and then after it was over like these guys didn't figure it out until like long past right that they were working with the government like Rick Ross had no idea no I just thought it was awesome and selling coke you know he was like completely protected yeah that's kind do you watch the pharmacists each one completely protected but I should say that he was in bed with the government right do you watch them the pharmacists you know what is that that's all about the the distribution of oxycontin and specifically like the what it's done to kind of the East Coast this kind of started in New Orleans the documentaries all about it but up there how it got really bad this pharmacist basically his son I don't want to give it away but his son tragically died and he started investigate like why all this stuff is kind of happening in New Orleans and it at the center was this Purdue Pharma Pharma that made oxycontin the biggest distributor of oxycontin in the United States and the whole documentary kind of shows you how it was just they weren't orchestrating this thing to try to solve people's pain all the documents and emails are just like these are big hitter areas meaning like sell sell sell so all these sales reps were going out pushing you know like they're fucking like they're trying to sell cars I mean they were selling them like and II was crazy I mean the government was totally totally okay with I mean after the FDA didn't have anything against it for a long time they were like they're solving pain so much money staggering it's hard for us to even understand how much money is coming in from pills just from pills and here's the thing about prescribing them this is let's be honest everyone's in pain yeah it's part of being a person yeah if you're and especially if you're an older person that's maybe got a difficult job like you have to carry things and move things around that are heavy you're in fucking pain oh you got back problems everybody has back problems so you go to these people with back problems and like soul poison once you get hooked on soul poison well then what happens is these these doctors this woman Jacqueline Claggett that's who the documentary focuses on she's running a pill mill right so like she's writing 7080 prescriptions a day and you get all these doctors on there that are like that's impossible you see 70 people is not you couldn't do it even if you were flagrant so she was making unbelievable money bro stop it let's break this down by the minute yeah 78 hours in a day yeah so let's let's she said 70 to 80 let's get crazy and say it's 80 right so there's eight hours in the day so she's seen ten people in an hour in an hour yeah ten shower yeah that's not counting lunch no bathroom breaks let's go well she was operating at night that was whole thing this whole investigation was about she would have a New Orleans cop in her Lobby to make sure that nobody was trying to you know trying to bust wrong armor as she paid off the cops crazy no trouble heap a security detail money for taps yeah yeah cops are happy we're all working together in the cops are like what do you mean I'm just protecting the front I'm the cops mind hey he's not breaking the law now he's not he said he knows what's going on in the back cuz he's probably getting chips off a face oh it's the laws very sketchy it was really sketchy back in the day to ever see um who did it who's that who made oxycontin Express what was the company behind that I don't know see we can find that at a movie oh it was a made-for-television thing a PBS showed an investigative report I'm gonna get you the people who were in the tear guard Vanguard did it but who's the woman in the man behind it Mariana van Zeller put it up so I could see it so I could say because they were on the podcast so a really cool way back in the day yeah Mariana van Zeller and wasn't her husband involved in this as well I think so anyway awesome documentary that detailed what was going on down there in Florida they didn't have a database so if you went to me and I was a doctor and you're like my back hurts I'm like you need drugs and I gave you oxycontin you'd like thanks bro and then you go over to Jamie yeah and you go to dr. Jamie hey my my back hurts because you need oxycontin there goes thanks bro and he gives it to you and then you just keep going and so they would go to 10 20 30 different doctors and they have these thing called pain management centers you go to a pain management center you see some solace doctor just sitting there just writing out scripts just and they the only thing they write scripts for is oxycontin's and painkillers and then they go right next door to the pharmacy it's in the same thing you know one door is here one doors here you go right next door and you get your drugs like in the same building right it's a one-stop shop there's no computer system to check so you just keep doing it and look everybody does drugs does drugs for a reason right whether you do real heroin whether you coke like you're doing drugs because I mean might not be a reason that makes sense to you but they want to do those drugs right you can come up with reasons why you want to take painkillers yeah almost anyone everything people are always in pain my shoulder hurts well this is my don't you know take half or one of these half yeah got it I'll take half now and half right after it it's just crazy how many of them there are if you looked at the actual numbers of prescriptions are written every year in this country it's like have you ever taken anything no not that stuff I did a morphine drip once though when I was in the hospital for my knee let's have a reconstruction in like 93 and it was laying there and I was on a continual motion machine I had a patellar tendon graft which means they'd cut a piece out of your bone of your kneecap but a piece of bone out of your shin and connected to a strip of your patellar tendon then they opened you up like a fish and they screw this in on one bone and screw that in another Bowl and they reconstruct you a new ACL it's all hand works great today to this day I throw kicks with it a run with it no problem you were floating on the clouds oh my god so I'm on this machine that keeps your leg moving after so it doesn't stiffen blood doesn't rise this machine's moving like this and this fucking drip I'm hitting this trip hard bang bang bang it's like a warm hug like when I was lying there I was like I get it the only time I've experienced that very similar was when the old nyquil was available the real codeine filled nyquil yeah when it fucked you whoa and I beep I the next morning I was so high I was lying in my bed I felt so good I felt so loved I felt like that like I felt so much better it's like before the drugs I was miserable I had the flu I felt like shit but then as soon as I took that stuff I was like I feel loved I feel like I'm just like floating and soft I get it yeah why people need that I'm the opposite man I fucking I tore ligaments in my leg and I took they gave me vicodin and it had an adverse effect it was so bad I had to go back to the doctor and I was like it's giving me crazy anxiety I couldn't sleep and I ate and I was eating a few of them trying to kill the pain the pain would get worse and the guy was like maybe you maybe vicodin you don't mix but it fucking it made my it made me angry I was going through these like really like night tremor spells and shit I was like this stuff is I couldn't do I never touched it again I mean I people love that stuff I get it yeah he should take vicodins and play guitar and he said it made him really creative really really I I think I took either vicodin or percocet I can't remember after that first knee surgery but I only took it once cuz it made me so stupid I remember adult the pain a little bit but I was so dumb man way your host ology half out of it yeah your brains not full I'd rather be in pain like this is stupid I can't even enjoy a television show no what the fuck is going on I'm laying in my apartment I can't even watch TV cuz I'm just stupid yeah I hate that shit yeah that's the thing that I like and I and I think I have a high tolerance for medication and there's a weird use Hey Hey Joe Joe a functioning alcoholic you can look it up though there's the thing about redheads redheads have a gene where they have high paint ounces and high tolerances to met to certain medicines yes and so every time I've ever taken stuff nothing really works for me the way that it's supposed to you know I mean like people people say all the time like ah what are you just palpable advil advil has never done anything from my whole life if I can take three or four it doesn't fucking mean you know they give you those um you know if you go to a doctor if you got some kind of thing because a headache or whatever and they give you those super advils you know they like to triple the dose or whatever mmm I take those things in there nothing so I end up throwing them away why is it okay to discriminate against redheads it's one of the last fun things to discriminate against people that would still actually hurts their feelings because we're still white [Laughter] like he still has advantages yeah it's actually it's actually when I see like a redheaded black guy I'm like oh man double down Jesus Christ have seen red-headed people that are really good at taking punishment and I've always wondered like I've read things about redheads having a higher tolerance for pain - yeah they do was that that article he brought up they they showed about it's like it's something it's something in I don't know what that there's I'm gonna misquote it but yeah mc1r gene belongs to a family where receptors include pain receptors in the brain as a result a mutation in the gene allows appears rather to influence the body sensitivity to pain that makes sense there's so many Irish dudes who can take a insane beating mm force to end on top of that just the toughness of the Irish people oh they're fucking their background just a redhead from Ireland with that mc1r gene mc1r sounds like a mortal kombat character and c1r it does it sounds like a bike bike yeah the mutation in the mc1r gene also occurs in brunettes although it's less common in the latest study the researchers tested for the mc1r gene variant finding that in 65 of 67 redheads holy shit and in 20 of 77 people with brown or black hair that's interesting so it's uh like what is that like 30-something percent of people that are brown hair but almost but is that like 90 97 90 yeah 8% almost 98 that's crazy so all redheads can take a beating mentally and physically mentally - that's gonna get shit it on we better make it bro you have a mental turtle shell I do yeah I have a mental show you just have to look I think I think every read and I know has an attitude because of how you're treated as a kid yeah but what I've talked about this before people think that it's not a thing it's a thing or if there's a room full of people right and a bunch of PC mongers social-justice words are in the room everyone to be like you can't say anything about him can't anything about her but her if they got to a redhead they'd be like it's it's fine yeah they can it's why that's not that big of a deal why they're still full white like imagine making fun of a handsome white man with blonde hair would you a Hitler's dream yeah probably but otherwise Nazi motherfucker like you get easily and no one would feel bad because it's perceived that they have all the advantages yeah even though that what if they're you know think they're homeless and they're you know how about they're dumb that's the biggest disadvantage of person I ever has if their brain doesn't work how many really handsome dummies do you know I mean most bro I know a couple guys that are dream boats but they're dumb as a rock they're so handsome they have just beautiful faces and perfect cheeks and they just look great stop Jamie races I'd be so excited to meet those guys but part of me says those poor bastards are at a disadvantage because everything's so easy right they're big giant handsome people like you see a six foot tall perfect man like do you know what kind of pussy David Hasselhoff must have been getting in the 80s are you kidding insane you imagine the kind of girl the girls were catapulted himself in his direction it didn't matter like smart or not he was beautiful yeah you know and he was really tall and classically handsome you know that's a giant advantage and if you you have that giant advantage and you don't have to work hard to meet women look at him Jesus Christ what a dreamboat yeah he's a baby fucking kidding me look at that face where's inclusive where's the naked one where he's on the rug that's the funny one right he's a really nice guy too he did sort of Fear Factor Diddy yeah yeah he did celebrity for your factor he this is what's great about back then though you didn't have to have a great body like nobody had a six-pack no one had pecs unless you were a bodybuilder yeah look at them like you looks like a guy who's maybe worked out three times okay yeah right yeah kind of knows where the gyms are yeah like when someone in a hotel goes oh we have a gym and he's like I'll check it out you know hey looks good I love this Nautilus equipment yeah he was uh but but my point being like that guy okay Hey look at that Knoblauch no muscle strong we're just fucking arms there's no muscle structure dude that's crazy do much working out but you don't need to back then you had you could be like a Hollywood dude who didn't ever it's kind like Leonardo DiCaprio might be the only guy who's that famous and good-looking today that has a bad body you bring out his body as shit that dude there's a shit for a famous guy dude he has a dog shit body all the guys in his level are met Brad Pitt Ryan Reynolds all these dudes are jacked as shit just jacked and you see you lean over to Capra on your like this this slubby Plato looking fucking body dude he's so good though I know he's the Pozzo good he's a pump king he gets everything he does whatever he wants he's such a good actor he I mean so good he's won one of my favorite of all time cuz he made movies back then that I loved and now that I might forget how good he is cuz he's so handsome you can forget but then you see a movie like did you see look at his body that's Bert Kreischer if he lost 100 pounds I mean it's a dumpy regular dudes body and look he's not he's not trying to hide it no it's awesome he's seven months pregnant cocaine baby inside his belly leo in his second trimester he can do whatever the fuck he wants he's a fucking modern-day Jack Nicholas but that's why I'm that's that's why I appreciate that would have sound better if I got the name right he's a modern-day Jack Nicholson yeah he's not trying with his fucking body he's just being an amazing actor dude into Django and he played that evil dude unreal fuckin Amen you buy it you believe it yeah so intense that fight scene was one of my when he he fucking hits these intense moments like in the revenant as well it's another movie where he has these moments were like fuck you forget how good that guy is you forget how good he is yeah did you like once upon a time I know you did loved except for Bruce Lee scene but that's I'm a Bruce Lee fan I'm a dork real disrespectful to Bruce Lee it was really it didn't make sense because even though Bruce Lee was very confident he deemed that he was arrogant this was Quentin was saying and there's no you know I don't think I just don't think he was a Bruce Lee fan has any athlete at that caliber not been arrogant well you name me someone that's good and there were things are swirly right because Bruce Lee wasn't like a professional athlete per se he was an actor but he was also one of the most important martial arts pioneers ever right because he was a like a true dyed-in-the-wool innovator and if you look at his skills like when he did the Green Hornet and came a death and OH Chinese connection just his kicking and striking skills off the charts technique beautiful technique and for the time very few people a technique like it like in the later years people's technique improved they got people had a chance to see more styles and video and see more of what's possible but if you go back and watch even like legends like Jim Kelly and like some of those other like Joe Lewis who was a heavyweight kickboxing champion not the box that's playing in movies and their technique was not as good his Bruce Lee's why was his so sharp he just was a genius he's a genius martial artist he understood more about martial arts than anybody book of his era because he understood that everyone was being imprisoned by ideology like if you were a judo guy you had to stick with judo you couldn't learn Muay Thai if you learn Muay Thai you'd be disrespectful to your master disrespectful to your style and people get mad at you when I was training in Taekwondo and then I started kickboxing my instructor did not like it they did not like one of my instructors in particular did not like it didn't think I needed to do it and thought I could get everything that I needed at there but I knew that wasn't true because I was going to gyms again boxed up and I was like okay I'm getting my bell rock I need learn how to use my fucking hands better and I started going to boxing gyms and these that was very like you couldn't do that you weren't supposed to do that like there were a little bit lenient with me because they knew I was a lawyer and I was an instructor I was trying to learn things right but when you go to a kung-fu school if you thought you go to a karate school they would fall could beat you like the people would really kick your ass if they thought you were leaving to go train with the karate school wow it was real weird so back in the day Bruce Lee was the only guy he was training in Wing Chun and quite a few other martial arts he studied but then he started studying Western boxing he started studying wrestling he started studying judo and you know he did some grappling training with gene LeBell who was supposed to kind of represent the Brad Pitt character because the Brad but in a different way the Brad Pitt character is this ultimate badass stunt guy in that movie and him and Bruce Lee get in a fight and you know he kind of kicks Bruce Lee's ass right he really fucks him up really fucks him he kicks him into a fucking car avoids the door the real story when Bruce Lee met judo gene LeBell judo gene LeBell was a stunt man and he's a fucking gorilla he was a heavy with her light heavyweight judo champion and I mean a fucking bear of a man and he just picked Bruce Lee up like he would pick up you or me yeah and walked around with him on his shoulder like just being cute with them and bruce lee was like okay teach me and Bruce Lee and him train together and even in a theme was Game of Death when the opening scenes he gets this guy it's either in a crucifix or an armbar I forget but he gets his kind of submission technique which would be in the very first ever MMA gloves like I don't know who invented those gloves who designed them but those gloves that Bruce Lee was wearing in it was Game of Death those was a game of death or Enter the Dragon where he wore those gloves I think it was Game of Death those gloves that he was wearing yeah they were just like UFC gloves just like UFC gloves just a little bit different a little more puffy you know see goes but anyway he gets his dude down and gets him a fucking arm lock and he taps them that's judo gene LeBell shit like Lebel taught him how to do that stuff but what I was saying is like it's not impossible that Bruce Lee would get beat up by someone like the Bell in fact I would bet everything on it I would bet the fucking house Bruce Lee had a fight with gene LeBell gene LeBell would grab him and just like he would do you or just like you do me he would choke him unconscious that's just facts this is just facts that's not the problem if they had that in the movie that wouldn't be a problem the problem is like he they had Bruce Lee act like an asshole yeah and there was no real evidence of the act like that he was certainly confident but it was also because he was a brilliant man and he knew he was brilliant he knew he was right he combined all these martial arts he was the first guy to combine things he was the first guy to take some of the kicks from savate which is like this french kickboxing style and he would combine them with movement of fencing he was really interested in fencing how they had these big entries right and he realized that there's like a technique to these big entries with the sword that you could apply with a punch and so he was in the fencing and he was into everything man yeah it was a genius so what was quitting trying to say he made him out to be a dickwad but he didn't like him I don't think he knew him and it was more fun for him to make him out to be that way look everybody in the movie was someone who they weren't right like all the Manson Family Wines a spoiler alert they turned the tables on them and they all get killed and none of the innocent people die it's a fucking wild scene the movie the thing is they made a guy who's a beloved historical figure they made him out to be a dickwad it's like he doesn't ever whatever it look when he's making these movies there's just wild ass movies he does whatever he want yes why those movies are so great I would never tell him what to do but I'm just saying the only thing I didn't like was that this guy who is this you know it's is there an equivalent in other sports like Bruce Lee it's hard to say because he wasn't really a competitor right him maybe like one karate match that was recorded I'm sure he had some gym fights everybody who got involved in martial arts had some kind of gym fights where there were real fights because there's someone who transcended there transcended their sport a little not now but other than like think of any other sport of that era and or in it's more than a sport rights fighting is like a little bit more personal but what one person transcended the whole art like Bruce Lee did yeah it's hard I mean the only guy that like comes to mind that did that dynamically is such a remarkable athlete like bo Jackson is maybe the most impressive quiet humble athlete that are my generation has ever seen bo Jackson was not only a pro baseball player but a pro football player and was fucking insane at both and when he was done because of injury unfortunately he relegated himself to still becoming this like very centered athlete there's video of him shooting bow and arrow with his toes and stand ripping bull's-eyes I mean he's an incredible dynamic athlete who's very quiet and humble and was always kind of the guy who never boasted the way that his image was put up right like his image was put up to a degree that was like one of the greatest of all like bo knows he was a campaign he became a superstar but his image was based on his accomplishments yes now talking that's what I'm saying he did the bow was never a guy that was very like in-your-face and loud and boisterous a guy that a guy today would be like you know like Oh Cho Cinco you know like cheddar all those guys did their big flashy that talkers I'm the shit Deion Sanders a better example of a guy who's a football player and a baseball player Oh neon Deion bro show time all he did was talk about how good he was Bo wasn't that way but but in my opinion was the most dynamic athlete I ever saw as a kid he was fuck he used to break baseball bats over his knee when he got mad if he stroked out I mean yeah and it looked like a it looked like me cracking him twig I mean but if you find try to find a video of him shooting that Bo it's the most impressive thing I've ever seen in my fucking life hee hee hee whittles him and makes all of it himself at his house he lives up in the woods somewhere I swear to God he was on my friend Steve Rinella podcast he's neither he's in Christ a really interesting episode yeah so yeah he's got a bow making shop he got really into bow hunting but now he can't draw a bow back anymore his shoulders are so fuck yeah so far from football that uh he has to use a crossbow now I mean it's just he's one of those guys that was I guess the only way I can compare him is just his humility was overwhelming he never really was a loud boisterous guy when he both when he played in after his career so that was the only thing that I think would parallel Bruce Lee cuz everything I know about Bruce Lee is like but he this is my difference he was a super accomplished athlete Bruce Lee was a movie guy yeah he was a movie star but usually yeah I guess that's true but if I mean but for you saying from your perspective saying like he he was a martial artist Yeah right for sure so then isn't that still true without the movie shit he was a phenomenal martial artist who's definitely a phenomenal Marsh just didn't compete didn't really compete well yeah I guess that's part of it but I mean like can you not compete and still be at the top of a thing I mean is that possible I don't know man you know that's the one thing that if I was gonna make an argument against me as a commentator for the MMA for MMA I've been fought in MMA like it's kind of hilarious and I'm a commentator for MMA yeah even though I'm a fan of it and I know mostly what I'm talking about you know that's on the contract must know most of what I know mostly what I'm talking about when it comes to wrestling like I've really it's really interesting to work with guys like Dominick Cruz or work with Daniel Cormier Daniel Cormier in particular was like one of the best wrestlers to ever compete in MMA Manny's I know me any an active wrestling coach and Dominick does a lot of coaching too and a lot of MMA coaching too but both guys are so good at breaking down the technical aspects of it it makes you realize how little you really know about certain specialties you know but are they good at well you the difference is are they good at also articulating emotion and public's the public viewpoint that's the difference I can give expert analysis of ground fighting yeah ground fighting I can give expert like just just you know not to blow my horn but I know what's going on like the way a lot of people know what's going on with boxing I can tell you what's going on with chokes and when when someone's in trouble when someone's not and I can see it because I've been strangled a million times okay I know what that is I'm like this guy's in trouble like and some people can't see that most MMA fighters at a certain point in time they know most basic shit in terms of positions and when things are dangerous but once stuff gets exotic like weird rubber guard transitions or strange chokes like people invent new chokes all time there's always like something new that you haven't seen before like how the fuck did he do that and you have to go back and watch it again but do people think how many people think that you did fight anybody does you don't think so I knew at kickbox and I mean if anybody looks at my record had three kickboxing fights and I don't know how many talk window fights a lot probably 100 what was your record I don't know I had two and one in kickboxing I lost my last kickboxing fight but as far as talk window I have no idea I won the Massachusetts state championship four years in a row and I won I think was called the American Open which is a big tournament won I came in second place in the US Cup that was a big thing in that was in Connecticut and I fought the national champion in the finals and I thought I beat him that was when I was like 19 20 that was when I was at my best when I was around 21 before I tried out for the Nationals and try I was gonna try to make the Olympic team that's when I was starting to box and kick box and I was losing faith in Taekwondo I was realizing that there was I had a distorted perception of what I could do so it was just way you were way more engaged with boxing than you ever were which I was getting beat up yeah that's what it was yeah I would go to these kick boxing gyms and when I would just bought when I kick box guys I could kick them so hard they couldn't get close enough to box me a lot of time so I'd kick him in the arms I'd kick him and they'd be like what the fuck and then I could even though my hands weren't as good as those my legs were so much better because a lot of these guys couldn't kick at all so as long as we're starting at a distance I could slam my legs into them and they'd just be terrified like so many guys just be just try not to get hurt right because if someone can kick and you can't kick there's a terrible feeling yeah someone's taking so much scarier than taking them because punches I feel like you know I could get into a fist fight if someone fucking kicks you in a fist fight I'm done I'm getting it's just so painful there's so much mass in the leg and so they're so heavy you don't realize how hard it is until you get hit even just getting hit in the arm if it fucking sucks so bad yeah when someone slams their shin into your arm you're like motherfucker it's sucks dude but when I was boxing with dudes I was getting lit up and particularly there was this one dude that I used to box with his name was dangerous Dana Rosenblatt and wound up to become the Massachusetts or the New England middleweight champion really good guy and I was sparring with him a lot in the beginning he was beating my ass and I was like damn this kid wants to fight way more than I do because I was already doing comedy at the time and I was starting to realize like I gotta pick one of the other yeah and then as I was getting into kickboxing because around 21 was when I got into comedy right right after on 21st birthday and so when I was getting into like really in the kickboxing was like 20 into 21 and the same time I was thinking about doing stand-up and the same time I was realizing Taekwondo is bullshit now not really bullshit but not free it's in it's incomplete the problem is it's incomplete of someone knows how to box like what someone closes the distance on you you don't know what you do with your hands you don't know how to protect yourself you don't know where the punches are coming from you're not used to it and you have to get used to it the only way to get used to is to learn how to actually box and I didn't know how to actually box until I was like 19 or 20 when I started going to these other gyms and then when I when I realized I had these giant holes trying out for Taekwondo like doing Taekwondo tournaments and I still competed in Thai quenelle but less it wasn't excited about it anymore because I realized like this is if I want to be a complete martial artist like I want to follow like Bruce Lee's teaching I've found a hole in my game I have to patch that shit up huh there's a whole part that I thought I knew how to do and I didn't I knew how to punch things I could compose things hard but you think that's boxing until someone pops you with a double jab left hook oh no technique comes to play but it's this lean hand uppercut you just fucking chin me with you think that's awesome that's also because you like you're obsessed as a human you are you're obsessed with finding the next level of things so you were leveling up to like tech one no just became kind of boring to you too wasn't that because I still wasn't the best in the country you know I'd lost in the finals to the guy who is this creme Jabbar I think his name was he sounded he sounds good he was good very good he was a national champion you know Kareem Jabbar's are good I lost a decision to but I'm telling you I thought I won that but there was a lot of wacky decisions in Taekwondo I mean I definitely lost a lot of fights but there was ones that are one that I didn't get the decision is it a point system by yeah but it's a weird point system it's very similar to boxing where you know you decide yes aside I never understood but I love boxing watching my I don't get I'd still don't get boxing scoring when you're like what where do they come up with these nuts just people that aren't good at it you know if you had like Ali boxing judges like that's what I used to love about like comedy judges Harold Lederman has to do the but he used to tell you what the score was he would tell you what the score was you know like so he would say this is how I have it you know I think Rosario has been doing the best work and he would you know break down the fight right it was it was part of what was fun but anyway I wasn't bored with it in that I achieved the highest of heights it was that I realized it had holes in it like big holes big holes big holes like if I was in a street fight with one of those boxers and I was in a bar where I couldn't throw a kick I would be in deep shit yeah deep shit and so I learned how to box but that was right or so like my Xperia x10 smite like I'm not a guy who should be explaining like everything that's going on but it's entertaining that's it like we talked about before the show all these NFL guys are mad because Tony Romo got a 17 million dollar contract and they're way better than him on the field than he ever was on the field a lot of these guys are getting paid way less and this dude was you know like how the fuck is this dude getting he was talking yeah he's just chatting well that's what makes guys like neon Sanders neon Dion Dion yeah he's so flamboyant because that's where you get money outside of just playing and the truth is guys like Romo he does have and this is something that you would share his acumen for the game is so strong but he's also like his opinions are so real that he's not trying to save a job a lot of times these announcers they Strine adjust save a job you know they're like doing the right thing being safe yes they're totally he doesn't give a fuck he'll call out an offense or a defense and say well this is why they fucked up that last play and I think America goes oh shit that's great that's cool to know versus someone just going here's the play and there's the play and that's what happened in okay here next I mean it just could people get bored of the same kind of announcers it's also his insight is gonna be so much better than anybody who has to play the game so he's just came off the field yeah he's actually that's why in the UFC they do a great job with guys like Michael Bisping it was a former middleweight champ and he does a lot of commentary now and he's great dc-dc commenting yeah Dominick Cruz Paul Felder who's great at ooh yeah and all these guys that have fought before especially at the the really highest level maybe even fought some of the guys are doing commentary for they can give real insight as to the things this guy does what they train for tendencies do any of these X Fighters ever become trainers or coaches oh yeah a lot of them because that's like the thing in the NBA is like become a coach it's like they all want to become a coach not not as much in the NFL but NBA specifically it's big with that yeah but you know what makes me sad when fighters become coaches and then get fat well they all get fat dude a lot of them get fat not all of them anybody out there's a bunch in boxing there's a bunch of MMA and then you see him and you're like damn dude what's going on you ain't training I'm eating well when they're done fighting man they're just done they're just done well because a lot of these athletes they spend their - every waking moment like not doing the fucked up thing that we all get to do and so then when they get a break I think at some point they're like fuck it but that was one of the reasons why it's so impressive that a guy like George st. Pierre takes four years off and comes back better than ever because he never stopped training right you really never stopped training because he's a martial artist he's not just a fighter he fights professionally and he's a world champion but he's also a martial artist that's what he is so he's always training and he trains because he enjoys it so like when I see a guy like him that takes years off you see him looks like a fucking Greek god he's sculpted you know it looks perfect doesn't anybody's taking a day off off out of the gym right he looks as good if not better than he did when he was the welterweight champion of the world he looks amazing but isn't it more fun though to see a guy like get fat as far yeah I like the fear like the fury fight like what a story to tell for a guy to get fat and then thin again yeah but that's different he's still a fighter sure he had a just a depressed moment in his life but we're talking about guys who become trainers after fighting right and they get fat that makes me sad because I think they're sad well yeah but they're also missing out on the thing that they used to get to do I mean it's got to be weird to put on a suit as a coach or a trainer or whatever put on the proper gear when you can you're not doing this thing anymore and watching it you know what it's like um I quit basketball my senior year because I liked partying a lot and I was like I say this I've found and I was like take it easy basketball that's like I just and I and a friend of mine invited me out we were getting stoned and he invited me to go to a game cuz we knew one of the rival school guys who were playing we want to see him afterwards and I went and I was baked out of my head but I was sitting sitting in the bleachers watching them play and a piece of it killed me I didn't think it was gonna affect me because I was like I'm over basketball I'm never gonna play in college it was fun while it lasted I got a move on but it did kill me dude a piece of me was sitting there being like fuck this sucks that like I remember what that felt like that thing and when I got taken away from that when I took it away from myself it does fuck you up it's exciting it stays in your brain yet you're playing a game you get a win there trying to win to the balls going there know what's over here I'm gonna try to grab it oh yeah do you feel like a hero right it's like you you would like you retiring if you retired from comedy I mean if you went to see a stand-up show it would eat you alive probably unless you were done unless you're really done are you really gonna ever be done not me no but on some people who but who do you know that of the greats that you love and respect are just done at some point Steve Martin he's still 20 torn right now yeah but not really he's not doing stand-up he's doing this two-man show with Martin Short where there I watched it they do stand-up be bits mm-hmm but I also think Steve is it got music the music bug took over which to me still the same parallel he's still performing I think the music bug took over like well he had it back then I mean don't you remember like his stand-up albums music he had a bunch of no he's like us outright musicians all he wants to do so that to me it's still the same he's a different thing he's just he's doing it differently but he still pro so like to me I always think what someone goes oh yeah when I retire it's like you're never gonna fuckin retire from comedy unless it tells you you got to go away I don't think comedy I don't think we ever quit I think it's just you know like really things you can still do it right why would you stop you know how fun it is I mean we talked about this before like I feel bad for people can't kill yeah it's weird never feel you've never felt that yeah on stage and the oh and just rock the house it's the best feeling in the world and when you got a new punch line BAM and it hits when you know it's coming to the way it feels and you see people happy you look out there's all these smiles yeah everybody's having a good time right everybody's happy you feel that you feel like you're making people feel good you can't that's why I think it's hard to be really hard to quit it's like it's sad it'd be a sad a sad moment till I give that up I feel like that you know when they say when a guy retires that's when he dies sometimes my old man retired he's it's different his lust for life is a little bit different now like he's going through waves he's getting better but it's weird man it just feels like he's a people person he wants to be around people and now they doesn't have that anymore I'm like go get a fucking shitty job at a you know clothing store or something kind of bullshit jobs he can talk to people because being at the house is miserable that he doesn't do shit all day he watches Fox News and eats beef jerky and I'm like dude Fox News is designed for old people it's on loop and my tits on loop in the living room so many old people when I go over their house they're watching Fox Fox News about Fox News white men over 60 is mandatory once Fox News and shake their head I can't believe these lips yeah I can't believe him it's he lock her up lock why they trying to sneak in I don't believe them I don't trust them they run out of so much material sometimes when I come home to my parents house and they've run out of material to talk about on Fox News they start getting really heavy into pop culture that's when it makes me laugh when they they're like did you see what Ariana Grande was doing the other day I got nothing to talk about they're just blood they're empty at some point well it's linear guys like these shows our opinion shows as much as they are new shows they're mostly opinion show yeah news is a part of it is opinion yeah it's just such a weird time man you know what's really interesting to me too is like if a liberal goes on Fox News they get a ton of shit oh yeah any of the presidential candidates that have been on Fox News like I think yang I know Bernie's been on Fox News and I think Tulsi has definitely been on Fox News as well yeah and people just get real mad at them yeah because it's just there's this thing over there yeah talking to those propagandists it's it's just it's like it's um it's like the way that people talk about you is really funny when they're like you know when they label you with something and oh there's our boy Oh Biden was there to look at him see I just wonder about his skin that there pull what are they pulling it back with fishing wire to keep it up up on his head it just seems he seems oddly stiff you know I'm saying yeah like it seems like everything's pulled like this is not a I expect a certain amount of laxity in a man's face when he reaches a certain age particularly around the forehead area I'm just not seeing it I'm not seeing any movement either which makes me wonder about that like I want to see expressions in your forehead my worry is his lack he has a very big his he lacks the ability to have like a cohesive story like he's not good at being like have you ever seen him talking to kids by the pool it's the weirdest fucking talking about hairy legs what the fuck he's like it'll do a bunch of little black kids he's like and the black kids would come up and they'd see my hair go up and bubbles come up they touch my hairy legs fuck I just think his brain is he's losing a lot of I tweeted something this morning cuz there was someone put up a video of models on a runway on a catwalk and they're all tripping and falling at the same spot these dumb shoes they're wearing and I was like this is Biden's brain cells it's like they think they're on the right path after they get to this spot they just can't fucking did you see the thing that he was talking about God creating women or no and then he called his wife his sister you know the you know I forget what it was I forget what the gaff was but it was one of those we list him like what your what are you saying like it's it's like he has no brakes but his car is you don't going down the hills my god jeez I had a fucking trees I hit the wall fuck it is can't remember the word creator refers to God as the thing hey actually I like that more that's on it you know what I think I have a different take on it let's play it because I want I want to have a different take on because I listen to I said oh I know what he's doing when do you think it is first it was the bottom one the second way he doesn't want to go you know pause you can't be president stop pause pause listen we can't play any games here folks this is a really old man who can't talk like this is not a joke like that right now you know the thing play that again play that again this should get you into a mental hospital right they should be like hey Joey you are right he had three strokes while he was saying that it's the first one what was that word self-evident is that we hold these truths to be self-evident but it didn't sound right he'll hear it again doesn't do it he's drunk that dudes either drunk or he can't talk we were just your bezel evident he shouldn't be doing this in still evident and then he says when he goes he could have just said all men and women are created and he could have just said equal and gotten out of there and been like fuck it blew up and instead he goes I think he didn't want to say the Creator because there's a lot of religious thing yeah there's a lot of people that would say well what are you trying to say do you believe in evolution or not are you a science deniers Oh Biden Joe Biden's of science denier that's it but that's part of the problem with all these any my biggest beef with anybody in the Democratic Party when you watch these debates is they all want to say the thing that they really feel but they're tiptoeing cuz they're scared out of their fucking minds of someone going up did you warn just sexy and she's not she's anti-trans because she referred to you know they did they're waiting for them to fuck up well they're making people behave the way they would like them to behave right there they're forcing compliance right meanwhile Trump is just like trans fags I don't care fuck em all shit we were trying to find it yesterday did you find that thing for titania McGrath god I love dude he's on goddamn him every day yeah the the interview was great but he just his perspective on the chaos is so perfect because he just takes a little it takes a how a little bit of how dumb they are and just shows everybody and it says so much a little dumb tweet says everything you need to know you tweeted something today that was phenomenal there was a series of it was a tweet in response to a series of tweets about removing a fly yeah women are woman a noun a female human and then people are saying that's a transphobic dog whistle you should write immediately and then he's like that's true the the the you know biologic I forget the exact females have never been women or women have never been females or something else it's like it's so great it's real reason unless he's tweeting all day or and they took down the flag its response to a picture this is two days ago maybe three days ago or something that so you'll see there's a flag in that's C first one go to the first one see that here it is look at this good it says hey Sefton council flag you're flying at the moment is a hostile transphobic dog-whistle recognizes a symbol and brand of one of Britain's most outspoken invisible trans and antagonists excuse me antagonists and the leader of a transphobic hate group hmm okay that well he might be telling the truth there though that might be something that like really anti trans people do fly as a flag even though it is just the definition of a woman that might actually be true it could be thing is that the thing is like one thing is what it is what it is is a fact but if that's something if it has like some logo on it that represents some anti-trans group that's right can we find out if it does because I we should know because it's either one of two things either it's crazy to say that it's transphobic because all it is is the biological scientific definition of a woman and it's woman empowerment is maybe the initial intention was to be like women were we go women but you know underneath it all it might be some fuck you can't say go women know if it's women versus trans women you can say go women if it's women versus men right right you can't say go women if it's women versus trans women because trans women or women you know what I say to women joy say get back into kick change you probably do say that's where you belong yeah that's a fucking terrible so find out if that that flag actually is the flag from a hate group like because if there was a transphobic like just let's imagine not someone who's like hey I don't think trans women should fight biological women and not tell them that they used to be a man for 30 years which is my position right what got me called transphobic that's not really transphobic cuz I really don't care if you're trans I'm happy for you it makes you feel better to be a woman or better to transition to a man congratulations really as an adult yeah yeah yeah but there are groups out there that don't like trans people like literally don't like them and think that they're all insane and then they all should be committed to mental institutions yes and then they should have that she'd never called them by their female name he should never treat him like they're a woman maybe that was the head of that group that's a different perspective but it was a council he was tweeting at it's a government building which is why I have a hard time believing that right that's the why I'm like who put the flag up weird the flag to say Clifton Council you click on that Clifton Council and see whom they are yeah but that's I think but that's the problem is like look like there's a difference though there is but also do you think do you think that that it just blankly do you think that was the intention of that flag I think most likely if I was gonna fly a flag that said woman noun a biological female I was saying that a biological male is not a woman that's probably what I was saying sure depends on why they're saying it are they saying it because these trans women are encroaching on female spaces like female sports uh-huh or are they saying it because they don't think it's morally right for someone to transition to become a woman I mean why they saying it that's a question look at what it is cuz what it is is inarguable yes that's what a woman is right the question is do you think that a trans woman is the same as a biological woman in terms of like the respect they deserve and whether or not you should treat them in a friendly manner right whether or not or whether you should discriminate them or be allowed to scrim innate against them that's where it gets weird right yeah I mean I think I hear all this stuff and I just I think about that asteroid that's supposed to come and I'm like hurry up I don't really give a fuck anymore I'm through the Black Plague I think we'll get through trans people no no no I'm saying we don't all this nonsense I think global warming is gonna be good for us I think we deserve to get out of here for a little while I think need to start from scratch I think we need to get fucked off this planet and the earth needs to start again without us I think we're getting too we're getting too heavy or someone sounds like a quitter yeah hey hey I'm done I'm done the real problem is people trying to get people to comply with their perspective and not recognizing other people's perspectives and then being like militant about supporting their side yeah but like look an educated person is cool with almost everyone doing what they want what they please right so what we're really doing is similar most educated people would go do you care about trans but I'd go I hope they're fucking happy I don't care I don't care what anybody wants to do there as long as it makes them happy and that's a part of their life that they choose to do that no one's forced them to do then I hope that they're happy I why would I why would I care I think only only uneducated people have a tough time accepting somebody else's needs or wants to be what society doesn't deem the norm get more insecure yeah because if you if you're if you're fucking educated you do you have other things to think about and to worry of people that are bigots sure sure but I do think it's more rare yeah I mean - but I think there's a lot of really time people that aren't educated I think really it's just or ignorant perhaps maybe that's the thing maybe there's a lot of okay so let's say this there's members of my you know family or friends or people that we know quite educated who are ignorant towards people so they've never met transperson so they're a little weary of them perhaps it doesn't mean they hate them yeah it means they might go I don't know man I've never fucking seen one you know what I mean let's be honest before people felt real comfortable in us they still don't really but they're more comfortable now I think coming out than they ever were before yeah people just woke up many but my point is there wasn't that many of them like when we were kids how many trans kids were in your high school zero zero yeah but also there probably were kids I wanted to be translated societally had this weird bar on them that was like because what's weird it's like that bar has been lifted in some ways how many more bars are gonna get lifted that's my whole thing - what else is next Fock skin people that are animals yeah but I'm cool that I went to high school with some kids I thought they were animals for sure you know there's always like a kid that wears ears and prance into the hallway furries yeah people are like Mikey's funny man he just let him fly if they get together they have a good time you know it goes furry convention right I seen a scene that's always sexual like it always turns into it's never it's never like we just do this because this is how we feel it's like we like the fuckin costumes that's what it is yeah and you take a peek is the woody the woodpecker doll is about to fuck you you look at his herpes is this a personal experience what happened they're all sweaty staph infections should imagine the perfect job for one of those kids in high school that wanted to be an animal is a mascot for a sporting team that's like the most they're just in there jerking off in between there's all these guys around everybody's going crazy nobody knows who you really are under there yeah actually probably hot as fuck in there though it's got so we talked about this I went to a basketball game when I got home the other day and I was like I wonder how much they make I wonder what they if they Minh if if they only do it because it's a free trip to the to the game because there's no way it's a can't make a lot of money doing I can't imagine I would imagine you don't make a lot of money first of all you're replaceable yeah just put we're done with you Dave no it's my I'm gonna hire my nephew instead well whenever there's a mascot like what Ronald McDonald yeah why yeah and like I remember there was some McDonald's maybe I'm remembering this incorrectly but didn't they used to have McDonald well you can meet Ronald McDonald McDonald used to be yeah the the figure himself was at charity events a lot or like you could like the McDonald's I dressed up like him yeah but it wouldn't be at it wouldn't be at the location just on a random day there was always like the Ronald McDonald House was a children sponsorship and they would do like you know they would do a lot of events he was out he was out a little bit more but it's almost like a Santa Claus type deal totally I mean if Ronald McDonald asked for too much money the boy pitch nobody knows what you really always like use the same nose yeah we got Ronald in Kansas is way better than you do worship animals is the same size you have to switch the little red thing mascots for fast food is very interesting I've never even thought about that why that exists Burger King never had one it's for kids the rope'n kids in but why did why Wendy's has Wendy a cute little girl makes you want to go there and get a burger Taco Bell has alejandro you know him do you know him Alejandro the taco no it's not a real you know that's a comic no that's a comedian does that voices Carlos Rosario is that how to say his name he the guy from Reno 9-1-1 he did it yeah the you care to talk about was you Carlos equity looked that up to make sure that I'm not out of my head but yeah he did that campaign yeah yeah but Burger King never happened they didn't need one huh talk yeah he doesn't say anything he's not really like a fait he's just like a symbol more than a dozen I guess Wendy's didn't talk much either what was your fat out what did you gave Thomas though he was the creator I mean that's from Columbus I know a lot about it but Wendy's would be from Columbus yeah we had White Castle that was our trash as a kid it's interesting if you have somewhere like in and out that doesn't they don't do fast food it's not really fast food I mean it's pretty fast but it's way better yeah it's me actually medium but they act like they actually cook it right there when you get it it's just way better oh by far it's not even close yeah so like if you go by Burger King and you see like the drive-in there might be one person there yeah you go by in and out there motherfuckers around the block never not oh it's never not packed there's always a line and it's because it's a better product but how come they don't how come everybody else doesn't go hey I got an idea why don't they make it better did you watch the founder movie yeah that's why I found the founder because I mean families became a production line and they learned that shipping Burgers frozen was way more efficient and they lost less product and they also cost them nothing in and out was willing to take a hit because they were a family-run business and they were like there's only a few locations will do better product for a little bit higher of a price at and not franchisee yet because now that you can only franchise it if you're a member of their family you know that good keep it up ya know you you can only buy you can only open a franchise if you are an extended member of the original family I'm happy yeah because it's a great way they're great because if they went the other way it would go to shit I mean do raw onions son it's the best it's so good it is the best but the thing about it is there's nothing comparable like there's no one else is doing it except five guys there's no one else is doing it like that I don't shake if I don't like five guys I've got to take a walk a burger no fat burgers a sit-down restaurant in Lausanne in Southern California that's like I sit down that burgers pretty good and Whataburger and fat burger on the same level to me they're like you sit down when you eat nobody drives through fat burger that's true but maybe fat burger should be on that list I think burger stands are a thing here that really don't exist a lot of place there are a lot of still small places fat burger doesn't have the kind of clientele base that does that's what it is yeah but I would also argue I don't think know about drive-throughs why wouldn't they have a drive-thru but I bet you I bet you I bet you it has a lot to do with strategic locations as well but you in and out puts himself in places where they know they're gonna go there's a there's a fat burger right up here on Ventura it's in a great spot and it usually gets a few people in there but I'm saying it's never got the kind of lines but he's right it's a drive to retain the other thing is fat burner yeah they do the same thing they cook it right then when you order it I don't really do it I don't do it if I'm gonna get out of the house and eat one of those I'm gonna have in and outs the only one I've ever really good I don't like five guys there's not a drive-through either that's a fucking what's the one that came to LA everyone freed up steak in shake shake shack no just came from New York Shake Shack that's it had a huge line for like months unless I pass okay but it's like a gourmet version of all they have Kris fries which is the problem it's a gourmet it's that good yeah gourmet chef me it's not the place that was in Ohio that was outside of the funny bone no what was that place I tell you really want to get Shaq thing some Shake Shack or steak Steak and Shake Steak and Shake you okay that's see my fucking dumb ass had those two like that one my dumb ass those zucchini that's not even hamburger those are technically steak patties or steak burgers really old but they have that Columbus chili with spaghetti Skyline Chili that's a Cincinnati thing yeah but they have that no in Columbus Oliver that's all over the Midwest said that chili with spaghetti they do it up pretty goddamn good when you're drunk oh dude go to chili John's here in the valley you never heard of chili Johnson no they do that on but you know chili Johnson Burbank you never heard of it that's what they do there was a guy from then West he put one over there there's a few places I'm gonna call and clean hear about when you're like oh that's real like that did you know there's a 24-hour steakhouse in downtown LA what Pacific dining cart like a legit 24-hour house you and I can go there tonight at 4:00 in the morning and get a legit steak like a fucking bone-in rib eye medium rare mashed potatoes fucking sour cream and chives kid how come I never heard of this before I don't know I haven't eaten at it I've eaten at the one in Santa Monica save but one of the writers fucking I remember what show was on forgot which writer told me about this but it was quite a few years back and I looked into it there's a 24-hour Pacific dining cart in downtown LA 24 hours you're the only guy I've ever had steak with at 1:30 in the morning dude 36 years I've been in the earth and you're the only guy that we go on tour together it'll be me and you and we'll be late night and you'll go you're hungry and I'll go yeah but usually I'll go I'll just you know whatever eat some small and quick you're like let's go get a big scoffs take well well if you the good thing about going to big cities like New York or Chicago there's always some weird spot there stay open food real late you know 4 o'clock in the morning of kitchens open till 3:00 yeah really and if we call in they're like I'm like Joe they're like okay we're open we're open that we just reopened we closed but we really had to happen a couple times that's very nice it's been great yeah it's been great that was Dallas right we did then we do something in Dallas in Dallas dude the days are bad with that over we're late-night steak after a fucking great show nice no it is it is the best at late-night eating has changed comedy will change the way you eat it's so funny when you're young in comedy you eat a certain way because you don't have any fucking money and then when you get to get in along in your career you get to eat better and you eat so different your hours change it's so weird like when people ask me what time I eat lunch or breakfast I'm like all that shit is depending on where I am and where I'm going people say it's not good to eat late at night and I think really it's just food I think the real problem is eating too much food so when I eat late at night I don't eat the next day it's like 1:00 in the afternoon later I don't eat breakfast most the time if I eat late at night I get up and I work out I do something I might not eat until 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon right though they say it's what you eat it's not when you eat yeah if you're shit when you eat I mean if you eat then just go to sleep that's not the best I really should be moving around your body probably to adjust things yeah better but the real problem is watch eat when you're on the road but it's so easy bullshit I know so easy to fuck off and start eating candy and whatever nonsense trail mix you see it the fucking there's bullshit everywhere yeah you could pretend the trail mix is nutritious because it's got nuts in it right it's got M&Ms little yeah you just say three bags of M&M so you you ate so many M&Ms and then you know some of them have chocolate chips and them yeah even better which are the better that's fuck that's the best version that's not good for you no that sounds good no and especially cuz when I go on the road you know like I like the sauce so if I go to a bar I'm gonna have the sauce and I'm gonna have a couple of wings and I'm it's a part of the thing yeah it's it's just so hard to not do you know well especially after tired see the thing about those shows too is like especially when we have nights where do two shows yeah you're fucking cooked your tires you know you put out a lot of energy and there's a lot of concentration involved there's a lot of anticipation and then when they're over then you're like fuck I'm hungry yeah because if we do two shows that means we're gonna do an eight and a ten I mean this to the the ten is over at midnight ish we're gonna eat somewhere around 1 that means we're not eating between so I won't eat burger two hours before a show so that means I ate at 6 right so you know it's like seven eight hours later you're fucking starving ravage you're starved last time we did that we would me and Tony we again we ate at 4:30 we had dinner Austin fucking geriatrics eating dinner and then 1:30 in the morning but if you do that you get real fuel for the show you know eating right before it shows the kiss of death can't do it yeah just slows you to down too much yeah they suppose you don't think it's too heavy I'm trying to and I'm trying to be more focused on like when I get to the hotel I just go right to the gym yep it's so painful man but it's the thing you have to do like this is what I do I don't have an option the gym you give yourself an option you'll fuck your fucked well I'd well I used to just get to the hotel jerk off and a nap right every single time I go I'm gonna nap and jerk oh there's no way I'm not gonna do this and now I jerk off in the gym the other things like I always have phone calls I have to make or emails I have to answer and if I start fucking around with those things it could be an hour late and then I watch a YouTube video who is that real then I have to google it how about fuck in the next thing you know I'm down a rabbit hole it's an hour and a half later I'll tell myself yeah but I I think I've got a good bit right this fucking trying mantis bit is gonna kill these Mongols with their flying eagles that they used to kill wolves I think there's something in that but it does do sometimes you do get such a good bit from going down these stupid little wormholes for no reason yeah how did people ever even write jokes in the 80s I don't even know how I did it you know there was so much more observational reason there was so much more observation that slike the Seinfeld era of like the bus you get on a bus you get it at rate you know it's like yeah every that's why airplane jokes got quote-unquote played out because it was like that everyone was that's all people had there was no fucking internet they weren't walk with the internet in their pocket and comics would always talk about airplanes because they were always traveling she would be hotel room service knock-knock do not disturb like all these names what does do not disturb me that's bad the maid comes in I'm coming oh yeah I know he saw they were sitting outside for like I'm doing an impression of Jerry but I'm not just the idea that era was like there was limited subject matter these limited things to talk about do you think that bubble that comedy bubble from then is the same as now or now as bigger I don't think the bubble is the same I think the bubble that people had in the 80s it's like people were just falling in love with stand-up comedy yeah like this is what we have to realize and this is where it's really crazy it's really hard to imagine but this is true when you think about the bubble let's go back to 1980 stand-up comedy and Jerry Seinfeld please welcome this guy in that guy and all these different comics that were really popular in in the 80s that was only 40 years ago okay so you go 40 years before them you have nothing you have no stand-up right I mean you literally have jokes you have guys who do emcee work at different clubs that bring up a band and then they'll do like the Don Rickles thing they'll pick on guys in the audience and then Lenny Bruce comes along in the 50s in the late late 50s and the 60s and Lenny Bruce gets arrested a bunch of times for talking for explaining things for talking about how he really sees things for free using words that are forbidden for talking about subjects that are taboo he does a different thing nobody had done that before there's just new thing and then Mort Saul does like political humor and then George Carlin changes from being this like Johnny Carson type 7 minutes set on late-night TV guy with a suit on to being this hippie who talks about the dirty words you can't use on television the seven dirty words yeah and everything shifted but that won't that didn't happen that long ago in the 1980s people still didn't understand what it was so what guy would go onstage and he looked like a comedian so you assumed he was a comedian because he knew how to talk like a comedian he's like what's going on who is this Wild Kingdom taking place in my house I got a cat I got a mouse let's get them together like there was comedy that wasn't really comedy it's like they were almost like premise merchants and they never figured out how to bring it to real comedy they just had a bunch of tricks and a bunch of like half duct-taped premises but they sounded like a comedian I mean I told my wife if that's what you need to do you go right ahead nobody laughs really hard but they get like that there's a rhythm going on they think they should go along with it those guys get into the workplace right they become part of the ecosystem and they actually had like careers yeah and the media but their boats start taking water and they drown and they all sink and they all went away look if you go back to those days of the 80s than the early 90s there was like a whole bunch of comedians that were doing some weird thing with her they were like mimicking the sound of stand-up comedians and talking about things that comedians talked about but they were missing like you know and you have cement you had a bunch of shit yeah but if you only had three of those things you just get this one slot is this missing something yeah that was a different boom that was like people didn't know what comedy was like we're gonna go see some comedy where are the local comedy Hutton here comes the guy with the tie and the rolled-up sleeves now it's an obsession now comedies become like this the fandom I think is something that I can't articulate it's wild to watch like definitely different it's it's just I mean you've seen way more than I have in that sense but even when I first started in comedy I just the fandom wasn't the same it wasn't people didn't lose it like they do now when they meet all of these comics and go see them live I think it's a good thing it's just wild to see it's become bigger than stand up a little bit I mean dude it's a you know it's a weird thing it's a weird thing for sure but I think one of the things is different is how prolific the comics of today are and how much stuff they're putting out yeah if you look at a guy like burr or Ali Wong or I mean look at anybody who wrecked Segura someone who regularly cranks out really good specials like the outputs incredible ya know it's it's so it's way stronger two years or so they're putting out this murderous new special and they're constantly working at it and that just didn't happen before and binder was talking to me about that binder is doing a documentary I did something for we were talking about how he was saying that those days people didn't work that hard they had one special maybe and then the next special would be years later if they had everyone ever had one again and they would have material that just was tried and true and they would stick with it and he's like I come in here and I see these guys just constantly cranking over and turning over new material yeah and it's just it's a different kind of thing and the like those guys that I was talking about they were around before they're kind of sound like comedians but they were missing something you know what they're really missing embracing it as an art form they were using it as a way to try to get a sitcom they were using it as a way to try to get Fame and to get try to get success but they weren't in love with the idea of being an artist they weren't in love with the idea of crafting a new bit and trying it and tweaking it and getting it going and making it happen and what am I doing wrong what am i doing right what's I do more of which I do less of and then putting it all together in this fucking like you're using alchemy man you got a sorcerers hat on you're mixing this bitch together to boom all the sudden gets this big giant laughs like you've conjured up some magic yeah you can get that big pop yeah the chemistry is unbelievable when it works also when you say a joke one different way and you're like fuck and it doesn't go the way that it's supposed to go I do that all the time on purpose and ruined jokes just to see if he's me anyway I'm like fuck why'd I rearrange the words but you have to think you have a certain number of sets right you if you don't rearrange the words sometimes you don't know that magic spot like you missed the magic spot you know it's like you ever almost give your missus the well that's I tell her I go as those on accident whoops no I don't let her listen to stuff stays on okay Jamie don't laugh at that's not funny dude okay don't let that is not funny I keep I think you're allowed I don't think he means what he's saying I think what he's doing is getting shit serious I think he's talking shit and it's your what's confusing your right shows me something you're right though that P that it was more the goal was like could I get a Stevie special from it or a TV series and now it's changed so much that like well those guys wanted to make it yeah you know they wanted to be in they wanted to be accepted they were on the outside and they were hungry and ambitious and then they wanted to make it right and they got in and when they got in they were you know like Kennison doing the fucking intro to a Jon Bon Jovi video that kind of shit like you're partying with those guys yeah I mean they want to be fair in Fame was so much more appealing back yeah ladies and gentlemen you know please welcome Sam you know and sit down the couch is like you're famous yeah that's what people wanted they wanted they wanted to be the famous guy who did shows and you did show it like even Jenni who was one of my personal favorites who was in my opinion one of the great unheralded comedian Richard Jeni Richard Jeni yeah fucking amazing comic he hated it man he didn't want to do the road he wanted a sitcom he wanted to want to be a movie star he wanted to be Jim Carrey or Tom Cruise or or someone on a sitcom want to be Seinfeld it's funny because like I I do TV sometimes and you give me shit about it all the fucking time but like it will no it pales in comparison to the way I feel about stand-up but it is something I still love the performance of it but if you said I had to it'd be gun to my face there's no way I would give up Stan I mean I just couldn't do it I mean my goal if if my ultimate goal if someone like what is the ultimate goal is to tour for as long as I can to set two crowds that are there to see me that's to me there is nothing I could do on TV there's nothing I there's no fuckin Quinn Tarantino role I could ever get that would feel as good as being in a room with people that fucking paid admonish it in a heartbeat no of course there's nothing wrong with doing the other shit if you enjoy doing it I'll give you a hard time because it's fun to give you a hard time I know you loved you loved shitting on me about doing that stuff yeah but look I got to do Curb Your Enthusiasm with Larry David that's different I would never shit tentacles and my life thing yeah I would I told him I would have paid them money the only a few times have I been so into a thing where I've been where I push my agents and go I'll fuckin I'll lose a lot of money just to have the opportunity to try it yeah of course like Galifianakis to show baskets on FX I used to love that show I mean it's a great show not usually but I told even said I said tell them I will I will do anything I'll be in the background because I think that show is so fucking good did you ever watch it no I haven't heard god it was just heard of it just now for the first time baskets it was a show on FX at Cal Phoenix created votes not a lot anymore I don't know if they're still doing it I don't know if it's still on I'm disconnected right now I love Zack though it's just you can't keep up there's too many things that's the problem I don't know what's on and what's going and what's coming any was just there passing by yeah so but yeah we're working with like Larry was like one of those moments of making him break that's what it really is making that guy laugh to me was like yeah he's Larry David man he said beyond he's a wizard yeah he's a guy who I can tell his comedy was perfect for this and not the stage you know how they talk about you he talks about he's not a good stand-up yeah you can you know why do you know I mean when you meet a comedian comedian and you go I know why you're not a stand-up but you're great at this thing yeah it's that's exactly what he is he's a genius with this live interactive aspect of acting comedy he's so good at that and writing yeah it's why I found it but I but I have seen those tapes of him doing old stand-up yeah yeah I've seen some clips he different I bet he made the comics laugh I bet it was one of those economists coming for sure but if we were in the back of the room we'd be howling do you know who's on top of his fucking game right now David tell ya I mean Jesus Christ I don't think I've ever I rarely see him miss that did you see him at The Improv last week no I watched him in Ross at the store when they were both Tony and I did did show The Improv last Wednesday and I tell did the Late Show god damn he was good yeah god Danny was good so silly effortless and it's so it's just it's all silly yeah it's jokes go into jokes go into jokes he's he hasn't changed you know his sensibilities because of all the backlash it still walls out comedy really well-written stuff really funny and just such a good guy I think he's reminding everybody we're still comedians yeah we're just in comics most of us realize that the ones who've backed off you know they're the ones who have like a deep sort of tentacle connection to the business yeah the ones who are like really connected to the business like they're executive producing sitcoms and they're a part of this and a part of that they've backed off the wild shit well cuz they know that they're there it's a threat to them yes it's self policing and it's they'll still talk like that in the green room they'll still make you laugh in the green but they're scared you know everyone's scared getting called out now for jokes which is just I mean I get I get that people haven't decided to make this distinction but there's a giant distinction between someone talking about something because this is their actual feelings on something and someone saying ridiculous shit that they don't really believe because it's funny yeah and when you stop that in any way as soon as you try to step that for yourself or if you're trying to get someone else to stop it well you're really doing is you're enforcing a particular very narrow band of behavior right and if you get stuck in that narrow band of behavior like it's real hard to see outside of it it's real hard to see that this is ridiculous right and as a comic when you see comics getting mad that other comics are touching on certain subjects or using certain language it's like oh like you're missing the whole thing you thought you missed the whole thing that's a mole I feel like that's a mole inside of the operation but someone's like I don't like when he does those that stuff and you're like I can't believe you're still saying bitch yeah yeah do you know the depth of what that word means for people you know what that does that's my favorite do you know what that does please tell me chubby white guy please tell me well that's like there was a dude there there's a there's a guy who had a great tweet I don't want to say his name cuz you know I don't I don't know if he wants it out or whatever but like he basically had a tweet he got a lot of backlash from the community because he was like all these Eastside comics that used to shit on the Comedy Store for a lack of quote-unquote diversity they're the same people he's an Eastside guy he goes as one I'm saying these are the same guys that get you know that pay no mind to the fact that we're living in the gentrified used to be Mexican neighborhood and our audiences are all fuckin white dudes with beards that look the same and he got a lot of shit but I was like yeah fuck I hit him up and I was like yeah you're right though like this old idea that the store used to be a it's just a bro bro hangout and it's all there is it's like to that line there's so many different kinds of people on that line up way more than you see we don't go to other say that of the people that can't work there so yeah that's jealousy yeah it's 100% automatic yeah I mean there's people to think that maybe there's a style that you see at the Comedy Store that they don't appreciate that's okay but the Styles it varies so much from Jelinek to D'Elia to you to Hinchcliffe to Diaz I mean to Owen Smith Sklar brother you're talking about people that this is all over the fucking map it's all over the map yeah you know I mean like I think that's that's why the I love the tweets yeah or Aly makovski or this there's so many different sort of styles of comedy out of that place now right you can't say it's it's all Bros that's nonsense but that's good calm that was the old way which I'm glad he was being he was like no the the these people are just like free thinking pushing out new weird fucked-up sometimes challenging shit because the store supports it like that that's all it is it's like now we finally have a place where it's like you could say it there doesn't if you know there's no freedom and suppressing people's ability to express themselves you just create an environment where everybody's scared to be themselves or everybody's scared to take chances right if you're scared to take chances you look if you don't push the boundaries you don't find out where they are you you you create your own boundaries like you when you're doing material and you're trying to come up with a bait sometimes a bit in the beginning it's highly offensive but then you turn it into something that's everybody accepts and it's great right this was the real argument for louis c.k when Louie CK had a recording of his leaked and there was a bit where he was talking about these kids were survivors of school shootings you say you're not interesting just because you push some fat kid in the way like like in your laughing see he got a lot of shit for that we're saying it like it's cruel and other comics said it was hacked and there's like first of all he had done comedy in 10 months second of all you know how Comedy Works that was a seed plant he wasn't delivering fucking origami plant or was what's those called the little small ones what a perfectly trimmed bonsai I'm like Oregon yeah perfectly trimmed bonsai tree that they sell on the side of the road yeah this was a this is a seed right like that could have been an incredible bit because it's already kind of funny that like you know that these people that are on television all the time of the survivors of a school shooting and that they might just be survivors they don't necessarily have to be interesting now he didn't in his defense have any time to prepare he had ten months of no stand-up then he just does stand-up and get some laughs off this premise that premise in six months could have been a fucking nuclear bomb right that exposed he would have figured out a way to expose how goofy it is that just because someone survives a massacre we want to parade them on CNN every couple weeks and Lloyd asked their opinion about gun control and about various things like he's right well yeah look someone's gonna have a fucking great bit about Greta Thornburg it's the same thing you've got some sixteen-year-old kid that's you know it's she seems weird to begin with and then she's on TV going how dare you and you're like what is this and then you keep seeing her over and over and over it who's putting her on TV over and over and over again you fucking people are like what are you doing in a lot of ways it's kind of say like why is she interesting because she's 16 and dealing with climate change as opposed to him who's 29 or her who was 50 or him who is 82 like what are we talking about just get some random person who wants to say how dare you about climate change yeah and they're gonna they're gonna stop going to school so someone does something about it they're on strike like what is this really what's on the news this is a ploy for her to get out of going to school she's like I don't like school they're like you don't have to if you could sail around the world and I just think the whole that whole thing about they find what works for them categorically cuz she's a good look yeah and they're like pusher pusher pusher see that that's why like when you go back to Louie's bed about the school shootings like yes it's gross to make fun of someone who survived a school shooting but that's what he does he tells jokes in the moment you know that he's saying something that's awful that you're not supposed to say so you laugh not how he really feels so for you and comics to pretend that that's how he really feels like that's fucking disgusting what you're doing yeah they know you not only do you know you're being deceptive or you really don't understand comedy in which case you should stop right just stop doing it is you don't understand it like and you'd also don't understand the process or you're at least like I bet if you asked him like is that ready for Netflix released you'd be like no no wait done call me in 10 months I was hoping that bit would come into something these are notes he's going off of right you know shit down he had some ideas trying it out it finally gets on stage to fuck around within someone he records it and puts it on YouTube well he's apparently I haven't seen him but from the grapevine I've heard that he's touring he's murder his new hours murderers I'm curious to know what or what platformer where he's gonna go with it right he's got to be independent I'm sure right because people are too afraid and I he's recording very soon oh he is yeah yeah maybe I know some yeah oh yeah I want to see it I want to see it before he records it but listen I mean we could talk about him see you're blue in the face right and I think you know leave the guy alone I don't know what happened those nights I know he has a very different story than the story that's been depicted in the media and I know he definitely did some stupid shit you shouldn't do sure but he didn't block any doors he didn't tell anybody they have to do it didn't try to scare anybody he asked if he could jerk-off him something front of people is it gross under present he would say so yeah I mean he has jokes about it right you know and did he apologize some people don't think he apologized enough but I don't even think I don't think we know the whole story well that's the thing is I don't know we don't we really don't were in the we're so in the dark about what really happened it's like we have an idea that we think would happen but no one really knows he hit the perfect moment on the wave oh my god he had the perfect moment on me to wave let me do Harvey Weinstein was like a fucking hurricane force wind behind his back he's outed fuck it was okay well like the the North Shore of hawaii's are gonna catch one now too biggest fucking me to wave just swallows him whole it would have been a gross thing anywhere else in history sure but at that moment I mean she shot it down there was a moment where he went on stage it's gank fest and the audience went crazy I saw cheered and went crazy and I either retweeted or liked it and someone went fuck you he sexually assaulted women like no he didn't no he no one ever said he did that also definitely didn't do that he asked if he could jerk off and he did do you think he shouldn't have done that yes I agree he shouldn't have done that but he did that right and then that's it that's what he did yeah that's what he did if you think that's gross yes that but that's what he did there's other allegations that disturb people that maybe someone from his management did something to stifle the career of someone else that I got fucked up if that's true yeah no if that's true here's the biggest problem again dozen of us no I I don't know either I don't know that that's the truth I'd like to find that part out that right but he doesn't it's not he's I don't know if that was because of him I don't know if the management did it without his knowledge I don't know if it never happened at all I don't know if it's exaggerated because I know many of the things that were said about him were exaggerated again this is non exonerating him what he did was gross he thinks what he did was gross but it's like what do you want you want him to never tell jokes again he's one of the best comedians of all time really knowledge is that what he did was wrong like at what point in time do we forgive people what point in time do we say someone was doing something fucked up and now they paid this tremendous price emotionally psychologically when you let him out of jail yeah what's the time what's the right amount of jail let him out free loo-loo free lift um it's uh it's a strange time for people with with accusations and being mean and in a gang on people on line and bullying and yeah and and activism and chaos like there's so much noise it's a it's so much of us interacting with each other simultaneously - it's so hard to have peace these days yeah on the stage on stage it's my that's like the only way I get away from all the bullshit yeah especially cuz we're embedded in the Internet that's the hardest part it is always part right now we're doing - Adam Curry about it yesterday you know we're talking about just outrage and he's like you just really can't be in that all the time you can't subject yourself because there's always something to argue about you'll never run out of topics now you're fucked all you have to do is have a few topics that you like to argue about let's just say your person Pro first Pro First Amendment pro-second amendment pro-choice pro-gay rights Pro trans rights pro civil rights don't you you just take those those things that you you feel very passionately about and then just put those hashtags online on Twitter and then go look for conversations and go to war right that's what you do yeah you can do it or you could do it all day you go to war about the Second Amendment all day you go all day argue with gun nuts and people hate guns you can take both sides you could have two different accounts you gonna have one account where you're like some fucking hillbilly who thinks everybody should have 80 guns or you go to jail or we need to trust our government and throw all the guns in a fire yeah you know use them to make a statue with a giant penis like we could do we could literally argue all day long about immigrant rights about whether or not they should detain them at the border you could be involved in that all day long I mean you knew it would you would never have a moment to sleep no if you just engage with everybody who engage with you you'd never have a moment to sleep people do it that's what's crazy people spend endless amounts of time on it that's why I try to check out Twitter you know it's like all those things Facebook I deleted I just I just get all I want to use those things for us to promote what I'm doing tour wise like hey come see me and also make a couple of fucking fart jokes once in awhile like it's worthless that's it I want to make some dumb jokes and then be like come see me live and I just can't I've stopped years ago engaging when people are like this is like never I don't want to get into I just don't I don't deal with anymore well the sheer number of people out there that are bored yeah in their cubicle somewhere trying to get a rise out of you yeah well it's all because uh you know they it's nice to be and you know what I think they compared it to it's like when they start flirting or dating somebody it's the same kind of engagement you get excited for the next piece of engagement right have you said something back then like oh shit I got him on the hook yeah it's coming it's it's trolling has become a new thing of like PCP it's it's constant engagement it's the same kind of feeling you get when you start talking to it someone you know that you're interested in you're like holy fuck and they're talking to me back and they you get this this tennis match of like an emotion so it becomes this heightened thing in your world now it's like a new thing to have you're like a big red snapper in Clearwater come on fuck take a bite you fucker here did you see Oprah fall down yes and it's honestly she's a little old to be falling down he's fine he's dead she died yes all right dingdong the witch is dead no she did she died you little fuck he ever fucked no she didn't no she's fine I just think like it looks like she got hurt it's nice to see billionaires fall oh how about that that's weird it's nice to see somebody hit no it humanizes her she is such a figure of perfection women should learn do those fucking shiny bottom shoes then bitch is a useless things they're so slippery those those really expensive shoes the gals like you always have the shiny bottoms yeah here she is walking and I believe she's talking about balance which is lol the irony is staggering so flat ground oh let's see how she recovers she says new shoes well you know what I gotta say I like how she framed with her elbow and then did a roll she absorbed a lot of energy and a roll good technique oh not bad what's this here we go that frame a little bit on the left hip that shit's probably sore but one thing you gotta say about Oprah she works out a lot and she has she's got muscles she went and ran a marathon recently thanks to the marathon in six hours which is not the best time if she still ran 26 fucking miles in a day don't you think it's nice to see people fall it's humbling to watch someone I just think that's did she really that's an hour faster than Bert Kreischer ran it four and a-five 429 how fast is that like a mile 10:17 that's really good mhm that's a good clip wait a minute she's doing better than you bitch no way right imagine you and Oprah in a race she's doing she dusts you ten minute miles yes 26 of them bitch so that's what six miles an hour about whoo yeah let me tell you something scared let me tell you something a little nervous right I went to 94 them that was a 94 years old oh no she ran one recently though yeah I just typed in okay that's very good though when she was 40 which makes me cry on speed back then yeah and steroids no I just it's it's humbling to watch someone so beloved take a little stupid spill it's just kind of like yeah that's the balance of universe well she's perfect to everybody mmm it's nice to watch perfect people fall a little bit that's fun that understand it makes she she's a part of the people now especially if she's like new shoes you know how this goes it's fun you know yeah well it's slippery shoes man that's not what it was what yes it is she's getting older that was I'm getting older fall Oh watch it again that was like I'm lost my balance from I'm just getting older but it's so stupid shoes I can't find our recent one there you go she didn't really mean anything soon the story has gone on around recently but I swore there was one that they were referencing a year before like she ran it for a late birthday she ran one of the marathons for like her fifties something.if birthday 60th she's in her sixties right I feel like her 60th birthday or something like that she would never run a marathon though never you'll never catch me it's almost scary no I left run i run i run almost every day but i'm never gonna run a marathon why because i don't need to it's an insane amount of distance out of nowhere like someone's grilling it i can eat how about this how about there's it it died I mean yes right to the point how about this campaigns runs one a day yeah cam come on does I know but it's like enough we get it no that's too much it's too much you just his knees are gonna fucking fall off is body great right now they're gonna fall all over than you it looks good send me your knees camp send me your cartilage or your lack thereof no wonder if I tried a lot the inside of your knees gets accustomed to it like it gets a callus in there well no like it strengthens no cartilage shoes wears away at some point it's just not made to do that that's true look it up baby cartilage is gone how do those fucking 100 marathon people those dudes who write run those ultra marathons how do they do it year after year after year because they can't do it their whole life you do it for a chunk of time until your knees your kitchen if it's just like if you if you're just a bitch it gets the point where your knees a shot but if you keep going you push through it needs one to fixing themselves like just break you know you legs callus over well it's like there's a there's a campaign for a great cyclist called shut up legs if you look up shut up legs it's like a whole thing about it people worry about running ruins knees but a new study finds the activity may in fact benefit the joint changing the biomechanical environment inside the knee in ways that could help keep that could keep it work smooth working smoothly may vary less weight is known to reduce risk for knee arthritis come on Ronny may be good for your knees that's the New York Times you dummy you know jack shit okay failing the failing New York Times shot your mouth fail York Times lyin Ted crazy Ted many people worry about right knees no studies my decades are running okay but there's a little Evan support the idea and a growing body of research suggests reverse oh this is clickbait New York Times got us Abadie on epi epidemiological studies of long-term runners show that they made that they generally are less likely to develop osteoarthritis in the knees than people the same age who do not run sometimes scientists have speculated that running running may protect knees because it is often associated with relatively low body mass carrying less weight is known to reduce the risk of knee arthritis it's yeah it's a little of instead of ruins your knees but it also says some scientists have speculated running so these there's no evidence there's no evidence in proof they're just saying this is also possible go back up to where it was oh the widespread argument generally follows the lines that running will slowly wear away the cartilage that cushions the bones in the joints and Kozma thrives for this little evidence support the idea that makes sense okay okay so what I was saying I was incorrect I was just tried to jump paragraphs I missed the context of it well that makes sense like these fucking guys that I know this is what I'm saying these guys that I know that run all the time they have good knees and you would think they didn't these volunteers stop stop go back these volunteers visit a clinic where they had blood drawn from an arm the researchers also siphoned off a small amount of synovial fluid a lubricating fluid that reduces friction inside joints from their right knee healthy knees contain only what does that work soupcon of this stuff I don't even know what that word is otherwise unhealthy knees tend to contain much more interesting all right well my knees are gonna be good mmm I just thought you know this is all speculative - there's not enough research supporting it - nose well it makes sense though that your muscles would be stronger and then that would probably support your knee better than a person who doesn't exercise oh but that cartilage wears out either way anybody you know that's a great athlete they always said that I need that knee cartilage wears from so much wear interest which is like jumping a lot like yeah that's different like that's explosive plyometric type movements it's not running like running is just running yeah but it also depends on what you're running on - there's a difference - you're running it's like going left going right and it's cutting and exploding right left you know I can move that you would do on the court right you know and then if you're running on a trail where it's got some dirt you get a little cushion yeah there's something there there's some absorption there this is from 2017 this one is more updated off of a new myth toppling a new study that says that middle-aged runners do actually rebuild the health of their knees see what did I tell you we'll see a myth toppling new study of novice middle-aged runners suggests the answer is a qualified yeah what is the question again scroll up could it be that marathon training and racing are actually good for our knees maybe a new study you son of a bitch novice middle-aged runner suggests the answer is a qualified yes the study finds that taking up distance running rebuilt the health of certain essential components of middle-aged knees even if the joint starts off somewhat tattered and worn when I tell you bitch show me the studies but the results also contain a caution marathon mileage could erode one vulnerable area within the knees the study finds if runners are not careful we will want to talk about that because this was about what does that vulnerable part that's I'm saying that's what they do that they bury it stop there was a one area it's in the study we'll just scroll down I'm sure it'll tell us but what is it saying what part of the knee focused on running activity harms knees do you do scroll down suppose the question is mm-hmm is that the end of it no why do they do that would they break things up I can't stand that shit you have one free article remaining what is the problem with the injury what is okay okay let's find the one I would imagine cartilage is the big issue and meniscus when meniscus goes if it gets blown then you're done yeah look if you twist your knee and you cut your meniscus have you run a marathon no see you're giving me shit about I wouldn't now you wouldn't do it either I wouldn't do a half either I'm not doing it I don't want to run with all the people very specific spot it says the improvement to the damage subchondral bone of the tibial and femoral condyle eyes it makes perfect sense following the marathon at Novus runners and patellar cartilage mm-hmm that's the bad part that's what it does bad worsening of the patellar cartilage hmm that makes sense it breaks it down yeah but can you fix that yet I mean they forgive you they'll give you those yea stem cells are well I know that they do micro fractures and shit like they do all kinds of different things to people to try to heal the cartilage in their knees right yeah run I just realize how privileged running is that was like I just get to run sometimes during the day yeah just so you don't get so fat from eating all the food you want that's what's crazy the frivolity our problem in America is eating too much food yeah it's we have way too much access where it's we're spoiled with it yeah but I just realized that that a time of my day I get to go I can run to the gym and then run home and that's like a nice day I get to have nice lucky dude nice no I wouldn't you know I wouldn't run a marathon because uh I don't like the people that do that's genuinely it you see all the people that get it the thing the culture I don't want to be a part of it no thanks ring in the fucking bells and shouldn't taking them well I don't want to do any of that stuff now but like Tibetan monk chance yeah that's dope on your phone and just listen to that as you run for hours I would do bursts I would go run in the middle of nowhere before I'd ever run in an actual marathon planned thing okay so you would run the 26 miles like maybe you're on a track I know it has to can't be on the track track I've done I tried track when I first moved to LA I tried running at UCL likes my buddy got me a pass to go work out at their gym and I did attract the abhorred miserable let me ask you this if you had a track like a standard University track this is like how how many feet is that like was that quarter-mile what's most each lap is quarter mile quarter mile yeah how many times you go around I mean I could go around a hundred times are you paying me yeah yeah I could do it as many times you want to pay you had a bet what if like you and Jamie okay I have to bet Jamie doesn't run made this three-point shootout before we get into this race yeah let's do the three-point shoot and then we and then when you do that you don't run yeah yeah but yeah do people do that though it seems like that would be like a great bet if these ultra marathon runners really want to put their money where their mouth is they get together on track see how long they get go let's see who quits first that's fucked they would never stop they would never stop you can stop to pee or shit that's it what's the math cuz I'm dumb what twenty-six times four well hundred four if it's a quarter of a mile he's four of them four of them are a mile so 104 he'd be pretty close to a hundred huh you'd have to run 104 times to run a mile I'm to run a marathon on a track yeah four laps yeah so wouldn't answer your question can I run 100 laps on a track fuck now you were closing in on a marathon around around 100 times yeah 104 times is a marathon no way no fucking way like seven seven you hit seven and you're like all right I think I did it I don't wanna loop around this thing and what look at this look at this football field again miserable that's you miserable yeah yeah you're not even close it's gonna take another two and a half minutes for you to get to eight and then you get there can you run stone yes I can you like running stone I love it I can't do it I'll show you do it no cuz I'll get high with you and I want to hang out and play school yeah you run high it's great see I can I can do certain exercises hi what can you do stretching yoga type of shit yeah I can do that stoned out of my mind that's fun I just can't run because running to me it's like I need to I need to be in this mood that I get in when I get in this little mood and then I start to run it's perfect it's like a zone that I get into it when I'm high I will fall right out of it and I'll start doing thinking about way other shit people who surf they say that's the move surfing huh I like snowboarding hi that's very fun I like riding on a mountain stoned I can't believe you don't like skiing so weird that you don't like going down a mountain how do you not like it cuz I do so many things that are already thrilling other stupid thrilling yes you ruined my knees that doesn't make sense that's like saying I don't wanna die I wrecked this last time because some lady slid into the trail in front of me and I almost took her out and I have a small fracture in my shin bone oh you hit her no at the ground oh you smashed smashed hard that's what it is just trying to go around this late she she newb and shoes on this hill just like oops sorry oops sorry and just slid right into the trail and there was people over here and people over here and I'm like I could plow into this lady I gotta go down and I try to go around her and free my legs went out from under me I hit my head hard like really poor I hung my head yeah yeah yeah still got my bell rung but I fucked my knee up and then the next day I'm in yoga and when I'm bending down like real low my oh this doesn't feel good it felt weird it felt like something's wrong and then I got a MRI on it there's a small fracture it's called a insufficiency fracture it's like right where it's actually right where I had meniscus cut out of that knee too so the bones actually bang into each other because the Hohmann is cuz there and there's a crack in the bone on your shin yeah there's a crack in my shin bone fuck that it's not a big one it's a small area it's really not that big a deal and it was 2 months ago and right right now I don't even feel it anymore what do they have to do for what can they do for it now I got some stem-cell shot in to that and some PRP and I just took it easy I didn't do anything pounding PRP is platelet-rich plasma right so they spin your blood right and put it back in yep yeah fascinated by that just good stuff yeah there's so many different methods now to accelerate healing it's accentuating Ewing that's a good one exosomes is what they used I've used that on a bunch of different things I'm knees and shoulders and shed sounds great for the average Joe what is that what does that cost I don't know I wonder it's not cheap no some people can't do it it's well it should be of like a normal therapy it should be something that you go to the doctor and your insurance covers it and they they do that to enhance healing it makes a big impact I've sent many people to get it my friend and his wife had a problem with her hip and they were gonna operate on her labrum her hip labor mm-hmm they shot some exosomes in there and then when they went to do a follow-up examination the issue was gone like four months later the issue was gone she just wasn't old was he wasn't healing itself man was getting worse they had one exosome shot into this lady's labrum and then next thing you know four months later when they go to look at it like it looks great she's like I'm not I don't feel any pain anymore like it's it stopped hurting her it healed up trip it's not everything it's not everything there's a lot of shit they can't fix there's like when ligaments blow out you got to get it repaired you gotta get surgically repaired there's certain things that become you know injured where exosomes or you know war this stuff called Wharton's jelly which was this new advanced for mesenchymal stem cells all these different versions of stem cell therapy that they use some of them use bone marrow they go into your bone marrow extract stem cells from that and use that for different and reinjected and different areas or they do some sort of a treatment to it to make it to really accentuate the stem cells or activate them or whatever the fuck they do some of them do it with fat they suck your fat out so it's a nice nice little break fat-ass get in there and get some lipo I'm gonna turn your life over to some stem cells and fix all your joints I don't know there's not enough understanding of what's the best way to do these things I'm really lucky that have a really good doctor that kind of like is very honest and very I wouldn't say skeptical or cynical but he's very pragmatic and very very honest about the potential both ways whether it could do nothing or it could wind up being a waste of time or it might actually work like there's not enough information on some of this stuff so you're experimenting yeah some fucking science project yeah but you love that shit works I'm the polar opposites I'm like figure it out on Joe then give it to me come see me see if it breaks on no one loose well I don't wanna be the first I don't wanna be the first not the first there's been thousands and thousands of patients still seems young to me don't know and then some people do have peer-reviewed studies on the benefits of some of these things particularly people with dr. Neil Reardon has treated people with certain neurological issues they've they've helped them with stem cells with like CTE temperature stem cells literally injected straight in your fucking head and stem cells are injected intravenously first for some certain issues that people have yeah to try to fix your fucking brain Aubrey de Grey who's a life extension specialist was on my podcast last week yeah and he thinks that that's the future of regenerative medicine is that there advancements and stem-cell therapy and medical technologies that they're eventually going to hit some point where they can sort of treat aging like it's a disease instead of like it's an inevitability and treating it like it's a disease and actually reverse the process holy fuck no thanks you gonna look like you're 12 years old you're gonna go 30 when I was 12 you're gonna fuck it up you're gonna go so far you gonna turn to a little kid and your wife's Go Go I just I missed the old Santino my friends I'm gonna fuck you 13 times imagine if we get we fuck up and you do stem-cell therapy but it goes too far and you're like Benjamin buttons here's the other way all look like kids you go back to a kid you fuck up like imagine if they fucked it up imagine if like they go okay we've never seen this before Andrew um how tall you how tall are you like six six months and something like six month I've elected to because I think at the very least like the worst thing is you'll get to go 14 15 16 17 18 19 again good to do it all over again it's like you're a 14 year old with all the knowledge and I don't think you're gonna get any younger you're like what do you mean you don't think you know we don't know yet we're not sure and then you come back in four months later and you're smaller still I'm nine now you're nine years old you're losing like a year every six months I'm nine I'm holding in my poop my anxiety is at a high I'm not imagine if they can reverse the aging process what if they fuck it up and turn you into a baby and you got all this money and they're like just signing over your will when your to your face like he can't understand what signing a girl I'm too but I'm 50 - you got the pen and everything you're ready to write shit down mr. baby mr. baby the family's like there's no fucking way you cannot let him sign this he's to see nobody's but he can't talk and his arms are all flailing around it baby you have to sign everything off by the time you can't talk anymore cuz it's gonna get to a point in time we're just gonna make goo-goo noises like trapped a 55 year old man trapped in the baby do you die then day you just crawl right back at your mom's pussy that's she's gotta be around he's gotta be around to see baby - how's this work they gonna just put her on the same program bring her back some time she's 20 okay great climb right back in it was a reverse button you said like use it at the right time by the time you're 80 just go get down to the time you're six and then hit it again yeah yeah go back to just live forever I don't want to live forever but like just double instead of going on and then yeah but then you'd go Brett I wouldn't do it one more time be imagine being imagine me in 10 years old today like if you just had to go back to school at 10 and kids be trying to bully you and say stupid shit do you imagine what you would do to those kids murder well I wouldn't beat him up but I just just talking to them oh you could suck good mind fuck intellectually just try to be mean to you yeah like all Bobby you try and be meaning me Bobby yeah what's the matter Bob I know about you I know about your father's addiction and the fact that your mom's with the neighbor wait what there's a great there's a great scene there's a phenomenal seen in the show called pen15 these girls are like my age but they play teenagers on the show right it's cool it's great it's really funny but there was a funny scene when she gets pep talk into talking shit during a fight and and she's like her friends that call him an aardvark dick and he's like okay what else she's like just use any ammunition you have against him right and he's bullying the girl and she's like whatever aardvark dick and everyone's laughing and then she goes yeah and that's why your dad died and everyone's like oh shit that's me it's such a good seed and she's she thinks she's like fucking like everyone's cheering her on she says dad died starts crying yeah if you had if you had the intellectual capacity to just shut down like I mean it's it's you emotionally break word - oh you break it like when I'm around little girls like my daughter and her friends and they're all like talking about shit like sometimes like they have a birthday party and so does like 1012 kids at the house they're all talking shit to each other right and you get to just hover and listen it's like the thing and they're talking about like some boy at school who's always a boy yeah so some door picks his Bowie tears and he's so he's always trying to be funny so mean you know and one of them really like how old is she again 11 yeah that's yeah that's that's that's that's the that's the age when the boys are starting to show the signs of being a lot yeah this is the government we're just gonna let you know that the neighborhood's gonna be changing radically over there a couple years would you suggest you be careful things are moving their newfound powers yeah boners boners are coming boners are on the way the flight of the boners you prepare for your boner I mean no one even tells you what's going on all sudden you've got a hard-on like what is happening but that day on the bus when you get a boner on the bus holy shit this is your day up my friend John Dudley calls them bumpy road boners bumpy boners you're probably you know what it is it's probably the pressure on your prostates activating your dick to get fucking used to end it and also you're on the way home and you're you might catch a glimpse of you know Natalie who's got the tits already who's too young start to get hard as shit you miss your stop one girl who's 13 with giant double D's that was my dad like she was stacked when we were kids what happens there I used to I used to miss a bus stop seriously sometimes I'd miss a stop before my day if I had a hard-on and I kids afraid to get off the bus with a boner even though you tuck it up you know you tuck it up in your pants and I was always afraid so I'd miss a stop or two sometimes if I get a hard-on the way home Wow I'd be so nervous as a walk home fuck that yeah I'd rather lasted you talk yourself out of it I'd have a friend slap me and if I start fighting with a friend yeah if you start fighting with another dude friend did your dick goes right into your body it doesn't well then you get a whole nother thing going on then you get a new thing yeah I got a new thing now yeah I mean imagine if you had to go through that all again though and didn't know anything like that's if the torture I've seen like I mean I only understand boys like because I've never been a girl but the going through like being 10 11 12 going through school all the social things not knowing shit yeah you're a boy yeah it's so confusing like it sucks once you finally become a and you don't have to do that anymore you can just be at peace and your own scans like Oh imagine going through all that stuff again no I had no hiding jerking off to like like like you're like a fucking you look at me like you didn't you don't know what you're doing the bathroom for 20 minutes in a magazine you're a little ninja jerky or a jerk-off ninja no and now I kind of hope my neighbors see me you know it's kind of part of the part of the allure I jerk off in my living room sometimes to do hope and they walk by walking their dog wave holiday if they see you jerking off in your house I think you can get in real big trouble I think a guy got in trouble jerking off in his house with the windows up shut up your private he's pretty property no no no I think because you could see into this guy's house and he was beating off they why cuz there was kids or something like that remember what the story was but it was a big deal or people like hey the guy's just jerking off inside his own house like what is the big goddamn deal yeah I had the door open for the front door letting in the breeze of course there is yeah I bet people go to hotels and then they open up the door and they stuff a wedge on the door and start fucking and then let everybody walk by a watch yeah leave the door open that's that's Vegas especially before cellphones all these fucking goddamn tattletale cellphones dirty cameras back then people just I probably I bet that was a common thing just fucking with the door open yeah I'm like Hells Angels they all took over a hotel sacher wow those guys fuck with that door they fucked in the street and for they fucked at the bar and buy that voyeuristic thing never was like a thing from a know some people like fucking in public cause I think it's hot to maybe get caught never never got me it was always like my I don't fucking why do I want to know that someone's watching me that's creepy if you get arrested you get weird charges too like if you fuck someone in public in some places they'll hit you with like a sex offender charge yeah because it's exposure yeah dude I had to fight that in college I had urinating in public I had to fight a public exposure charge yeah that's a real problem because that's a piss and goddamn thing that every man understands and that's a little game they're playing yeah I was a dirty game you caught a guy taking a leak and you're saying that's public exposure look he shouldn't be taking a leak outside maybe but everybody's done it had to piss yeah when guys have to piss and there's not no one around they piss in alleys anyone doing that since the beginning of time right so for some fucking guy to pretend that that's is like robbing a house or trying to kidnap a kid right like that's not a sex offender no that's a guy that a P yeah but I had to be in a room in a in one of those rooms with people that did expose himself and I was like nothing like these dudes man I'm nothing like these fucking guys I was pissing outside near a bar walking if you pissed your pants I should have kissed your pants they can't say shit right I know it's not at least you pissed your pants in public though yeah but I have my pants on yeah but still you know have you seen these in Europe they've talked about bringing them some places in America I think but they you stand in there and jerk off I know they have opened urinals it's like in the middle of the street all those dudes jerking off in there for sure people get drunk I bet that smells like fish someone's pooped in one of those for your face the wrong way and err urinals caused uproar in patty's what would they rather have people just piss look at that guy he's got his hog here's the difference though otherwise they're asking all these coffee shops can I use the bathroom and people like no bathroom no bud well let him go pee then and the thing I feel like those would fill up quick San Francisco San Francisco has these but they're closed they're enclosed San Francisco they've ruined that place they're in close they've fucked up they fucked up they've ruined that place by allowing people just shit in the streets and not do anything I don't know what you can do about it but they should have taken steps to make sure it never got this bad meanwhile it's there's the it's the highest concentration of billionaires on earth I think that's what someone said maybe they don't live right there in Rome they work right there it's the highest contrition live in that area yes yeah yeah they live in like Atherton the big spot out there what's the what's the one what's in the senator City not Russian Hill no that's not what it's called Mission Hill elephants something I don't know you if you look it up but it's um the driver was telling me we were there he was like no man more billionaires live in this you know quarter-mile radius than anywhere in the world this is Marin County that's a lot of really rich yeah but this is in the city that's in an actual city of San Francisco it's just the everywhere yeah lots of pool so many people would take pictures of people poo in there Oh I mean I saw I saw that happens in LA - I was on Fairfax I saw a woman pooping on at a bus stop yeah did I take a photo I did I did oh so fucking sad yeah there's nothing there's nothing you can do about it San Francisco they're fucking they're drowning so far gone yeah it's the city it's filled with tents and it's so crazy I know just hand it back over to the homeless i remember what that's the human poo man it's just full oh my god where's the map that's where they found poo look at that though dude that's the real there's a park up there in the corner and that has the least amount of poo in it look at this San Francisco there must be a high spot problem plotted on foul map the city itself is in trouble see this is how medieval diseases get re they resurface they come back up yeah because it gets in the rivers and the drinking water that's how people got diseases back in the day in roams because a bad sewage either were pooping in a place they were drinking and eating from oh this is so bad yeah in the streets well isn't that the Ganges don't they have too isn't it filled with feces and dead bodies and stuff and they drink and bathe in it that's mind-bending to me but then San Francisco with all these rich people has this giant homeless shitting problem yeah a billionaire and then two blocks away is a guy pooping goddamn what could they do I mean they did something in New York City right they did some strong-armed type shit and they reduced the amount of homelessness in New York City they cleaned up Manhattan it's like sparkling clean now it now it looks like it's like a Six Flags like Manhattan has become this like very pristine nice safe clean it definitely could have gone off the rails in Manhattan that they did but they did it right somehow I don't know what did they do I don't know I mean I think that was also the implementation of like they doubled their police force they started busting people for everything people got you know scared of doing anything illegal in the city well we're real close to someone saying enough is enough and you get some some dude who comes in is gonna have some hardline Giuliani type right attack on the homeless problem in downtown in LA because la is up to 70,000 plus people homeless wow that's crazy that's actually Boulder Colorado Boulder of home just all the people in Boulder but homeless and they're concentrated mostly downtown and buy in like Venice right and then where the most of them are Boulder might be a hundred thousand I think Boulder I mean might be underestimate the amount of people in polder how many people you think live in Boulder Colorado 100 sounds low Boulder pretty big really the school is there and the school alone has got to be 70 K what 7 all right yeah but that schools got to take up the high majority that population isn't that school massive that schools fucking huge mean fifty sixty thousand kids that's the most for like any school really like Ohio State or Texas is like fifty sixty yeah but isn't boulder beach towns are strange right yeah young people and the old people who like staying near the university to people you should complain when I was in Arizona State people would bitch constantly about our own house parties like what are you fucking think this schools been around since 1896 yeah and they used to be in those parties these are far yes so stop so either fucking come over and get high with us or move let's move you gotta move - it's not my the school's been there when somebody moves to a school area and they complain it yeah well you know you know what they did about Westwood UCLA that whole thing is fucked up that's why there's no college town there because those community organizers basically made it almost impossible for young and new businesses to open up that would be supportive of like bars or restaurant culture they keep shutting it down because these old rich people in Westwood don't want that there they want it to be a neighborhood they fight UCLA tooth and nail to make sure that it's like no make the kids go fuckin live in Culver City or something it's bull it's bullshit it's bullshit yeah that's why I wouldn't move to a place where a college is I wouldn't move a block from a fucking major university how about that when I was in Boulder I was driving down the street and I saw a returnee house and I said imagine Zac Efron movie you live right next door to these fucks like that that's like a Zac Efron yeah Seth Rogen movie yeah what does it call it neighbors from someone yeah yeah but do you know better that's what I mean you know where you're moving you know where you move if you move next to a major school it's your fault whatever it's really cheap to live next to the fridge of course it is what do you mean it's got good out of house yeah that is there anything that fucks with your real-estate value more than a fraternity sorority it's like I bet they're loud but they're probably not gonna be lighting anything on fire no because they go to the guy's house they go to the frat to fuck shit up well also the dudes are the ones that the problems in terms of like violence and explosions and in chaos yeah drunk men yeah way scarier than drunk women all right drop I'll just cry they scream they tell bitches they're gonna cut them they might pull hair and punch each other but it's nothing there's not bombs going on man of shooting guns and lighting cars on fire and they're doing dumb things drunk man or fucking danger but that's what you're supposed to do when you're that age where's you're supposed to do dumb shit we just first start getting drunk and you're also supposed to realize how dumb it is that you're living in the house with these fucking savage men I gotta grow up and then by the time those three years or four years are done and you're out you're like enough I'm gonna be a different person turn over here I'm gonna live a long but it'd be a venture capitalist I'm gonna do I'm gonna be an angel investor and put two of those guys two of those guys still want to keep that party they just can't school for a hundred years yeah how long seven seven years and he never graduated I don't know if he did or not did you have a degree I guarantee you he bribed somebody you know it's got to be in hotel management if yeah if he has one I bet you that's what imagine if he did spend all those years on school tuition what a waste so much but isn't isn't his parents he comes from money right he'd what what is top partier I swear to God in my life I did not know that but I just knew it in my bones I knew it in my bones I had friends that did that they went for one buddy did agriculture yeah but Agriculture's real we need food he had nothing to do with it it was just a thing to do to cuz he didn't know what the fuck's so funny how much did that cost to get a degree in hospitality that he'll never use what do you got to say how many how much a year is FSU look he's had he's got an amazing career in stand-up comedy and I'm sure his experiences in the university probably did something to enhance his perspective that would help him on stage and stand well they made a fuckin movie out of it I mean ya know as the story was but was they borrowed it yeah they twisted it but it was all based on Bert Kreischer totally Van Wilder movie that was in each time Bert Kreischer yes there's an English major for six years I can't speak no English yeah he looks he looks exactly like what I fifth Florida was a person and me Berta was a human embodiment a fucking Bert Kreischer yeah with like a weird hat on yeah yeah well no shirt no shirt baseball hat not even a baseball hat you know like one of them weird fedoras kind of like Fedora no shirt and flip that's Florida's flip-flops ever he gave me a pair of his own flip-flops he's got a company that makes flip-flops now Berta does what are the what do they call birdies that's insane Bert Bert investing in a flip-flop company is now and it's a company that pre-existed and then he bought into it or he started it so it says Bert Kreischer free waters free water that's the company I guess they're a very solid flip-flop though thumbs up yeah yeah if you're into flip-flops these are great I wear flip-flops once a year just when I go to Hawaii I I don't really wear flip-flops I don't I don't like the toe divider I like slides you know slides I like slides I fuck with slides yeah I just can't do flip I don't like the toe divider weird weirds me out where to draw the line huh you yeah what's better what's better Jamie you like slides slides yeah a lot of dudes will rock slides with white socks yes and like serious dudes like guys who go to the gym like muscular young guys yep the oil slides and socks and they'll go wandering about comfy if you ever wear flip-flops and socks and you went out people would smack you there's a difference for some reason some guys can yeah but for some reason slides and socks is acceptable wearing flip-flops and socks are not well because then you do the Ninja Turtle toe you can't do the socks with the flip-flops cuz then your toe gets divided and then it looks really weird but isn't that strange yeah secure those both ridiculous we're in slide socks no it makes sense to me but at least it looks casual right slides and socks just I mean wear shoes man just slip my socks and these and go to the fucking don't go run over there real fast you can go to the grocery store with slides on and socks I go to the bank I won't say nothing nope go to the bank yeah I do small errands with slides and socks on well especially a guy like you you're a successful comedian you make

name Philip line how'd he said is it um he's the guy that got in trouble because they took pictures he took pictures of his sneakers he didn't get in trouble but Ferrari got angry at him because he has a Ferrari and he took pictures of his sneakers sitting on his Ferrari so what and Ferrari said that he they send him like a cease and desist saying that he's damaging their brand his car so there was a big controversy because like hey bought your fucking three hundred thousand dollar car he should be able take a picture of his sneakers in your car or just set it on fire if he feels like it what the fuck his it was something about his lifestyle that the lifestyle I got the notes but the lifestyle that he promotes is just his hot girlfriend and him and they're wearing clothes how do they there's nothing crazy what do you think buys Ferraris yeah fuck this is it so yeah there's that's a dope collar for that is a beautiful fucking color I've never seen a green Ferrari threatens to sue do that as a that makes me want to make a Ferrari that color that's a dope color yeah okay tarnish is the reputation of Ferraris brands and causes Ferrari further material damage that's his behavior they'll lose that letter to plane also says that he was using Ferraris trademarks for the promotional purposes of increasing his own brand and products visibility again the cars pictured uplines own Ferrari is essentially claiming that plying is harnessing its iconic imagery to bolster his own brand and also denigrate Ferraris how is it denigrating Ferraris though like scroll back up it's just a dope looking colour Ferrari and some pretty fucking cool sneakers those are cool I don't understand how that's denigrating the brand who do they think is buying fucking Ferraris like did they have this idea that it's Harvard grads that are buying Ferraris well some of them were Harvard I think most people that buy Ferrari didn't go to Harvard do me a favor well honestly a full picture of his green Ferrari before those pictures have been taken off Instagram so like oh but you see if you can just find his green Ferrari because I know that motherfucker he's got a green Ferrari he takes a lot of pictures of it there's no way that's the only picture of his doped green you would assume Ferraris brand is to promote people who are like self-made money making that's what this guy is right he's neither said there it is is that it is that is there any other ones the photos of it yeah see it's just all his girlfriend looking hot and him looking sexy and here's a dope come to Lambo yeah here's a my gold Lamborghini dope here's my fucking hilarious it might be I was at his store they have a store in Vegas and they had $6,000 crocodile sneakers you didn't know bro I mostly wear chucks or

why the fuck do we buy that that's called that's an insane amount of money for no reason the thing that I like that I spend money on that's kind of ridiculous is the cars yeah you got a car yeah you

because we're like just put up some shit oh my you put some stuff on the wall that represents what you like we're gonna we're gonna it's brand new we just started the whole thing we haven't done it yet also you know you need an American flag behind you that should be what we all do now go to go to episode three go to episode three and go to the very well go to the beginning I think is this is an episode where I brought a airsoft gun to the studio Bobby with a gun is a you know who those glasses are you reading the script yeah that's reading sweet sweet nothings but Bobby got a gun but I mean I gave Bobby's where it slides him and he well he always works automation he's wearing slides go to the very end go to the very very end real quick there's a the airsoft gun comes out way later there at the very end imagine if we all dare that every podcast we're gonna have an American flag in the background we're all decided to do it that way oh here it is yeah and I shoot a TV people didn't like people people got freaked out they thought it was a real gun I think this is one you had to be there things yeah no no it's not no no I'm saying but I brought an airsoft gun which is a bad break the TV yeah Bobby Darin issue the TV so I did it we're children he run a BB like what's it shooting its airsoft gun so BB gun yeah oh so you shot a BB at the TV yeah like I shoot a gun inside a TV yeah Bob Bob does that stuff to me only when I'm with this moron do I do such dumb smoke cigarettes in there too he started smoking again yeah not inside we make him go outside no how long did he quit for he quit for a while didn't he yeah he was vaping he was vaping for a long time but now he's uh now he's back back on it he's trying to get off of it he's trying but we'll see if it actually had well if he's smoking he's not trying to get off of it no he wants to stop and get him what's to stop but you know there's not a weird thing like if you trying well you could just stop yeah I mean I smoked for a while and I quit it was you know but Hong smoked for a couple years do you like cigars nope you don't know cuz it makes me want to smoke like Burroughs always like what do you mean you know I want to smoke so I was like cuz it makes me want to smoke a cigarette cuz some sometimes I do want a cigarette used to smoke cigarettes didn't you yeah I could tell burr loves the cigars but when every supplement is drinking that's cuz he doesn't want to drink anymore that's why he likes smoking I think he liked him when he was drinking too though yeah but now more than ever I think he smokes way more cigars and he ever did when he was drinking oh yeah cuz now he's almost gotten rid of the sauce completely right I think so yeah he went a whole year without drinking that's not it's funny the number though yeah I don't think I could go a year how long do you think I could go without crap what do you think I've done a month I've done a month when'd you do a month why'd you sober October with us this year okay do you maybe you know how much I like drinking October is my birthday Oh sweetie and I'm gonna be a come on it's hard for me it's a thing every year I know but here's what we do it's interesting it's a thing but it's so easy for you because nothing has a grasp on you alright like that doesn't that like drinking and smoke a little pot that it doesn't control you the way that like it's a real challenge Bert not drinking was a written actual check for you I don't think it's a real challenge well it's a challenge in that it's something that you commit to yeah but you but you do that constantly on your own anyway you're you're doing it against guys that don't constantly do it on their own yeah there's a little bit of that but it's good for people I think but even for me just knowing that I have to do something for a whole month and I think that's one of the really good things about when we did that workout challenge yeah then out six hours a day you realize you can actually do that yeah that's insane I've never thought he could do that I've never even thought about doing that but when you know that you're competing gets three other assholes and and you like let's let's fucking do this bitch everybody's getting up like all hyped up and I would get up and I would read them the fitness tracker results that like Tom had put in fucking 15 miles earlier in the day I'm like shit yeah that's and he's on the East Coast and I'm the way or you know Ari's doing something crazy we rides a bike while he's watching a movie for two hours and he's got this crazy high school or I'm like oh no and everybody was doing that so everybody was checking their app and then going and doing crazy shit all day right so by the end of the month we were literally working out at least three to four hours every day like hardcore that's absurd that's absurd I did one day I did more than seven hours at 80% of my max heartrate yeah I worked out all day how much weight are you losing I was eating everything as you just constantly did I didn't lose any weight you're just maintaining it was also mixing it up so I wasn't going crazy I was doing cardio and I was also doing weights and I was doing a bunch of this thing and I was eating like a wolf yeah I mean eating like a wolf broke into a house it was tearing apart the cupboards it was horrible I was drinking a lot of soda too like I was like craving sugar from the actual soda so I was drinking like a whole sugary cream soda you know like I did this elliptical machine for I don't know how many hours but it was at least five maybe six hours on this elliptical machine in one fucking sitting yeah where there's puddles on the ground I set off the fire alarm in the room from my steam there's a video of it on the ground from my sweat and setting have you just keep going see if you watch movies that are exciting right and I have his TV right in front of me so I'm watching I watched the scene in John wick in the Russian bathhouse where it kills everybody yeah there was that scene 50 times in a row well you just kept looping it kept going back and watching it again because there's something about that scene where you pretend that you're John wick or you pretend you're someone's trying to kill John wick and you're in the middle of this whole fucking shootout stab them cut that guy look out this one and it's a fucking super intense scene so I would just watch that scene over and over and over again and then I'd watch other movies and I get bored and I'd go back to that movie again and I watched John wick to a bunch of times to like but the hyper violent scenes yeah when you watch those you feel like you're there like you're locked in another thing is fights I would watch fights all day while you're a bike or elliptical or a stair mail or something like that you can watch fights and you know like you like you start seeing stuff happen and why are you doing that you the excitement of the fights carries you through your work are you listening to you call a fight sometimes that's fucking why yeah but it's really that's it doesn't matter what matters is good fights really what it like it doesn't help me hear my own voice is weird but the good fights anytime it's a crazy chaotic fight yeah you'll get hyped up and your your mind will think about that more than you thinking about the burning in your lungs or the burning in your legs and like just the momentum of something exciting carries you really far it's like music music music music for me when I go run it's music that's it that like I've tried to do on the elliptical when I watch something I can't do that I just can't like I gotta have something I do music or a podcast or an audio book then I can get it if you know that you're gonna be on the elliptical for hours it'd be hard for me to walk I don't know why but my I don't like watching something when I'm on them on a machine that's why that's why again the gym for me is just a place to lift weights in between running mm-hmm I can't be in there and the elliptical the treadmills they give me nightmares like these fucking things I just got to be outside you like running outside yeah you just can't do it no I make sense I can't do it yeah I can't do it yeah it's um I never done a spin class but people love that shit nope not gonna do that okay I did the peloton in a hotel I did peloton once in a hotel yeah and and my my tush was in such pain my my undercarriage my my grundle mine if Ken and my asshole were in pain I don't think you're supposed to sit down well I was putting the seat in my asshole I thought that what you're supposed to do the whole time I Spit on it nice no I did I did it I did it I did the workout and it was a great workout I will say it was awesome but I don't like bikes that much I don't like biking that much I don't yeah it's not for me like well it's always more exciting to do something fun like if you can play a game like if you play basketball you get your cardio from that oh that's great that's the best yeah or soccer soccer is an awesome game for cardio Jesus who has to be in better cardiovascular shape than soccer players they run for 90 minutes straight no way they have another game tomorrow yes all right boys rest up you got one in eight hours I mean those dudes are always fucking cut and left and cotton right and stopping oh yeah there are those guys aren't probably the most like a high-end cardio shape of all pro athletes they also pretend to get hurt worse than anybody in any of that's part of the thing you know I don't really love that but it's part of the thing Ian Edwards are trying to explain it to me one time I just we're a big part of the things pretending you got hurt imagine and imagine a UFC fight if a guy like walks in flinches and the other guys I get down in the refs I'm warning you do to either hit him don't flinch well that's like uh you know they're flopping flopping in the NBI flopping is a weird thing taking doing NBA as well it's a big thing man it's used to not be a tit but it used to not be you know with the ideas that you can get someone to call a foul and trick the ref and then yeah yeah men it's when you start to build up fouls against the other team they can follow I don't they check the replay before they ever do anything like that okay so if a guy flops you know for sure that he's faking it why can you penalize him I mean that's not part of a bitch card big pink card bitch in soccer you get a yellow card if you're being a bitch so that's coward that's even better than pink if you think can be powerful you can get a technical in basketball you you can get a technical foul in basketball so pretending to be hit technically do it for that what do they do it for like yelling or fighting or but or if you're enticing some bullshit like if the guys flopping and in the ref knows he's full of shit and he's trying to entice this guy he'll give him a tech if they're John at each other because that's what usually what happens so in one way it kind of leads down the same road you end up getting the refs call out the bullshit they have to do it in a different way or they'll hit you with an unnecessary foul to check you to be like I know what you're up to you're full of shit like you know taking a charge means if you stand still someone's got to run into you sometimes they'll call it on you just to be like you're fucking your you know you're cheating a little bit you're stepping in the way you're breaking the rules yeah I don't I don't know basketball enough to know what's going on it's like a different the difference I think between like a fight and a basketball right go an octagon referee versa didn't be referee the guys in the NBA are controlling the game every game is different there's not there are rules but some are easily bendable or breakable at times depending on what is actually going on like if you might allow a travel if a player doesn't actually get an advantage on that you're right it took an extra step you don't want to slow the game down you don't want to ruin everybody there to get it it's kind of like it's like intervening in a fight too much of a ref is coming in it's like you don't want them you don't want to really fuck up the rhythm of this thing because you know it's in it for the for the players purpose and the fighters purpose and for the entertain at some point you're like you just ruining the fucking thing for every wasn't there an issue years ago that referees were being paid by like gamblers Oh Tim Donaghy there's a whole like he's booked a lot yet about well he said he was betting on advantages that he knew about not necessarily like making something happen in a different way I called more sure yeah weren't the referees though that were accused of doing certain things got caught he was refereeing anyone to jail yeah he got caught he got fucked I mean this happened this actually happens more often than not I mean the most famous betting story is Piero's and baseball was getting you know that they don't think he did anything to somehow or another well he never bet he never bet on his team's games that was his thing he bet I thought he did though I thought someone called bullshit on that I don't think they ever found it I don't think they found that he was I don't think he was betting on his own why don't you google did Pete Rose ever bet on his own games but anyway so the problem was that he bet on baseball well yeah but with Tim got Tim Donaghy the the NBA raft they said they were betting on games and the basically mean Pete Rose yeah he said the only bet on this team to win he never bet against them right he bet on other games and then only bet on them to get a W well man am I wrong and thinking that should be okay I don't think it's wrong if you bet on your team to win why wouldn't you put your money where your mouth is building a book obtained that says a night a sexy bet against the team he bet against them that's what I that's right that's right okay so that's the issue but I think you should be able to bet for your team to win can't you fight your team to win for sure in a fight in Vegas can't you put a bet on you to win could you bet on yourself to what hey guys do that yes well why not I don't know we should totally be able to do that but there are one-man team I think the real question would be if he bet against his team it says he did in that if that is the case and he did something to win the bet and tried to cost his shirt like made decisions that weren't the best decisions put the wrong people in this right Scherzer well then the other side of it is even on a one-man team let's say I me and you were fighting I but I bet me to win but you know that you're gonna throw the fight and I'm gonna get you some of the winnings do you know what I mean that's the other side of it oh okay because there's other people involved yeah you could definitely do that we can make agreements if I said hey man you got to throw this fight you're basically paying you to throw the fight knowing that I'm betting on myself do you but but yeah yeah yeah and I would bet against myself fuck yeah right yeah that's definitely done yeah that's where it gets Shady well referees in boxing for sure I've been shady and so have judges judges have been caught for sure rendering decisions that didn't make any sense and then you know taking money yeah they must have I'm I don't know how many times they've been like let's find out how many boxes jeez boxing judge arrested for corruption just Google that Pete roasting is very confusing oh yeah and more about I guess if he bet on him bet while he was a player versus being a manager and it says documents obtained by outside lines reflect betting records from 1886 which is when he was a player 1886 Christ it's shown no evidence that rose who was a player then bet against his team sorry I misread that well yeah but that was a stipulation of there's no evidence that he bet against himself or his team red ok then I'm fine with it again yeah yeah like if I was a fucking player and the coach said I just put 5 grand you motherfuckers let's do this shit I'd be like that coach believes in us talkin a it's putting his money on it you know that stipulations were that or the argument was whether or not he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame of course he does you know that was all that 100% it's a savage sport where guys are hitting a leather covered ball string you know yeah what do you mean you're smashing this thing and you're running around you you're it's a since it's a sport sports are all dominated by savages what is this may be the worst referee I guess it's videos about asked about the boxing thing oh there was a really bad stoppage this past weekend in the UFC really bad really bad that gets so much controversy huh but this one was a bad one it was the worst stoppage I've ever seen there was this guy will pull up the you could find it in the UFC's I've got to remember how to say this guy's name what did he claim he stopped the fight well the referee I don't want to call the referee out there's no need to everybody knows what it is he's a nice guy he fucked up referees fuck up sometimes he thought the guy was hurt and he wasn't hurt he was faking it okay so the Mago Med uncle I've think that's how you say it and I forget I say coup de bellas first name I think it's Eon I think it's Eon clues about yarn so coup de Bell was playing possum if you watch the video you can see the video it looks like he's playing possum see he's pretending he's hurt see he got hit for sure but look how he's wobbling his head back and forth he's trying to sucker him in for that right hand right trying to pretend that he's hurt and then throw that right hand the referee stops the fight while he's throwing punches as soon as the referee stops the fight he's like I'm fine what the fuck are you doing that's not a guy who's rocked if you watch it again you can see that he definitely is getting hit but you can also see that like when he like that that's fake that that's wobbly with the head well cause he throws haymaker he's trying to lure the guy into thinking that he's so hurt that he can't control himself and he's trying to throw haymakers but he's also definitely getting hit too so I could see how the referee fell for it but you gotta let guys fight you gotta let guys fight and sometimes referees in the interest of the fighter trying to save a guy from damage they step in and they make a mistake that's an easy mistake to make because it is a really bad stoppage but because the fact that he was faking like he was hurt but he wasn't faking like he was hurt enough to stop a fight now I didn't like it when the guys swinging back with big wild haymakers he can win at any time I mean we've seen fucking bridle I mean there's been many many fights where you see a guy when a fight that he's getting dominated because he catches the guy who gets overzealous and tries to finish him off that's what we got robbed of the referee fucked up or the you know the the referee I mean he fucked up but he also was a little bit tricked by this guy's trying to lure this guy in by pretending and then exploding right he didn't look like even if the guy was really that rocked it wasn't enough to stop the fight that guy was throwing back he was defending himself he was moving back with his hands out but he's trying to fight you know the fight just doesn't end when someone gets hit right like no the fight ends when you can't protect yourself anymore when it's defenseless yeah it was very dangerous still that was a bummer to watch that's that's real well you feel bad for the guy who fucked up a little bit not a you know the referees not a bad guy he just fucked up and then the fighter you gotta think that guy trained for months for that moment and he's trying to sucker this guy in I mean maybe he's got this thing that he does is he Russian like he's hurt I don't know where coup de bellas from is that rest gonna die member if he's Russian I rep said it's I don't think it's a corruption thing I think that's just a mistake yeah it's fucking hard it's a fucking hard job man that's me in there these dudes are throwing their fucking knees in each other's faces and I and it's just you yeah the only that's the other thing other sports have many refs you're the only one dude fuck that yeah yeah the pressure is insane so many other sports can rely on other referees to go oh shit I think we fucked up where I fucked up this one is like it's this dude that was a bad call yeah that was a bad call but it happens it's our gigs and
