how do I pronounce your name colione nor Kohli on yeah okay yeah now there's a conspiracy out there okay I made this name up yeah we'll talk about that we're talking about we're live ready how did you do that so quickly oh you're a wizard what's the conspiracy about you and your name is Kohli Anwar yeah what's the conspiracy about your name that I made it up to hide who I really was oh yeah a type yeah like like everybody gets to have like pseudonyms except for me when you're talking about guns you don't get to have seed names did you have a different name yeah my name is Collins oh okay so you did change your name yeah I did but there's a conspiracy behind you changed your name but that's not real you just decided you wanted a different name I got into guns and I wanted to start watching gun videos and so I wanted to make a youtube channel and I didn't want to use my real name cuz I thought that wasn't cool enough it's alright so it's not your name wasn't cool no I didn't touch a african-american thing yeah yeah I mean I know comedians who change your names like earthquake you don't know worth quake is fucking hilarious comedian man he's hilarious but a white dude couldn't call myself earthquake okay good no you could but nobody would wrestler I was a wrestler name earthquake that's different yeah that's different that's probably a big giant guy right so what's your original name what's your actual full original name I'll give you my first name I'll just I just don't wanna make it easy for people to Charles Collins bouncing around it yeah cold the way it's a fine name something wrong with that name I wasn't the wrong with it why'd that name bother you to the point where you didn't want to have it on no I just you just thought it'd be more fun to just come up with a pseudonym for my youtube channel like I didn't start my youtube channel thinking all right I'm gonna start this channel and I'm gonna build this whole brand box right no who's just one it's for fun yeah my friends call him one of my friends he called me killer calling all right that was a kind of little nickname that I had and so I was like okay well just use going on and then I'm like I'm always in black why did he call you killer cold yeah no idea just talk to him to this day and I still don't know why he called me that yeah there's nicknames man that just happened sometimes there is a rapper in Houston by the name killer : yeah okay yeah so I don't know if maybe he listened to him and in my name collins and so forth and so on yeah so so how did you get wrapped up with the nra so we should kind of we should cover a couple of things here the origin story yeah so you're kind of like a spokesperson for the nrn not official spokesman on official unofficial no today you are a member of the NRI do they recognize you do they appreciate you like how does that work okay so the way it started do you I mean I'm gonna start from the beginning okay all right so I had a friend of mine a good friend of mine who called me up one day and was like do you want to go shooting and I was like oh cuz that time I were really wasn't pro-gun and this was about I was around 23 holding air for I'm 34 so this is 10 years ago yeah and I hesitated a little bit because my background growing up like I didn't grow up with guns in house no one in my family had a gun and for me the idea the notion of being a young black male with a gun it's always I don't saw it exactly through the lens of you know gang banger drug dealer so forth and so on so that's the mindset I had with respect to firearms unconsciously right I didn't even realize it was in conscious of it until I started getting into this very head and realized okay wow I was thinking like that didn't realize it and so but at the same time I told myself why am I afraid of essentially what is an inanimate object right so I think to myself I'm like alright I really don't want to go I'm a little terrified but you know what I'm gonna go ahead and do it and so I remember getting to the range we get to the range and we walk into the door and then I hear the door for where the actual bays are and I hear the pop-pop-pop go off oh my holy crap this is actually happening and so it kind of had this nervousness but I'm with my friend right and so I don't want my friend to feel like okay you're acting kind of like a bitch alright hmm so I kind of kept it to myself you get to the counter we do all the paperwork that you know requisite paperwork liability forms all that and he has his gun we get some ammo we go to the lane I remember as a very last Lane it was a lady the range was Top Gun in Houston and so we go to a very last range he gives me kind of like a brief instruction about how to shoot the gun how to load it so forth and so on and so at that point I remember picking up the gun terrified not knowing what to expect not knowing what was gonna happen so I remember picking it up it was a little Taurus PT 1151 11 millenium in 40 caliber and this was a subcompact probably not the best first time shooting to fucking Sun well the gun itself a small caliber example yeah okay exactly so my experience if anybody who watched that as a gun person would be like oh this is not gonna end well so I remember standing at the bay and then taking the gun and pointing it and shooting it and I remember just the concussive force the explosion with the gun dancing in my hand and I was like holy crap that was terrifying then I shot it again like this shit and in the weird thing is it not in a way that most people think the nerdy aspect of my brain kicked in right I'm like holy crap like I'm taking this project down and I'm launching it right several feet and I just cuz the second shot allowed me to realize what just happened I just contained an explosion in my hand right I'm like if you don't find that amazing you want the pulse it's amazing the thing that people are bothered by is what comes with it and how people use it mm-hmm and I think an analogy that's a fair analogy but people reject is driving cars and a lot of these fucking psychos that have been running over people in the street I mean it just happen again Berlin yeah what somewhere somewhere in Germany some guy ran a bunch of people over and then blew his brains out it's it's an object right it's a thing that you use and I'm a huge car guy - same as well now yeah I love cars I mean if someone said we have to ban cars because people started running people over with cars they'd be like well okay I think we're dealing with a whole bunch of problems and there's there's a bunch of things that I think we could probably agree on one of the things we agree on is all these mass shootings are horrific absolutely they're terrifying it's it's an evil terrible thing that here's another thing no NRA members are doing that that's one of the things that's really kind of fucked up about people getting angry at the NRA yeah we've never had a mass shooting ever not that I can recall that was done by an interim and I looked I tried to find out I can't find a mass shooting that was perpetrated by an M RN R a member and I think it's so the biggest problem that a lot of gun owners especially NRA members have is people like the conversation that's being had is basically coloring or actually forgetting the human element behind those three letters mm-hmm like the NRA isn't like this demigod that just sits in a cloud of Olympia and it's just one big guy that just it's orchestrating this entire thing yeah it's you're talking 5 million people you know all right like I'm I'm I'm a member I'm a gun owner right that that's who I am along with five million other people who are that way and then there are a ton of other people who think they're honorary members in art and then a ton of other people who probably don't mind being an RA members they just haven't got around with doing it and getting a membership yeah and the vast majority of those people and I'm saying that just to be safe they're good people I think there's quite a few good people the people that have perpetrated all these mass shootings are definitely not good people the what's wrong with them well I'll tell you what's not wrong with them guns it's not guns that are wrong with them they use the guns to express what's wrong with them you know and everybody wants to look at the object which I get what's easier well it is easier and it's it's something that everyone's pointing to like why do you need an ar-15 why do you need of this well I need that these are good questions why do you need these things why do I need that fucking samurai sword over there I don't know you know it's like what do you need yeah okay and that's another thing too though like and I've said it before I think we are a victim of our own success in this country right I do think this is the greatest in the world but the problem with that is is this country was built on an ideological foundation that I think it aids in that our ability to be as great as we are but we live in the world now where people don't see the necessity for something that was never predicted that was never supposed to be seen through the lens of necessity in the first place the Second Amendment doesn't give me a right it preserves something that already existed but what happens is we have a culture of people who don't who look at the second women as a privilege not a right they look at it as a privilege so that's why they say well why do you need that well why do you need more than 10 rounds why do you need this why do you need that and I'm like first of all we're framing the entire conversation under need when that's not what the Second Amendment is about it's a right that I've already had it's a natural right that I had the moment that I stepped foot on this earth as a person the right to self-defense is universal yeah and the you know people say okay it's a right but obviously there's a problem so we have to do something about it so you're gonna have to give up your guns this is this is the common conversation and it's very flippant and it's not well thought out and there's no consideration whatsoever to mental health issues mmm I think this is purpose I think that's the primary problem I that's I've been saying this from the get-go I think it's the primary problem I think it's a mental health issue and people say oh that's simplifying it I don't think it is I think it's the opposite I think it's it's ignored yeah look it's a there's something wrong when you have this many people on mental health medication and then when you look at the number of mass shooters it's almost universal almost every single one of them is on some sort of psychiatric medication but that's not a part of the narrative that's not a part of the conversation the conversations always get rid of guns now I don't want crazy people to have guns I don't think you do either no I don't so outside of taking away the rights to have guns from normal law-abiding people like yourself and myself I have guns what what do we do okay so first of all I think we need to frame the conversation and into specifics right you're a lawyer right I am okay so you understand and bills and amendments and law okay yeah and so I think one we're lumping the entire conversation in one category right if we're gonna talk about school shootings let's talk about school shootings okay right so first thing I say is because one thing a lot of people on that side like to say is well you guys just don't want any any gun laws and you say no to everything but you have no so that's true but to to stand up for that it's because all they want to do is take away the guns yeah they're saying let's take away the guns you're saying we're not gonna take away the guns you guys just don't want to get your guns taken away yes you're right right no one wants to get their guns take away and inoculate but a monster as a result of saying exactly you want kids to die and it's it's a fucking real sneaky conversation it's disingenuous yes it is and and that's and that took the odd thing about it is it's you anybody who's paying it into the discourse in a way is happening especially on social media right anybody who follows my Twitter my Twitter account knows this multiple occasions I've tried to have a rational conversation with people who are complete opposite side of my spectrum of this issue is there any of this online they're like debates raised like that well no I mean it's just on Twitter tweets going back and you can't do anything okay okay occasionally you can it's a goddamn miracle yeah it is people being friendly you want to see me flustered yeah respond to me rationally well because I'm always you know I have this right and I actually have to check myself about that a little bit because how am i any better than the people on the other side if I have the same if I have the same energy that they have towards me that's a very good point and so I've started you know what I mean cuz I can be incredibly snarky yeah like I can't and it's partly due because of my friends they're all assholes just like all the friends I grew up with I grew up arguing with a group of guys who when they were losing it logically they went to jokes right right it was like a man right yeah it took me a second to realize it because I was the one in law school right I was the one that was going to law school real all that stuff so everything I did was focused and centered good idea logic logic logic you're not making any sense and you know crack a joke and then everyone's laughing and I realized there's some power to that right you know what humor you should know something about that yeah just a little for sure and so I took on some of those qualities in the way that I advocate for the firearms hmm you know because it can be a little disarming but the disarming aspect of it could be beneficial because it causes people to drop their guard a little bit right and then when you drop your guard you can take in information more objectively more so than waiting or looking for confirmation bias or instigating your cognitive dissonance because you just don't want to hear the thing that caught that's contrary to what you already believe I just think you need a lot of character like as a person to be able to communicate reasonably on Twitter there and there's a lot of people that are just lacking that so it's almost like the ability to steal and no one's looking the ability to shit on someone with no eye to eye contact no social repercussions no you know you're not feeling anything from that person you say something rude to them they're not in front of you so don't feel terrible saying it yeah no it's it's not gonna lie so Twitter is a dirty place but it's a great place to sometimes it is it has its benefits I think there's some really good conversations to be had on Twitter and I've had really interesting moments on Twitter where I've learned a lot about things where people sent me links and I've retweeted them and I've learned a lot of things but it's it's hard sometimes man because there are so many people that are just unreasonable and they're not good at communicating and they're not happy they're not happy people not man there's a lot of people out there that just aren't happy man it's you know and it'd be honest with you I didn't realize it until I got to the notoriety that I am now in a space that I'm in well you're in a weird space yeah because you're in the space of defending guns no and I'm black yeah and I'm relatively young yeah it's a lot going on there and we were a lawyer and I well they disregard that well they pay attention well it doesn't matter because I have I'm doing I'm advocating also with certain three letters behind me and then they automatically assume as the devil now how does the NRA feel about you do you know I mean do you have conversations with them are they saying good job or they they please door I mean as far as I can tell they are yeah and you know we still have the relationship we have it's very much a very symbiotic relationship it's a weird one right now because it's like this is what I hear from the NRA mm-hmm I hear Kohli on and then I hear Ted Nugent I I gotta be honest I'm not I'm not the biggest fan of Ted Ted Newton's rhetoric but I do know where it's coming from but then again I didn't grow up listening to Ted Nugent yeah that's not my demographic time Ted Nugent is still an individual and people fail to understand that like we like we may be monolithic on that only issue of firearms we're not monolithic in the way we go about expressing it well he's right about things yeah you know just because someone's outrageous doesn't mean they're not right like have you ever seen his thus the debate that he had in a gun store with Piers Morgan yeah no the funny thing is that dude is incredibly bright he's smart raising hell I don't even think he's crazy I do listen you can only you can only kill so many things before you lose your fucking marbles Ted lives on a fucking ranch in Texas where it's all fenced in he's just shooting all animals he hunts every day he's a psycho and I don't do respect I'm a big fan of stranglehold so what so how what's where's the line of demarcation between comic Regis honey too much and not hurting enough in terms of becoming its crossing over that line into into sociopaths well I'm just joking I'm a hunter I mean it really depends entirely upon what he's doing with the meat and i know he gives it to hunters for the hungry i know he gives it to neighbors and and friends and there's nothing wrong with that and he asked he actually has he has an obligation to be the steward of his land because he has a lot of exotics and stuff and I'm just totally joking around oh no I know but when you like you listen to his conversation with Piers Morgan which Piers Morgan takes that flippant left-wing knee-jerk reaction arey you know really arrogance yeah he's a content and when when he's on with Ted Ted just knew everything about the actual facts when you start running around with statistics of gun violence he's like do you know how many of those people were bad guys that were shot by cops there do you know how many of those people were people that were shot when they were breaking the people's homes do you know how many those people were people that were killed in self-defense yeah there's a lot yeah it's not and do you know how many those people when you say talk about gun violence how many as people were suicide yeah there's a lot keep in mind that's recent suicide well no so here's what happened so when I started getting really deep into the advocacy component of it everyone was screaming 30,000 people day died from gun violence 30,000 people today that's what they were running with right and they were scaring all the suburban house moms oh my gosh we got to do something about gun control we got to do something about guns so I jumped into the pool and I just like something doesn't seem right about that figure right I'm not saying I'm wrong about it it seemed inflated it seemed elated I don't know what it was it's on a subconscious level and maybe or maybe was me looking for confirmation bias right because I felt the way I did about fires I'll be honest and say that right and so what I did is I kind of was just little more and I realize holy over 65% of that 30,000 suicides 65% real yes Jesus Christ so what is that like eighteen thousand people a day shoot themselves man something crazy like that what do we say at the top of the show man people are miserable man that's a fucking crazy number though man that's a Kevin Hart concert yep pretty much all together good night everybody blam well that's really what it is 18,000 people dad that's fucking incredible so then it but then it begs the question that you brought it before the mental health aspect yeah how much how much how many lives would we actually save if we took the same energy we applied to just making guns evil and trying to ban guns and to take that energy and put it towards understanding what it is why as a society we have a society that is so eager to really not want to be here anymore hmm expand that a little bit more because we have all the guns in the universe here in America right compared to any other country but yet our suicide rates should be seemingly higher than all the other countries that don't have as many guns but it's not the case right you look at the UK you look at Japan Japan has double our suicide rate does it really oh yeah double yeah wow so sixty thousand people a day in Japan or whatever the fuck you go complain again did I say you earlier a day yeah yeah cuz you know someone thirty thousand yeah what I say a day thirty thousand a year doesn't sound that bad cuz 300 million people oh yeah so you would think about it predicated on on a daily basis no no no no annually annually yeah yeah that doesn't make any sense why would I think that I think you might have said on accident - oh really yeah every 130 3091 yeah thirty thousand three thousand a year gun violence they call it gun gunfire right right but in reality you break those numbers down 65 percent of those are suicides and about five percent of those are our goddammit I think justified homicides including times when cops shoot someone in self-defense and it's justified right and self-defense shooting so forth and so they count times when cops really shouldn't a shot somebody but did I'm pretty I'm pretty sure they do yeah yeah I'm pretty sure they do but even then that number would be exceedingly marginal comparatively right well then you have the remaining number which are and then you have like three to five I know I think was 15 percent are justified three to five percent are accidents three to five ever since a lot you notice the 900 people 900 people year right so and I tweeted this I said again if we focused on firearm safety education we could that number would drop in half it might no you're not gonna you're not gonna fix the intelligence level of the human see us are fucking around with gun that's where you underestimate the fact in the understimate how those people are dying as accidentally okay because there are a lot of people who don't understand basic gun safety right within that nine hundred a lot of them when you see some of the accidents that happens with firearms they're easily mitigated by just simply knowing the four rules of firearm ownership and when you get into the gun community like as a whole you follow that rabbit into like we are we're crazy about gun safety you you you put your finger on a trigger in a picture we're slaughtering you yeah not literally but you know what you said yeah like we're gonna hold your account I have a friend who has so many guns he doesn't know how many guns yes I said Mike how many guns yeah I don't know Justin he's a legit gun nut and and great guy yeah and I don't know how many cuz I had either right fucking crazy person I mean I mean again I didn't shoot my first console at 23 24 yeah so when did i just become crazy i think i was about the same age yeah well I think I shot one when I was real young and I definitely shot one in camp when I was like I guess I was probably 12 yeah but I didn't count that I shot my first handgun when I first came to California and I might have been really no ironic yeah well what's ironic is it's way easier to get a gun here that it is New York I lived in New York it's fucking hard to get a handgun in New York almost impossible you mean here was easy legally you mean yeah legally illegally okay Wow no I mean when I came here it was 1994 mmm I guess maybe is 93 94 I bought a gun and I was like can't believe I just buy a gun they just did a check yeah yeah I bought a about 38 special I bought a Walther PPK and I bought a Glock 9-millimeter all right man good taste I'm a fan of PDK as well yeah it's a cute little gun well when I first came to California at her all's crazy shit about drive-by shootings gang violence I just thought it was just gonna be a fucking war zone out here I maybe missed a funny thing about it is it's your natural disposition was I need something to protect myself yes it's such a natural thought process I don't know why we've perverted it to this deal where it's like something has to be wrong with you if you had that mentality or that much well there's a lot of people that haven't experienced real violence you know and then if you experience real violence and you've seen what happens when you have a terrible person around people that aren't terrible mister sure there's that's a reality that people don't like to face and they don't like to look at the other side of the coin like whenever there's an instance where there's a shooter and the shooter gets taken out by someone who's a trained person is trained with firearms and and knows tactics nobody wants to talk about that that just gets brushed off they don't there's not a balanced conversation to be had there isn't and if what an interesting thing is like I have a group to have a group chat when stuff like that does happen they write it off as just anomalies how's that an anomaly that's what exactly what it's supposed to be using what again like I said confirmation bias and cognitive distances are is a bitch right we all suffer from it right to next day for sure um but when you add in the component of fear right for a lot of people they don't necessarily hate guns the consequences being shot or someone they love being shown exactly and one of the thing about it is though you know those people never put themselves in a position of being the shooter right they always put themselves in the position of being the victim of a shooting so that's why you get well why do you need that because they don't see it as okay this allows me to better defend myself right they look at it from the perspective of well if you're able to have that then you might use that against me there's that and you know there's also the looming specter of the mass shooter it's just so fucking common these days he's not every three or four months there's a new instance how many times does that happen perception is a bitch okay so the reality is the absolute reality is they have happened there are horrific and there's more of them here than anywhere else in the world that's reality but here's so when you say that you're talking about the developed world correct you're because that's usually the caveat they like to plow there's no mass shootings in the undeveloped world there's people don't just go into a fucking mall and shoot people up with switches you know it's very rare where the people think it happens more than people realize it just doesn't get think about it how many people died on Chicago in a weekend over a weekend it doesn't get reported that's true but then we live in America well show complete access to information that is true but it's a different kind of violence because it's people that are actively trying to get people that are actively trying to get them it's gang violence whereas school shootings are complete innocent school shootings are the worst right because it's a child and some fucking psycho decides to make the most noise possible by going into a school and shooting it up that's the scariest and the worst for most people formerly when you think about gang violence you say well that's violence it's terrible that people got shot but it's people that are trying to shoot each other all right so then when I tell you that the remaining homicides in this country right we're at 30,000 number that I gave you annually over 80% of that is gang violence that's crazy to think about yeah no I believe you but it's when you see Sandy Hook when you see parkland when you see any that's the shooting in Colorado Aurora in the movie theater when you see these mass shootings these are what terrify people yeah people are not necessarily terrified of the gang violence in Chicago you know I'm going to Chicago in a couple of months and not one fucking person has brought up hey man that place is a war zone everybody's like I love Chicago you're gonna get deep-dish pizza like nobody's your life is that what it is yeah I know I'm not going to South Side dude you see that's the thing I just went to Chicago was just in Chicago I was here and they were like what you locked and loaded did you wear a vest yes I got all those questions but I said I was going to Chicago those are the first things people told me now granted I did go to Southside I did Tillman's I said yeah we did would you be nervous well yeah I was nervous I'm not Superman is like when you're walking around he's trapped not in Chicago because it's illegal for me to be that's what's crazy is Chicago has really strict gun laws and that they don't work at all I was driving down a road where there were like six seven eight dudes who jumped in front of the car won't drive that because we didn't look like we belong there and I'm positive every single one of them had a gun they jumped in front of the car well didn't like who lob their bodies in front of the car but you know you see a cop it's unfamiliar driving down a side street so they try to stop you oh they didn't try to stop me I think they're trying to figure out who the hell we were got a board or they were just trying to service oh yeah yeah so it's kind of one of those things right but then again when you're driving around you driving down inside sweet soy sauce Chicago but GoPros on the car that's right so you kind of have that I'm so we all agree that gun violence especially in terms of mass shootings is one of the biggest problems that we have in terms of like a horrific public image problem right it's a it's it's something that you see in the and everyone on what I say public image I should what I should I should rephrase that what I mean is like public perception problem like you see it and it's just death and violence and children and innocence and we as as people I think consider the death of innocence to be one of the most egregious and horrific deaths absolutely I think we both agree on absolutely so so that's a hundred percent across-the-board I think with any decent person these mass shootings are horrific I think in my opinion the the the number one aspect of the argument that's not being discussed is the mental health aspect of it are you opposed to more screening of people to get guns yes and no yes and no yeah okay yes in that in an ideal world if we could minority report it and figure it out I mean Minority Report I mean just like check to see if they're on mental health medication but I mean we we currently will see here's the thing the slippery slope with that - mm-hmm so what would constitute somebody being home into health medication that's prohibitive what if I what if I deal with anxiety if I'm on zan's prescribed does that prevent me from owning firearms it's a good question in California for the longest time they were trying to make it if he had a medical marijuana card you couldn't have a firearm I think they were doing that federally I think there was a federal thing that if you had a legal medical marijuana card that they were trying to prevent people they were trying to prevent people from they were trying to try to cripple the marijuana gaucho industry because they knew that people want it done because because to be honest it's it's intellectually dishonest if I can if I can go to the store with a gun on me and buy alcohol right like in you know me I don't even smoke right right but let's just be honest about it like alcohol weed I mean I think utilizing that as a prohibitive means to own a firearm I think is I think that is true but if you were under the influence some of the shit I got in this studio you've been super paranoid think I didn't under a gun and say I didn't say under the influence I said if I could all the all the marijuana car does is allow you to buy it no 100% but I'm saying that is an issue if you're under the influence and you have a gun mmm right yeah but I'm allowed but I have you go to my house where and I have all types of whiskey's at home right but if you're under the influence right yeah but yes no I can't I can't carry a firearm in the trunk right you can't you shouldn't be drunk with a gun you shouldn't be high as fuck with a gun neither one of those are good ideas and nor should you be driving right nor should you be driving so should you be on xanax with a gun that's a question I don't know the answer to because I've never had xanax exact me neither I don't know what it's like but I do know that there's been people that have killed people when they were on xanax and you know that guy in Vegas this the shooter in Vegas that guy was on an anti-anxiety medication I didn't know that Chris Cornell was on anti medica anti-anxiety medication when he killed himself look it's got a profound effect on some individuals and it's no it's not uniform the way it affects you it might affect change different it's just it's a different I mean I know I know tons of people who are on it yeah I do as well yeah and they they respond like you said they respond to it differently yeah yeah and I know tons of people on it will also drink while they're on it which you're not supposed to yeah yeah and that that's not good either yeah what's so screening with the screening component right you've got to be careful because what it didn't does it's like it becomes a de-facto way of preventing people to own firearms apparently right so it's like oh well you have anxiety or even even somebody who's maybe dealing with PTSD right not everybody dealing with PTSD is a potential murderous ravenous hunted person who died in the one kill people so with the screening component that's why I say yes or no right if you can find a way if you can find a way to establish a skrub a mental screening it but even then no because there's a desert there's a due process aspect to it as well right so you can't prevent me from owning and you can't prevent me from exercising right if I haven't done something to absolve myself and being able to do that legally right okay so what if they come to your house and you've got let's say you've got like a cork board up and you've got all these pictures of schools and fucking arrows pointing to the emergency exits and plans of how to block things off and then pictures of Jodie Foster and pictures of serial killers up everywhere and you're on anti-anxiety medications and the cops talk to you and your fucking squirrely as hell you haven't done anything though yeah arrest me then if you can't arrest me arrest can't what if you can't arrest me for for crime or possibly attempting it because like I can only like the legal standard is like taking substantial Act mm-hmm to commit a crime even though you don't do it that's attempted right did you hear about the kid that got kicked out of school what was the school he was an Asian kid dyed his hair blonde started collecting bullets got a semi-automatic rifle his friends started freaking out they called the cops cops came to visit him he bought another rifle and I believe they deported him they deported him for reasons not having to do with the firearms they deported him for reasons that he wasn't going to so any more green card or visa but the way the sheriff's were framing it was they deported it because they wanted this fucking psycho out of the country and they think that they might have prevented a crime they probably did but my still happen they still had to establish a legal basis for deporting you know they did all they had was that that he didn't go to class yeah I mean that's something you've done I've done yeah yeah I mean everybody but then again he wasn't a citizen right so now was that was that was a requirement for him to continue to be here but it was really was kind of like Al Capone you know a god I compose my tax evasion right by way of you know right right right but he really had guns and was acting crazy and that's why the kids that were friends with him called and that's why they acted and they just found that loophole yeah so what do you do with someone like that other than I mean this guy we had something what if this kid was still going school I mean it'd be pretty bad yeah well you bad but but then again we still we still have our loss for a reason right we have we have our inherent rights for a reason we have to due process for a reason because if we didn't have those right anyone could just come up and say man you know what I saw I saw calling on the war on Instagram the other day he posted a picture of a Gandhian he was like cursing people out because they're making fun of him the water he was drinking and so you know what's my needs to go check on him to make sure he's okay right and he's gonna take his guns away from him right you've got it was there's got to be due process I appreciate that and I agree with you and and it's it's unfortunate in that some people may slip through the cracks but but I can't arrest someone for something that they haven't done yet Brian you just you just can't well I agree and so that's where we are right now so then so then not now we're getting to the complexities the hard hard questions right what do we do how do we put something in place to catch the people who do happen to fall between the cracks alright so then you go okay well sorry yeah I move a lot of yeah I'm like Hydra the complexities yeah it's it's a very complex issue which is why we're not largely not having it we're having it here because no one wants to have this conversation on the national scene because it's hard and it doesn't make for great sound bite and it doesn't make for good TV mmm right because I hate doing cable news hits because I have two minutes to to basically deduce a complex issue that we've been debating for decades almost centuries it's the worst and it's also people talking over each other and there's one you know they have two boxes one guy here one guy there usually you're not even in the same room together you're talking through those earpieces is a delay those things are a disaster Horrible's one of the worst ways to communicate which is why I tried to establish my platform with my show noir mm-hmm I tried to have it as a platform that's open to people to come on Hey look you want to come on and discuss this issue by all means come to it have you had anyone that's the that's like really strict anti-gun yeah on yeah I had I had an entire season so what we did in the season I think it was two seasons ago we brought on I was a young lady and a guy from Zeeland I can't remember but he came on the show they were anti and so what we did was he had a roundtable discussion at the end of every episode of my show and we bring up a specific topic and we discuss it and so then basically was like two against one essentially mm-hmm until they would talk to me about what their thoughts on on what we talked about in the show or a particular gun control issue and we had that conversation I had an individual I sit down with her as well and we talked about it and then took her to the shooting range to shoot for the first time hmm you know but that's going to be overlooked right they know they ignore it well they probably aren't even aware of it cuz I wasn't aware of it another aware of it you think people who need to be aware of it all aware of it okay because like for instance I bring this point up in makes me come across as if like I feel some type of way because he didn't Inchon me but it's not really that it just speaks volumes to what I've been pointing at for the longest they ignore rational discourse John Oliver did a twenty minute monologue on NRA TV about NRA TV right 20 minutes mm-hmm you know how long 20 minutes all that's pretty long yeah he didn't mention me once he didn't mention my shot had three shows on an array TV three shows and I had the second longer longest-running show on inhye TV he didn't mention me once the level of detail that they went into within that monologue lets me know they watched everything on that platform okay they watched it all and why do you think he left you uh because I didn't fit the narrative right also cuz he is a progressive guy with glasses who's white and you really shouldn't you really shouldn't say anything negative about black people how so he's like but he's not white though he's a minority just like me what is he he's I don't know he's like he's white what is he then over white if he's not white I'm not white Irish Irish yeah am i white if I'm not what the fuck is I'm sorry in the street you are I wasn't my grandpa you weren't white yeah my grandparents came over that guy's way to start over white he's white like paper him is it yeah oh shit I'm wrong well there you go um what did you think I don't know I never thought I'm confused with the Daily Show guy I'm probably an Trevor Noah you know that's rabbi no but I know about Trevor you know right yeah he's white his fuck he's a white Englishman man I'm racist but for a guide like that guys like that have they've here's the thing about progressives and I like John I'm not I'm not negative against John doing a show I have I had this perspective up until this point so I'm gonna shut off I'm gonna shut off my belief system and listen to you and listen to what you're about to say because I hadn't thought about this because I thought he wasn't white to this entire time so yeah so now why his fuck um I mean it might not even Bob what be why he did it he might have found the worst examples and maybe you were too reasonable and it doesn't fit the narrative of being funny I mean his show although his show has points and he makes these very you know these clear conclusions and you know but it's funny it's a funny show yeah the whole thing behind it is that any any girl who's dating me knows like I have enough episodes on on on that platform you could find some stuff to make fun of me about well I'm sure they could but I don't think that's the kind of thing they're trying to make fun of like individual personalities that say stupid shit I think what they're trying to do is point out the disingenuous narrative from the NRA while ignoring the disingenuous narrative from the anti-gun advocates okay I could possibly see that I'm trying to I'm trying to be fair and reasonable because my mind wants to go now he saw he realized that by mentioning me right it's gonna it's going to peak curiosity with the audience in which he's trying to so you are too reasonable and too logical and that since you're not like this redneck hee haw type character that like to talk about you it doesn't fit their narrative so let's just ignore him yeah because that's a trade on the dummies think about it like bunnies are still real though right don't have dummies on all sides that's true that's true but it's pretty easy to find like pro-gun dummies you can find quite a few of them I can pretty easy to find dummies on other side as well sure yeah but you wouldn't be looking if you were on that side right if you're on the anti-gun side you're looking for Pro gum dummies pro gun dummies yeah pro gun dummies are easy to find they all right there's plenty of them right now you can go fucking find them on Instagram and Twitter and there's there's dummies all over the world you see here's the thing though the thing about what John Oliver does and that's the thing this is the kind of disingenuous nature of satire okay political satire it I call it the the the comedian plausible deniability card right okay so you can make a joke about something and then say oh it has no influence cuz it's just a joke it's not but he's not saying that is he he's not saying it doesn't have an influence what exactly he understands the influence at wheels but he's been he's saying but he can he can always swipe the plausible deniability card and say well no I wasn't making an actual political statement like I know that there are reasonable people on the other side no you're pushing a narrative that has been pushed for decades about an organization that fights for the Second Amendment the same the same the same narrative that's being pushed by groups of people who say the only thing standing in their way of more gun control is DNR a so what do you do so where does he make you this power from because they talk out of both sides of the mouth they don't get the power from there but they're uh sorry they don't usurp our by their membership right right so what do you do you do your best to stifle that membership you make it seem as unattractive as possible and then you also your audience is already largely uneducated on the issue right and there's already this perceived notion that the NRA is just a bunch of racist white rednecks right so they don't then what do you do the further that narrative you talk about their platform and then you pull out all of those things that further drive that narrative while ignoring the most popular figure on the platform which is you which is me and and so who so happens to be black so what does that say it tells me that this is that it was deliberate and I really do want to agree with you and say you know what he's white he didn't want to be seen as attacking the black guy so forth and so I think there's a little of that but I think there's also he's doing a show let me let me explain how a show works he's got a team of writers there's a ton of people back there they are just trying to be funny they try make points for sure but they're trying to find stupid shit that they can mock yeah and why would they concentrate on the guy who makes sense if they looking for stupid shit that they can mock they're not trying to make a balance to reasonable argument like maybe we would do right here right now yeah what they're doing is doing a condensed edited down very smooth polished television show with that rant has been dissected and gone over by a team of writers and they have video that corresponds to it and photographs that they shoot go to and and they have clips that they show and they Mock the clips it's a it's a comedy show all right do you have a point but it's a comedy show absolutely that's why they didn't go after you is because maybe you're a lawyer maybe you're articulate maybe you is because you're young and black and they just don't feel like it's a smart thing to do but it's because they're making a show I agree with you now let me tell you why my panties aren't a ruffle about it okay it's because I understand the influence of that show when people make political decisions but don't you think it's preaching to the choir that show what I mean that won't that show yeah John Oliver show I think if I had to guess how many people who are watching that show are left-wing leaning Democratic leaning liberal leaning I would say it's a giant percentage here's the problem though the number of people who come to me and say I don't I don't deal with the NRA because they're racist and they're a bunch of white rednecks who says that oh god I get it all the time where's the evidence that they point to they just assume we're racist yeah that's that that's just it yeah cuz in their in their attempts to just make a show right I agree with you wholeheartedly I absolutely agree with you but we can't undermine how influential that show is at crafting people's thoughts about particular issues and ideologies within this country right right and so I stand back and I'm like man this is dangerous because to me the Second Amendment is incredibly important right I don't you know what the funny thing is I thought the monologue was hilarious the mom's a funny dude mama my life is hilarious I'll give I'll give him the mom I Marlin was monologue was funny funny dude because he said that funny he was a funny dude during that 20 minute model consistency consistency some consistency I'll let you drop the ball a couple times here and there that's fine but as far as consistency tough job no John Oliver guy it's got a tough judge I think it's an I think it's incredibly tough I think I think comedians don't get enough credit I'm not sure even a real comedian stand-up does John Oliver that is that is that the barometer for being of me comedians stand up for us okay yeah there's it's a big is a big difference I stand up to me terrifies me that the thought of ever having to like keep him on I'll get in front of a million people and talk all day long but the thought of stand-up see I get to cloak some of my humour in seriousness right so it's easier right I can do little stuff here and there and like it's kind of funny well no it's only because it's contrasting against something that's serious and you don't expect the humor do you remember the way you felt before you walked into that shooting range and those guns were going off and you're like holy shit it's really happening yeah now think about how you feel now when you walk into the range like I go to the range yeah I go to the range all the time you know especially when I was rifle hunting I would go to the range at least once a month yeah and you know got used to it you go you hear the bang bang bang you put your fucking headphones on you just walk up you say hi to everybody that you see there all the time everybody's super polite at the range that's one thing man people are polite as fuck at the range because everybody around you has the ability to kill you they're just not everybody around you especially when I mean I was in the rifle section I've got a 300 Win Mag door outdoors outdoors okay damn cannon yeah you know and everybody around yous got one of these things to everybody can kill everybody and everybody's like hey man how you doing what's up how's everybody doing everybody super friendly everybody shaking hands as a mutual respect it's but it's interesting that's an interesting I mean that's so it's a weird statement that gets thrown about a lot of times that a well-armed society is a polite society then there were two times in my life where I felt really insecure the first time I carried a gun out of my house in my first MMA class yeah that makes sense but look what I was gonna say is when you go to the gun range a bunch times then it becomes normal mm-hmm comes life that's what stand-up is gotcha same thing I mean he still can eat plates Addicks onstage okay you go south and it's terrible it's one of the worst feelings a bit about Texas fucking dead-on and hilarious Oh were you there no I just thought which which which bit were you basically about Bucky's or mauled in the Lions yeah by the Tigers the cute the Tigers - Tigers in yard yes it's true Lacey then you basically talking about we need these people [Laughter] we're not fighting wars the people of Santa Monica that's true man that people have never been in Texas do not understand that is the America of America you don't play no Texas doesn't play we are most arrogant some bitches on planet it's also like what when people think of America like overseas they think of like these fucking crazy people with guns that have jacked up trucks or to driving too fast the girls have big tits the guys are fucking crazy that's what we think of that's Texas yeah like that's not America now as a whole it's Texas is the most exaggerated form of it Texas houses the most exaggerated former yes well there's a lot of cool people in town yeah this is way more diverse my big friend slur yeah Austin which is like super left on Austin is like California in Texas but I think it's a little cooler it's smaller but it's the thing I said about about Texas is true is there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than there are in all of the wild of the world more Tigers in private collections that's fuckin true and when I read that I was like oh my god I have to figure out a way to make this funny that's the craziest fucking statistic I've ever heard in my life in people's yards like a lot of I grew up though I grew up my entire life in Texas wanting a cheetah and the beautiful man a beautiful beautiful man with and just watching the funny thing is I get a cheetah and put it in and put it in the yard no bigger than this room and inspect to see the beauty of it running well you know it's all so fucked up I don't think you're allowed to like just feed them animals I don't think you're allowed to let loose a goat and have a have the cheetah tackle the goat and fuck it up I think you have to feed them meat you know like already cured process some Wild Kingdom shit go down in your yard I don't think they allow them oh no you did say we only have three pages of law so if it's not no three babe to say you know hey no chase shit about Tigers order dude you know you know if anything about it is when I got in the firearms I lived in Texas my whole life and I went what 23 years without ever shooting gun touching the gun and when I got into it I started the first thing I wanted to do was shoot competition right and so you shoot competition you know do do those competitions like John wick style where you go to three gun they call it three gun three gun yeah so basically three gun consists of three different platform platforms a rifle shotgun and a handgun so how does this competition work so basically they just set up it's basically set up various courses where you have to utilize one of those three platforms some of the courses you utilize all three and so it's just it's just your set to a timer you got to clear the course as fast as possible oh yeah and the clearing the course is are you is there like walls that you have to look I know you're it's only limited by your imagination you ever see that shit where Keanu Reeves was preparing for John wick - yeah oh you were there I wasn't okay so I was there not for that particular video that went viral but I was there one day when he was training and so I met him after the fact how is he different spacey Spacey yeah interesting but not in a bad way it's a very very calm energy yeah you know why why that's how he handles being that famous gotcha yes just shuts off I picked up on it immediately yeah and it wasn't it wasn't bad it was a it wasn't a bad thing as a good thing yeah I realize he's the matrix guy yeah that's some over-the-top Fame he hit that Johnny Depp Tom Cruise level of Fame and then just became this super chill mellow guy that can just like go through crowds that guy goes sits on the subway by himself know like it's freaking awesome yeah but there's no obvious outward displays of wealth from him he's insanely wealthy when you see him he's dressed like me yeah he's got like a regular watch on and sneakers he's normal as fuck man it's it's real weird like he's he's figured out a way to avoid like there he is right there on the fucking subway just chillin you know and he looks like a totally normal dude yeah well and people freak out they're like is that no can't be like people ignore him because he's figured out a way to just sort of just later in plain sight and then even if you talk to him he's just normal like everybody that I know that's madam said the dudes like totally look at it he lets his chick sit down you know he said do you wanna sit down go ahead boom and he just stands up look it mean even the way straight he's not no bodyguards you know what's interesting about his demeanor and how like he doesn't have this sense of entitlement and I'm bringing it bringing it back to the gun thing a little bit the first time I carried a gun I mean I told you those are two most the times where I felt more insecure was my first aim in MMA and carrying gun for the first time like carrying that gun for the first time made me realize holy shit I'm not the only one right mmm so it actually humbled me and from the standpoint that knowing that you don't know who you're dealing with and when you carry a firearm on you you have the ability to go from zero to a hundred like that and so you develop a respect for that also you start to develop a respect for life as well because you understand how fragile suck Terrell's how fragile it is right and so for me I actually became more docile like I don't get road rage because because I understand and because I live in Texas you don't do that yeah no it's not but I also know that like there's so much responsibility that comes with carrying a firearm it's it's unreal and so for people who go out of the means to learn to do it and be able to do it like there's a certain level of respect you have to have for it because it comes with a lot the certain places you can't go certain things you can't do things you have to be cognizant of like so I started I actually started staying away from certain places because I knew I had a gun on me and I never want to have to be put in a situation actually have to go for it no do you wear a gun all the time what if I can do it legally I have really yeah and what is the idea behind that is that like it's better to have it not to need it than the need not to have it yeah it's it's an it's no different it's literally just a part of my routine watch.watch Keys phone wallet good one in the chamber or no one in chamber oh yeah safety on the gun I usually carry doesn't they don't have external safeties it's just I I carry a holster so if you carry in the holster it shouldn't be an issue Wow yeah that's interesting yeah so you just want to be really really ready yeah we'll see you don't want to have touch no and see here's the thing that's that that's progressive I wasn't always like that I started off not caring with one in the chamber but when did you start putting one in the chamber when I started understanding and trusting the mechanics of the firearm because when I started caring I knew about guns I didn't trust the mechanics Brian right so you that extra step hmm you don't feel like it's necessary I'm like no what do you mean in terms of like I just yeah well I understand that I understand so I started doing training right and I started training with guns and self-defense and stuff like that and I started realizing you know so the gun isn't isn't an end all be all right it's just a tool that I carry with me that could possibly save my life I could still die with a gun on me for sure but I started weighing the disadvantages and the advantages of having one in the chamber right I might find myself in a situation where you know what I have time to okay I'm a behind here and I have time to racket and do what I need to do mm-hmm there may be other times where I won't but if I already have run in a chamber those times where I will have the time and not have the time won't make a difference because there's already one in a chamber ready to go yeah so from that perspective as I got more comfortable with the gun and realize holy crap the gun never just went off on its own because it was inherent fear there right it's like you don't want their gonna go off while it's in your pants do you have like one of them Kydex holsters it's form-fitted yeah I have a box full house yeah cuz I review guns and reviewing gear and stuff so I'm constantly switching which is a gift and a curse because you know I never perfect any platform but I can you put any pretty much any gun in my hand I can you now when things happen whenever there's a mass shooting or something immediately people want to blame gun owners or people that want to protect gun owners and specifically NRA members this comes down on you sometimes this always the problem it comes out of me people that want Gardens and people that don't want regulations and don't want you know additional screening yeah because you gotta think about it so like the figureheads when you and you start talking about Wayne and so there people go after them clearly right but then also you have the personalities of the brand which is me Dana and Dana laughs Dana laughs right she's an official spokesperson right it's very nice lady matter exactly then you have cam Edwards show as well exactly yeah and so what had what ends to happen is I get it a lot via social because that's how I built my brand mm-hmm right I build my band through social and so most people will when they can't descend like I don't think Wayne LaPierre has a Twitter page you know he doesn't have an Instagram account right so it's probably in a bunker somewhere well your but what you are is an interesting version of the NRA it's like oh this is the NRA too like there's a kind of a new thing it's multi-faceted like yeah if any I dare anyone to go to the NRA in your meetings and then if you can I don't know how secluded it's go to the board meeting well you have a thinner air meetings you'll be surprised they have I have every race you can think of different sexualities you name it oh I believe you look I was in the NRA forever I just might let my membership lapse like a year and a half ago but I was in the NRA because I just felt like I know people that are just like we've got to get rid of the guns I'm like man I don't think that's gonna do it and I don't think that's gonna stop anything even and I asked people this all the time I've done it on my show I call it a big red button question right so you put a big red button I'd ask him I put a big red button in the middle of table if you push this button all the guns on the planet disappear would you do it and I'll get various answers but I wouldn't do it then people like why like why would you not happy the end of violence might not real it's also the end of defense exactly especially when you're talking about military I mean if you can't if you don't have guns like we're gonna fight with swords and bows and arrows and shit you know the interesting thing about that too is only a lot of people are this I will say they were like why did the same people will say why do you need an ar-15 and then in an inverse when I say the Second Amendment is actually not about hunting it's about defending ourselves from a tyrannical government domestic or foreign they're like oh you think you little stupid guns are gonna be able to defend against the against the government I'm like well then why don't you give me the guns that the government has then and then they get quiet because they realize a contradiction and what they're stating well it's also the government when you say the government like protect us against the government we are the government the government is filled with people like the cops are us the problem is is this separation of us if you gave me a red button said would I could I end all senseless violence by hitting that button I would say yes and then when people say it's a guns promise do you know that London past New York City for the first time since 1800 in homicides and they did it with fucking knives with knives to the point where that goofball Mayor of London that dork on his Twitter page said there's no reason to carry a knife if you get caught carrying a knife you'll be prosecuted under the fullest extent of the law this is the fucking knife but I've got a knife all the same country that the utilizes the shining example of what we should be doing in America exactly and they they have more murders in London from knives and here's the funny thing about that too you know like and so they have an uptick in acid attacks sorry I think well that's up that's the thing that people are doing two ex-wives and shit - yes that's I mean is that is that is in human shit but it's also all this stuff it comes down to like what makes a fully developed person instead of looking at what's available - a fully developed person and what would allow a fully developed person to commit horrific crimes what turns a person into that we should be looking at from the root fully-grown like what is the process that allows someone to become a mass shooter what's the process that allow someone to throw acid in someone's face man because I have you know clearly I have to frame everything to my perspective because you know I know it the best but like even for me like I said it in video before if I ever had to pull my gun and shoot someone to take a life I'm gonna I'm gonna need therapy yeah I am cuz because I value life that much I value it right did you have children no I don't let me tell you something man if he had kid and some guy was trying to hurt your daughter and you shot him I think he'd sleep like a baby I you know what that splitting interesting you say that because when I talk to women about firearm ownership right like none of the girls no girls have ever been in relationship with were like program right but over time you know dealing with me and when you walk into my house and there's five rifles on the table you kinda just have to get acclimated but in dealing with women who start off initially as anti a lot of them talk about not wanting guns because they can't see themselves taking a life but the moment I asked them would they take a life to protect a child oh yeah I'm blowing that sucker away yeah you know and it's interesting how that works how we and I felt like I agree with you I'd be the same way exam charge and you know that whatever it is that turns a child into some monster that could shoot up a school I think that's what needs to be examined I mean and this is not a part of the narrative it's not a part of the discussions no one's bringing it up all people bring up is the event themselves their gun violence and we need to keep the tools away from people I just think the tools are one part of the problem I definitely think that you should with if there is a way and we should figure out a way to keep Psychopaths from owning guns but how do you determine whether or not someone's a psychopath so they do something psychopathic yeah and then someone will talk about well you know Australia they had one mass shooting in the 1990s they took all the guns there's 18 people in Australia it's as big as the United States this lends me not to mention crime went up after they did that did it violent crime went up when they did that that's when people don't want to talk about and and you're right like people forget context yeah they're like two people in Australia what do you know what about this one town in Georgia where firearm ownership is mandatory I do when they made it mandatory and violent crime and everything dropped radically break-ins dropped radically they made it mandatory everybody has to have a gun and everybody was like fuck a crime I think about I need to find a new way to make a living because most dude like look most dudes who engaged in crime right of course you have your sickos who just love the violence right most of them just crimes of opportunity yeah all right so they're looking for victims they're looking for easy victims easy targets right if you know you're gonna deal with someone who possibly is going to kill you they don't want to die right which is why you've seen a lot of these videos with with these home invasions where you watch when the actual homeowner has a firearm once the shot start the bullets start flying they're gone yeah they're taking off nobody wants a get shot right so and so it always boggles my mind when people are like whoa you don't need a gun for there so you don't need to go Mike no I do and they're like well the chances of you ever needing you know using it that's a stupid it's and it's incredibly moronic sure this the chances are you've gone through life right now you however old you are when I'm talking to you you haven't been shot so the chances are 100% that you didn't need it right but that doesn't mean that's a crazy conversation I don't think the conversation should be about the tools I really think the conversation should be about what makes a person capable of doing that I mean if the conversation is what makes a person such a fucking nut that they have so many guns that they don't know what to do with that I mean you have so many guns you don't even know how many you have mm-hmm is that bad I don't know seem like a reasonable guy I'm not worried about you but even then I can only use one gun at a time I only have two hands I get that but the idea is like what if someone breaks in your house it steals your guns I'm sure you have been a safe but if somebody breaks in your house and steals your gun it's like what so that's my fault now that someone wants to break the law and break into my house no the idea is like access now you're giving access but you're limiting it's a very different argument yeah exactly but you're still the dad it fundamentally goes back to the idea that people want to undervalue this is a constitutional right right yeah and so what we end up we find ourselves doing is finding ways to limit that right because of the few bad people in our country right you know and I just think that's the wrong way to go about it because we're basically weird evolving ourselves down to a point where we're not gonna have any rights left they're a couple of bad people who might do something bad with the rights that you have I think it's wrong way to go about it too but if you if we had no violence in this country if something happened human beings evolved if our switch changed and there's no more violence would you still want to have guns yes you want to have them for recreation you enjoy them yeah yeah that's something people don't want to hear yeah you're like I always tell people if you've never shot a gun if you've never gone to a gun range you should probably should because it is actually fun it's fun now if you do that activity and you're not thinking about hurting someone and all you're thinking about is focusing on the target and trigger control all that stuff is that bad I mean we do we do a thing on my show we call it athletic shooting right so my background before I got in the guns was sports I was in the basketball football I ran cross-country track you name it so when I got in a gun so my dream was to go to the NBA when I was younger right clearly that didn't happen and it wasn't going to but you know there was that that athleticism still in me so what we did on the show we were talking about coming up with a different shooting competition was how do I incorporate I thought about how to incorporate someone athleticism into shooting right which is essentially loon by and large a lot of running and just shooting a different position so forth and so on and so when we're doing that I'm not thinking about shooting a person that's not the type of shooting I'm doing right doing target doing target shooting with some athleticism involved in it mm-hmm and so and people undervalue that like it's kind of like how can you not see that these are other ways that firearms are used which is why I started my brand too pewpew life right pew-pew life is predicated around he ewp easy for people don't understand that so people who use guns lie exactly firearm wise yeah yeah and right here doing hashtag pew pew yeah because I mean it's its think about it when we were kids it was all so simple right like cops and robbers gun pew pew pew pew we do that and so it but then so it I I want to capture the recreation involved in playing cops and robbers as a kid but then also understanding the very definitive and distinction between the good guys and the bad guys all right right the people who live this lifestyle are good people they enjoy guns for recreation they also understand that we live in the world what not everybody's good right right so we also own guns for our own self-defense and so it's this culmination of this lifestyle that comes together and we appreciate guns in a way that some people think is perverse but it but but how is it any less how is it any different than me obsessing over the Aston Martin DBS for the last 20 years that does that perverse it's still its little mechanical item yes the potential for violence is what what scares people yeah they mean when the guy kills 86 people in Nice with the truck right not a good point you mean it is a very good point and no one's turning outlaw trucks no but it's this thing that we have in this country where we have more guns than we have human beings and that's that disturbs people yep because they inherently vilify the firearm right which is why I have another hashtag that I call still waiting it's still waiting for what still waiting for my gun to jump upon it's only kill somebody hmm no it's it's it is relatively tongue-in-cheek but at the same time what it does is it transfers the focus and in it I say when a drunk driver gets bought it gets behind the wheel and kill someone we don't blame the vehicle for it blame the driver right alright so when somebody goes out and commits violence with the firearm why are we focusing on the people who are doing get instead of focusing on a firearm well I think we should certainly be focusing on the people as we said we should certainly be focusing on focusing on what happens to a person that makes them develop into the type of person that can go into a movie theater and shoot it up like the Aurora Colorado let's talk about that a little bit cuz that it's a conversation that we don't have honestly and I'm not gonna I don't have the answers um I can think of several things you know the easy answer for me is to say is it's our culture right we maybe have a culture that facilitates this or you know we have situation where there are people who do flip between the cracks and no one pays attention to them there's certainly some of that and I do think there is a lot you can't write pay attention everybody you can't but then also I think there's like I was raised by a single parent mother right and my mother overcompensated when raising me because she understood the limitations of her being a woman raising a young man right so she was unnecessarily hard on me my mom has zero tolerance for my emotions absolutely zero so what she taught me growing up was how to deal with adversity taught me how to deal with failure how to get past those things taught me how to be self-assured and so what I think we were lacking to a degree in this country is people not having the coping mechanisms to deal with failure or to deal with the rejection you know some get it worse than others I agree it was definitely done there's definitely people that feel like they're Outsiders and they want to flip the board over they're losing the game and they just want to flip the board over and that seems like that Parkland kid I mean there were kids that were worried about him before this ever happened and that his whole thing was that his life was shit and he wanted other people to experience that yeah and in thing is it's like and the hard thing about it too is not realizing it just came to my mind I think sometimes I don't even want to talk about the mental health aspect of it in this particular case of the parking chute because I just want to relegate him evil right right because it pisses me off yeah like you're you taking innocent lies because you feel bad go on a corner and shoot yourself if that's the case there's a romanticized version of that too where people just want to take everybody out take all the people out that you saw that we're doing well while you were struggling there's that man but the world always flips man oh yeah looks like it flips if you've got a good attitude you're a healthy person like yourself but if you're mentally ill and your life has been just tormented and abuse and just your mental health issues and you're all fucked up it's I don't know what the answer is I mean you know what the answer is but I do know that the the problem lies in the individuals that are capable of committing that and how they become that because you got it you make a great point he's got thing like well mindset you have to be in a walk down a school hall and just shoot people shoot kid just shoot them it just innocently just now it's it's fucking gross yeah whether it's Sandy Hook or what any one of these things like you have to be fucked up to do that like s and how many people are running around that are like three-quarters fucked up and only need a few bad things to go wrong and relatively speaking when you think about the fact that there's 300 plus million people in this country these are relatively relatively few people that they're capable in that actually act on such a horrific act but what do you think can be done to stop this stuff have you thought about it yeah I think about it all the time it's it's it's a harder question for me to ask them to come up with ways of why we don't need guns right you know because that's that's yeah you know it's hard especially when I'm taking gun control off the table because people are always saying you know you guys don't you guys don't want to move one inch well it's like yeah because we've been moving an inch for the last 20-30 so the problem is it's a it's a fucked up argument because the people that are holding the guns are not necessarily the people that are doing these things you're trying to attack the the vast majority of gun owners are not committing crimes with their hands they're not so when I think about what can we do to stop different types of shooting for instance let's talk let's start with the let's start with what the type of shootings that happen to most Brian gang violence right so if you look at the statistics you think oh my gosh America's war zone right 3,000 people you die in an in the vast majority of it that is remaining as actual homicides is gang violence so then we have a gang problem we have a gang problem in this country we have a socio-economic problem in very specific areas in this country right because I just came from South Side Chicago where I started in Hyde Park where Obama used to live and in drove a few minutes into an area that looked like a bomb went off they don't have the violence in Hyde Park that they had in that area why had the same access to illegal guns they don't have the same problem because there's a difference in economics and no one wants to judge when no one wants to address that right I'm a kid growing up in that neighborhood and I'm going to a school that shitty right I don't give a damn about me I I lucked up and was able to go to good schools right I went to schools where my teachers cared I went to schools where teachers pushed me when I was slacking off you know I had the ability to take out loans to go to a good law school you know I had those abilities if I'm the kid growing up in this environment and I can't find refuge in my school I can't find refuge at home because my mom's working three or four or five jobs so she's never there where am I gonna go find parent I'm gonna where am I gonna find that parent to influence let me fight on the streets so now I'm on the streets being led by people who grew up in the exact conditions that I grew up in and so now I'm like okay well I have to make money what am I gonna do for money well then there's the Nok economy very conveniently right there for me right so drugs so now I'm selling now I'm staying on a corner selling drugs I got to protect my product all right if I don't someone's gonna take it from me so what do I do I get a gun I carry a gun now I'm stuck in a situation I'm just stuck in this violent loop right that feeds on itself and so now I'm stuck defending myself against the guy who's shooting at me trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting back at him maybe not because I'm trying to take his stuff but because he's trying to take mine all right so that's what you get that violence that comes from that from those particular areas now if we would've sat back and said okay we have hyper concentrated areas in this country this is a widespread it's hyper concentrated communities in this country that are dealing with this that are also the result of the vast majority of our gun violence if we sat back and thought about from a social economic standpoint how do we fix this what do we do how do we present opportunity I'm not saying gonna just hand out stuff but how do we fix this from the standpoint of improving our schools how is I can draw five minutes one direction and have a school that has everything you can name and then drive in the drive in the opposite direction the school has can barely have textbooks to give to their kids hmm think about that yeah so why aren't we focusing our energy on building that up versus talking about all we need to get the guns off the streets you did that you have that in Chicago you have every gun law imaginable in Chicago but Jets are Chicago still looks the way that it does still has a violence that it does right so if we would if we provide I mean you give people something lose or they live for they don't throw away life so easily plain and simple so if my social economic status is in the dirt I don't have a problem looking at another kid down the street and shooting at him taking his life I don't have anything I don't have anything to lose but if we were to focus our attention in fixing that same way we talked about the mental health issue with respect of mass shootings in school shootings we wouldn't have to worry about the guns because we won't have people wanting to do those things or have the capability to do those things right so then that deals with that vast majority of the violence that we had there focusing that energy in fixing those communities I agree with you 100% and we've talked about this many many times in the show that I think that if you wanted to make America a better place one of the best ways to do it is to make it easier for someone to succeed make it easy and stop pretending that it's a level playing field because I didn't grow up in a level playing field I got lucky I did you got lucky a lot of people did and if you go to somewhere like the south side of Chicago and you don't realize that you got lucky you're you're blind then there's we if you want to what's the best way to make America stronger less losers less people who lose or how'd it how's that well give them more of a chance give them more of an opportunity and give them guidance ship community centers clean up the streets fixed buildings but that's a lot of fucking money that we're spending right now in Afghanistan and Iraq and building missiles and all kinds of crazy shit that we're not putting any money into that but then who do we hold accountable we're doing like like we talked about the inner cities for instance mm-hmm they've been democratically run for ages now the local leadership there is democratic right but there's no money there the problem is there's no money's going somewhere look I mean look at Chicago it's not enough I mean the money is going into the areas where people are wealthy and that's what they're supporting they're not supporting these impoverished areas and but then and you know what you're absolutely right so if that's the case and we all understand that and you know that stop someone is bullshit about gun control that well let's just say that that's just one one aspect oh no I'm next one yeah I agree with you there so in that sense in when it comes to gun violence it's very complex when it comes to gang violence it's very complex and I agree with you that they need there's no other way to stop that then to fix the inner cities where people are just in that cycle of constant poverty and crime and that's all they see around them so it becomes normalized yeah absolutely so so now let's talk about mass shooting mass shootings all right so get rid of gun-free zones no one wants to hear that get rid of gun-free zones if you're not going to establish a perimeter outside of a building where I can go don't tell me I can't bring my gun in there a sign on the window was not stopping somebody from coming into the building we've seen it time and time and time and time again if the guns were the problems we would have mass shooting at every gun show every single day what we don't why the same reason you pointed out why'd that one that one place in Georgia when they said everybody had to have a gun crime went down people don't want to hear that though they don't want to hear that the answer to gun violence is everyone has a gun now not such a convenient answer for a guy like you is very convenient so many guns you can't count but here let's look at the alternative we've been living in it mm-hmm right right we acknowledge in that there's a problem right so why are we entertaining the fact that maybe that is the case right but do you think that like school shootings for example do you think that these teachers being armed would be the answer all right so or do you think there should be armed security on the campus I say it should be multi-layered right because if you if you really want to put things into perspective and inner I didn't add about this and people got pissed off but it's a truth wherever whatever school the president's kids go to they are guarded by guns right that school was protected by guns right right anything we hold valuable in this country is protective with guns no one is more anti-gun than Hollywood when you hear about any sort of crime or gun violence the left wing people in Hollywood are the most vocal the most virtue signaling the quickest to jump on their pedestal meanwhile what percentage of their fucking movies involve gun violence and if you look at the Academy Awards did you see the security at the Academy Awards you see all these left-leaning liberal actors being protected by people of flack jackets on carrying guns with fingers outside the triggers I mean dogs which it's crazy you know what it is though it's a loss of touch with reality well they're also insulated and protected well that's part of it because in her mind their mindset goes like this well I have security guards I mean Kim Kardashian's biggest I did a video on that so I'd add that was first indicated is what she big super kid on that right because she's a dumb-dumb yeah of course but she also influences a ton of people yeah right that's unfortunate but exactly Steve Harvey had her on family feud they were on family feud that Kardashian's in the West or talking about how fucking stupid Kim was but we know this go that's crazy there's no incentive for her to be intelligent there isn't I mean she's good at making money oh absolutely yeah absolutely and I don't fault her for that hey make you money booboo but but at the end of the day you used to she still has access to scores of young influential minds I understand that that's unfortunate but there's nothing we could do about that there isn't but other than you point out the fact that she's a dum-dum pretty much yeah yeah it's not terrible person is you I don't think it's B I don't know I don't know the woman I just don't well I've heard a talk I just don't think she's really interested in expanding your mind I just don't think that that's something that's not beneficial but that's her here's the thing though the mindset though is there are people who we paid to carry guns right I don't need to carry them therefore you don't either so what you're saying about her is that she's anti-gun she talks about being anti-gun yet she's constantly surrounded by people of guns that's a fact absolute fact so you cancel this fact so then you can't turn around and tell me that no you don't need a firearm right course you know bitch seven-foot-tall dudes strapped to the fucking gills all around you yeah yeah so it's it's it's man it's frustrating because it's like I get it I would love to have a dude standing out here with a ar-15 slung over their shoulders ready to protect me out of given notice where I could afford it I pay for it not do it the funny thing is I still carry a gun on me because I can't always be exactly where I am right you know what I mean that's a paranoid way to live though isn't it what difference does it make think about it how much does it affect me I wake up every day put a gun on my hip and go out and do the exact same thing I would do if I didn't have it but you don't think about it so you in the in a sense you feel like you're not paranoid I'm not paranoid no there's no nothing no more paranoid than any than any person that has a fire extinguisher in their house hmm think about it it's it's like I don't walk around like oh my god oh my god who's coming to get me that's paranoia right what well I'm doing it's being prepared right well there could be levels of preparedness you start being hit diminishing returns where starts being like it starts to take away from your quality of life mm-hmm but me putting a gun on my hip and just going about my business that doesn't interfere with my life enough to say you know it is not quite worth it you know it's funny that what you said about like humility and that you like more calm and relaxed since you've been involved with guns the same thing happens with jujitsu and martial arts training in particular but jujitsu in particularly because he had strangled so much and that hurts right now because I was rolling with a guy just before I came out like last week and it does it man it's such a beautiful sport it's beautiful but it also lets you know your place in the food chain especially when you first start out know these domain like you start to realize you really honestly can't call out an elite human until it's too late what do you mean so when I started before I started really kind of getting into you know like MMA so forth and so on I thought I could spot out the guy you don't want to mess with no right you know what I mean yeah and then I went to class and then he knew my coach started pairing me with different people and I'm like holy crap like if I was seeing this dude was just walking down a sidewalk I'm like yeah I can handle him and now I'm rolled up in the pretzel is nuts in my face yeah nerd assassin man at 10th Atlantic we got a whole fucking army of them he would they like computer dorks and they'll kill you with their legs to wrap their legs are on your neck and choke you to sleep but you can't even stop it from happening this is crazy nothing man and then Maya and I always get stuck and I'm gonna overpower them and I'm like now yeah you better off being weak believe it or not that's Jiu Jitsu is weak man Jiu Jitsu I would say if you're gonna learn jujitsu learn from a small guy yeah cuz you learn from a small guy they they've never been able to cheat meaning they'd never been able of muscle type of things I've always had to have perfect technique yeah techniques everything when it comes to Jiu Jitsu literally you have to have some strength for sure and strength with technique is the ultimate coach but perfect technique is where it's at and you get that from like little guys like Barret Yoshida Eddie Bravo Euler grace are the smaller guys are the ones that you want to learn from because they've never been the big guy the big guys are like top game guys yeah smash pass guys those guys were just relying on horse power and leg strength and shit those that's not the way to learn though you know the way to learn is to go around things God show and you know the funny thing about that is do you know why I started doing it why someone said what if I take your gun away bro mmm no one said that I said it to myself oh right I said to myself because I didn't I almost thought I was over depending on it because we remember the gun is a tool mm-hmm you carry a knife too I used to I used to but I float I float I'm in this weird space where like my jeans are kind of sorta a little too tight and not like so they're not quite skinny jeans but it's kind of like after a certain point I have too much stuff going on I got the answer for you my friend here you go it's called a fanny pack you know do we have some here you would you never wear this you would never wear this I'm down to try anything come on man well tactically tactical wallet some of them but they have like ones their tactical ones they rip them open that's what yeah you have a tactic going I'm all for it no this is just a regular one see this you keep your shit on you so you don't have your pockets all filled with shit see here's mine do you have a knife here's my fanny bong this is what I consider a fanny pack that's a little big yeah I know but then again I'm the guy who carry it but I'm the guy who runs around with MacBook iPad you know cuz I have carry one everywhere pretty much if I can put you back because I'm coming working writing working yet right well you would you like what kind of stuff do you write pretty much 80 to 90% of my show oh yeah I write all the videos I do I write them do you write them and then put them on a teleprompter do you practice it out sometimes it's straight off the top sometimes and teleprompter he just depends what we feels gonna give them communicate the best to what I'm trying to achieve oh that's cool yeah well that's that shows work ethic for sure that's I mean I don't I don't have a life you know I really don't all I do is work work out and eat so is this these videos is this your entire life now I for the most part ya know in terms of like your occupation yeah you don't work as a lawyer um I do a little bit I still have things with the small firm in Houston and then so other than that just other investments and things that I have going on about it so you're able to make a living off of these videos ah there was a time when you could do it on YouTube right none anymore yeah it's real recent right yeah within the last six or seven months well actually gun guy started noticing that drop a long time ago like I'm talking about we went from like so like half yeah and then now it's like 70% so the next revenue that happened like a couple years ago and how does that work the terms are like they pick certain videos that are just not eligible for monetization so I wouldn't know before it was just a drop in organic reach it just started like it was it wasn't anything formal so she's no stirred you out yeah that's that's that's what I picked up on because I started noticing I'm like wait a minute like I mean I wasn't living off the YouTube stuff but I was like this is it went like I just kept my income cut in half here yeah well there's there's been some people that have investigated this and there's been some inside sources that have told people that they actively target conservatives gun owners redneck they do it on Twitter they do it a lot of a lot of different places I don't know it's a hundred percent was that guy American privada guy that those undercover investigative reports he sent a bunch of people into like bars and talked to Twitter engineers you know I'm talking about yeah now I will say this though there are so like there are certain people in these places that are actually they may not even agree with my stance but I've talked to them and they'll help me out the best that they can you know some people in facebook some people at YouTube so forth and so on because there are those individuals you know the comment column go support is in a sense because you know they can't beat or explicit about their you know yeah you're not gonna have just a complete uniform left-wing ideology at any of these organizations gonna be some people that but they get stuck in these groupthink environments like Google or whatever the fuck it is and they can't speak out which is unfortunate because I'm like isn't this country this country was founded on the idea of having having this project release undercover footage of Twitter employees and employees engineers and employees admitting that Twitter employees view everything you post on their servers including private sex messages and dick pics in dammit I've never seen engineers also admit that Twitter analyzes this information to create a virtual profile of you which they sell to advertisers James O'Keefe has completed the book about the series entitled American privada my fight for the truth new era of fake news yeah so this guy is sent a bunch of people to talk to like engineers and I've seen the video tester well they're explaining how they algorithm and yeah how they make it so that these people don't even know that people can't see their their tweets I get it all the time people to see me to me all the time like hey you know for some reason YouTube isn't forcing me to unfollow you like I thought I'd followed you but then I'm not following you and I think some of that's paranoia and I do yeah but it still begs the question cuz the numbers don't lie yeah right so like I know with Facebook there was Tom so I was reaching millions of people with just a post but then that got cut in half but largely that was due to monetization that was one before Facebook was monetizing itself so they wanted to count now they're they want you to pay to get access to audience yeah yield I'm saying so that I don't like it but it isn't it isn't like some deep secret kind of like oh I want to stifle your reach because you believe in this now there may be some of that going on right so I had for instance like I buy ads for my like merchandise that I sell on Facebook right cuz if I just post a picture of it my entire artist doesn't see it right right and so somebody went through my facebook and just deleted all of our ads like I supposed to turn money on ads and they just did Lee disapproved him out of nowhere and so then I called a contact and it was like now that shouldn't happen and then went back and put them back up so sometimes it's even individualized right you know what I mean it's just an individual who disagrees with everything you stand for who has the power to do it well you might when that guy did that with Trump disabled his Twitter it deleted it for a couple days yeah yeah now there's definitely people that have that kind of power and they abuse it I mean you see that everywhere you see there with moderators on message boards you see that with you know every time people have more power than you and they go I don't like this fucking guy this guy talking about his guns fuck his ass and they just yank them the weird thing is though like I I don't complain about it on my platform at all because no one cares yeah because I remember the first time YouTube started taking off taking like D monetizing my videos for ads I mentioned it and people were like good I don't like those ads anyway yeah you do realize I have to pay to get this stuff done right right you know well no one no one seems to care until it comes and affects them exactly like that essentially what they're doing is they're they're censoring you by diminishing the amount of money that you can make yeah you know you could you could say it's not real censorship but it is censorship I mean it's it's it's pretty much what I'm dealing with right now so for instance right my videos don't come out as consistently it's like I do gun reviews I'm known for my gun reviews right and I like my government used to be very cinematic i voiceover I put thought into them I write scripts out for my videos the problem is - now before where I could afford to hire someone to edit them I can't write write write and I need that now more than ever because now on the political front of the things I'm running around I'm traveling that's why I was having my macbook with me I have to try to find places where I can try to edit a little bit and get things done but then the same people who like we don't care about the ads on your videos and you make your money from Europe from your videos are saying people like why aren't you making videos as much as used to well I'm like yeah well I don't have the money to pay someone to edit the videos in order to keep pumping them out the way I was doing it before and I'm not gonna give you some sub quality crap right I could just toss the video together and just throw it out there it's just too much noise you can't listen to all those people that are complaining and asking for things but I'm true but I really really do think that Twitter or YouTube rather is fucking up because they're opening up the door to a competitor that is really invested in free speech I disagree really how so it's the advertisers they are at the they are at the mercy of the advertisers they are but I know people over at YouTube they are deciding what they want said and not stature and this is how I know I brought up Jordan Peterson this woman that worked at UGA no and she said he's a troublemaker and I said how is he a troublemaker he had no answer so radical left-wing but not thoughtful not not thoughtful like she doesn't have a good argument for this and when you did when you push back she's used to being the boss at work she's used to just dismissing you yeah and when I was pushing back with her like what why is that why why is he a troublemaker like you tell me what's problematic about what he says no answer to that but yet able to dismissively say someone's a troublemaker when there are very highly respected intellectual that has amazing points about a lot of different things that resonates with a lot of very very smart people I think he's the Nietzsche of our top he's a very bright guy in a really good human and when you meet him he's a really good person so for some someone just say he's a troublemaker like okay no cuz he doesn't agree with you and and he's causing trouble with your organization because you're censoring people's views and viewpoints and it's so convenient to label someone all right or you know I mean this is this is what we're dealing with today there's these hate identity politics it drives me insane crazy it's crazy how many people flock to it - because it's intellectually easier very no yeah it's very easy you can sit there and then you just just regurgitate all of the talking points that you have yeah is why I don't do well on cable news hits yeah because what ends up happening is like on this issue I intellectualize it right like the conversation we're having now mm-hmm like I get the benefit I love this because we could sit here right if we need to think about something you know what that's that's a good point yeah let me think about that for a live like on the table news think you can't do that I just did this kind of platform is the best platform because the conversation is never interrupted you never stopped for add yeah and no one can tell us what I'm about to ask go to the bathroom here oh sorry we could wrap this up soon but I wanted to I really wanted to get to other than not having gun-free zones yeah I mean not having everyone armed to the teeth and well no here's the thing here's the thing I'm saying if you're gonna have gun-free zones make them real gun gun-free zones don't just put a sticker on the window and then say you can't bring your gun in here and then not have physical measures in place to prevent it because otherwise I'm allowing to prevent it they've have like somehow movie theater or some if you have a movie theater have them if you're gonna make it a gun-free zone have a metal detector cyber comes in and the metal detector goes off you're still fucking guns in the room and what do you have armed guards to keep people from so then so then don't make it a gun-free zone right okay but even if you don't okay say if you have a gun-free zone and you have a movie theater and you put the metal detectors on the only way to enforce that is to have guns okay yeah but you know I'm saying okay so if you want to say if you want to hire if you want to hire armed guard to stand there right with metal detectors because I mean the metal detectors are only as good as the person being able to enforce it right so we need we need the executive right right so that would be an armed guard right so we think about it though we do it at the airport yes you know saying we do it at certain nightclubs when I go I'm not admitting to go in the strip clubs where I am I go to strip club I get patted down that's a guard there there's usually three guys there with guns right I mean and I don't besides the people they let in who shouldn't have them in which there's always gonna be cracks right right but at least if you're gonna make it a gun-free zone put up the physical preventative measures to reinforce that you can't just lot of people just don't stick her on a window and say this is a gun-free zone the only people who are gonna obey that are the people you're not even worried about anyway well think about movie theaters this movie theaters don't even say this is a gun-free zone they do when do they say it there's some like state to state so for instance like in in Dallas right where I live there are some movie theaters where I can bring my gun in no problem there are other movie theaters that have these signs that say you're not allowed to carry a gun in here right and so it is state to state some states they just require you to put up a it's business - business - it is it absolutely is so from that perspective it's like it's like even the courthouse right when I go to the courthouse courthouse is a gun-free zone - the fact if you're a cop but what do you have to do when you go to a courthouse you go through metal detectors there are cops there with people there with guns so what do you do about schools same thing but like these guys that are showing up they're not even they're not even students at that school like Masaryk land yeah the sea horses hook think about it like this though this is where the argument gets really disingenuous because it's like oh we want to save our kids lives in schools right right so the inner cities have more violence than we can think of right there's tons of shootings that go on outside of the schools in their cities right the last time you heard a mass shooting at inner city very very rarely very rarely yeah if not if not ever what's the one thing that they all have metal detectors huh what's the one thing that parkland didn't have metal detectors what's the one thing that a lot of these suburban schools that get shot up don't have metal detectors well you know it's one of the things that they've found - is that it's it's a very strange sort of situation but when you deal with places that have a lot of violence when you deal with places that have gun violence and crime which you don't have in those places is the random mass shootings you have one on one crime one on but the the tangible reality of actual gun violence for whatever reason sort of eliminates these mass shootings the mass shootings tend to occur in places where people think they're safe yeah right like schools movie theaters I think there's just a closer there's a different dynamic involved you know what I mean it's um it's gonna become more of an enum because if you compare the violence in the inner city to the violence in the suburbs which present themselves in by way of mass shootings if you compare the numbers as a whole mass shootings account for statistic for about one to two percent of all gun violence right and so but there's a seating higher number of percentage of gun violence in the inner cities right and it all really goes back down to what I set forth by the economics so you have a situation in the suburbs urban areas were economically speaking they're good right right so there's not really an incentive to just engage in random violence right you know there isn't a narco economy there that that feeds on itself that requires you to engage in a certain level and violence in order to survive whereas on the other hand in the cities you do have that dynamic so from that perspective what ends up happening though even though there is an money isn't everything right money doesn't care all so you're still gonna have instances of people who slip through the cracks because money doesn't care everything and so when it does happen it manifests itself in these random acts of mass shootings right whereas here there isn't if I know I'm going to school and I'm gonna have to deal with I'm gonna have to inevitably deal with the violence outside of school anyway it almost it almost makes it unnecessary to engage in random acts of mass shootings it's almost it's almost kind of like this perverted distraction from from wanting the mass shoot a place up when you have to deal with violence on an ongoing basis every single day of your life right you know what I mean I think that's what their point was the point was that when violence is real and it's around you all the time yeah it's it doesn't become this attractive blow up the game version tubelaunch go take a leak and then we'll wrap this up okay back Oh young Jamie's gonna show me his collection of guns while you're gone he carries one in his pants at all times strapped right next to his dick do you think you'd ever carry a gun okay like what if like what if someone came in here and got us license for concealed carry and said young Jamie you need to be strapped all you have to do is fill out this paperwork I'm gonna make it happen man I just don't personally feel I mean I just I feel like it's also naivety or whatever that I don't feel the need to do it well most of the time you wouldn't have the need to do it right right the the question is if you were at a place like you know fill in the blank whenever one of these things has gone down a nightclub let's say that gay nightclub in Orlando maybe you're curious and you walk around over theater how about that man at the night he came out yeah how about the Batman one or it wasn't there one in an Amy Schumer movie there was I think so yeah yeah yeah there was a mass shooting on sir no I think it was an Amy Schumer movie one of her movies because she became like this big anti-gun advocate afterwards what do you think that you would ever find yourself in a situation where you'd want a gun I mean I after that happen I just I was I've gone to movies and pictured it happening right and I don't I don't you just think about what you would do and I don't know that pulling out a gun and firing back is even in that my conscious thoughts it's it's definitely in the cards if the guy has a gun and he's in the room and you see one guy shooting people and you're there and he's not shot you yet it's definitely in the option I suppose so yeah I mean it depends on how long you're in there too if it's also whether or not you can keep your shit together what someone's shooting you know I mean keeping your shit together while while guns are going off and but that is that is not a normal thing for you and the amount of adrenaline that would be pumping through your body we're talking about if you were in a situation where mass shooting was going down yeah the people that think they could just pull out their gun and shoot that person he might fucking hit random people you might hit the wall you might hit the ceiling like here's the thing about I'll tell you I have a lot of experience in archery and one of the things that happens with people when they're shooting a live animals they panic a big fucking moose walks in and you you might hit that moose in the dick you might not even things as big as a building you might miss it totally I mean it happens all the time twenty yards away people miss the entire animal they just and that's something that's not even gonna fight back that's just a moose so the end the Vegas shooting thing I got any any witness reports or anything is so hard I feel like anything even video there's it's such a chaotic situation Sunday night everybody's wasted yeah it's so wasted yeah how what are you gonna do you have no idea well it's also one of those things to wear is a real problem with the conspiracy theories because one of the things that happened at the Vegas situation was people would show up at all these different casinos and say someone's shooting so they would say the security we go there's an active shooter at Circus Circus there's an active shooter so all the conspiracy theories were like look there's shooters everywhere there were shooters everybody know there was people everywhere that were freaking out because this fucking guy was just gunning people down from a hotel room one thing I've learned about being a lawyer eyewitness testimony is not reliable eyewitness testimonies dog shit man I've had people tell me about situations where I was there I was there I'm like dude that is not what fucking happen and enough to go over it with them and they're like oh yeah maybe you're right I will say this though people stopping mass shootings with firearms happens more than people realize it does happen mm-hmm it happens it's very disingenuous to deny it happens yeah there's a lot of stories out there where it's happened and people don't know about it because they're not they're not gonna push it so you think the elimination of gun-free zones would be the way to protect people I say no I'm gonna clear it I'm gonna clean up a little bit if you're gonna have a gun-free zone have physical preventive measures in order to enforce it if you're not going to do that eliminate them I think there I think first and foremost this would be the first thing that we should do there should be some sort of a public hearing on the use of SSRIs antidepressant psych medications and their corresponding instances like the the the amount of instances where these shooters are on these things I said I don't think people are aware I'll say this much to piggyback off what you're saying if I was diagnosed with a mental disorder I first thing I would do is I would go to a bookstore or go online and figure out every possible way that I can sell help my way through it because I won't touch this stuff one of the things that's just as effective if not more effective I think Google this cardio I think exercise and running is more effective to treat depression than SSRIs I am almost certain that that's the case I don't doubt it at all I think you think so many people are addicted to marathons yeah to get high yeah there's something to it man I get high when I run for sure is there anything there every time I go to the official site and it says it's not a real thing who's what officials CBI dot was the NCC I like what I did a study on it it's exercise a viable treatment for depression oh they want to say no get pilled up but there there are studies that have been done that show because I know Rhonda Patrick was discussing it I have to be freaking hate taking medicine like I have to be on the floor before I was prescribing exercise before medication aerobic activity has shown to be effective treatment for many forms of depression so why are so many people still on antidepressants well here's one reason and this is not to dismiss the people that are depressed cuz I know people that are depressed and it's a horrible thing and I know people that have been helped by antidepressants I know people that if my good friend Ari he was suicidal he got on antidepressants he's happy as fuck now he's off of them it helped him yeah my friend Brian it was the same thing not the Brian that we know another Brian he he was a jujitsu guy that I knew he had a real fucking problem got on SSRIs turned his life around found a good woman got it got in a great relationship to start his own business wean himself off of them now he's happy there sometimes people find ruts in their life we had a podcast with a guy wrote a book on it a guy Johann Hari who wrote a book on depression SSRIs for depression heart failure patients not so fast the studies should put to rest the practice of starting SSRIs and depressed patients with heart failure in an attempt to effect CVD outcomes what a CVD cardiovascular disease okay oh well that's what people with heart problems if eclis but it's also a depression yeah people with depression and heart failure yeah fucking exercise I think is not is it's a requirement of the human body I really don't agree with something because I mean even my darkest times so I'm never at my I'm more I'm never more at my then actually when I'm down what I'm going through things because if because my my response to it is act what is to tighten up to force you to focus act yeah and so one of those things that I do is like I've been to gym every day for the last two weeks right it forces me to one of those things that happened that one of the things that happens is I start working out more yeah because of the clarity of mind I get after the fact right and in the sense of accomplishment and then it kind of starts me off in a way where it's I okay now what's next it's like I'm chasing I'm chasing the next thing to conquer but but yeah I agree with you all heartily I think I think focusing on it's focusing all means outside of just prescribing pills yeah right I don't like taking pills I don't like things that alter my mind I don't I don't like maybe because I'm a control freak in that sense this weird guy with a hundred guns is a control freak you know I was just thinking about I had thought while I was using your super toilet yeah I should get joe rogan one of my guns but then I realized you can't even know it here I can't nope what can I own what do you have that I can't own what's the it's the first gun I ever the first gun I've done so this one just so happens to be one that you can't you see you have a company that makes him yeah I have what I did was I came out with a Signature Series line of handguns well this is the first one because it's not allowed in California what's what's wrong with it y'all have a list of guns that you're allowed to own it it's not on and then like you would have to there's this micro stamping that's required for any gun it's not own list and it's so prohibitive yeah it's weird so what is the different what kind of guns are they what is it other went as far as they're prohibited the one that you have that I can't have oh I can't pull it aside if you want okay you mean that particular gun yeah oh yeah what's about it like what is this spec state just it just it just is like it's just a list of guns I don't really know exactly the caliber is it the semi-automatic because there are some automatic guns on the list that you're allowed to own there are other it's just arbitrary that's what it seemed like to me what kind of guy is it it's Amy he'll look it up Wow if you want to pull it up pull up tiered of Tyr e de fe NS e fear defense calm there we go yeah there's some weird shit I mean we got Jerry Brown's our fucking governor the goofball the firearms transfers work order phone gallery contact people can't shoot there's Lincoln's mass shooting going on pressure actually no you see one where says the Advocate yes that's it name of gun is the Advocate someone might have beat now Gyr does my service unavailable all the hackers they got to it already fucking Russians bro nasty problems go back to get her pasty problems I don't know if everything we were to kill doing we just killed it you can't take a couple on her people and it but the by the time that it hits YouTube though isn't it important or too late in seconds 20 seconds to type in type in the advocate and then Kohli Anwar and then see what that does and then like erased air defense though click on the top damn we killed that website go to images kill that well there you go those that's the gun okay and why that seems like a normal handgun it is so what the fuck is wrong with it why can't I have it I know I wasn't asked the folks your leaders and calls but what are they saying is wrong with it like was specific I don't know why they make the decisions they make in California to be honest with what what is this x2 this gun what it is a nine-millimeter handgun semi-automatic this is because it's semi-automatic or no no I don't think so no no just I don't I don't think that's the basis like I don't I don't know the the complete basis and reasons for why certain guns are allowed handgun wise in California another I'm pretty sure they're gonna be tons of people who tell me this because I have a huge audience in California at the section my one of my biggest audience there's a lot of gun owners in California people people aren't you know the idea that guns in California are somehow another rare you know what's fun thing is the birthplace that they are 15 was in California yeah well that's a weird gun that's a gun that people just have demonized it's not the most powerful gun it's not the scariest gun but I do chamilitary but they don't even use it in the military they don't use it in the military but to be honest with you if they did I'd want that gun why because it's the most effective means to protect myself right like I don't I don't understand this idea of neutering guns to the point where two new doing gun to point of irrelevance more ineffectiveness it's a people that don't use guns they have this idea and this is this is where we're at now I think one of the things that I'm getting out of this conversation with you is that there's not really a clean answer there's not a clean answer and if there was people would have figured it out it's almost like society has to continue to evolve and one of the way society evolves is having these conversations you and I have in this conversation where a few million people are going to listen to it and then millions of people on their own having those conversations and people looking at the reality and that's in that way I think what you're doing is important and what a lot of people are doing is important where they're talking about the actual numbers in the actual statistics and that's letting us get a look at it and that's the one thing that I try to convey with my videos I don't care where you stand on the issue I just will have a shit ton of more respect for your position if it's from a position of education right if you actually have some knowledge I'm not saying you have to be a Jedi Master firearms mm-hmm just understand the very basics the fundamentals we have politicians pushing policy based on things that make no since Brian like it actually exposes the fact that they don't know anything about firearms it's almost like you're gonna push policy on something that you don't know anything about right and so it's disingenuous and inherently dishonest so that's the biggest frustration I have I'm I look at I put a look I'm gonna educate you and give you the information that you need so that you can make an informed opinion about it if at the end of the day I take you shooting I tell you the stats I tell you about how guns function and how they work if you still are anti-gun I can respect that mm-hmm now that doesn't mean you get to then push your anti-gun agenda on to me and limit my rights because of it but I can respect that at least we can walk away and say hey look well I think we're always got it from a difference but I appreciate that I think we're also faced with the reality of this the sheer number of guns that we have in this country it's a staggering number so you're not gonna just take those away you're not where you gonna put them and that's just now there's some people were like well we can devolve the number over time right we can just put these laws and they can get bad for a little bit but then over taluk a you doing that weird voice where you see I always do we're out of time just at that gun place would you be interested in sitting down like maybe on this show if I had an anti-gun advocate I beg for it okay not not to say not not here's something reasonable here's the thing I'm not trying to get up here in crush this person and and all that stuff I've done it to death right but I do want to have the conversation right you know and I've done it on my show the only problem is is it's too easy to ignore it because of the platform that it's all right you know you had someone on your show that made reasonable points like if somebody wanted to watch you with in some sort of a debate with an anti-gun person is there a show that you could recommend that people go watch right now that I was on yes on your show on my show ah well see is the thing though so one of the biggest flaws of the people that were on my show that would I had that conversation with is you could instantly see it was more of an education process because you could tell they didn't know much so what would happen is that they'd make a point about why they believe this then I would give them information and then would be like oh okay okay you see what I'm saying I do um I'm sure there's someone out there that is educated is anti-gun well we'll have someone find them well I have this I have a publicist we'll have him I'll have Matt Staggs please let me know because I'd be all for it yeah I really would there's there's probably someone out there that's reasonable that has good points and has a well-thought-out sound argument it would be interesting to listen to you talk to that person absolutely but I think one of the things we could take away from this is that this is a it's a messy situation it's not clean it's not like hey we're putting poison in the water stop putting poison in the water clean up the water it is not that simple super complicated it deals with mental health it deals with freedom and it deals with law-abiding people who aren't doing anything wrong where people are trying to take away their rights they're enthusiasts they love guns and I don't think there's a look look here's a perfect example you're sitting here with a gun on your shirt what kind of gun is that ar-15 you have an ar-15 yeah actually selfies I have I have an archery shirt on I could walk anywhere with this yeah no one would feel threatened no I'll kill the fuck out of you with this bow right but no one would feel threatened but if you walk around with that people will you know you are one of those doing you're a gun guy are you telling people you have that on you yeah is that what you're saying you warning people you're a dangerous person you know oh you're an archery enthusiast oh so I did archery at Camp Nelson the Boy Scouts we shot bows I'm sorry I'm gonna start opening girls at the bar with that yeah I shoot archery so listen I appreciate the conversation I don't think we got anywhere but I don't think you can I think we talked about well I mean to be honest with you it's a conversation that needs so here's what happens things happen in our in our reality that forced a specific focus on the part of the conversation right and so of course we weren't gonna stand on a how long we've been here how long within two hours two hours right we've been having this gun debate for how long now in this country years right yeah yeah but I think for a lot of people especially people who follow me they wanted me to come on your show not because you and I were gonna come to an answer but to educate right well also to have what we have on the show of where I try to have on the show just discussions just talk exactly and let people talk let people express themselves and I think you definitely did that today you express yourself you're a very reasonable guy anybody looks at you and says you're a maniacal gun nut that's you pulling that out of your own head you know but I would love to do that and we'll try to find somebody we'll try to find somebody if you're open to that absolutely we're trying to find somebody that could could argue the point but thank you brother really actually no thanks for having great talks pleasure all right folks we'll be back very shortly we have a second round to today with Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz see you soon bye [Music]
