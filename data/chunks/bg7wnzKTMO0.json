the Joe Rogan experience i watch the thing they are down crazy Eddie do you remember crazy Eddie his prices are insane you know crazy dude well tell everybody who crazy and he was crazy idea was a guy that had stores in all five boroughs of New York wholesale outlets TVs and everything like that I was watching fake snow in the background he fucking like just like he liked it out of the park didn't he go to Israel hide to flee but the most brilliant thing he did was he took don't don't fucking check fact jnanis he took either his nephew his son-in-law somebody that he was related through blood put him through college so he could get a job at the IRS so they could figure out how to rob from the IRS this is how fucking insane this guy was I'm watching this dog they got crazy right crazy and he fled after he started just buying boxes you know how you remember years ago you'd be driving in New York and there was some guy selling stereo speakers yeah then you take him home there was two bricks yeah well he did the same thing to investors he took boxes filled them up with bricks and just stocked them in the warehouse and then he went public so he got everybody to come down and look at all his inventory and all these fact checkers they're checking boxes of bricks of them whoa and he had I mean five fucking warehouses all around they were all fake and he got all this money he fled to Israel and he fled for a while but they knew he was a pussy hound right so they got like Escobar style they got him like you know on the phone like I'm gonna store something crazy and what they did it was they put a blonde on the side of the road with a miniskirt and they knew eventually he would drive by it stop no he stopped [Laughter] what is the did you google the richest women in the world where they got their wedding from Syosset Queens Long Island and he had commercials he he was the first one that pushed the commercial barrier I mean I would like to look at how many people on the Left will attack others for not being progressive enough not being left enough so I think it's a it's a panic right you see this is the kind of behavior you see in a panic a moral panic for example and so Helen and I the third person who worked on the project with us Helen and I wrote an essay about a year and a half ago and talking about how the extremism on both sides is really the problem and most people reject it and should fight it most of us are sensible people in the middle who hate this in fact data just came out showing that it's 80% of the population hate the fringes both sides yeah so an only 8% are on the left and 12% are on the right of the fringe however that works out and so we wrote this thing and we said that what's going on actually we called it existential polarization so you have this idea that everything is an existential crisis so the the far-right will start with them sees that if the democrats get power oh it's open borders the terrorists are coming in our entire way of life is going to be destroyed catastrophe catastrophe oh no Judith Butler's you mean 95 genders quick stop the Democrats no matter what and then you have the left oh my god if they get power that everything's gonna be racist we're gonna be beating gays in the snow it's gonna just be the worst thing that's actually kind of a joke but it's it's for real though that they think that the world is gonna fall apart if the other side gets power yeah and so when you have that kind of a situation you have a panic and you see the slightest bit of a happening on the other side is just something to completely freak out about and then what do you do you say oh well the only possible recipe to balance the scale is to turn further our way if we go toward the middle that puts the balance say if the right goes really far right and we on the Left move toward the middle now the whole balance has moved right so the only way to keep the balance close to the middle is if they go right we go left right mm-hmm right then that's gonna keep the balance but what that actually does is it this is gonna get nerdy hang on that actually puts all of the weight on the outsides and you think about a spinning thing right it's got centrifugal forces happening what's that trying to just kind of rip the spending thing apart well if you have all the weight crammed in the middle it's like a wheel it doesn't come apart right now imagine if you had like two billiard balls and you have like this big long stick and there's two holes for the billiard bars they don't go in it like locked in they're just sitting there you spin that what's gonna happen there to fly right off right so if you have all the weight on the outside you start spinning a thing so that's like the political conversations are dynamic it's gonna rip the thing apart the more weight gets to the outside so one side going to the fringe doesn't mean the other side should go to the fringe that's how you tear a nation apart and I pass out 230 hits 2:30 in the morning hits and I'm just uh I'm just you know I wake up because I hear the alarm you know kind of pop off at the hotel so now I'm hearing these alarms starting to go off and I've you know I checked out I checked out on front I checked out through the window and I checked out at lobby nobody was moving so I was like it's a false alarm so I got the pillow put over my head and everything slapped the alarm and then that happened about 2:30 now 4:30 comes about on this time I don't wake I don't wake up because of the alarm I wake up because of the smoke I'm like coughing I'm I'm like coughing on the smoke and I first I thought I was dreaming so I wake up and at that time I had I had a you know I slept him I tell that's how tired I was and I got up and I'm going to turn on the lights in the light ain't turning on and then I go through the window and I checked the window and then she no I see the car right in front of me on fire 3/4 of the hotel's like I was probably about five rooms away from like getting hit hard like I'm talking about like like fire coming out the window like that and I'm waking up to this like thinking I'm dreaming

walking through the streets going up the hill I'm just thinking like God give me a horrible way to die horrible way to die and I got a I got a bird's-eye view when I was on top of the when I was on top of the hill and then I saw there's a cop down there there's a cop down in the middle of the free one just so you know that that's where I got to go so now I'm running fast and I've seen out this brush fire kind of come along and just I'm seeing like California like just catch on fire like completely I threw my eyes I jump over the first fence to get to the freeway you know no problem I jump

had on with slacks I was commando slacks no shirt no shoes like out in the cold in California and as that flimsy fence as I jump out that last fence it like cut your like a part of the fence I grabbed my butt and it just it get cutting me open hard and at or like half the leg so now I'm full of smoke on my right foots burn and I'm I'm pretty much half naked so I see the cop car and I go up to the cop car and as I'm going up to it I'm sorry the freaking cop Carly like fucking just scrambles I'm just like oh my god and as soon as that cop car left I remember seen like this big-ass DS a lot coming towards me and ever get into the middle of the freeway and kind of you know waving my hands like you know take me and die like this like hit me dude and as it got closer I was a firetruck and I
