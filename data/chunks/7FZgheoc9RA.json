the gyro can experience a V I read war the world's the opening line is something like I can't remember the opening I'm paraphrasing um the earth was being we knew we were being watched or what we didn't know is we were being watched and that's a great opening line for a sci-fi novel awesome Martians are watching us and then they send their ships and everything it's a beautiful sci-fi novel because it's so priests I did you notice I made up all the side yeah and Welles really did make it up like he knew nothing about technology you know how the tripods come out of this shit huh and they have laser beams and the laser beam everything like he just sort of made up it's gonna be this beam of you know pure energy or whatever like well you know what's fascinating he did do that but that's what a lot of people use as their template for the future when they thought about like future weapons it was always a laser beam it was always a beam well I think what's once physics were understood that things were in particles there wasn't that big a jump that there would be it first of all Zeus's Thunderbolt the ultimate yes you know sure I dude yeah just I mean this Thunder in general it's the idea of this power this electricity fan everybody knew what electricity wasn't what it could do I would have loved to been alive before electricity was explained and see what the fuck people were saying you know I mean did you imagine what people were saying back when you know people barely had a language they barely could string together a sentence you would understand and the fucking sky bolts of light coming out sky and hitting the ground balls through a field to deal with you know there's been an instance that I read about on of ball lightning like there's been several instances of ball lightning that they think explains UFOs yeah I would think that a lot of not all UFOs obviously but some UFO sightings they talk about these orbs that are flying orbs of light apparently under certain geological pressures like certain pressures on near fault lines and the like there's there's fucking bolts of lightning that like come out of the ground I would be surprised it's yeah it's supposed to in Atlanta it can last for like three or four seconds well if everything in the world isn't to charge everything is totally makes sense right just a weird spark you know that occurs what is this never seen yeah really exciting my wife and I were in Capri once and it's a little island off the coast of Naples and is that he laughs oh well I think they're saying this is ball lightning yeah yeah I could believe it would be ball lightning kiss ball lightning can has weird properties yeah look look at that just disappeared it's a federal role and it sweet writer than fuck so you can see it from miles away right right and you will like me hit things you know how you always see spark a shit well my wife and I were sitting at we were having dinner and this and it's a little island and a big storm brew started brewing on the Mediterranean and all of a sudden everything you know the ozone in the air and your hair starts to stand up and it was a light breeze and Capri smells like lemons and bay leaf so it was really beautiful and I said to my wife here and this is what a rabbit smells like right before the lid comes down on the floor bay leaf in lemon and then hey and then we sat on the balcony of our hotel and the storm never hit Capri but it was several miles away and we watched it and it just just giant lightning strikes out in the clouds but it never got close enough to rain you know what I mean oh that's great and it was the I said this is like watching the gods play right like here we're sitting here with a glass of wine and the air is electric Wow and all you you'd hear it you know and then you you know you see it and then you hear it afterwards because it was that far away then now you need clouds to have lightened yeah and the clouds are just crashing together and it would you'd see like what I'm saying is where you were you didn't have to worry there's no clouds above you you didn't have to worry we were it was at least a couple of miles away Wow so you guys yeah clear Mediterranean sky simply that you could feel the raised electricity in the air because there was a breeze blowing and and your hair was on and and there was a lot of ozone you know yeah from all the crashing but it never got close enough that never hit the island and never poured rain it just sort of stayed right off the island and I was that's so exciting if I could always have storms to spectate you know because you'd watch a ball just watch shoot from one cloud to another or arcing rope you know and and it was endlessly entertaining there's nothing more entertaining than lightning you know then the the noise of the Thunder and that smell of especially if you know you're not gonna die that was what made it so great we were sitting there with a joint and a glass of wine it was like it you know yeah heavenly cuz if you're in a city I live here in New York City no storm goes on you have this weird feeling that let lightning can hit this fucking building at any time and my windows could explode I was on a plane with my wife going into Frankfurt Germany for the World Cup like in 2006 and we flew through a giant electrical storm mm-hmm so we're on the plane and I'm looking out the window and the planes bouncing up and down and a giant ball of lightning struck the wing of the plane oh my watch out like this and then my huge humming noise the lights dimmed for a second and went right back on the plane like oh my god flight attendants went fucking white which then I was a little scared because I thought well they shouldn't be freaked out right and my wife like was you know panicky and I went not that I was so great but I went the wings still there let's start there right the wing the wing is completely intact yeah it's a lightning rod at the end of that you know the little metal thing they have at the end of the what do they have a metal thing yeah yeah - a transplant exoskeleton thing around them so right and lightning it's it's disperses around the planet Earth Oh prepare for that yeah yeah obviously you have to write because they're gonna fly feel like just do that look at that picture oh my god planes you never hear about planes blowing out because they've got hit by look at this watch this Oh though it's crazy cuz in then when you see it in real life it looked like nothing looks so fast yeah let me see what it actually is so we it got hit and then the pilot didn't come out for like ten minutes that rot he led us all sweat and everybody was scared shitless maybe then the pilot came on and he talked like Kissinger he was German obviously but he first you didn't German then in English but when he spoke in English she sounded like hisses you there's nothing to worry about this lightning is harmless and everybody's like oh my god what's going on here but it was scary this is the Turkish airplane hit by lightning strike inside playing video but I don't know why there was sparks going look at the door the doors all just got hit right there and the lights go out terrified the mountains does shit's terrifying shut it off don't ever put that back you know flying through the sky where the fucking gods are angry I think did I tell you this week if I've told it all stop we flying Australia clear sky and what was on a little plane usually you're on a giant plane and then it was on like a 737 you know like that you original version Australia which is groovy airline so on the flight with me and my wife has the game you know this guy is a rapper right he's on a tattoo and his dad and Carrie Hilton who's also rapper and uh and their policy right so it's hectic right it starts to get bumpy and the pilot comes on it goes like everybody strapped in okay for like ever and it Australia's 15 hours 16 it's long yeah this is all day and this lasted literally five hours right just bouncing up and down side to side pitching you on the whole thing and on them on the sky map right it says like Pago Pago 1500 kilometers meaning you're 1500 kilometers from panko panko in other words the Pacific Ocean is so big there's no land masses nothing anywhere near you where you're going over right so you're not gonna go in because it's turbulence it's not your fucking freak man you're not gonna die this is an electricity turbulence doesn't make planes crash and it doesn't unless there's some sort of shitty a structural defect on the plane like that you know the wings aren't glued on I mean any a structural defect I'm thinking about generally you've been in a planet turbulence they know you know that's not what makes them cross you know but anyway said it's terrible in any case so we get through it and next morning the wrappers get up and they're all like oh my god I thought I was gonna die and you know it was so bad last night I you know I was praying and lo I they're all really shook up and Carrie Hilton is a very lovely young rapper lady wakes up it's been all night mind you well no one can move I stopped holding my wife's hand for five you know like this what happened and the rappers cuz you didn't feel we're gonna die no hurry alright she goes I took a pill I didn't see anything and beans a motherfucker yeah what and then she ate one piece of fruit and put on a leopard miniskirt and came out with her makeup and signed autographs and I was like you're a star I want you on my team you are Alexander the Great we everyone was scared are the adrenaline you could smell in the plane you know what I mean from five hours of bouncing you know just not oh you know you want it to stop stop so we can stop producing and she just woke up work yeah if I can put on a push-up bra getting ready to for the photo call when they got the plan I believe you did tell the story I remember this place herself there was like you got to be kidding me man yeah it was either this podcast or another podcast I heard you Tori it's remember it now after it's over we talked about the girl getting out and changing yeah that's a great story well it's great that someone could be that that out cold on ambient so there's positive things to ambient I was talking about shit about ambien but if ambien can get you to avoid that not one minute of it and it lost the forever I'm sorry I didn't mean to repeat it but it always made me laugh because I was scared to death and when I got off the plane I look like you know something James Brolin sat on I was squishy and moist hmm what's your dance per day yeah and you know you just wrecked and all I wanted to do is like you know eat a club sandwich and die you know cuz you're like God we're on the ground and she just like hey who's for pastures
