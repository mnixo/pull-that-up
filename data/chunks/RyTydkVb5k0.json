hello freak bitches whenever I'm at UFC and somebody gets kicked in the face well I just always I just think about how disappointed I'd be if I got kicked in the face of it what did I do in my life why somebody kicking me in the face you especially I mean you've never been kicked in the face no it's just been kicked in the face mmm especially like that's why I'm glad I didn't fight that guy I'm glad I don't you know put myself in situations where I got a fight a strange because you never know where I'm just if I was to be fighting I'm trying to throw hands poorly but if somebody just kicked me in the face like oh I didn't I didn't know you were gonna do that this Donald Cerrone combination god damn that's beautiful laughing right left high kick boom yeah that is matrix shit Donald Cerrone lives in the fucking matrix do right now at 170 he's coming on the podcast next week Jamie he's here on next Tuesday I'm gonna fucking convince him live on the Internet don't drop down from 170 and 170 s a fucking wizard who the hell stop and Rick story like this oh man Donald Cerrone he's a fucking wizard he's a wizard at 170 if it felt it felt kind of barbaric or arcade but when you have money on somebody and they're beating the shit out of somebody else and you're winning it's a different type of emotional when he wins Cerrone started fucking that dude up I stood up I you were in there with them I was in - in there wither away fucking a couple thousand dollars hell yeah I was with him I was in fucking appreciate your loyalty first of all to both on it Donald Cerrone dope and then Johnson I bet on Johnson right before the fight started they know him well with the odds he was - 250 so that's pretty reasonable yes it ring how hard he hit and the one is so fast oh my god I don't want it we think it's someone he told me I have to search it please do was that the fastest knockout in the history of the light heavyweight division it was 13 seconds which took me longer to place my bet it's so hard that happened so fast he hit so hard it happened so quick when Glover's started pressuring him like what when I score a fight or rather commentate a fight when I watch something like down I like okay what can go over do and what can rumble - we know rumble has awesome stand-up skills we know he had a college wrestling background we know he's really powerful and he's probably the hardest hitter ever so what can go over do he's really technical he can survive a storm maybe he could take him down maybe he can get him into deep water so he starts out super aggressive bobbing and we even Tyson's style and then one haymaker one haymaker uppercut so sorry Ryan Jim OH 37 seconds god damn Ryan Jim OH rest in peace Ryan Jim oh he just died recently run over by a car in Canada James Irvin Sandman 8 seconds hoody fight and then John's that gamble to gamble on that and they have it happen that fast that's like fuckin craps she'd put like a 30 second over-under on summer rumbles fights this is literally a 30-second cuz he's so scary right now he's so scary he hits guys in a totally different way it's like he knows something that nobody knows about how to hit people cuz this dude what was that guy's record daddy fought 25 for he's Alexander eight seconds well right loads of guy Johnson Fox record was it 25 like he was a elite fighter Oh clover is beyond Italy Glover's fought for the title yeah he had a five-round fight with John Jones went to the distance yeah so it's one of the best fighters in a world Glover's excellent and that's crazy that he got in 13 seconds you know what it is man there's the human frame you know like the skull the brain the neck can only take so much it just can only take so much yeah and most people can't hit that bell you know that bell when you go to the carnival and you slam down on that Bell and the little thing goes up and dings yeah most people can't make that thing ding in this world but Rumble Johnson he can make that thing ding every time with his open barrage yeah with his first you know name the number 200 punches and kicks whatever it is he can knock you the fuck out the question with a guy like that is if he gets past that 200 number and the opponent is still there can he make it through it and that's what happened to Cormier fight it's like Rumble hit Cormier with everything but the kitchen sink but Cormier is so fucking tough he's so tough from being a world-class Olympic wrestler from a guy who competed all over the world he's just got this this is like a level of toughness that you can't recreate and he takes a big bomb but figures out how to scramble and survive you know and so he makes it into what Brown did Cormier submit Rumble see the thing about a guy like Rumble though is you could submit him once but once he figures out what you did and he remembers how much it sucked when you did that to him can you do it again and if you can't do it again what if he can figure out how to keep it standing yeah what if he could figure out how to keep hitting you with those barrage 'iz of heavy bones coming flying at you with perfect technique he is so fucking hard man what third round hello Cormier took him in the deep water man
