hello freak bitches you you um we were talking about what I think we say kratom I think we yeah I'm call cradle and this is something that is in the news right now because it's helped a lot of people overcome opiate addiction yeah and they're about to make it Schedule one meaning that it has no medical use whatsoever no no right right highly addictive you know medical use you're gonna take it right now like right now it's legal to do boy they're gonna get you wrecker out right right no statue of limitations on illegal drugs it takes like an hour to kick in and so it also is a very mild dose it is 12 23 and 123 em and start asking weird questions I'm already on some uh-oh Eddie on some before just taking this shit all day long I know I take it before I do podcasts oh well I still have some pain management issues from an injury and sometimes anybody injury cuz it's crazy it's crazy story uh so I was this is a couple years ago I I was in the best shape of my life and I was rock climbing like three four times a week and doing crossfit and all this and I was like I always been lanky like this my whole life and I actually had muscles for the first time in my life and just like felt like Superman and and I was supposed to be rock climbing is on my birthday and and there's some fires in Sedona where the rock climbing was supposed to be and so so we went for a hike instead just to see a little bit of Sedona as my first time there and I was out with my friend Mikey and he so he he was like this he was like three four hundred pounds I think he's like 400 pounds like his whole life he's been like hugely obese and then he went on this diet that he just drank coffee with a butter in it for like 40 days that's it that's all you eat yeah yeah he cracked himself out and then he much he lose in 40 days like a thousand pounds like 200 like Eli like all of his weight and then he was like a normal person that sounds crazy and I was 200 pounds at 40 days I don't know if it was that much it was significant it was like well over a hundred pounds and yeah and he and then he so then he started doing like jiu-jitsu started like becoming active for like the first time in his life when it was like all excited about this and so he was like oh I have this there's this one shortcut that I want to take my my wife will never let me and so let's let's go and do that now and I like that it let me take a shortcut because it was too high of a jump and then I and we got to this and and I looked and I was like yeah that's too high and he was like so because he's been so huge his whole life he has no idea of how high you can jump from like this you know he's he's never been able to put jump before and and I know because I'm an adrenaline junkie I love Heights I've been climbing trees and jumping off ship my whole life and and I was like this is too high and he's like I think if we like climbed down a little would be okay like I don't know and I was wearing barefoot running shoes at the time and then he was like determined he was going to do it nice hike so it was jumping from a cliff onto another cliff and so if you couldn't roll and if you landed it wrong and you rolled off it was like death death hundreds of feet and fucking and so now I'm like I'm gonna watch this guy roll off this cliff because she's new to like physical activity he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing and he's about to jump off this thing that's to lie on the other side he's been carrying around an extra a hundred plus pounds on his legs his whole life his legs are probably strong as hell yeah yeah I imagine and it was weird cuz he had like weird skin like hanging off everywhere it's tough Emma found that like stretch marks and stuff but he so he was he was determined and I was like I was looking at it and I was like you know what I think that I could make it oh gee and then I can I can like at least be there so you make sure he doesn't roll off this fucking cliff my god and yeah I mean you know some of those things you feel like a fool in hindsight and I was like you know I've jumped off stuff higher than this it's just that I'm wearing bad shoes and I can't roll I'm gonna have to take with my feet and I even told them I psyche I'm gonna be risking breaking a heel because I broke a heel once before when I was like a teenager I love jumping off shit and so but it wasn't like the end of the world Isaac you know if that if I break a heel it won't I'll still be able to get her around it's just like a couple month thing and in my mind this is the worst of what's going to happen and so I went for it and I and I jumped and I landed and and then and I as soon as I landed I heard both of my heels break it just the sound shot through my body and I heard it like it sounded like a branch like snapping under water and and I I was I think I was in shock or something because I just kind of turned and looked down on my psyche I just broke both my heels and I said it just like that and so he thought I was like joking so he is just about to I'm like no no I really broke both my heels you're going to have to go around and try to help me down and I started making my way down it took him like a half-hour 45 minutes to get to me and I had to kind of do you remember when you're in school and gym class did you have to do that crab walk thing we're like your belly's facing the air so I had my left foot just was was already like five times its size within like 30 seconds and so I couldn't use that at all and then my my right foot was just I couldn't even tell if it was totally broken or if I just bruised it real bad but I was able to use my toes thankfully and so I had to kind of like one foot crab-walk down and then he got around to me and was and like a couple people were trying to help me for a little bit as too steep for anyone to help me so I just kind of had to make it down on my own once we were at level ground which took like three hours of just like it wasn't exceptionally annoying I mean it was painful I scoot down for a little bit and I'd have to take a break for a few minutes and just like and just like roll around in the fetal position in pain and and then and he was like he was like so this was his dumb idea and on the way down he's just like standing there like next to me waiting for me like trying to lighten the mood by telling me jokes and stuff I'm like dude this is not the time for jokes I am fucking pissed right now and as I could see it's fine it's gonna be fine I just fucking need to focus and get through this and got down went to the hospital I still I mean it hurt real bad and we had to go to a second Hospital because the one was too full and and then I mean I thought it was bad but I I thought I was like this is more than just a little break this is like this is a pretty big break you know the doctor came in he's like this is this is really serious and and your your heels in like 20 pieces oh Jesus give an x-ray so I could freak out yeah it's um it's actually the the online I made an album about it called my bottle break this chain your uh imagine ball that's the cover art as the x-ray of my heel what's the x-ray post surgery it's got all the screws and plates in it yeah yeah I don't know I imagine I have the originals around somewhere and I'm maybe somewhere way back in my facebook you could see some of the scars and stuff like that it's real grill so I'm not sure if you'd be able to find it or not but so they put these metal plates in and kind of screwed in the pieces of the the bigger pieces of the bone that we're still there oh like where they wanted them to be eventually because it's you can't just put the bone it's like if you if you snap like a candy bar and try to put it together there's all these crumbs and stuff like that missing and so they just kind of put it in place where it was supposed to be and and and they're like well hopefully it just kind of grows back and comes together alright and did really the real issue was so they the way they did the surgery they put a an issue sign ladies and gentlemen it's a first you see that what am I looking at right here yeah what is that that's the from where they went in with the surgery okay so they they said they didn't want to do the surgery at first because they're like this is really complicated surgery but if we don't do it I don't think you're ever going to walk right again and well why didn't they not want to do it they weren't qualified to do it is that the idea no this guy was like this guy I got referrals and this guy was like as good of there's there's go further back than that there's some real disgusting stuff so they just just the area that it's in and and so there's this is it's like a 90-degree angle that they have to cut in in the corner of it oh there we go there that doesn't look good that and that was like that was like months and months later - that is this is a bill surgery this is like four months after the fact this looks like what it looked like dead tissue yeah a lot of scar tissue and stuff so see where it's open there and in that that corner ripped open they're like I hope this corner doesn't rip open because this sometimes happens with the surgery and if it does you're going to be really susceptible to infection right and so I had I couldn't when I at the time I lived in Malibu and my place had like 50 steps and there's no way I could like get up with groceries and everything with two broken feet and I could get around on crutches a little bit but I ended up having to spend like three months in my parents basement as I couldn't care for myself or anything so like on top of hmm having to cancel three months of work and not have you know we don't have a safety net right and having no income and you know it's it was is actually like I'm very grateful for my parents and every but it's you know it's just embarrassing and you're like I had to move into my parents basement I'm sure they understand them yeah like you just you know we were a loser and couldn't wake up on time I lost your apartment you know this is just fuck man the worst part of you to come to start walking again so after three months I got back on the road and and there was still this this little kind of wound that it opened up wasn't healing and then I started it was just taking they told me it was going to take like at least six months to like start walking and it ended up taking much longer than that because so about four or five months in I got on the road and then and then a a doctor thought that maybe I was getting a like just a topical infection and gave me some stuff that wasn't good enough for the infection and then I started so about four or five months later I started having fevers and then I went into the hospital and then they're like you have a bone infection and I was like God because they're like this is really serious because that's when you can lose your foot and stuff if they can't stop the infection they just have to cut it off oh Jesus came back it cancelled every all my work again came back to LA they did a surgery and and I was really thankful that I'd happened to sign up for the health care this is right when the universal health care it just came out otherwise I'd be bankrupt from it but it was still certainly it was not perfect at all they wouldn't let me do stuff out of state I had to get myself back to California and and do you mean buy stuff out of state you mean surgical surgery and Hospital checkups I had to pay they had them in California because your insurance yeah and so when I was in Wisconsin I had to pay out-of-pocket for that and and it's like kind of not supposed to be that way either but there was the I mean I would I would call and try to in the insurance company and be like you need this one form okay I call this company and they'd be like yeah only doctors can get that form and so I'd tell my doctor and he'd be like no you can get that you have to go here and then it was like around and around sometimes I'd have to like pretend I was a doctor when I was on that phone with people just to get this fucking form that I'd need and so I paid out of pocket size like you know get medical bills up pipe we're piling up and so the second surgery what they did was they just cut out they took out the hardware that's what that's what got infected and then they kind of where the holes were from the screws they kind of drilled those out a little bit and then they just cut off the cut as big of a hole as they possibly could in my foot to suck out as much of the infection as possible and so I thought I was going to be in a hospital for and I still hadn't walked at this point and then I thought I was going to be there like you'll be in a hospital for like a week and a half or so two weeks and I was like okay fine I like I'm in I finally someone's going to be like taking care of me we're just going to get this done right I have my computer I was in good spirits and and getting a lot of work done and stuff and and then like two days later they're like your insurance is saying that they think you're better and you need to go home and now we need to show you how to like care for yourself so we had to train me on how to I had to give myself IV antibiotics three times a day Wow yeah they had they they put IV they put lines in my arm and I had to like make sure that they are sanitary all the time and I'd have to get him in and hold on a second it that's a complex medical procedure getting yourself in IV dude I had to google it I like fucking googled your insurance but what's the name of your insurance company um I don't know do I have the that's insane the fathoms right so that's the other thing is I have like two different insurance companies so this is like health net and then there's like this lakeside and low which one when I never know which one is like that I call one and they be like no that's your other company I call the other one no that's this kind it was just a year of dealing with this so because of the fact that this was so expensive they just decided to say fuck this guy let's make him do all the medical stuff himself yeah they were like you ever heard of that before they're like well he's a young guy he seems like he's in good spirits and healthy seems like a bright guy like he could take care of himself I think it was the logic behind it and so let's let's get him out of here could use a glass of what's up could you fight it I tried I was like what your I can't do this on my own it when they show me what I had to do it was so once I get the IVs hooked up and I'd have to figure out how to like get bubbles out of the lines and stuff like that like I was googling how do you get bubbles out of the lines like that's literally what eyes then I had to the first time they showed me what I had to do I I couldn't believe it they're like now watch this because you're going to have to do this yourself and then so this huge hole in my foot was packed full of gauze and they started pulling out this gauze I didn't know how big the hole was at first but then it was like one of those magic scarves I'm coming yeah and and then they're like so you're gonna need to take this out and then look in here look in your hole you're going to need to clean it out and like clean off your bone and stuff oh every day you can see your bone oh yeah I had to like scrub it off and then and then I had to pack it full of shit again and all this with like wearing gloves and a fate in a mask and everything like that and and then I and then I'd have to like put a rubber thing on to to take a shower I had to do this three times a day and then I couldn't sleep either because I needed the IV antibiotics had to be every eight hours and it took two hours to do them and so I could never get like a full 8-hour rest so I was like two hours and set it up it took two hours for the IV fluids to go and kick in yeah oh yeah yeah so you have to so I'd hang up these bags and stuff I'd hook up the IVs then I'd spend twenty minutes with my foot hole and then and then after after like a few weeks of that see they would always be like okay we can get you another home visit or something like that it would be like a week after I actually needed it because then I got I got this vacuum suction cup thing that they put on my feet and and they and it just kind of sucks all the infection stuff out and and it's gets rid of it and closes up in creates like blood flow into that area so it generates the things actually work amazingly well but but so then I had this device and like a vacuum and I started performing again I'd have to like take this vacuum off myself and I could close up my fucking foot hole and then go onstage and perform and then get off and put this vacuum back on and I remember because I had before I before I I went through a big breakup before I broke my feet and when I and I had been in like 12 years of relationships and so I was like I'm not dating for a year I'm not going to have sex I'm not going to think about women for a year I'm just gonna get my head straight and I did that it was great got tons of work done and then then when I started getting back into things he broke a fee it was no I had already I broke my feet during this time which which helped when like you don't have a sex drive when both of your feet are broken and and then but when I started getting back into it and like I remember I brought a girl back back to my hotel when I still had this fucking vacuum on my foot and it I was just like it was the fucking awkward and I hadn't had sex in like a year too so I'm like trying to figure out how to have sex again I got a fucking vacuum attached like what hole what was your health like I mean what kind of like energy levels did you have it would seem like if you're going through your body's trying to repair itself for such a long period of time it has to wear on you right yeah I mean it was it was more just the depression of it all and the stress was was harder than I I was getting plenty of sleep and stuff but it was it was a depressing time but ultimately it was kind of it was kind of good in a way um can build it in some a little bit I mean I mean I got a good Alpine I so I mean when I started in in Boston my start doing comedy I was like fearless I would do like the ballsiest stuff always trying new material and I just did not give a shit and I got a lot of attention for and I caught some breaks early on and once I started making money and doing the road it was like then you're worried about like getting negative comment cards and all this shit and that's like my livelihood and it was it was just watering down what I was doing and I wasn't fearless on stage anymore but and and so after breaking my feet and having three months of my parents house it kind of was just like I don't give a fuck anymore just doing exactly what I want to do and it was it was it really created a change in my career I thought that album and like the new act that I'm doing now are the best that I've ever been how long ago was the incident and the accident and how long did it take you to recover so it was it was two years ago um in May and then I about one year in I started using a cane and then that's when I that was really hard when I started using a cane because I was like yes light at the end of the tunnel and then I realized oh every other step that I take for the rest of my life I think is going to hurt just every other step and so it's like always on that's why that's why I take kratom before podcast because there's always like a part of my brain that can't stop talking that's can't stop thinking about my stupid fucking foot is it is it hurting you right now um no right now it feels fine but when you walk here um well the cardem helps but if I if I'm not on that most days it's just like having a pretty sore foot and then some days like probably now it's it's coming along better than I thought it would actually about three days out of a month I have like this streak and I don't know what causes I don't know if it's inactivity the weather whatever I have a streak of like three days where I can just where I should be using a cane again where if you saw me you'd be like what's wrong with that guy years later yeah yeah yeah about a year and a half after I started using a cane so but on a cane for about six months and then I started going without the cane and just using it sometimes and yeah so it's been quite an ordeal [Music]
