the girag an experience you are feeling when I go to pitch a I'll go to pitch a me an idea about a new show or something right and they're like this one guys is like that's a horrible idea don't ever tell anyone that idea again whoa that's always the best idea I've found like if an executive sucks go go digital and do it cuz they don't fuckin care I have an idea once that I pitched over the phone and the guy actually like said you're kidding right you did you waste my time with this and I was like wow alright I guess you didn't like my idea I pitched over the phone he was like I go I have this idea for a show it's just a silly idea but it's like it's a comedy and it's about these girls that work at a bikini pizza place in the day called Pizza sluts and at night they fight crime and they're there they're super hot chicks that are recruited by the police force and trained to infiltrate into areas where other cops could never get Jennifers people would never believe that these hot girls were actually secret agents yeah why did they have to work at the place is that a full-time job though well because they have a cover thought and you know where this mark and fucking dude was mad at me this is Chuck I pitched it that dude was Matt is a long time ago by the way and the dude was mad at me I was like I think that would be a silly show like you don't think they could be like a ton of jokes and like you'd get 2 million viewers just completely over the top have you ever pitched something just to fuck with the money no have you waste time with me sometimes yeah yeah because this is not at first this was I took I mean like I I make my money helping people right and I make my real money as may known speeches like I go to do motivational speeches at colleges teaching kids to get their shit together and stop being lazy it's up to stop being a whiny little bitch speech it's it's this entitlement buy college kids and colleges really like me coming and I do an hour speech and then a half-hour Q&A and then I'll do a lot of podcast it's great I mean for me that's amazing money it changes our family's life right so now it's like if I can do TV great if I don't that's fine too I'd like to do it but like I'll have an idea I had a idea of quarter road trip I just wanted to take bunch of hoarders in a Winnebago take across country and make him clean up someone else's house that's a good idea I think be fascinated yes like country right at first it was a joke but then the more I started pitching it I was like actually Alex I like seed Ignis but the first time I was just trying to piss off the executive because he had sat on my pilot for a year and so I was just mad at him he sat on the pilot I did I've done two pilots and I didn't realize this is everyone's done ten pilots it is what it is don't worry about it I was devastated because my first pilot didn't make show really yeah I was devastated devastated I was like this is gonna I mean I really I put all my eggs in that basket and I was just emotionally and I was like this is so important that I get this show and by the time the network and the production company and I got done with it was a shitty show and I didn't want to do it and I was like praying that it wouldn't get too picked up but then when it didn't get picked up I got all upset I got I got personal with it and I just I've learned now it is what it is it's just business it's it's really hard to be on a show and watch it fall apart because too many people have their input and this fuck with and I had no input yeah you know and it was like my name's on this my company's name is on it and it doesn't in it I mean well executive always think they always think they have a way to tweak it to make it better yes I'm not saying I'm brilliant or anything I was just I was personally upset I think that you know the the collaborative effort like a real true creative collaborative effort only works with people who respect each other creatively like people who actually are proven to be creative in order to bring someone like an executive into a creative meeting like what are you a creative person you would you write a lot I mean you're gonna have good ideas or is this like an ego bullshit thing here your greasy fingerprints on this and at your little ingredients to soup that's what a lot of it is and I got I mean I'm but with hoarders there's no writing we turn the cameras on and shit happens yeah and that's it it's your show no I'm just talent on that how many different dudes are quarter cleaners we've got wells to really like I mean there's a lot of people that that try to do it but in the it's like a hit show right oh yeah you know I say I'm the number one trash man in the country and A&E has no problem with you doing all your other stuff where they just never even sign me to come name it on a contract you're not on a contract I'm week-to-week whoa it's crazy that's gonna be annoying I'm the number gaion you know their number to show it amazes me I'm fine I don't want a contract now like doesn't contract I couldn't come do this like I'm you said it best the other day on your podcast you go I'm doing what I should be doing you're doing it right now and I'm their man my PI I'm doing I wrote a book had a great run with my book I'm helping a lot of families with my book it's called secret lives of Hoarders so you're just happy to keep moving work direction and keep working I clean up shit for 12 bucks an hour I'm happy to be working period like I'm lucky to have work III can afford all my groceries and my mortgage in the same month I'm lucky like that's awesome
