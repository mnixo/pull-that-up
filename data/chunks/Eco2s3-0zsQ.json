and here we go first of all gentlemen thanks for being here Jeremy thanks for coming back again thanks Jeff and thanks to you sir it's very excited to be here very exciting for me to be here to be able to talk to you about your story thank you I'm glad to be here David tell everybody who you are and tell everybody your background please okay and my name is David forever I served 24 years in the military enlisted marine for a couple years they sent me to Naval Academy then I flew for 18 years for the Navy had literally flew a-sixes Hornets and then super hornets had every qualification you could get in the airplane everything even the stuff they're not doing anymore so I had nvg high/low went to Top Gun and at the time of the incident we're going to talk about I was a commanding officer of VF a41 the black aces um I've gone through a gurney with this whole UFO stuff from being a full-on true believer to being incredibly skeptical to trying to be open-minded to being more of a believer now than I think I've ever been before and one of the things that I've always said is the people that I believe that there's a lot of loony people out there but the people that I put my trust in are high-level military people like yourself so when I hear someone like you who has a story that defies logic or defies conventional understanding of how aircrafts work that's when that's when I sit back and I go okay this this is a different thing because you know there's always people that are telling you they're psychic or they can you know they sense things or they're in communication with Bigfoot there's always loony people out there but when someone is in the military someone who's trained to fly these in Krabi how expensive for those jets when we haven't met about seventy million dollars a piece yeah they don't give those two morons typically not some people in my family would probably argue that point but a better lucky than good it just seems to me that this is for rational people that want to look at this whole UFO objectively you're the type of person that I want to talk to so I was very excited to have you in here so what year was your incident and you have a very very famous incident that's krob corroborated by actual evidence which is one of the rare ones what year was it and where did it take place so as 2004 November 14th of the it's really if you draw San Diego to Ensenada Mexico or about 60 miles off the coast in between the two we're doing work ups so when we get ready to deploy this was for the 2005 deployment we were going at sea for November and December of 2004 so we had been out I'd just taken over the squadron mid-october so I'd been the CEO for a month so we go out and we're putting the Battle Group pieces together so it's not just the the Air Wing but we were you know we're on the carrier we've got the cruiser we've got all support ships out there and we're gonna integrate all the defenses and train as one unit so the exercise we're going to do is an air defense exercise where there's good guys bad guys they're all from internal from the Air Wing so two bad guys today are gonna be the Marines VM fat32 the Red Devils so they're gonna launch and they're gonna go about hundred miles south of the ship and we're the good guys and it's we called a 2v2 so it's two of us against two of them we're going to work with the USS Princeton which is going to be the controller and they're going to control the blue forces and then the red guys are going to give us a presentation that you know they're going to try and intercept so we can stop them from getting up towards the carrier so that's kind of the training set that we're all good so the Marines take off first and they start heading to the South now we have no idea that for two weeks this is the two weeks we've been at sea they've been tracking these things coming out of the sky and when I talked to the Prince controller he's like up to about a dozen of them they would come down from above 80,000 feet they drop down to about 20,000 feet and hang out and then it goes straight back up after about three or four hours so when you say they've been tracking them who specifically this is the USS the Princeton is tracking them they saw him on the Nimitz radar and the e2 could see them so because they're out there you know that radar is on all the time and the spy-1 system on an Aegis Cruiser is you know the state of ours probably was one of the most sophisticated systems in the world so typically when something like this happens and some unexplained phenomenon what do they do in this case that you know if it was if we were in a threat environment they would tell us but they're off the coast of San Diego it doesn't come to the air wing so we have no idea that these things are out there at all so they observe these things and they never bother telling any of you guys that's correct so they just knew that these things had been visiting this area but they just allowed this training exercise to take place anyway yeah talking to him the previous for the two weeks they would show up but it was when we weren't flying so the typical carrier schedule is you know for us it was about noon to midnight it's a 12-hour day there's reasons for that you can go a lot longer they can but for training we just do the 12-hour day thing and it's cyclic ops so you got guys taking off and landing periodically so we were on one of the first goes you know it's you know noon one o'clock somewhere on there and we take off the Marines take off first and my buddy cheeks who's the CEO of the marine squadron was one he was leading the red air they had when he launched off the carrier first they called him up and said hey what do you got on board well the the small the original legacy f-18s don't have as much gas as the super hornets super hornets about thirty percent bigger so they start talking to him about fuel and based on how long we're gonna be airborne and everything else they go hey why don't you just go ahead and proceed to your your cap point and because we had just taken off and that's when the controller had come up and said hey yeah I forget our cost and spread like dealers usually what we went so it'd be like dealer one one this is Princeton control what do you got you know say your loadout kind of chuckled he said I said I got a Kadim nine which is a it's a basically of just a blue metal tube with a seeker head for a name 9ir missile it's a training it doesn't come off the airplane you can beat it with a sledgehammer that's the only way you're gonna get it off or you got to unlock the lugs with a key so I'm like kind of chuckling because well hey we're gonna cancel the training so we're like okay he says we got real-world vector and they're gonna send us out to the west so picture if it's you know if you got a clock the Nimitz is in the middle we're a little bit south of that about forty miles south and then the Marines are about a hundred miles south of the ship about sixty miles between the two of us so as this is all happened in my wingman is joining up all right and these are f-18s so there's two people in each jet so it's me and my WIZO which is weapon systems operator and i've got the other pilot and the weapon systems operator any other jet so they tell us all this hey we're gonna real world vector and they send us out to seven zero about sixty miles away from where we're going so now we're going out even further out to sea we have no idea what we're intercepting and this is when the controller starts talking to us he says hey sir we've seen these objects they've been for two weeks they've been coming down and he's given us the whole story says we need you to go investigate we want to know what these are but they're asking you to investigate in a jet that's unarmed that's correct okay yeah we have no there's reasons for that that we don't fly we typically don't fly with live ordnance unless we're actually going into like a combat zone or we're on a training range and we're gonna shoot something and the reason is you can go through history of the Navy or Air Force if you put live missiles on airplanes and then you start doing training where you're squeezing the trigger someone always messes the switch ology up and someone gets shot down it's happened multiple times so we don't do it you know there's times that we do but it's rare so we start flying out to the west now I want you to think because the other pilot has a you know when you talk to it's good south it was a female when you talk to her it's she hears the kind of goes through the mindset of hey we're off the coast of Mexico real world vector we have no idea we're going to look at probably drug runner cuz you get the drum runners coming up the coast so we're like okay so we drive out and they're calling down ranges so they're telling us hey it's two-seven-zero at 30 miles at 20,000 feet and then it's you know you just count down the ranges and we're talking back and forth the whole time so they got to a point where they say hey merge plot which means radars have resolution cells you know range and asmath of what the radar can actually see once you're inside that box you can't tell the difference between me and the object I'm going in will just become one big blob mmm so they call merge plot and so the other jet is on my left-hand side and we're gonna and I'm going to go to a clock code to make it simple so the object we're going to end up looking for is then right in the middle of the clock and we are at the six o'clock position and my wingman is off to my left side so it's she's further down with her widow so as we're looking around we we look to the right and there's a it was yesterday there's a perfect example out here that water is perfectly calm no Whitecaps I mean it's literally a perfect San Diego California day and we see white water it's something like if you see a seamount you know rock underwater when you're standing on the shore and the waves are breaking over and you're like what is that it's usually because there's a rock under the water so it looks like that but it's about the size of a 737 it actually kind of has a shape of like a cross and it's pointing to the east so you've got the long part going east-west and you got a couple of things going north and south so as we're looking at it cuz that kind of draws our eyes we're like oh that's kind of odd we look down and whiz oh and the other airplane comes up and says hey skipper do you and that's about what he gets out of his mouth and I'm kind of looking at the same thing I go dude you see that what is that thing and what we see is this white tic-tac looking object just above the surface of the water pointing north-south and it's going north south east west it's just radically moving forward back left right at will and it's moving around the disturbance the white water that we see how big is this thing over time it's about 40 feet long and the way I asked to mate that is I mean I got a lot of time fighting other airplanes so it's about lot size of a Hornet fuselage so that's why you say forty feet this thing's just going left so the first thing you see when you look down you go and this is with our eyes it's not sensors right so we're looking down at this thing and first thing you think is helicopter right there are the helicopters typically stay below 200 feet when we're out there and they're just driving around we're pretty far away from the ship for a helicopter for one of ours so what is it so the first thing you look for is rotor wash you know if you've watched any TV show that starts kicking the water up and you can see that it's really easy to see from the air so we're like no rotor wash matter of fact don't see any rotors don't see any tail rotor don't see any you know the main rotors or like that's kind of weird so as we're driving around we're looking at this thing we get to about the nine o'clock position how far away are you from this thing I'm at 20,000 feet and it's right down on the surface - right off our right side so I'm probably maybe a couple miles lateral and 20,000 feet and we're just watching it move around and so it's very small in your eyes um not overly smarmy and airplane down that low it's 40 feet it was pretty clear so I'm like okay so I said I'm gonna go check it out that's what we're trained to do the other pilot says hey I'm the stay up here and I'm like that's perfect so now we'll get some separation we'll get it from different views and the other airplane will act kind of a God's eye view everything that's going on as I go down and check this thing out so I start driving around and it's still doing its Ford back left right it's still pointing north south we get to about the 12 o'clock position I'm just in a nice easy descent a reason you know because I've been asked how can you go more aggressive you can but when you're out over water the water looks the same at 20,000 feet it does it 2,000 feet you don't you know yeah so you can easily put yourself in a non recoverable position if you're not paying attention and you go into the water so I got this nice you just send I get to about 12 o'clock and as I'm coming down you know I could guess probably about you know 18,000 feet now a couple thousand feet below the other airplane the tic-tac just kind of rapidly goes and turns so now it's kind of point east-west and now it mirrors us so it's above the surface or up high we're coming down it starts coming up well this is getting interesting so we kind of drive all the way around a circle I'm descending it's coming up and I get over to about the eight o'clock position of the on a clock and it's over at about the two o'clock position well the quickest way as we know as kids to get someone you know you can keep going around the circle nothing's going to happen you cut across the circle some about I don't know pry two to three thousand feet above it and I just kind of drop my nose aggressively and I cut across the circle and it's coming this way because I'm trying to fly to where it's gonna be because I want to join on it I want to see how close I can get to right and as I'm pulling up it's kind of starting to cross my nose and it starts to accelerate and within about less than a second as I start to pull nose onto it and it crosses right in front of me it just goes poof and it's gone so I call the other airplane I said hey you guys you guys see that thing and they're like sure it's gone we don't see it at all so I'm like okay that's kind of weird so we don't see it we're looking at the same time I say hey let's turn around and let's go back to see what was in the water you know there's was there something there so we turn around right there we haven't gone anywhere it's gone waters perfectly there's no white water nothing it's just blue like okay so we turned back around now we're heading back out towards the east and I tell the controller I said well I said you know first said I'm kind of weirded out and I told my my backseater that we start heading back and the controller on the Princeton comes at me says sir you're not going to believe this but that thing is back at your cat point that was our original point where we were gonna hold 40 miles south of the ship so this thing is went from wherever we were at - it's kind of about 60 miles in you know maybe 30 40 seconds it's already over there and it just and they didn't track it it just appeared he just shows back up on their radar and they go it's here so we're like okay so we fly back we don't see it we don't see it on our radar we don't see it on any of our sensors we do like two runs and we come back to the ship and land so as we're in our it's we call it the PR shop we're taking off our flight gear one of my crews is getting ready to go out and I think they were going to be on a tanker mission but they had a targeting pod on board so they launched off and we're tell him about this before and I in the back seat er Chad says he's really determined he's gonna find this thing so he tells the pilot hey we're gonna find this thing so turns out driving around and in the back seat of a Super Hornet there's no stick but there's side stick controllers and they're to control the sensors because that's what the weapons systems guys do and they can change displays really fast by just hitting a button and will flip from the radar to the targeting pod and the way the system actually works is when you see something on the radar and you designate it as your primary target all the other sensors will look at that point so it's everything's kind of synced together so he picks up a hit on his radar and he goes to lock it up because I watched all the tapes he goes to lock it up and immediately the radar can tell it gets signals back that it's being jammed so and technically jamming is an act of war it starts jamming the radar goes into a jam extrapolate a bunch of stuff happens on the scope well he's smart enough to castle to his targeting pod and he takes a passive track and that's the video that you see of the tic-tac where it's just sitting in the middle screen real quiet so he does that and he and he goes through if you watch the video if we had and I'd go through it with you but they go through all the different modes so he goes it's an IR and an EO EO as TV it's black and white TV camera we do we can get the video right online yes let's get the video Jimmy where would you can't show it to anybody we can't we can't show it on YouTube but you can see it and people will be able to go to it you know what we'll do go to the video and we'll tell people when we're starting and we'll tell people with the title of the video that you get to is and they can sync it up themselves if they're watching it it's publicly owned it's you know American government right so it is actually something in the public domain so you think we could play it on YouTube and not get cold yeah a hundred percent you think so Jamie it's a government those things I would say yes we should be able to but sometimes those things get messy so let's take a genius okay let's take a chance with this one I know if you go if you're on a New York Times article there's a link to it it's had it gone really YouTube is crazy with copyright stuff and we've always been like two steps away from getting pulled off YouTube completely it's a real disaster it's understand from their perspective there's a lot of legal issues they have to deal with but I have it on a private server I could maybe send Jamie the issue I'd believe though is the actual copyright of the video itself oh it's just it's um Pentagon Pentagon released Public Enemy and the Pentagon's can come after us I don't think so either you find it I want to find a good version of the video that doesn't have somebody Jeremy I'm watermark version please look it up the sons of Jeremy over to us I have to figure out how to send it to you right here give me in a second do you have air drop what did you hear drop yeah but I got it on a bit pay I got it on a page a private page they can send Jamie oh yeah okay okay Jeff Jamie's uh info no okay I'll figure it out Lee says to me and I'll send to him okay that's pretty easy sorry to disrupt the momentum no but I think this it's probably important to be able to have this the the video itself so you could just talk about it and we're about to yank it up here okay Jamie wrote it down for you there you go give me a second to get it okay and for people don't know Jeremy also produced bob lazar area 51 in flying saucers and he was in here when we had bob lazar in talked about Bob's experience and Jesus if that wasn't a game-changer for me and for a lot of other people this is a subject that it's so easy to mock you know this is why I think it's so important that we talk to people like you because like I said just your average everyday UFO crackpot they believe everything in anything have you did you have you ever had any UFO experiences before this know the irony and I tell this story my mother in law shall be listening she she literally every time I would go home she would ask me hey did you see UFO do you see if you haven't I'd be like no when I first started dating my wife she was a big like National Enquirer she had all the you know supermarket tabloids and I would always just feed her crap for it so I this happens and you know and I'm I never say a word so my friends all knew it was a great story over beers cuz they go hey what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying I go I chased a UFO and they go seriously and I tell them the store and they're like dude I go yeah so I go home and and I got got asked by Lou Elizondo to do the New York Times article which as like anything else I always say no like it took a bunch of times to get me on your show Jeremy kept asking asking asking and it was Thank You Jeremy Mike yeah yeah I thank my contractor's wife angel who we were to party drinking and she goes we got to do Rogan I go what she goes it's the biggest podcast on the planet she goes you got to do it and I go alright I'm gonna do it just for you I want to do this show a shout-out to angel yeah from New Hampshire so so my mother-in-law we're sitting there and I know the New York Times article is gonna come out and as I was at Thanksgiving in 20 when there were a come on seventeen so it's Thanksgiving in 2017 I never wanted to kind of left the house that's just my wife and my in-laws a couple I was sitting in the kitchen and I said hey I got to tell you guys this they said what I said there's gonna be this article comes out in the New York Times and I'm in it and they're like yeah go well I chased a UFO my mother-in-law is like haha she looks at my father-in-law he's rolling his eyes looking at me like are you serious and I go yeah yeah and and she's like you never told us I got never really told anyone I mean my wife and kids knew the event happened but they didn't have all the details cuz there's just one of those things we just didn't I just didn't get into is it classified no was it at any point in time no a lot of rumors out there that I was classified and the ship got locked down no it wasn't it was we were never men in suits did not show up no one told us not to talk about it and this is because there's a lot of other people saying other things and I said this look at it that here's the context so in the battle group you've got the Admiral you got the captain of the ship the captain of the Princeton and then you've got the other COS so in position wise I'm probably as a CEO of a squadron in the top 20 out of 6,000 and no one came to talk to me no one came to take my tapes no one showed up in a suit no one told me not to talk no one talked to any of my aircrew that were involved in this all there's six people total involved the two they shot the video on the four of us that looked at it for five minutes with our eyes knowing nothing it just and I can get into how that you know there's a report that that George Knapp got released it's a I call it the unofficial official report and I had met someone and I'm like hey can you find any I had this incident normally you tell people this they look at you like dude what are you smoking I'm like no no I'm good I'm tested and they go and and they said well let me see what I can do and I had got a call I was working I was doing some aerospace work and I had gotten a call my cell phone from a guy and he said hey I want to investigate your incident and I go okay so he did he investigated the incident and it was very very thorough I mean if you've read that it's about 10 pages long and he yeah I mean he tracked down everybody he tracked down all the people that were the aircrew that were involved he talked to he tracked down the Admiral he talked you mean he it was a pretty thorough report and I don't think anything of it you know because you know the the people who weren't it's out there so they want to do FOIA but it was never released in a FOIA request I actually had the Navy call me I'd been out of the Navy for like six years and what's explain to people that means freedom moved infrequently so I got called by a public affairs person from the Navy and said hey is this commander forever I said yeah they said hey do you know of any documentation on your UFO incident off the Nimitz and I said official and she said yeah I said no because I knew the rapport existed but to me it was an unofficial because I didn't know who were when I and I had a copy of it but because it wasn't official well then years later I find out that the guy who actually did the report was part of the a tip team and I was talking to Lou Elizondo who runs that program and Lou showed me the documentation of the original I think is like 13 people that were part of a tip and they were fully exempt and I'm like well that's kind of well hey I know that guy he's a guy that did the report which is why it never ever came out no George got his hands on how does something Freedom of Information Act exempt obviously DoD has the ability because I'm a I'm not a conspiracy theory person at all I mean I'll just tell you that you know I think there's reasons that the government doesn't tell the public everything and I don't speak for the government but I think there's a good reason for that that not everything needs to go out to the public but most of it does and they just what they do is I put a clause on hey for this program or whatever we're doing which would been an a-type program the work that they do and what they find is not it's not releasable through Freedom of Information Act there's probably other avenues to get that you know and then you go well what really is freedom information because I got into this sauna I was talking to someone who's a conspiracy theorist and they said well so and so wrote and they're not getting any information on your event I said so what are they gonna do they're gonna call up you're gonna put in your request for for freedom information you go here's what I want it goes to some poor guy at the Pentagon who's like I have no idea what this is and he searches around he doesn't find anything he looks at his bud and I gain all for you I go hey Joe you got anything on the Nimitz incident you go oh I go okay well I didn't find anything I looked I did my due diligence but I'm not gonna spend the next six months of my life doing your research project for you right so you get nothing and then you assume the government's covering up when they go that really isn't they just you know the guys are doing the research doesn't know where it's had or nice access to it makes sense um Jamie we have the video okay here we go now explain what what is what are we seeing why we seeing it in this this particular cat the don't on the top left corner na R is narrow field of view which is zoomed in IR at the top middle it means it's an infrared mode so instead of seeing color you're seeing temperature variations and these things are extremely sensitive to in like tents of degrees they will tell you the difference so it'll go from black to white so in this case white is hot so if you look down on the bottom left corner it says WH T mm that's white it means white is hot so the object that you're looking at is hotter than the sky around it but we also notice is there's no plumes not if you're looking at an airplane when you get closer you'll actually see the exhaust coming out and there will be a really glowing plume that's important as we look at the video and then most of the stuff on here you really don't need to know what you can look at is the bottom right corner it says $19,990 tude and if you look up in the little words or it says HD G and then B alt B it's autopilot so it's on altitude hold it's just flying for that so you can go ahead and play the video and so those two bars next to the white object that's a that's a that's a passive track so what he's done is he's commanded the FLIR to track that so what the system does is it uses its actually tracking it can track pixels and it's just basically blocked those hot pixels those white pixels from the black ones and you're gonna see now pause it real quick so it over the top see it went to a white screen with the black object this is a black and white TV mode and even look at the top says TV so narrow in TV mode is actually you can get closer than narrow and IR it's literally narrow in IR is about medium and TV mode so there's you can get closer with the TV mode so as you look at it now in this case you would actually start to see stuff going on and even in TV mode because you get exhaust you know the black exhaust that comes out he'll usually be able to see kind of some of that coming out the back and you don't see anything this thing's just sitting there and if you look at the the top where it says three right that's the pot is looking three degrees right on the nose of the airplane right so he's just flying along the bottom numbers don't worry those are time so it's 41 56 so go ahead and hit play and what what he's doing is he's going Chad's going through all the different modes cuz he's like oh I got it and he's gonna try and see the best video you can get now there's rumors that this video is like 10 minutes long know what you're looking at is the entire video now notice where it says 99.9 mm-hmm so hit pause real quick what that means is the why he's got the pod the targeting pod because that's his primary sensor right now the radar still trying to look at this object and trying to range it and the radar can't get ranging on it so the object is doing something to say I'm not giving you back because it's just a Doppler radar just like a police radar as a Doppler it's trying to get arranging on you and it can't do it so when it says 99.9 the radar cannot see this object right now mmm it's not allowing it to get ranging and I think that's super important Dave the way he explained it to me active jamming compared to passive jamming this is a technology that is actively jamming this system rather than something like stealth aircraft which is the shape and texture of the yeah it's because I one thinks stealth is invisible it's not it's it's just it's a technology to to basically make it harder for radars to see you you know and that's the whole thing you know if you look at you know airplanes that are knows on are harder to see than airplanes at the sides kind of like think of a barn door if you're looking at the whole barn door it's really easy see if I turn the barn door sideways works really thin it's gonna be a lot harder for you to see it guys so that's it that's the easiest most basic way to look at this so keep going you can play again and you can look to the airplane is still sitting at 20,000 feet it's doing 250 knots he's gonna go through different modes and try and lock it and it's just kind of sitting in all of a sudden as the video goes on I think it's a minute and a half long see it's going to try and reacquire it Rhys enters the pod so it's it's slowly drifting to the left the the Hornet is still going the same heading it's just kind of hanging out and they're just filming this thing and I when they get close it's gonna zing off the left-hand side when you see it on a full because it's you know you think digital you'd be able to get a one-for-one copy I'm like you know when you copy your album to a cassette you know you lose a little quality well you still do in digital world and they're off it goes to the left and that's pretty fast to leave that field of view on the when we have big monitors that we look at these when they come back so we're looking at the original tapes so they the end of that again please Jamie so when it's taking off how fat when when it just sort of like leaves the field of view and takes off to the left how fast is that going I would say pretty fast it's an estimate if we had ranging you know you could obviously view the triangle and go hey because we know how big the field of view is but for something to leave the field of view that fast with the pod just staring is pretty fast I mean it just it's like out of here like nothing that we have no because we can't I don't care what airplane is so let's just use the f-22 Raptor that's probably one of the it's probably the best airplane in the world right now performance wise it can't take off like that especially if it's a hover I mean you're talking something that's just sitting in space in the wind and then it just all of a sudden accelerates airplanes don't work that way and it's not leaving any exhaust plume no notice there's none and when you go back to geography n even in the IR you don't yes here's IR zoomed in and there's no you would see a plume if that was an airplane it's creepy how it takes off yeah with active jamming it's intelligently controlled there's no rotors there's no plumes there's no exhaust there's no tail fin there's no tail number this thing goes from a standstill takes off it's a propulsion system we don't have in our inventory and no other nation does that's how it's understood by the government now that that's say if the fastest plane on earth was trying to do that same maneuver this system would be able to track it yeah well yeah we'd stay with it until it got to the limits of the pod you know as far as looking to the left but right and you know the radar would see it I mean we get get close enough you're gonna you know everything becomes visible because you get burned through with radar and how how radars actually work this one is you know you tell me but this was performance beyond I mean it's like when we saw it disappear when it flew in front of my nose I'm talking something I'm within a half mile of it looking at it and it gets in front of me and just disappears so take we'll just go to something that everyone knows as fast let's just say sr-71 that's doing Mach 3 you know the visibilities fifty miles so even at 35 miles a minute I'm gonna be able to see this thing turn into a little dot as it goes off into the horizon for a probably a minute the thing that we saw disappeared in a second just gone and that's from two different angles remember the other airplanes 8,000 feet above me because we we get close to at about 12,000 feet so the other airplanes above me looking down and when it disappeared I said you guys see it they said no it's gone they just literally was poof now when you came back and what do you do with this information do you report it do you talk to people about it so the typical process any time we fly everything gets debrie so because it was a two-seat airplane usually the junior person then the jet goes down so I was the boss so I wasn't going down there so we have a thing called Civic c VI C which is the carrier Intel Center so they go down we always take our tapes because we record stuff when we're fighting they take it down and it's really to exercise the system when we're in training so that when we actually get over to in this case we are going over to the Persian Gulf you know anything that we do comes in and gets debriefing then it all gets sent off that's how you get the CNN video and all that so they go down and a debrief and I have to tell hey we we chase this object we don't know what it is you know and of course everyone now is gonna make jokes because we know we're gonna catch shit because that's how the Navy works you know and I told him I said I remember telling the guy in my back seat I said dude you know we're gonna catch maximum shit for this and he goes yes sir I'll show you the comics I have him on my phone we do the airplane comes out so we know it's gonna come down so he goes any day debrief this both crews going in and of course everyone at Intel thinks this is hilarious so the flight the you know Chad comes in with his tapes you know and when he lands and there's the thing yeah vfa 41 ha ha guys see any UFOs out there and he pulls out that tape and drops it on the counter he goes yeah it's on here so they're like oh shit so they copy it they play it and there's a big it looks like a rack system they put the eight mil in it gets copied to a hard drive and then they they archive it so you go okay so I got this video and then you know the ship spreads you know if you have a room around the ship 5,000 people are gonna know about it within probably thirty minutes I mean it spreads that it's like a virus so the whole ship now knows that we chased this I guarantee the whole Princeton knew this stuff was going on and it goes all the way up the Admiral knows about it the captain of the ship knew about it and and then all the movies because we have they play movies for us on the ship and they run like a 12 hour loops of course the movie selection is men and black men and black two signs Independence Day and and we know we're gonna be on the airplane comet because there's always a comic so you do some stupid or like this then you're gonna be on the comm I'll show you the comics here a little bit oh they're pretty funny but you know so that went on for two days but you know we're in the middle of work ups I got a squadron to run so it's like you know there was after about the first day and a half early died down and then it was there's always that closet people that you don't think that it really like UFO buffs and you know like we had one on one like one of the Marines would always come and eat sit down hey hey skipper can I sit with you okay you want to talk about the UFO he goes yeah I just I can't get it out of my mind and then we would just sit there and talk about it you know and to me it was like you know we're just saying you know my entire now flying career is defined by five minutes of chasing this white tic-tac vice almost 4,000 hours you know flying so now did you encounter anyone else that had a similar experience I've talked to the guys a couple of guys from the East Coast event the gimbal video mm-hmm one of them I talked to you daily he's pretty good friend of mine totally different now keep in mind ours is 2004 the gimbal video is 2015 the funny part about the gimbal video and the East Coast stuff that was going on because that's off the vacate so off the coast of the United States sir they're called warning areas and all they are is their if you look out of aviation map they're these big areas that are blocked off by blue and they say like whiskey 291 or whiskey 243 and is the gimbal video available in the same way that that video is available yes yeah okay so and I was talking to him about it cuz I asked a buddy of mine he was just retired he was the he led two fighter wing on the East Coast night called him up because we start finding out that these things were so prevalent out off the east coast the United States and there's a couple of them so there's the we're going to talk what they started seeing originally was these things and one of them almost hit the airplane almost hit one of these things but it looks like a cube inside of a clear beach ball so they don't know if it's actually like a surrounding or it's you don't know if it's a force field and you see kind of in the gimbal via video it's got like an aura around it where ours didn't I always laugh I go ours was tic-tac these are not that means there's different stuff out there that we don't know but they had two airplanes flying and we fly when we go out to to Train we're usually we have a distance you know we'll just say we're you know ma mile apart as we're flying out so they're flying out and they're you know the airplanes are deployed we caught combat spread and one of the airplanes almost hits one these goes close down like 50 feet down the side and almost hits one of these floating cubes inside of the beach ball and if someone goes out like it's a it's a balloon it's not a balloon I mean these things are literally sitting still they're there no effect from the winds so if you got 90 knots of wind and they talk about it these things are just sitting there so 60 or 70 people at see it because the radars the the newer radar in the super hornets is extremely extremely capable okay and at first when they started seeing stuff they were like that's just like maybe it's the radar just give me a false target and that really doesn't give false targets and then someone did exactly what Chad did is they threw their targeting flare out there and all of a sudden you see a heat signature there's a return there's obviously something out where that blip is at what is a targeting flare that's a we caught the 80 flares it's an advanced targeting flirts it's on the left side of the airplane and it's launched it like a flare no no it's a it's a FLIR forward-looking infrared receiver so it's when you see the bombs blowing up on TV and it's that looks like a black and white and you see it's like that's the targeting pod okay it's got a laser in it it's got an IR marker in it it's it's a very capable system that syncs up to this to the Hornet so everything kind of marries oh so this is the go-fast now this is go fast no it's the other one it's the was like that what is that that's called the go fast that looks like a tic-tac and I was another one taking off the East Coast but they grabbed it and Mark that one it's going it's screaming across the ocean at a very high rate of speed and there's been some debunkers that say well it's really not going that fast it's just the way the airplane is and how the mechanics of the Potter work and when you talk to the crew cuz it's actually I could ask my bud I'm pretty sure it's the same back cedar took both of these videos took the go-fast video and took the gimbal video and my buddy was on the flight with the gimbal video but they these things that I call my buddies I'm like hey how many people are seeing these things I got like 60 or 70 60 or 60 or 70 people had seen these things on radar and I said well what do you do and they said well we put out a note AM which is a notice to Airmen that just says hey these things are out there so just be careful because we don't want you to hit one yeah and it's kind of like our shego because you would ask you know who do you tell well everyone knows well what do you do and I said well because it was all white and it didn't have any markings on it and it didn't have any wings and it didn't have any rotors and it was just outperformed anything that we have yeah I think if I would have painted China or Russia on the side is this the gimbal video yes okay so it's the same pod in the beginning Jamie what we're looking at and when the crew finds it now what you're not seeing you're seeing it targeting when you hear them start talking when you listen to the video you'll hear the guy go dude look they're all over look at the SA page so we have a situation awareness page and whatever the radar is getting returns on it'll show up it's kind of like our God's eye view in the airplane so the pod can only look at one thing so he designates that as his primary target so that's where the pod is there the radar still seeing everything else so what they're actually seeing this video is what you're when you see that the object that he's tracking when I was talking to one of the other pods he said there's actually when you see the radar video there's like a it almost looks like a formation in front of them like five smaller ones that are moving in front of it and then they turn so like a formation these things turns and starts going the other way and then again while they're filming the gimbal video and that's kind of the comms when you hear it dude holy cow look they're all over this is unreported new information that he's actually saying right now everybody knows this video this is the one that they say turns like the Lazar craft like belly-first however what he's telling you right now is something that is not public yet he's telling you that there was a V formation of other objects that the public has yet to see you're not going to you're not going to the radar tape but I'm not gonna there were more objects surrounding this is what he's telling you right now which is fascinating because the world doesn't know that yet just so you know I mean that's brand-new that's never been reported by a New York Times anybody okay so you go ahead play so the cool thing with this is that you know when he goes into so he's an IR IR mode right now you're still seeing no plume he's looking 47 so they're actually turning into it so it's starting to pull it back towards the nose see how the number at the top is decreasing and it's against the wind now he's in TV mode and this thing's gonna just start to run you can kind of see it's got that aura around it mm-hmm he said they were saying that the the ones with the squares inside that looked like the beach ball were the same and this thing is just hanging out so it's on the airplanes on the left-hand turn and it's so now it's right in front yeah it's it's just rotating no this is how Lazare described you know Lazar described that that these things would lay flat and then when they would travel they would turn up on their side mhm and that's that's how they maneuvered so this is very similar eerily similar to the propulsion system that Lazar talked about and that's why this video we're seeing it very differently now especially with what we know about Lazar but the idea is that it would fly belly-first in high-speed mode so if they have these are gravity propel this is something that's known within the government they're trying to back engineer they're trying to understand it we know there's a program currently that they said is is gone however it is currently active to study this these things will turn belly first the saucer type looking ones and then that's the high speed mode because they focus of allegedly you know these gravity wave amplifiers look this thing turns mechanically there again no typical form of propulsion as an expert is telling you this is not a glitch this is seen by multiple radars multiple people commander freighter was so close to it this is something that is not aerodynamic and it could move in ways and fashions when he's underplaying it when we first talked the idea of this thing going up up up up up up it's instantaneous acceleration back and forth there's no slowing down no turning like a ping-pong ball he said to me our first talk ping-pong ball in a in a glass nothing moves like that with traditional reactionary propulsion somebody has technology that we don't have in our inventory at all so this is counter-intuitive the way it goes from being aerodynamic to being uh narrow dynamic when it goes sideways and flies belly forward that's correct it's well it's not it's you know if you talk because I was just talking that guy the other day and he said the the irony with is these things would be out there for hours we don't have you know a high-performance airplane does not have hours where the gas I mean you know Hornets we if we don't have area we're feeling you know and we're actually out doing a mission and fighting and going fast you know you're talking hour and a half and you're coming back to land some airplanes are even less you know based on their size you know so if like an f-16 doesn't have external fuel tanks it doesn't have a lot of gas and the Soviet airplanes are the same way the mig-29 does not have a lot of gas the su-27 sweet 30s because of weight because it's weight performance size of the airplane so you know even even our intercontinental bombers like b2 they still take off and they error or fuel they keep topped off so they can get to range that's how we extend things you got something like this that's coming down you know just think of the physics so just you know I'll use my instant because that's the one I really know the best is you've got an object coming from above eighty thousand feet so I'll just tell you that eighty thousand it's somewhere around seventy eighty thousand feet is where you can actually start to see the curvature of the earth you know so that's considered space so they're coming from above that they're coming straight down they stop at around twenty thousand feet they hang out for three hours and then they go straight back up so and I know you had a lot on the show so SpaceX is really excited because they can launch a rocket and then they can have the booster come back to earth and actually land on a pad very impressive engineering feat next to this technology that's like a Model T next to a Porsche I mean it's like wow really that's it you know and you got something that can just at will and move around now take it to the next level and I know this is there's a lot of talk about this so think is going to go into speculation mode but when you take a shape like that so just take the tic-tac shape which is shaped like a submarine if you're if you're using a propulsion that's non reactive where you're just manipulating the median that you're in err whatever you can go into the water so when you hear the all the reports of hey we've seen these things since you know World War two that would come out of the water and fly if you have a technology like this as long as the object is sealed where you're not going to get water inside of it there's nothing that says you can't do that because all you're doing is you're not you know where a jet engine sucks in air and blows it out the back or a propeller actually pushes the water it's a force now you've got something that's actually manipulating the gravity field and it's just moving through a void then it doesn't then air you could literally in theory fly go into the ocean cruise around pop back up fly around go to space you're nothing you you remove the barriers of the normal propulsion that we have today there's been many instances of sightings off the coast of California of things that plunge into the water or escape from the water and take off into space so yeah the with this field propulsion system as commander favors describing as Lazar described it doesn't matter the medium of space air or water there's no resistance no splash and this goes back to you know when Christopher Columbus reported a UFO sighting he did oh yeah did this idea that so this has been around anyway this idea boom that you can go through these different mediums will pause for a second Christopher Columbus at a UFO sorry yeah it's it's a written account so it's like find that no video it's bullshit Leslie but that's what's so cool so commander framers encounter it's not the most documented it's not the most dramatic however it has had the most impact out of any sighting because of his credibility and the mere fact that the the New York Times picked it up with video footage radar evidence and somebody who is as credible as commander forever it has changed the dynamic of the way people the government responds new Navy protocols because of commander flavor coming forward there are there's closed-door congressional and Senate briefings he's been part of them he's admitted that before there's a new study about UFOs because of this encounter it's so much evidence has so much power to it compared to other ones the Christopher Columbus great cool story somebody wrote it down who news who knows if he even wrote it down we have highly documented cases this one has changed our culture and that's what's so cool people are talking about it differently so here's this is a good story this is true so sitting at home and usually when people try and find me they get my wife cell phone because it's the first one on the cell phone ville and it's on my name so I get I see this call from California and I'm like you normally don't answer them and it's her phone like whose call my wife because that is me so I answer it and this lady says hey is commander forever there and I go who's calling she goes well I'd like to talk to him at her forever I go who's calling she says hi I'm a 79 year old woman and I would just like to tell him my story I go you're talking to him and she goes I've never in my life told anyone this she goes my I grew up my dad was in the Navy she goes I was he was stationed in Rhode Island at first when she was a child she said we were walking her and her mom while walking on the beach and they saw these weird lights so that kind of got her into that Oh UFOs she goes few years later they had moved to San Francisco so I imagine Treasure Island because at her age that would have been you know right in the 50s her dad was shit her dad is working as a Navy liaison to the agency and he came home one day and he had a telegram in his hand and she goes for some reason he let me read it she's told me this story and I said well what did say she says it was it basically said hey unidentified objects going in and out of the water and it had a latitude and longitude in it and he looked at her she goes and I'm a child I always remember that she says he looked at me and said we get these all the time and it's always in the same area and I go of course I go well you got the telegram she goes of course not he had to take it back to work I said you don't have to remember that latitude/longitude she said no she goes but you seem to be so credible and believable she goes I wanted to tell someone the story that I've never told anyone in my life so that's what you're starting to see is people that you know very credible they're not you know they're not they're not crazy they're not making stuff up but they're coming out and going hey I've had these experience and I've got a lot of that from for over the last two years where people just find my email and send me stuff saying hey this happened to me I saw this and and there's some things are explainable because I got asked to tell this so because we're kind of I have a sixth sense of humor at times so like I said I had all these koala we used to fly they don't do it right now because it's a little bit dangerous but we used to fly night-vision goggles low altitude in Hornets all right so when you put on night-vision goggles they amplify light like a lot so you can see a campfire like 50 miles away so we used to do it the good spots were down in like al central California there's a range that there's some bombing ranges but people go camping in the Superstition Mountains which is a kind of north and west of Imperial by I forget what it is the springs it's real pretty in a desert it'll come to me in a minute so we even go out at night flying around on goggles and you'd see a campfire and you go up UFO time and then you get the airplane going about 600 knots and then you pull the power back to idle so you can't hear it and you get zing in towards the fire well you turn the lights are all now because we're in restricted area so we can do that and there's lights on it that you can only see if you're on night-vision goggles so the other airplanes can see us but no one else can see us you go zing and at it and then right when you get to the campfire you pull the airplane into the vertical yes stroke the afterburners you let them light off you count to three to pull them off and then you just go away instant UFO reporting I'm sitting out in the desert it's all quiet and all of a sudden there's a lure there's lights in the sky and they go away and it's gone like you would do that just to fuck with campers yes yes I did not the only one who did it but like I said we have a sixth sense of humor yes so so some things are explainable because I guarantee there were phone calls made on some of the stuff that we did and I guarantee you're not the only one who's ever done that I know I'm not yeah I'm not that creative but it's just you know you think about it you go because people go I saw this or I saw that because I've got stuff like that and I go yeah I used to create stuff like that just not toes do you are you Jeremy I'm sure you're aware of this the footage from the the Mexican Air Force yeah yeah very aware that what do you think about that well again it's it's IR footage which is really interesting they actually got the cameras for runners right so you you can see in the infrared so it's beyond the observable you know I I myself have not detailed looked at the footage however FLIR experts and people that work with NSA have looked at it for me and they these are not lights in the distance these are craft very similar to what commander favor talks about without plumes without heat signatures you know non-traditional field propulsion systems we don't have that I thought they tried to assist it right here it's just a mexican air force footage yeah so they tried to say these were lights on like an oil rig out in the water that's been diba you say was a fire mm to the comcast video of the year was the mexican air force tracking like six so literally right after our incident I come and we come back and I think we were getting ready to go to fallon and i'm i had comcast and that the homepage comes up and there's this video and i go holy cow that looks like what we chased and it was like six of these things and they were tracking them in the same area two right off the coast Ensenada and it's not as rare there's now admitted and increased frequency the pentagon spokeswoman finally went off-script i was tracking the scripts for the last two years of what pentagon spokespeople say about commander favors experience someone went off script last week in the new york times and she admitted there's an increased frequency of near misses because of these a AVS anomalous aerospace vehicles so it's pretty astounding we're getting all these kind of revelatory moments in these little seeds that these are not ours we don't have this even Elan doesn't have this I mean this is a propulsion system unlike anything we have it's amazing it's gravity propelled now that gimbal footage when it said that there's a fleet of them how far away are those guys where you're seeing you don't see the individual objects you only see a singular spot well the pod is you know when you get pretty narrow it'd be like you know if I put three people around you I can look at you and not see the other people so that's what the pod is doing but the radar is seeing everything because it's a it has a nice array dharna which is an active electronically scanned array so instead of like the radars we had which did the mechanical you know doing this like old-school this thing is just a panel that sits in the front of the airplane and through beam sharing beam's shaping it can move and it can look all over so we used to have what was called trackball scans so we would be able to track a target why we're still scanning this thing has scan law but it scans while tracks so it it literally if it sees you if the radar sees you it has basically a weapons quality solution then it can do that on multiple targets is that's how it that's the same way that the spy radar the aegis system works on the cruisers they can track multiple targets and have weapons quality on all these different targets while it's still scanning a volume so in that image you're seeing one individual object but there's other objects yes the radar is seeing the object that the pod is looking at where they're talking and when you hear the video you hear the the pilot say dude look at the sa page there's there's a whole fleet of them so what they're seeing is the the the pod is looking at the main that's the bigger object at the gimbal the thing that's rotating on the screen and there's five smaller things in front so this thing's just sitting there and then they kind of he said they turn around on this on the radar and start going the other way while the pods looking at this guy just kind of rotating so like a mothership and smaller aircraft could be something along those lines is there video of those smaller aircrafts are just the venom of the one large the only thing they have is that the targeting pod I would highly doubt even if they had the video that they're gonna release the radar video because of classification levels are you able to tell the story you told me about what was underwater with your your other buddy because is that okay yeah yeah so it remains you know people come out of the woodwork when they figure out you feni's because now they don't feel alone so I was working I'd worked I still do it but I was doing oil and gas at the time on a contract and one of the guys the story came out and he was a Navy helicopter pilot and he comes in he comes in he goes Dee can I talk to you man I go what am I guess I gotta talk to you I said what do you wanna talk to me about he says dude you know your UFO he said yeah he goes I had a similar experience I said what's that he said he was flying ch-53 s which is a big lift heavy lift that the Marine Corps uses and the Navy uses it for certain things and when they go off of for the East Coast they do a lot of shooting off of at the time it was off of Puerto Rico we had Roosevelt roads that they ended up close and but he was flying out of there and you know you got super clear Caribbean water and they have these things called beak um as they fly around and when they're all done because they'll fly towards the ships and the ship can sorry about that they can track with the radar and then they also do in a like the ships or submarines shoot torpedoes there they're called telemetry rounds so they have they gather all the data on what the torpedo or is doing underwater and then they blow ballast and this thing will come to the surface and float and then they go pick them up and then they can extract all the data out of them so they do it for both so he said the first time they're out and they're gonna pick up his beak um and those things when they're flying they're done a parachute comes out and they gotta go they hook it up the helo drops a swimmer in the water he goes and hooks this whole thing up then they hoist the whole thing up and fly back and then they extract it in so he says he's sitting in the front you know in helicopters there's you know c-53 you can actually see down by your feet you know just like typical like you got a Hawaiian ride so because you can see when you're touching down so you got really good visibility out of those things and you can stick your head out the window too because you're just gonna hang it out he says he's going on there and they're getting this thing hooked up and as he's looking down you know cuz they're I don't know what fifty feet above the water he sees kind of this dark mass coming up from the depths and they starting to hoist the the diver up and he's got they've gotten a beak um and as they hoist it up he says and he's looking at the single and what the hell is that and then it just goes back down underwater it's just like once they pulled a kid in the beak um out of the water this object descends back into the deficit so he thinks well I was pretty weird so he goes out he says not too long later you know a few months later he's out he's picking up a torpedo so he says they got the they hooked the diver up on the winch and they're lowering him in and he's looking down he sees this big massive because it's not a submarine he's seen submarines before once you see a submarine he can't confuse it with something else this big object you know kind of circular says it's coming up from the depths and he starts screaming to through the intercom system to tell him to pull the diver up and the divers like Fifi from the water so they've reversed the winch and the divers thinkin what the hell's going on and he's getting pulled up and all of a sudden he said the torpedo just got sucked down underwater and the object just descended back down into the depths and they never occurred that that torpedoes Jesus and this happened in the late 90s late mid to late 90s thank you I can pray get in touch with him and ask him and he told me this story and I'm like how do you report that you come in and go well where'd the torpedo go I just got sucked down they just went down you know and then you get to people that attribute it as I something happened when it blew ballasts and it just took on water and sink and he's like it didn't sink he goes it literally looked like it got sucked down the only reason he didn't they talked to him when they did the New York Times stuff they talked to him but it because the incident was from the 90s they didn't want to they wanted something you know newer mm-hmm so they did not include it but I know they talked to him about it now what was the other footage that we were walking at there was the first footage that Jamie pulled up there wasn't a gimbal footage go fast go fast what is that that's a it actually looks more like a tic-tac but it's they saw it going across the water and they're they're just grabbing a lock so they're seeing this with their eyes and he gets the FLIR to lock out and that's when you hear the kid go I got it cuz he gets the AutoTrack and it's just something screaming across the surface of the water so and this is in the same area this is East Coast yeah this is the same time frame as the gimbal video so the idea that these are birds or the idea that this is a radar glitch or somebody said pilot error like on a clear blue day commander flavor has nerves I mean that kind of thing that people have said on your show to you that you know this these are explanations that make sense who saw the I don't want to say that West yes sure Maina mint believes everything like every single thing that's ever happened has a rational explanation yeah it's so that you know the probability that you know all the radars went off at the wrong time commander flavor you know had nerves and all the other pilots up there with him that you know this thing's shot off like a like a can like a gun instantly like that that was somehow perfectly coordinated that's a conspiracy that that's a fabrication probably Occam's razor as the events happen exactly like we're being told yeah for us it was you know and I'll go back to the beginning of the story of you know the other pilot who was brand-new yeah she had been in the squadron for four months five months so she's pretty junior she's still working on her initial quality airplane and you know so she gets the you know we get the real world vector and it's like okay real world vector cool I'm gonna get to do something real exciting then you see the water and you think Oh something sinking because it's kind of that shape of an airplane you know that cross type so now it's oh crap now it's search and rescue we got to go down and see you know because there's people you know and we are sympathetic and to the tic-tac and as soon as a tic-tac it's like I mean a holy shit what is that you know and when you get you know some people get very emotional when you talk about it because for me it was like yeah you know I you know for her when you talk to her she has a disdain for some of the leadership that didn't tell us that these things were out there you know they're here now we're getting vectored because we were the first time demand airplanes had been airborne when one of these things showed up that no one even gave us a brief that hey we're seeing these objects out here for the last two weeks they're just kind of shit you might want to know they're out there and they never told us no one knew these things existed besides the radar operators and the radar operators didn't know what they were they just knew they were seeing blips you know so there's a lot of stuff that you know that it flew around and it came around me and it didn't do any of that stuff it's the story that I gave you if just relatively benign but it was you know it's it's an interesting experience so these incidents that they reported were taking place before you saw your that Tic Tac encounter yeah they they were taking place over a period of how many weeks two weeks we went out in the beginning of the month for that's this two-week ATS a period we pulled in for Thanksgiving but other that we were out till time December 21st is when we pulled the ship back in besides pulling in for three days at Thanksgiving so yeah for the two weeks prior so this was on the fourteenth and we went out at the beginning of the month so about two weeks they've been watching these things come down go up come down go up but it was always when we were not flying which is really probably like the midnight timeframe until early in the morning the next you know till noon the next day and then we just happen to go and if you think about it you know I laugh it you know if there was some little green man flying around in that tic-tac he probably got back to the mothership and got yelled at for being seen like oh my god you let him see you so so have you communicated with anybody that has any thoughts why what these things are doing or the the whether or not there's any consistency to the size of them or whether or not they think they're coming out of a larger object or anything along these lines no you know you can ask well cuz I was asking you know what do you think they were doing you know and I said because you can look well they were observing you know because they're coming down and watching number two is they were communicating because I think you know in my heart I think there was something under the water I don't you know what it was doing there but because of when you saw the X the cross looking yep thing explained that again so the disturbance may be in the shape of a cross yeah like I described it as it's about the size of a 737 so just think if you submerge the 737 pointing it to the east underwater by like you know 10 15 feet so as these waves are coming across when they you know they hit that object they're gonna break on top just like you would with a submerge like a seamount so and it's it's they're breaking and that's where the tic-tac was that this only reason we saw the tic-tac that's what drew our eyes down there as we see this whitewater when it's a perfectly clear day with no Whitecaps and you go oh what's that and then you see the tic-tac and then we you know we do all the chasing the tic-tac and we turn we're right there and we turn around and there's no white water it's just blue as far as you can see so at that point you go okay what was it doing because there was obviously something there that's not there now hmm so that's where I say well it's it was observing us it was could been communicating with or whatever was there you know and then someone else looked at me and said you know I was talking to Lou and he goes what about prepping the battlefield I go okay you know so if you go you know or these things from we don't know you know are they from China Russia someplace else I don't know but it's a it's a capability that we do not possess to my knowledge and if you asked me in 2004 cuz there's a lot of guys go out maybe it's some secret government program I go alright well let's let's let's be honest one if you have a propulsion system that made it gave the capabilities that we observed visually that's a huge leap for mankind' period so you would say yeah that was you know think about its it's gonna be 15 years next month you know that we saw this I would like to think that okay maybe let's just say in 2004 it was something somebody had this some government had this I don't ours whatever if you come to now you go 15 years later you don't think that technology would have emerged because it literally would change everything we do I mean we're happy about you know hybrid and electric cars and all this other stuff but if you've got something that works like that air try would change our travel forever no visible percent system of propulsion no what no plumes no it's just uh yes we jokey and said that's a thing of a 40-foot long tic-tac that can move at will through the air at speeds well beyond what we've ever witnessed I mean even when you watch a rocket go off you know one of Ilan's or one of the NASA whatever you know you sit there and I grew up during the Apollo ageism where you just look at the thing go up up up up up I've seen them shot out of Vandenberg where you go you know I'd sit in my house in central California and you watch you go up and go I can watch that thing for a while this is something that just like poof a matter of seconds is gone now our other pilots or other people that have cited these things have they also reported something larger that's in the water near it no no not the ones I've talked to I mean I think you know you can get on History Channel there's all this stuff on there about people talking about stuff but you know what here's the question is what do you believe what you not believe and you know my biggest frustration is the you know our incident and even the folks on the East Coast it is what it is to us there's no reason to embellish there's no reason to make stuff up but yet there's still groups of people that are making stuff up like someone came out on ours was talking about and he's like I I saw the whole the whole video is ten minutes long and it was doing all this it's bullshit what you see is that's literally the entire video it's a minute and a half long I think it's about a minute and a half long what people haven't seen that I saw I mean I've seen the radar tapes because I had them as my squadron you know I've heard you know the men in black you know I just I'm free you know maybe the okay I'll give you the credit if they did but why wouldn't they show and talk to the guys who actually witnessed it chased it and is one of the senior guys in that group right it's also possible that that men and black stuff was something they used to do back in the day and that that program was no longer continued and you know from Jeremy you would know this the older sightings when they go back into the day into historical sightings and I'm not not Columbus but you know a 50s and 60s did they have similar things that they talked about or something moved in this manner yeah it's absolutely incredible and I want to dumb this down because that's how I had to understand it when I was talking with commander favor years before I kept his secret years before the New York Times blew it up I told him it's probably gonna happen it wasn't by me we were talking about it this system that we have seen for over 70 years just documented by our military this is so important this is a non reactionary field propulsion system everything we know is a reactionary propulsion system you push something out the back it goes forward this is not like a mag system this is a gravitational field propulsion system and throughout history our military has documented them and there has been ridiculed now I'll tell you exactly why 1952 there was a huge flyover of Washington DC jets were scrambled all the papers covered it's very famous you know case everybody can look up it's an important case because at that time a policy was started and that policy started because it crashed our communications that teletypes went down the panic of the UFOs that were being seen by people with fighter pilots trying to capture and trying to engage them and and it crashed the teletypes so our government was like oh that's not happening again because you know Russia could use that as a scare tactic so this policy of denial don't look here nothing to see move on UFOs are fake that's what Project Blue Book was tasked to do specifically the guy who ran it admitted that that it was tasked to debunk this and demystify the UFO thing that's J Allen Hynek correct right I also yeah jr. Hynek um he was once asked by a friend of mine do you have the smoking gun I'll give you this documents pretty amazed it's an Air Force manual where they explain what they know about UFOs at that time in 1967 but here's the point yes this has been going on since the beginning of recorded human history these propulsion systems that are captured on footage you know that is confirmed now by the net by the Pentagon like commander flavors experience this technology is not ours it's it was here 70 years ago you stole my 15 years ago we didn't know we would see it now these exact things at 20,000 miles an hour going on 70 years ago documented somebody has a non reactionary feel propulsion system now are they aliens or some subset of humans you know somebody has them and they're fine through our airspace with impunity and pilots like commander favor who by the way defended Los Angeles over not after 9/11 I mean this is a guy we put all of our trust him he was defending Lausanne just right after 9/11 so we got people like him coming forward saying I saw this and you got Internet warriors being like it's a bird it's a glitch it's Superman let's not concentrate on them what about the Columbus thing did you find that yeah it's just there's like light 1492 light signature event that they saw white in the distance because it is the actual text no there's nothing like Wikipedia stuff it's just one of the oldest accounts I was trying to throw out that this is something that do you know of there's a very famous painting that shows what appears to be men in crafts flying through the sky in the background of an ancient painting do you know I'm talking about I do I actually have a page one of the first pages ever put on my website is like a bunch of these because throughout history there are these indications of ships of crap but you know what the one I'm talking about it's like and yes that that's the shape of it it's also like a plate turned on its side and then there's a person inside of it yeah yeah man it's it's flying through in that same yeah that's it yeah like look how it it's flying but you know the thing is is it everybody can say are the one above that's pretty cool because that was a hidden thing I've studied that one where it says discovery fifteenth-century above the her left shoulder there is an object and if you really zoom in look at the dudes staring up at it as a painter my wife is a painter everything is intentional which wears the ground of the ground yeah right over there it's pretty cool looking up so I think that's 15th century it said so that the problem with this Joe is it go to the original one the one that we just looked at Jamie the one right before that yeah so you get a big picture yeah that is so strange like here you got Christ being crucified and then above him UFOs like is that supposed to be aliens or is that supposed to be angels like so what is that supposed to be in these things that they have it's severe it's real similar to what we're talking about here that's the argument of miracle of Fatima let's say I mean again this is so speculative we have a witness here of you know pilot but when you see something like the miracle of Fatima if you look at the miracle of Fatima God that's that one that was you know considered a real miracle by the church and the three kids we're getting messages I'll get this all wrong but for like months that they're going to be visited and to bring people and bigger and bigger groups gathered to where there was over a hundred thousand people years of 1917 1917 so you know dozens of thousands if not hundreds but dozens for sure see an event a mass sighting of something that happened we're talking people that were religious people that weren't religious you know doctors that that's not a real image there's a gym now one's doctored a little bit so you could see what they're all looking at something but that's not real yeah that's the but that's the crowd right the crowd is real is that right so here's the thing people come out something happened that was so intense some people thought it was religious that it was a visitation but other people saw it as technological like something descended you know look into I'm just saying art pictures like paintings we're talking about men you can interpret them all day I can't hold on to that I can't hold on to an eyewitness with other eyewitnesses with radar systems and with video we're in a different era now we don't have to paint it man we get to see it it's fascinating man it is fascinating but it's way more faster when someone like you talks about it versus some fucking random kook you know that's that's what makes me incredibly interested is the just your credibility in the fact that this is not you know I'm a history of seeing wacky shit that other people don't see no just this once and but it's the on video and that there's other ones as well this it's really strange that I've seen people try to explain it away and what I don't like about when they explained it away or attempt to explain it away is that they're trying really hard they're not going who knows what this fucking thing is they're not looking at it like cleanly they're looking at it like a quote-unquote skeptic I don't like the idea of being a skeptic not that I don't think you should be skeptical of certain things I certainly think you should be but there's a lot of people that brand themselves as skeptics and I think it's a lazy way to look at things I really do because I think you're just looking for the holes in things without looking at it objectively if you wanted to be a scientist if you wanted to be someone who is a fan of science then you have to look at it as a thing like look at this information and let's study this without any bias any preconceived notions I don't think they're doing that they're looking at it they're trying to find a way where they can justify that it's fake and they're they're just doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to try to make it fake that video that you show where that thing slips off to the left and takes off at incredible rates of speed that alone should freak people the fuck out yeah well I think because people confuse all the time like we took the video no it was another crew that took the video we we watched it for five minutes with our eyeballs and there was four of us and we all have the same story we all saw the same stuff we all came back and looked at each other and scratched her head and said WTF you know I mean serious what was that you know and then what do you do you you move on we never saw it again I imagine they probably saw him on radar after that but I think they're probably seeing them on radar all the time they just don't bring it to the attention of the general public oh yeah because if you don't you know for for a ship when they see something and you know you know what is that well you don't have any way to go out there and look at it like when you're talking about how they were informing you that they were seeing these things previous to your your mission when you're doing this exercise and they let you know that they're seeing these things did you say hey how frequent is this is this something that happens all the time I didn't get in that ours was more of the moment of you know when he's telling us save for the last two weeks we've been tracking these things right and we don't know what they are but you don't know whether or not it was just those two weeks or maybe it was a year ago there was other similar situations or there's other situations that have happened out there but yeah I would say you know for this I I don't even know one you got to take it serious we have a tendency if we don't know what it is if we just ignore it it'll go away you know and I joke you know there was an incident years miss prentace pry not too far off the same timeframe where I think it was like constellation was doing her work ups before she got decommissioned and an Oscar class of Soviet Oscar class submarine surfaced behind her mm-hmm right and then it's now it's like you know go to battle stations world war three how did this how did this foreign submarine get in our area and spend monitoring our workups that's a big deal right I said but now we go out and we have these things that are coming out will there's nothing we can do about it we don't know what they are we have confirmed sighting by two aircrew four of us two planes that said look this is not this is not an airplane this is not a weather balloon this is not a blip it has performance well beyond you know in the airplanes that we were flying at the time were literally brand-new super hornets right out of the Boeing factory I mean these these these were brand new first block two series that came out and you go why wasn't something done you know it's like we don't know what it is I think it's good now you know the moves that have happened over the last you know two years since the original article came out that you know they're there now there's a new reporting for the pilots the Navy's acknowledged hey these things we don't know what they were you know they're they're starting to take it serious because you know I know there are other events that are not out recent events where people have been called in to go have seen this thing so the investigation process is still going on you know we don't we don't study the military doesn't stop even if you take funding away we don't stop you know we don't stop until we're told to stop so you know what's what's going on I you know you go well a tip ended you know they spent four and a half million dollars a year on it I think it was four nests 22 million over the five years see you go what are they doing since then well I mean I'm pretty sure there's still people looking at this and there's still people that are taking this serious I will tell you that I won't get into specifics but there are there are people inside the United States government that are taking this serious and I've been I've went down to DC twice to talk to folks you know behind closed doors to go because they want to hear the story and I've got a lot of you got to be joking yeah I mean this this seriously happened and and I'm like yeah it did happen and it is real you know what are you doing about it so what kind of people are you talking to high-level government officials is what I'll say and most of that is because that conversation is between me and them and I don't want people speculating but you can say high-level government officials I have talked to well that was always the the speculation about like what would someone do if they became president well the first thing I would do is I would tell everybody about the UFOs I would ask immediately what's going on and I always thought about I said how many people actually know what's going on and how much of the information I mean it's not like if they're dealing with something like this like your experience it seems like what you described is what is known so it's this anomalous event with this thing defies our current understanding of technology and then it's gone yes and so what do you have you don't have anything else other than that like what other information does anybody have well I would say I would say this because I've talked to Bob we did a table czar yeah we did an event together and I'll leave it to everyone to if he it's up to you to believe Bob I'll say this Bob's a normal guy Bob's not crazy he's not crazy at all not at all that was the weirdest thing about talking to him but when you when you look at it and go because I had asked Bob I said what he describes in the technology when he talks about his his story I said well do you honestly think we could you know reverse engineer it I said how long do you think it would take us and his response to me was another hundred years he goes Dave it was so far beyond he goes the stuff that he says he worked on he's like you know there was on your podcast cuz I watched it you know hey there was no wires and because I had asked him when he said you first described the ship that he got to see he said I used to say you know they built it and then it was like wax and you'd heat it up he goes now I would say it was built with 3d printing because now a 3d printing we didn't know things literally from the ground up and it's basically built as one not panels no rivets it's just made right and so when you talk about that and you go well it's still another 100 years so you go well what if you had the technology we still if if what Bob says is correct we still don't understand it and how fast would it take us to understand that I mean if it's if it's driven by something that we don't even have on earth which is when he talks about that element we can't create it you know we can create it for a microsecond and then it you know it decays and we call them at 115 yeah so you know I think we're we're still a long ways off you know I'll argue with the people that go you know are we really alone I was telling Jeremy we used to go out on on goggles you know out in the middle Pacific there's no light poles night-vision goggles so we can see well you go out at night and he'd be on like a tanker hopper so I'm just hanging out not doing anything driving around in circles with the autopilot on you just turn all the lights down in the cockpit so you have no night light pollution and you just look roll your head back and look up there's billions and billions and billions of stars out there and you know I always look up cuz I'm like you know are we alone and I go I look up and go well if we're the only ones around and that's and I'm looking everything I'm looking at some it's a pretty sad place it's a pretty lonely universe I asked my astrophysics prof that once I said you believe in extraterrestrial life and she's like of course not and I said well there's billions and billions of planets you think we're it I mean just the probability of it is you'd go other Spri something else out there and I'm not crazy I'm just opening up the possibility that we are not the only planet that has life on it I think people don't like to seems silly they don't like to be foolish and I think when people start talking about anything that's not proven or anything that's connected to a bunch of loony people that are making up stories which UFOs certainly are yes UFOs are connected to so many people that have made up so many stories was that gentleman's name from what you would know that guy was from another country Billy something or another Billy - yeah seems a hundred percent full of shit yeah yeah he's proven to have done tons of hoaxes with this but here's the deal sometimes I think people have a real experience and they're always like chasing that dragon and they get UFO disease and the brain goes fucking berserk right I know that there are people that have had profound experiences and then they can't ever replicate them so then they just start going crazy and I don't blame them for it but you got some of that command of flavor when he saw that AAV anomalous aerospace vehicle his reaction was I want to fly it that's a pretty cool reaction I'd like to fly it yeah imagine flying that thing well that's what I told my buddy is my XO at the time Dell got back after all this happened he looks I mean we're just standing right here when he goes hey dude I go it he goes what do you think it is I go I have no idea but it was pretty freakin impressive and I'd like to fly it Corps and he goes yeah I go I mean it was it was you know it's just like any putt you always want to follow coolest thing worse yeah of course you race car driver you want to drive the fastest car that's it now you look at and go well that's some we don't have yeah this idea that you know maybe we're not alone that some of these other stars have planets that or maybe technologically advanced so the next thing people say and you know new eras are going to say well they're not coming here because the distance is so vast hold the fuck up from the very beginning when Bob Lazar came for and talked about field propulsion gravity propulsion distance becomes completely irrelevant so if we believe the and the radars are right and commander framers saw this thing moving like a ping-pong ball in glass water it's gravity propelled that's why you can make those maneuvers without exploding okay then distance becomes completely irrelevant for travel you're literally warping time and space you're falling into place well it's like the idea of showing someone a video on your phone long before video was ever invented people like what are you talking about like before photography was invented which is shockingly recent right you ought to draw pictures of things you saw just like those people that drew or painted that those images of those men and whatever those things were with Christ in the background the idea that we could understand what some insanely impressive technology from a planet that is nowhere near us could could manifest that's great it's nuts yes but Bob Lazar talks a lot about this remember he's a young guy right in 1989 he gets shown something and all of a sudden he's trying to interpret it through 1989 technology so he said it looks like it was injection molded because that's what he had and then Ron I said him this thing about nanotechnology and you know working towards an atomic printer he's like dude that makes a lot more sense so he has to view it through where he saw it in 1989 however I will say this it is my knowledge that we understand exactly how these crafts work our one limiting factor is our material science we can't replicate not the fuel source itself is another when you say we know exactly how they work yeah it doesn't break our laws of physics this concept of amplification of gravity this concept of gravity propulsion we understand how things can move from point A to point B almost instantaneously our physics doesn't disallow it but our material science and the fuel to create that machine that we we have machines from other places so we I mean well Bob Lazar whether you believe him or not that there was a program I have other witnesses that I will be bringing forward about s4 where he worked we have cred of other witnesses that worked with along the people that corroborate Bob's account in that they saw him get on and off the red and whites the Janet flights that come on mm-hmm somebody that went to Papoose Lake and was stopped by non-military guards at that time people that were aware of sight four and et exploitation projects one is an sr-71 pilot that I've been talking with for a couple years so these people are coming for now which and it's like I'm sick and tired of doing it these little nitpicky things about Bob okay there was a program there was a back engineering program they've admitted there are materials so this is like the meta materials you heard about in the New York Times all that we have materials associated with UFOs that are interesting what is that what are you talking about so this was something that was launched in the first New York Times article I believe in December of 2017 that there is studies being done right now on materials associated with UFOs right so actual metals that have come off of you could say crashes or who is that that explained that there was something that they were with Eric Weinstein that was explaining that there was someone who reportedly has something along those shocks ballet has 17 samples 17 samples how does one night at 17 Sam well he's jock fucking ballet right so he is the guy first ever for the United States military created a computer program for you know for the study of UFOs for Project Blue Books he's an old school guy they modeled him after in the Close Encounters movie it's modeled after Jacques Vallee the French guy so he's kind of like been involved with this he's had more access to government databases than any of us he went around collected samples from known you know crashes or like when things will come off and what's the conclusion well they're studying him right now there was just something on Fox about they're studying some of these materials and what they will find because I actually the ones they're talking about I actually took to New Mexico and had five scientists study it about five years ago I got my hands on it got to study it the the famous parts they're talking about now it's layered and the way it's layered is what they're trying to see if its anomalous elementally or the way that they're the elements are bound together and also the atomic level of layering is what's interesting we'll find out if we explain what you're talking about what is this thing that you saw okay well there is there are a lot of different samples but when you get a sample of something and you can come bigger these samples the ones that that I looked at they ranged from about this size they were you know they range from the size orange-y a size of an orange to the size of a quarter these are materials right the materials from a crash so that's the alleged layer there's a known crack this is in the public domain rather than you know government control so what we were what I was looking at or having the scientists look at is isotopically and elementally what are the elements that are in this are they engineered and what's the conclusion well I I'm not I'm gonna leave it to the people that are doing it now who have much better machines than I had a million cliffnotes yeah they from what I understand there's atomic layering there there are levels of like we do with graphene we lay down these layers that are basically oriented at a certain degree that's how you get a superconductor or something like that if you take a piece of graphene and you and it's highly machined so it's not doesn't deviate from that atomic layering you can push it right through ice thick hot knife through butter so the weirdest feeling in the world because you just take this piece of what feels like graphene and it goes right through butter because it's a superconductor and the heat from your hand melts the ice so that that is a meta material it doesn't occur naturally humans created it and it has special properties because of the way it's atomically layered so if these materials are from somewhere else then they're we suspect that they're going to be highly machined that they're going to be created for special use so my whole point is our material science has not caught up with the physics that we understand for these field propulsion systems I'm just telling you believe me or not but you'll hear more about it that that our material science in 1989 and today is our limiting factor and as our material science gets better as humans we know how these things work now the fuel source that's a whole nother conversation but as far as creating these machines that's what we're trying to do that's why there is secrecy we're trying to exploit the technology because whoever exploits it first wins it's a game changer we don't want Russia to do it we don't want China to do it if we had a non reactionary propulsion system the world would look different instantaneously what what is your perspective after the incident versus before the incident like how much did it change the way you view the world and our place in the world for me I mean I always I never believed that we were alone me I just look up and go there's way too many stars up there for us to be my own place after it you know it makes it a little more clear to go you know one my questions are where to come from that's that's the biggest one of where'd it come from what was it doing you know and then I've asked why me I mean why why did I happen to be because you can say wrong place wrong time right right place to see or right place right time for me it was I think there's more out there and if I could get word out to anyone it's like you know especially the debunkers of one quit trying to debunk it because it is what it is it wasn't a there wasn't a system glitch this I mean this was a real incident that happened and number two is let's open our aperture a little bit and start thinking outside of the box you know if you go you know you look at it go ahead it's it's non reactive propulsion well it's because when we came up with propulsion we D we you know the people long before us came up with a reactionary propulsion system and that became our standard had we done something different or we developed non reaction we might look at something like a gasoline engine go holy cow how's that thing work right we wouldn't have that idea so you know I think there's you know if you look at it and go people thought Einstein was kind of nuts and we're still proving his theories today and what we're learning is that he was right and he was right there was a time when the earth was flat except for some people in California the earth isn't flat around its people there's not an ice wall so so when you look at that and you go you know a lot of the stuff that we thought was true isn't true it's totally been changed so for me I just say I think let's get outside of the box and go if we can develop a technology that would and I don't look at it from a military standpoint because it would be a game-changer from military standpoint technology like that would be a game-changer for mankind completely I mean it would literally everything that we do you know and we don't know exactly you know you could you know do you want that system in a car you know people have trouble driving in two dimensions let alone three right you know they you know it's kind of like your joke last night the vaping thing let alone drive in a car that goes up down works in three dimensions or that was what they originally wanted helicopters to be they wanted to be flying cars yeah if you get out on the road you see how people drive yeah and I always laugh because people think well we're three-dimensional like we know that this table is not the floor but it really humans are two-dimensional people and you learn that especially when we would fight if you can really work in the third dimension which is up and you go well we are three dimension like I know if you look at like a tall building is you know 1700 feet high the big ones and you go no you know for an f-18 to do a split us which is go from up here and just do a vertical 180 degree turn so you're going this way and you go down here it's like 2500 feet hmm and that's tight that's a tight turn for a jet you know unless you're running like vectored thrust stuff but there's everything has a cost so if you do some big high akka you bleed off energy there's a cost associated that that to a pilot that's three dimensions to most people on earth you go no I'm you know I look at a hill and god I want to walk up that thing Rio and in an airplane it's it's a totally different thing so if we just open up that expanse you know for what we're trying to do for technology and go is there another way because we still build we still build suckers and blowers which is a jet engine we just refined the internals the turbines to get them to be more efficient where I go I don't you just put your efforts at someplace else like I was talking to there's a whole realm of physics that really doesn't get explained and it's I was talking to Steve Justus about it it's more into the magnetics type side that we don't we don't spend a lot of time on and I know he said when he was working at skunk works he did it's not a good call I read internal research and development money that he would fund to try and look at some of these other technologies for propulsion and you know he's now since retired but really impressive to talk to him at the level that you can which is you know for us would be an unclassified level but you know the stuff that goes on behind closed doors there's reasons for it you know because if a technology like that got out where someone could rapidly reproduce it after all you've done you know or they got it first do you think of the atomic bomb you know Germans almost had it Russians were working on it we got it first changed the world literally changed the world when we detonated the first one and you go I'm not gonna get into the politics behind it but now we had it and now it was the race everyone else because they had to get on equal part because it's a destabilizing thing and novice side if you develop a technology like this and you keep it to yourself you've got something that no one else has and it's a huge leap I mean it's a quantum leap do you do you share it because it's a mankind thing or do you keep it for yourself you know and that's right now it's not for me to decide I'm just Dave well it's fascinating that some other method of propulsion could have been established in some other place and that we're experiencing or that you've experienced it and some other folks have experienced it in action and I just think for us as people as human beings in 2019 it's really easy to think that what we have now is so amazing and that what we have now is the pinnacle of discovery and then what we have now is you know with our electricity and with our LED screens and that we are experiencing like the height of Technology when if you're some creature from some other planet that has got easy access to element 115 and some gravity propulsion system you're looking at us like we're digging holes in the side of a mountain to protect ourself in the rain we're a cave people yes yeah what we do that here on earth yeah I mean you look at like a first world you know like a United store you know these are the cunt of developed nations I need to go to Sammy's other and go you know people are still getting their water out of a hole in the ground with a bucket right or people in the rainforests are living these indigenous lifestyles yeah so you know take them something take them one of these flat screens down in one of these tribes that no one's ever seen and go hey yeah and start showing them pictures of themself that you're shooting real-time or video that's feeding directly into it they'll freak out don't think I would you capture my soul right so it's it's where we add more are we gonna do and what can we do did it change the way you look life I mean even though you knew that or you had this feeling that we were not alone just from looking at the Stars and but when you actually see the thing like how I mean I would imagine that that has got to really shift your perspective well if it shifted my perspective but it was more of a it's a validation a confirmation ago you go yeah you know I've always like yeah there's a lot of stars and then you see something like this and go well maybe we're not because that that pushes you to the next point to go you know you know one lands in my front yard then I'll be 100% sure that we are not alone because it's sitting in my front yard but I mean I got within a half mile of this thing which is people go I have miles pretty far away I got not when you're flying an airplane half-mile is like really tight when they bring you in to have these conversations with high-level government officials how long these conversations so I went to the I've been down I've talked to three different groups of people this is post The Times article so the New York time article comes out in 2017 yes and then our compliment the other pilot that was involved had been to DC multiple times this is how our kinda I got in touch with Lou she had called me and said hey I need to talk to you so I called her and I said what's going on she says hey have you been there's anyone called you about the tic-tac and I said no she goes you know I'm gonna the Pentagon like a half dozen times and they'll take me in and anywhere from Starbucks to you know inside of a vault and she goes and they'll talk to me about the story and they'll show me a picture something goes to look like this and then she gets pretty frustrating goes it we called the tic-tac because it looked like a tic-tac what part don't you get I mean go get up thing at Tic Tacs and look at when they're saying did it look like this they showing her something laughs that they have no not pictures that they have but like a video from someone else like they'd show the gimble video like this okay and it was no so and that's when I told her I said well just just tell this guy that you're talking to just give my name and number I go I'll talk to him it's not a big deal to me you know and that started so when we I got asked you know multiple times to go down and talk to two people one of them was supposed to be 20 minutes and these you know these are important people get in 20 minutes as some of these folks time is that's a huge deal so we went in thinking okay we're gonna do the thing 20 minutes and then we're in and and an hour and a half later we came out I mean that's the interest of you know and there were some Pino you get the group you know the folks that come in and out but there's a few that just sat there and were enamored by what we were saying like you're you joke and we're like no this is this is all real I mean these are these are pre senior officials that are taking the time out of their day to take this serious to go you know maybe we do need to put a little emphasis on this I mean literally if some can just show up at will and do whatever it wants and I'd probably at least pay attention yeah pay attention but what could be done I mean what could they do if you put yourself in a position of one of these high-level government officials what do you do just spend more money on looking at them now if you look at money though I mean I know when the article came out and they talked about the a tip program that Harry Reid got funded 22 million dollars over five years yeah point four million dollars a year and you go and one's freaking out oh it's 22 million I know I wasn't 22 million dollars a year it was 4.4 million that's not even in the rounding error for the United States we just gotta prove what it was seven hundred and fifty billion dollars for a defense budget seven hundred and fifty billion if it took a hundred million out of that it's not even gonna put a dent and I go why can't you know if you're if you're only spending four or four point four million dollars a year and you can actually get some good work done because you don't need a huge team because you figure if you look and I think I think what's the number like ten fifteen percent of all these UFOs like you would you look at Project Blue Book really remained unexplained and you go okay so you can weed out you know you can read out me flying over someone in a campfire in like my afterburners so you know that was Dave being Dave so you can weed that stuff out now you go now I'm really kind of concentrating the funds the most important thing and I talked to the folks one that we were talking we talked about funding and I said let me leave you with this and I had got some pretty good stuff I was talking to Chris Mellon who's a former undersecretary and understands how the government works so is where he gave me some really good feedback and I said I talked to I said look I'm all for you guys funding a program but what you need to do is find a program that there's going to be oversight over when I say oversight I mean because what happens is you go here's money but we're going to distribute in the government so we're gonna distribute it to these three different agencies across the United States government you know I don't just call them agency a B and C so you give it to them you know and I'll go back to like the 9/11 stuff where we've really had the answer but all the agencies weren't talking to each other to put all the pieces together and that's my fear that you go hey we're gonna take a hundred million dollars of taxpayer money we're going to fund a program to actually seriously investigate this stuff and look at the technology but there are three different entities working on their own and not talking to each other so there's got to be a joint collaborations we go we're gonna do it but you know Joe's going to be in charge and you guys are all gonna play nice in the sandbox together because we want to get our money's worth because people pull raise the the fraud waste and abuse flag that we're wasting money on something stupid now the gimble video shows a different kind of thing yes how many different kinds of things are you aware of well those are ours too if you look at the go-fast it kind of looks like a tic tac so you could say those two are the same yeah I think there's other stuff out there you know and sometimes it's not that the you got to look at where do you obtain the video it's just like intelligence you know and I'll use because I had no you got that picture of Pablo out there you know and there was the guy Tom Cruise made the movie about him what's his name Louisiana due to his flying the drugs for Pablo in and out Barry seal Barry seal you know hey it was all great until Reagan posted that picture that they had the cameras inside the cargo plane and then Pablo puts it there the only place that picture came from is Barry seals airplane you know and then now Barry seals a dead man so you got to watch when you release because you go hey we got this video but it was taken someplace we probably weren't supposed to be or how did they get that video right like I look the video of the tic-tac video that thing first came out is kind of funny the guy that was in my backseat had sent me an email and this is about probably 2008 so I was retired and he sent me this video guys say skipper's look familiar and it was on strange land calm but not suitable for work just say that but I look and then next thing you know it's on YouTube so when I would tell this story to my friends I would go I'd send them a link to the YouTube video and this is years before the New York Times article and then when they did the unofficial official report the you the video was taken down off of YouTube and you know it kind of puzzled me like why'd you take the video down and I told the guys when they did the unofficial official products that way you really need to look as how did this thing come off of a classified Drive system on an aircraft carrier and end up on strange land calm in YouTube because at the time the videos were classified secret and that's not because it was a UFO it's the the 80 Flair video what they did not want that released so you'd see it on CNN they blocked out all the performance stuff what the airplane was actually doing in this case you know the one you see it's 250 knots of the autopilot on so it's not that big of a deal but you know Jeremy how many different types of vehicles are you aware of that have been reported credible reports for decades hundreds of different shapes even Lazar himself said he saw you know nine different styles all working off the same propulsion system the tic-tock shape you know vehicle that that goes back in history some people say cigar shaped you know big ships small ships we you know they're all different kinds I think it's important to state though there are other funded government-funded UFO programs it's a misnomer actually that a tip was the recipient of the 22 million dollars it was actually harry reid created a program called AUSA awesome was the sole beneficiary of that 22 million new york times got it wrong and then what happened is a tip was a different funded program to study military encounters with UFOs aw snap was created because of skinwalker ranch a government program to study UFOs and associated phenomenon a tip and awe sup communicated and shared information but they were independently funded so the 22 million dollars was for OSAP and then a tip had its own sources and then they did collaborate to UFO programs there are more that I think we're gonna learn about so the different shapes that bob lazar saw there was nine different shapes that he saw yes there's only one up close yeah and none of them were like to tic-tac not specifically however that's not an uncommon if you go back in history of like military sightings of craft going over 20,000 miles an hour the tick-tock is a shape they have triangles they have ones that look like rectangles the thing that is common with all of them is the non reactionary propulsion system I think even command a favor said the thing noticed him was words he first said to me and and kind of went towards him with its nose but it could move in any direction right I mean it could just move that will however it was when we first thought it was just basically it never turned it was just going left right you know kind of doing this she probably doesn't matter and then it became aware because it turned and it actually mirrored what I was doing when I was coming down it came up and you know so it was obviously knew we were there and I don't know if it was picking up you know energy coming off the airplane or what you know I do know that when they tried to lock it it actively you know it jammed a radar made it pretty much useless and you know Chad was pretty good about kicking it over and grabbing that video so it's pretty wild it's a big deal to actively jab a radar virus you know yeah it's um you know whenever someone tells you an awesome story it's great to hear but god I wish I saw it myself you know yes but you got thing that's yeah you're like you're telling me and I'm like wow I'm listening I'm trying to imagine I'm putting it in my head I'm I'm I'm visualizing it but damn I wish I could see it yeah I said this to a guy where he's he's pretty proud I don't say who it was or what his position was he's pretty prominent in the UFO community I'm not really a UFO guy and he starts quoting like Jeremy can't quote event so this was this dis event that event that of it and it keeps looking he goes what do you know about this event I go nope and he goes what about this event I go nope he gets like three of them and I look at him and he goes well you're not UFO guy I go no but I chase what have you he goes no I go I'm an expert you're the kind of school he kind of got deflated a little bit he because he looked at me like you suck well it's like people that are into baseball stats but they've never played yeah yeah you know you gotta get got your hands dirty get out in the few I'm with you Joe like I wish I had seen you I've been so curious about the propulsion system since lazar and I wish I could see something too oh my god yeah I would give so much I'd almost think about for president just to win just so I could get in and find out about you everybody's track and then go I quit bitch everybody Clinton tried he tried to eat yo big time that was his that he came in he said first thing he webster hubbell he said i want to know two things who killed JFK and i want to know all about UFOs and they were he was denied access and he later said it's not the first time I've been lied to her denied information after asking for it Bill Clinton said that additionally Jimmy Carter he said before he was president I'm gonna find out well Jimmy Carter supposedly saw you know he did he said I'm gonna find out I'm gonna tell you never talked about it again afterwards after he became president wonder what his briefing looked like you know and then so many presidents have tried because they're like us man they're curious mm-hmm however this information from my understanding which is an informed understanding is so compartmentalized you know that makes sense listen is anything else just one thing I want to make sure to brief you on storm because I still blame you for it a little bit no idea can I just give you a quick break now okay so check this out I made a movie Bob Lazar Air Force One and flying saucers Joe blows it up I go on a show with Bob Lazar which was awesome thanks for letting Bob tell everybody what happened and then the world lit on fire now from a sociological pop-culture standpoint what happened on that day is huge and I don't want it to be missed on anybody so a kid watches your podcast watches the movie puts up this Facebook page Stormare 51 oh my god that's a big problem right so I ended up talking to the kid and all this and helping trying to help him navigate kid went left he should have gone straight anyway vent went down Rachel Nevada where area 51 is where the access points go up we all went out there right but really Rachel nobody wanted people to come it's a town of fifty two people one business the the residence I live in Pioneer Tom Coburn it's tiny you don't want your whole town taken over by potentially dangerous millions of people that are signing up for this on on Facebook right so it's this huge phenomenon that happened because of going on what happened so here's what actually happened because the media has completely lied to you they said 150 people showed yeah it's a total fabrication the footage to prove it we had an event in we I participated in an event in heiko Nevada which is safely 50 miles away from you know Rachel where they didn't want us and on the fly 3,000 plus it's me it's a huge win three thousand plus people even though they were scared to come because they were told to be scared to come out there that it's gonna be a riot okay and they peacefully assembled and enjoyed this thing I had but what what happened there was nothing they just got together 3,000 people yeah but everybody came with the idea that they're curious about this it engaged a whole new audience of people we had Dave Foley talked we had Paul Oakenfold some famous people talked the phone setup yeah we had a I set it up I brought in speakers right I brought in speak Dave did you avoid this yeah I'm you know I'm a military guy not forming a government that's about the stones go that's like jumped the White House fence I'm like are you black that's the dumbest idea on the planet yeah I didn't understand the benefit of getting all those people together no no people were going and so my point was well let's at least bring people who can talk about it and and have a civilized fun time and see what people want to do so my point is it's amazing anybody came out to begin with and nobody went crazy so what is the 150 people that were reported where they may be at the gate itself to go so that's probably what it happened and someone like you didn't come along and organize something else yeah I didn't organize it but I definitely advocated for safety and and it worked and and it was a success so they just got together and talked 3,000 people got together and talked well it was spread out all throughout like people didn't Rachel the community didn't want people there was an event there though and the in heiko where I was was the event with the stage and the fun stuff we all did George Knapp was was there as well how did you promote this well they did the event they promote it because people are already coming didn't promote it on social media sure I said if you're gonna go somewhere that's where I'm gonna be and it's gonna be safe and sane my point is this you have so many people that are curious now and don't underestimate what happened on when someone watched your podcast and that happened boom you've got all these new people who are interested in it and I think that's important because this UFO phenomenon is real you've got fighter pilots that engage them it represents a non reactionary propulsion system and that's a physics that would change the world so the more people that come together and say we're interested the louder the voice we got I think it's cool when I had some alien Budweiser great well I don't know if there's really any benefit to people physically getting together but I do think that there's a lot of benefit I'm glad you had a good time but I just think there's a lot of benefit to this discussion and and I really think there's a lot of benefit to hearing the stories from people like you because that's the only thing that matters to me when it's like I need to know the person who's telling me the story isn't full of shit so when I get it from someone like you I really really appreciate it so um that's it thanks for being here thanks for telling your story thanks for having thanks for being you thank you Jeremy for setting us up and thanks for your documentary on bob lazar which really like fucking turned me around that was the one all right that's it bye everybody [Music]
