hello freak bitches yeah I mean people ask me like why would they want to be on TV because everybody wants to be on TV like we talked to a bunch of different Klan groups and are they the producers did most of them didn't want to be on TV but there was like three or four that did because they they thought they were spreading the word maybe they were you know you know what was their message like when you were talking them like what what was the reason for them doing this they believe America is a white country ordained by God that way they believe the Bible says that's true they believe the Bible it's like I'm not telling you what I believe but they believe that the Bible doesn't think the races should mix the Bible doesn't you know all these things that people quit out the Bible the Bible is talking about donkeys in they were like they you know so the data and they believe that America is a white country founded by white people and that that the people who like the black people and the Mexican people and eventually the Catholics in the Jews own against a cooler with Catholics now that you state the Catholics should get to leave go back home and because that America is they in it then though and the whole America is for white people is the whole white is there just a different way of saying the white has no state thing that a lot of the people are the alt-right in the National the white nationalist movements say then so you know they they think that this is that you know this is they they think of America they think this the whole idea of America is that it's for whites only and that the rest of us need to go home how did that feel for you I mean I'd be standing there with these people in the woods in Kentucky looking into the eyes of madness yeah whether we're in satin sheets over their head with holes poked out for eyes well it's sort of it was a lot of it that was fun I mean it was it was like we got there I got out of the car and there's a line in the in the show where you can hear me before you see that I'm going like and that was really me saying this was not a good idea that was not me making a joke because I see a phalanx of them and they're all standing there at attention and right when we got there the guy who wasn't all blue was like immediately goes into a rant about Ferguson it was in 2014 so it's all about Ferguson and how black people are police themselves and the white man is gone another that well at the same time they don't advocate violence because it's clear that at some point they were told if you talk about violence the FBI will be here every weekend you know so they're like we don't advocate violence we have Kate self-defense we don't hate black people we just love our people also black people can't look what they're doing in Ferguson that shows the black people aren't whatever blah blah aren't the equivalent of the white man and and so I had to so we first started shooting I there was just like this guy was just going off and I just thought it was like having to take it and wondering is this gonna be the next three hours this kind of like yelling and the producer stepped in and said alright everybody let's just oh we got to check the camera for a second and we slowed it down and then we set up chairs and he sat down and started talking and from that point forward they were so excited to talk about their clan thing because they don't get asked that a lot that they sort of like eventually you would if you weren't thinking that it was the Klan you'd be like yeah there's just people talking about their lives I don't agree with them but they're not they didn't stay angry I was talking to uh this photographer I was at this festival this weekend and she had a film camera you know do you develop your fishies oh no you can only develop black and white because if you develop your color pictures the fumes will it'll knock you right out whoa and so I said so just a little bit of that would be a great time this is just a small so just get a little bit of that and you can break off in paint job interview Meilin maybe just a little bit midget just like crack a violin funny micro dose a little bit of that have you ever tried poppers you know poppers are those are the things if they crack them and they sniff it a male nitrate I think it's called no I did whippers in college oh yeah I did that when I worked at a Creamery I worked at Newport Creamery it was like an ice cream place and they had a the ice cream those big vats yeah that what is the gas nitrous oxide nitrous oxide right yeah that's what this huh and we would would you talk yeah like sucks off of it I killed a lot of brains oh that kills a lot of brains I remember I did one weekend in college in it I think I did on a Friday night and on the Sunday I was forcing the Yale just because I was trying to justify how I felt or if it was a natural year but nothing was happening Wow yeah and you couldn't help it I don't know you know something you ever tweaked out by yourself just you know you absolutely do like a crazy workout yeah after work I'll just show yourself right yeah change your state of mind just by yourself yeah like people say if you smile change your mind right change the way your brain actually feels well if you freaked out it probably does that too right yeah yeah definitely this ways to do it I mean why wilds would Indians like Native Americans when they do those those battle cries why else are they doing that getting fired up yeah you know singing a song yeah yeah is it it is New Zealand isn't it yeah yeah well they they would play it's this video of the plan the USA team oh yeah and they're doing this elaborate thing they're doing it it's very elaborate and wearing just energetic and the cuts of the USA team and it kind of looking back kind of just connect confused with just what's going on and they went through this whole thing is this right yeah yeah they did in a basketball game yeah at a basket volume this is ridiculous basketball and you never get dust about the 45 points you plan NBA superstars you fucking dummies but it's just what a coach is for that mean that's what they do all the time but is but it's just it seems so stupid next well it seems stupid if you have you playing a basketball is stupid something can have evolved as a virtue in some circumstances and still be of the type that if magnified beyond its proper limits becomes pathological so let me tell you something I learned about Hitler which really I haven't recovered from my shock from this so we've been looking at the relationship between political belief and personality okay and your political belief is strongly determined by your temper so liberal left types are high in trade openness that's creativity and low in conscientiousness but you can fragment conscientiousness up into industriousness and orderliness and the real predictor for conservatism is an orderliness not industriousness and you might think well that's no surprise rate wingers are more orderly hence Hitler's call for order let's say but it's one thing to stew to I posit that and another thing to measure it and now it's measurable and it appears that orderliness is associated with sensitivity to disgust and this is actually a really big deal it's a really big deal so there's a paper that was published in PLoS ONE about three years ago looking at the relationship between the prevalence of infectious diseases and authoritarian political attitudes and they did a country-by-country and then within countries by state or province and the correlation between the prevalence of infectious diseases and authoritarian / right-wing political beliefs at the local individual level was 0.6 and so I want to take this apart a little bit okay so the idea is that this is part of what you might describe as the extended behavioral immune system and one of the problems with the interactions between groups of human beings in our evolutionary past was well exactly what happened to the Native Americans is you know they came out and shook hands with the Spanish conquistadors and then within a couple of generations 90% of them were dead of smallpox and measles and mumps and so it's been a truism in our evolutionary past that if you meet a group of isolated if you're a group of isolated humans and you meet another group of isolated humans and you trade pathogens there's a real possibility that you and everyone you know are going to be dead in no time flat and so we have a discussed mechanism that that produces this implicit let's call it racial racial and ethnic bias that is part and parcel of the human cognitive landscape but the problem with that is that it's rooted in a discussed mechanism that actually serve as a protective function now when I was sorting this out I was reading Hitler's table talk and Hitler's Table Talk is a very interesting book it's a book a book of his spontaneous mealtime utterances from 1939 to 1940 - and I went through with this new knowledge because people think of conservatives as if like or fascists as affray of those who are different they're not afraid they're disgusted and that's not the same thing because you burn things you're disgusted by and so it was terrifying to me to read it because then I also thought oh well disgust sensitivity is associated with orderliness and you need order in a society in order to maintain it and the Germans are very orderly and that was actually a canonical part of their civilization and part of actually what makes them great and powerful and that just had to tilt a little farther than necessary and all of a sudden everything needed to be get cleaned and you know Hitler talked about cleanliness all the time and he actually meant that and so this thing that's emerging you know you talked about its biological basis its evolutionary basis it is it's part of this deeply rooted discussed system that protects us from dangerous pathogens that can manifest itself and does manifest itself in the political realm it's not good so you
