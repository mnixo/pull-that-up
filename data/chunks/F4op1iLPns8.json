hello freak bitches so it was one of the great challenges in life is knowing enough to think you're right but not enough to know you're wrong ah yeah well that is a big problem with a lot of people that watch these YouTube videos that's what it is they say oh this is right oh my gosh but they don't know enough to know why it's wrong well this is what I want to talk to you about it what is it about people that there's this this is this very compelling need to find something out that other people don't know like the world is flat like dinosaurs aren't real like that kind of stuff is very compelling to people so what I do in those cases in the in the a flea yeah so what I do is I would say instead of debating them and some of some of your listeners are listening to this right now is what all I would do is say what is your best single bit of evidence for what you're claiming and what would it take to show that you're wrong mmm all right well let's go to a simple one so that's what I would ask okay and I've done this exercise and it doesn't work you know why why because there's a guy who didn't believe we went to the moon we spent a third of our time in our last session got there so that someone I know who doesn't believe he went to the moon rather me to say skeptical so I said what kind of evidence would convince you he said images of the landing site of the Apollo missions so I said okay here's a website where we sent if I wasn't watch was the Chinese I think the Chinese or Europeans sent a spy probe to an orbiter to the moon so it was close enough because ground-based telescopes are not personal don't they'll have the resolution to see the landing sites but we get close enough to the moon you can it it photographed the entire surface of the Moon and there were the landing sites and you saw the rover tracks and the the the base for the lunar module and so he that night he went home and found it and then he came back and says well NASA could have faked that well I'm done with you we have no more to talk about because he's not ready to be convinced well that's a weird because I gave him the evidence he asked for exact of that would convince him and it did not convince him and the other thing that's going on here which is still a theory I'm working on but there seems to be a disturbing peak at what a matriarchy would be like and I'm seeing a lot of women in these movements who are sort of vindictive and and cruel and like this woman we're talking about you know you watch these videos and you hear like fuck him up get him get him these women voices from behind the crowd and I call them chitchat like that woman from the University of Missouri can I get some muscle over here yeah remember her yeah yeah yeah yeah she wants men to fight on her behalf and you know iron man has that blue thing in his chest yeah I don't think women are evil I like our women are like iron man they're magic right but by ripping out that blue thing you're ripping out their ability to have children and be mothers in everything and then you put in a piece of shit into Iron Man's Chest that's what feminists and like this woman are their shit chest and they're malfunctioning robot you know I didn't kill them Mylo wants genocide killed so diamond that they're imitating what they think our patriarchal society they're doing their version of it and that's what they're doing with this the whole matriarchal posturing yeah it's like Clark Kent I want to write an article ah I'm writing no you're not writing it and you go Clark simmer down dude you write your article I'm doing mine no any crunches Otis I got a whole lot of matriarchal societies in the animal world other than hyenas I tried there's a few of them the few where the females are larger than the males a few bugs especially but hyenas in particular the female hyenas are much larger than the male's even at fake dicks rid of a faux penis has big large tube fake dick that hangs down they actually give birth out of it and they climb on top of the males and they fucked them and the speculation what there's a lot of speculation as to why the females are bigger but one of them is that they think that she has to be bigger does kyna's are so goddamn ruthless they eat their babies oh so the female has to go fuck away from the baby good dumpling she gets on top of him fuck so mean pieces shit it's my baby I mean there's no more you know no pun intended dog-eat-dog world than a fucking hyena world you know they're fighting for scraps with lions yeah well I actually have described an tyfa and these people as hyenas because that thing i was talking about at berkeley where our guys went in and said I thought you guys were like tough or something was his exact quote and they're going to get him get him fuck him up and then the guys sort of give up because no one wants to fight them they start walking away and then someone runs up behind him knocks him out with a flagpole as they're screaming these italian slogans by the way know why she stopped i'm before she star from the 1920s they're having fun they know she a game they're LARPing and then knock him out and then a student sees out that the hyenas come out then they start kicking his unconscious body and they start grabbing there really I like your little yes online you can find I have people that I talk to professionals obviously like sports psychologists or well sports psychologists and then you got to get a psychologist in general to deal with depression whatever when you hit your lows like it's okay to get you know if your bench pressing 350 pounds it's okay to have a little touch it's okay to have a little spot here and there you know and then after you get a couple spots now after awhile you can do it yourself you don't need the spot anymore that's how I look at psychiatric help to an extent for some people especially if they're battling depression sometimes you just need a floaties and you need it and then you can take the floaties off after a year see what I'm saying it's a mental it's a mental floaties and it's okay because we all hit low parts low points in our life where it's unbearable and you either allow it to continue to be unbearable and just deny it or you deal with the task at hand and say I'm a little low right now I need the floaties it's okay I'll get through this and then when you take the floaties off you realize I only needed them for a little bit of time and now I'm okay I'm here and that's kind of what it felt like it's like I just needed a little bit of a push I need to get through this and learn some things about my own my own mind and understand my own emotion to understand that I didn't need all these things that I was thinking weren't real it was me not being in control of my own emotions your own emotions are your choice and I chose to feel trapped I chose to be sad I chose to feel like I was Jax yet I chose all these things and it's like you don't need fighting to be these things you need to you need to let go of fighting to learn that you are something without it and that was actually a gift it became a gift because I learned so much in life now bigger than fighting I look at the things that I went through as a gift because I have gotten a gift of feeling retired during my career hmm who else gets that some people retire for five years lose their freaking mind end up in the bar and come back and try to fight again ten years later all the week and Bobby a mask from abuse why the motto why are they doing that they're not doing it because they're physically capable they're doing it because they never dealt with their life away from fighting fighting wasn't like fighting is who they are fighting is their persona so take away fighting what are they they're in the bar drinking away what they're not instead of drinking putting the booze down and knowing what you are without fighting being happy with that chapter your life and being able to live who you are I've gotten to feel that and now I can fight with a peace of mind knowing how good I am without fighting and how great I am with it too and that's that's what this thing's about all these fights all these me attacking those challenges coming back and winning and getting my belt back that could only happen because I let go of control the things I couldn't control okay but here's here's part of the problem when you're talking about people who troll online go back to when you were a young liberal and you thought if I was a doctor and I was like a three million dollar course I should be given 70% of taxes you don't have that so you're looking at the people who do and this part of you is like give it away man you shouldn't you don't deserve it give it away that same mentality exists with trolls they don't have anything going on they're fucking losers for the most part so what do you want to do they want to burn it all down they want the whole thing burned out go Trump go try I want the reason why they want to take go trumpets because they want this clearly maniacal person - just throw a fucking monkey wrench into the gears and watch the whole system explode that's half of what they're doing they don't have a vested interest in it they're not they're not successful they're not happy they're not doing well out there there's role if you're talking about all Trump supporters I think part of that is true I'm not talking about all anything okay because I was like I talk about all Trump sports I'm talking about trolls those people with the green frogs fucking with the crazy hair on their Twitter profile okay there's a lot of them that if you go over their Twitter feed their online 13 hours a day shitting on people I mean that's that's what some people do I've got I look to just a few people that I follow and I don't follow them either I just go to their page I have them bookmarked and I'll go to their page like look at this crazy asshole what's he been up to today and what I've been up to just trolling liberals just going crazy and shitting on that Jake Tapper guy boy did that fucking guy's Twitter feed is a mess why because he he fucking summon the ire of the trolls [Music]
