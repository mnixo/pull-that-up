the Joe Rogan experience right and I'm not gonna be because I I tried money but what I yeah we did yeah once two years ago and I stayed hide for 14 days sorry god man did you eat it 14 days no no it's smoke it wasn't a vaporizer is that yeah vaporized vaporizer yeah yeah and I say hi for 14 days right but I thought I was like disconnected for reality well sometimes that does happen and I know a story about a guy who is a straight-laced guy who took some marijuana edibles so that he could get to sleep and he had a real problem like he got suicidal and freaked out and became just irrationally anxious he had crippling anxiety for some time for some time for weeks Wow and he's a confident guy and a very handsome big muscular guy like just like you would never imagine this guy have any anxiety I think some people have just the the chemistry of different individuals I wasn't bar for that and that's what the doctor told me because I went to the psychiatrist that week that week with the psychiatrist man and I sold him me know I smoked that thing like 14 days ago and I still high and he looked at me and he gave me some some psycho one he gave me some pills and I was like if you stay high into tomorrow take these pills because what he told me is something that I didn't know that it can be a trigger if you're has some tendencies of schizophrenia and I'm a psychopath or if you have which was not my case and he's told this is very rare but he can't happen which is not your case and it was happy because he said yeah and the next day I was okay and I felt okay [Music] and I remember that I decided to record I was like let me let me record what I'm thinking at least let's get some good experience out of it and I remember that I started to record and I said now I'm going to record everything that I'm thinking and when I looked at the cell phone it was 45 minutes 45 minutes to talk to me I didn't realize I just said that I'm gonna record now and there was 45 minutes and when I listen like for 15 days after that I was like I'm so crazy I'm so crazy I'm never gonna understand my son's talking talking to me right now Wow one hit of a person no it was more than one a bunch of hit it was a bunch yeah oh you're too tall you're big you're like 250 pounds so fucking use it a lot also they were saying keep hitting it because you're tall because I wasn't feeling it oh no when I felt it I felt for fortune and you know having that belief does does you know add up to that I mean that's step one in my opinion is visualizing that believing it and our on the flip side having a negative self-worth or a negative opinion of what you're about to do or a negative thought about the future can also manifest all sorts of terrible results absolutely absolutely gotta think possible effect is a real thing we know that right we know that if you really do believe that you're going to get better because of some sugar pill they give you yeah there's a tangible result 100% if you really believe yeah so if that salt guy if the thing about all that stupid shit is if you believe it it actually has an effect yeah there's there's a lot of healers out there that at least on paper or totally full of shit but if you believe in these assholes yeah thank you first yeah it's very slippery the human mind is such a slippery thing I mean and I'll go back to my own experience and again I don't know how ephemeral are out there you want to get but I'm out there in Antarctica 54 days alone like I'm telling you I'm doing this for this bigger purpose I'm feel like I'm tapped into that and like legitimately there were moments at least for me whether I'm manifesting that in my mind whatever you want to call it that I am actually feeling energetically uplifted by the people pushing me on like there were days that were incredibly hard where I would sit there and I'd be like oh my god I don't know if I can do this and I'm done like boom like I would get over I would hit with this sort of large purpose this larger outcome and again like I'm not I'm not super religious person I was actually raised on a hippie commune like I come from a pretty traditional background but like the energetic field whatever you want to call that or if that's just the belief in something you know the power of that like I felt the strength from those moments there was moments when my body switched from kind of being negative oh my god another hard day out here oh my god it's - 25 - tapping into those flow states so yeah again I don't I don't have perfect words for that you know I'm starting to try to build my vocabulary around that but that energy I think it is derived from what you're saying if you start to believe it if you can believe like hey there's a larger purpose in this or hey there's blue forcefields get one foot there is something that if you can originate that positivity in your mind that I think can give us incredible amounts of strength and then we can tap into something greater and so imagine being this guy getting medals and awards for helping create jobs around the country and then realizing that automation is coming like a tidal wave and that your efforts that you're getting applauded for are really not gonna do the trick and then Donald Trump wins the election in 2016 and for whatever reason in my opinion the media's is not being honest about all the economic drivers they're blaming racism Russia Facebook the FBI and if you look at the voter district data on a district-by-district basis there's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in that voting district and the movement towards Trump mmm like it's a straight economic story where we blasted away four million manufacturing jobs in the swing states and Donald Trump is our president so imagine being me and then seeing that and being like okay I get it this is an economic technological story and then I went to people in Washington DC I was like hey guys what are we gonna do we're in the third inning of the greatest economic and technological transformation in the history of our country and the third inning has brought us Donald Trump the fourth fifth six things are going to be horrific what are we gonna do and then the answers I got were somewhere between disappointing and horrifying where if you go to mainstream politicians you know like what are we gonna do the answers I got were literally number one we cannot talk about that number two we should study that we cannot talk about that was that's verbatim really yeah and why were they saying that because it seems alarmist like anti progress or like you know you're like you know throwing stones at like like big tech companies and it's like I'm not throwing stones at anyone I'm just pointing out the fact so number one is so number one was can't talk about it number two was need to study it and the number three was the point you made originally which was we must educate and retrain Americans for the jobs of the future and then when I was like hey we're terrible at that by the numbers yeah then they'd literally be like well I guess we'll learn to get better at it then and then I so I came back to my home in New York City and I was like oh my gosh like we are so backward and far gone as I certainly as a government and so then I was grappling with it and I'm a parent like you are and I looked at my kids and I was like am I really gonna bring them up in this shit show like and so then I was like okay how would you actually solve this problem if you if you had to do so and so then I said okay universal basic income rebranded the freedom dividend after we did a bunch of tests because it tests much better as the freedom dividend the universal basic income and and then try and make the the rules of the economy work better for more people as fast as we can before this automation wave really crescendos and then the kind you know okay sure and then Alzheimer's you know again I know you're plus plus 50 so you know cheatsy wants to keep doing this podcast young forever that'll be excused to stop so THC has been shown to inhibit the formation of beta amyloid plaques so that's the you know the hallmark of of Alzheimer's disease and then CBD CBD has also been shown to be effective for for all stars disease as well you know it was a rat study that was gonna get into but it's it's fairly fairly it's fairly detailed so you know might be best just to say that a cane you know help with rescue memory and patients if you do use CBD meaning that it may actually reverse and that's been shown before to they've done that in mice I gotta interrupt you for one second okay and I think you would agree this data is some of it's some of it's sort of epidemiological some of it's preclinical it's very very early none of it really proves my dad but but let me say I'm a clinician okay if someone comes to me and they have a concussion it's very fresh strangest to say to them hey physical cognitive rest go home okay it's really frustrating to say that's some also too you know that the high-fat diet thing you know Joe and I both follow you know very very similar diet so that's something that want to share with regards to you know the the Alzheimer's disease we have really really poor medications for that and we have an aging population so again like Alex like you want to look at everything which is what I'm doing like I'm looking at everything and I'm trying to make a clinical decision am i using some things like without you know randomized control trials of course I am but again on the clinician so I'm using you know mechanisms of action I'm using what I've see and in clinic and I'm using epidemiological studies and I'm also taken into account what other medicines do I have you know based upon all the data this seems to be ineffective treatment and I am absolutely not saying that you as a clinician shouldn't do that especially your in Canada cannabis is legal you should you should use your best judgment what I'm saying is that when we're talking about policy decisions around cannabis and THC and to a much lesser sense CBD the advocacy groups have seized on this very very preliminary data to say a lot of things about cannabis and THC that have not been proven and you know a guy I know named Peter Bock who very smart he's a pulmonologist he's at Memorial sloan-kettering in New York and he wrote a piece in The Wall Street Journal a few a couple weeks ago talking about cannabis as limits as medicine and he said something that I thought was so well put which is the reason why people want cannabis to work for Alzheimer's and cancer and a bunch of things where there's really no evidence that it works is that we don't have good treatments we want cures we want help we if we're clinicians I mean I'm not clinician your clinician want to be able to give people who come into our office is something but that hope is not a substitute for science it doesn't mean then it works and even you want you want your patients to have hope okay but that advocates the people who are using this to push especially to push THC and to capitalize on the public confusion around THC and CBD I think that is a real it's a real disservice to people okay listen I think we covered everything was a complicated subject it really is and I think it's really important to discuss how complicated it is I don't I don't think there's I've never heard such a detailed analysis of all this stuff and in a way where you can get to opposing people that are you know very civil about it but agree on certain aspects of it I think I think we really highlighted all those things [Applause]
