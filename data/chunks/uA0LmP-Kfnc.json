hello freak bitches well I saw ghostbusters I didn't see it and I ain't like that which I feel awful about there's some funny shit in ghostbusters like overall it's not a good movie it's just not a good movie but they did some funny shit they they came up with some fun and I almost want to know like man what could this have been if you let whoever came up with all that funny shit just make make a movie out of it where they scenes where they died it was adjoins scenes in dialog there were scenes in it was such a combination of things that movie and it so had the feeling of the hands of the producers and the executives it's so how does that what you you in some ways the thing I liked about Deadpool was I was watching it going the producers of this movie did a good job where they were like this moment doesn't work make it work right every day like micromanage like I worked on Chris Wragge gonna be top 5 a little bit like for a couple I just consulted for a couple weeks and the producer is this guy named Scott Rudin who's like a famous producer and what I couldn't believe was the level of detail that guy was worried about it was he busted Chris's balls for a year about the script literally made him rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite rewrite and then on set the guy was worried about shirts and buttons and that's what I realized like okay these Deadpool producers whereas it feels like maybe on ghostbusters they've got you got to get you have to get lucky too with studio where they yeah they you all haven't agreed to set of what's good and then you build the movie from there was also there's a problem that the movie had a very clear agenda to be a pro woman movie huh yeah which it's gets I mean there's nothing wrong with being Pro woman but if that's what you're trying it's like a it's a goofy it's not a theme for a movie a comedy movie all the men are buffoons they're not just the food's they're they're cartoonishly retarded yeah like Chris whatever the fuck's name is Laura Thor is so retarded it doesn't even make sense yeah he's he's so fucking stupid it doesn't make sense but they keep him around because he's beautiful and that's like the joke well that's a funny but I like these revenge jokes where it's like so you're just gonna do what men did how long is this gonna last like what's the next it's easy for a man to say like hey do something else honey but like but it just feels like there's got to be like a next a next there's a lot of like retribution right now that's what just wasn't believable a lot of what trigger is how whatever it's a lot of people it's like digital lynch mobs of people and that are rightly so they'll go after people for saying something fucked up about race like they went up to Justin Timberlake a few weeks ago because he said something we're all the same and then it's like but what you can't say that and it just becomes this mob of people and it's purely about racial revenge hmm as far as I'm concerned well it's it's definitely about people having the opportunity to shit on somebody and having people that didn't have the opportunity to before yeah and now they have it via they it's like they have social cachet and they have social power and they use it for the same bullshit that white people use it for well it's not even just black people doing it it's a lot of white people aren't women any any any any sort of marginalized group whether it's for any like literally any group but this movie like this is there's a bunch of problems at the movie but this the the the fact that all the men in the movie were ridiculous all the men this movie with buffoons all the men in the movie like they like Bill Murray gets fucking killed in it spoiler alert yeah I mean it it's weird it's weird it's like it's an agenda driven movie more than they'd wrote something they figured well they'll it'll work if you do this or it'll work if you do that like they didn't even have romantic interests in the movie because men were just so retarded yeah like the women didn't have boyfriends they didn't have husbands they didn't have like they had Chris Hemsworth yeah but that's it and he was just eyecandy well the thing I always tell people is when you're writing about a specific gent like for a long time women in comedy women in comedy movies were props or they were like Andie MacDowell always used to be like the love interest and and she was always just like this warm sort of like vaguely disapproving it's either like you're disapproving of the guy or you're approving to a fault because that's if you're if there's a movie about a certain gender which is usually men the women in their lives for the plot to advance they'd have to be for the plot or against the plot right so then women started complaining like will you see us as these binary goofy things and obviously women in life are more complex than that so so now that women are starting to get their own movies and it's about groups of women you see it's it's a writing problem it's you're in a trap where the men in bridesmaids for goofy is fuck it was an Irish cop in Milwaukee tell me more because I've never seen that in my fucking the whole life a guy who's just like and bridesmaids is a fucking masterpiece for the most part just that part I was kind of like wait so he's a cop and he's got an endless appetite for wig even though she's not interested in was it was deke to him but he's still he'll take her back whatever and it becomes about he's basically the only man in the movie and it's kind of a goofy part and it's what's because it's about a group of women and that's just the purpose that men have in that plot you know I mean but yeah but they always they people take it as like this a sexism thing and I just take it as like a screenwriting thing well it is that definitely but one of the problems that people have found when they're talking about this movie is that you can't criticize it because if you criticize it you're sexist yes yeah and no it's not it's not a good piece of art yeah there you go it's not really well done yeah big who did who did bridesmaid said I'm talking about the same guy the same guy who did it he's Depp well whatever he's done it twice now but like I think he knows he's a really good writer like he knows you can you it's hard to write because it's never been I always tell people si go show me a good example of a movie about a group of guys where the woman isn't just even in Deadpool she's a prop to the but they made her in love with him unconditionally and even though face turns into a monster she still wants some nuts yeah eat a pussy and they make fun of it yeah they make fun of it in a funny way like their meat up their meat cute and then you think about like the damage they both are that was like perfect to me right it was brief and it it's like the thing they always complain about him when you're developing a movie it's like I don't buy this couple in Psych it's fucking movie right sorry like just not I don't buy a lot of real couples well not only that they have to spell it all out in two hours yeah and they have to meet and fall in love with in five minutes well there's a lot more to a relationship than that yeah yeah we can't show you all that other shit yeah because that takes hours yeah days and weeks and months and you fuck that is correct the sad thing about the movie the the Ghostbusters movies there's some stuff in it that was really clever there was funny stuff and I in the beginning I was enjoying it I was like you know what I bet people are not giving this thing a fair shake and then as it got on and I was like oh they just this is just so clunky yeah there's parts of it they were just so clumsy poorly pointy on Athiya because every single one of those women are fucking homerun hitters yeah Melissa McCarthy is fucking funny man dude she's fucking funny wig wig which one she she was in bridesmaids I don't know I don't know no she's the Auburn haired woman yeah yeah she's Leslie he's a fucking monster she's handicapped in it they give her some clunky lines yeah and then and the girl from ethanal kate mckinnon is really really she was really funny yeah she was very funny in it look it's not that bad I mean I didn't hate it I want to see what my kids they enjoyed it but there was there were some moments I laughed pretty hard great but most of it not yeah hard to make funny movies man and you know it's like at the end they way they wrap it up you're like oh Christ I can't the fuck out of here it's like it's so clumsy oh it's just so awkward somebody told me there were no stakes in the movie it was just like yeah there's ghosts and we're gonna smite them yeah we got them yeah yeah is weird it's hot fucking I mean it's wrong good movies freely are it's not a budget yeah a big budget with a legacy and a start in up and a release date yeah and if they just K if there was no ghostbusters before it there had never been a Ghostbuster movie and this was the first ever Ghostbuster movie there would not we wouldn't be talking about ghostbusters it would be different yeah well it maybe people would enjoy it more and maybe they wouldn't be so handicapped because they had to sort of connect with the legacy and tie all these loose ends and they could they kind of do it anyway any way they want
