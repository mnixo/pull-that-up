the general can experience well you know they've they done some really interesting studies work because you know they just over the last ten or fifteen years and we see inside the brain but for the first time heavily in these fMRI they can really see inside the brain yeah and they found people who they've who can identified as status and they show them you know pictures of people being hurt intentionally and they're like happy joy centers light up they look like brain gases light up that's so messed up it's a crime you know because it's like opposite planet you know the whole thing we've got this thing from religion like everyone has a soul and we're all kind of equal all made in the image of God of this man the other but it's a claim to this people I've talked to a research that I've done I mean there's some real predators among us who really are not kinda like us at all yeah and it's somebody who like sees you know some cat being driven over and heat giggles and like finds that really quite thrilling I mean I didn't even know what species that is but I think they're a lot but not people out there that they make like kind of difficult for the rest of us yeah it's a real issue it's very scary and how are these people becoming that is it because of nature and nurture is it because of you know abuse that they've personally suffered that sort of stimuli seems to be really yeah yeah but I mean this is the fascinating thing about epigenetics right so I mean when I was a kid growing up there was this nature versus nurture like you got your genes that's what you're born with right and then maybe you can influence it a bit with nature but what they finally got now is that genes turn on and off depending on experience so they found like if you have a particular gene and your boy and you are physically abused as a child almost for certain you're gonna end up you know on the bad side of things like you can end up violent aggressive criminal in jail or whatever right now if you don't have that gene you're abused you likelihood but it's less and so certain genes for aggression get turned on and strengthened based upon your experiences you can end up dead twins who grow up in different households in another different genetics based on their environment so that's what's so important about you know something I'd focus a lot on is a parenting parenting parenting it seems to me so many people are out there and they're just so messed up like you just you can't rewind and you can't send them down a different path but if you kind of look at the next generation the next generation what if we could get the percentage of people spanking their children down for 90% I mean it seemed so weird in the 21st century but that's how parents are really folks is still 90% depending on why you counted you do not understand it's less so in Europe like in in Sweden I think it's been banned since like 1973 and you'll know what a hellhole Swedish yeah they're doing fine but yeah it's still 80 to 90 percent in well it's legal here it's it's legal in America from 2 to 12 you can hit a child in Canada legally just not in the face and not with an implement so all I care about is the opponent in front of me and and and that fight I don't I don't do anything to go out there and lose man fuck that I go out there to go to war and be the nastiest meanest individual I can being I view the fight as the most important thing and everything else is if I was thinking about the things surrounding the fight and and separating that from the fight that was more that would be more difficult for me to navigate because that's also not necessarily all within my control but what kind of thing specifically oh you know you got your media days and this and what you should say and you know what you're trying to do and maybe getting this sponsor or all these different little things that have that are not they're not directly controllable by you that she can get in the way right of course it can but I separate the two I keep them completely entirely separate and at the end of the day I will throw away everything that is not the fight the fight is what gets you what you want you know I always say over and over again if you if there is nobody left alive to stop you from taking what you want then you you can have all the trophies and trinkets and all that stuff now everything is left it's the spoils of war so go out and win your war and then deal with the rest later there's an article about it online and says Afghanistan's male soldiers are having sex with other guys but don't call them homos well there was also something where like ah they were like their soldiers they would have a young boy who would have to service everybody check this I need to tell the soldiers don't get upset about that what yeah don't get involved that's their custom whoa well we know their custom is that the young girl that died she was sold away to marriage she was 8 years old she died after having sex with the guy was listen to this Afghanistan's the article is in Queerty free of an agenda except that gay one queer decom queer liking instead of QWERTY QWERTY how accept day when they got that dough much money we got it as I loved I love the title to freakin yeah yeah good and it's talking about it says Afghanistan's male sir soldiers have a sex have sex with other guys but don't call them homos and it says it's really interesting it says America's gay soldiers have unique struggle on their hands whether the hide or be open about their sexuality but Afghanistan's gay soldiers have a different battle despite regularly having sex with other men and shunning women many of these male soldiers refused to identify as gay which can get in the way of say preventing STDs you need only watch the CNN clip below where three gay American troops speak of the need to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell which it has been repealed now I believe to understand the difficulties of being gay in the US Armed Forces how all this article is is from main level Thursday's has its own post on urban dictionary it's the article doesn't say where it's from here unfortunately it doesn't say what year so it's before Don't Ask Don't Tell was repelled so I don't hmm repealed rather for these Afghan soldiers however having sex regularly with other men is no big deal just don't call them gay an unclassified study from military research unit in southern Afghanistan that's a funny statement an unclassified study from a military research unit in southern Afghanistan that's looking into gay sex details how homosexual behavior is unusually common amongst men among men in the large ethnic group known as Pashtuns pa a sh t UN's pash tons although they seem to be in complete denial about it what's a new unclassified study of Pashtun men oh that's that's what the new unclassified study revealed these men admire other men physically have sexual relationships with boys and shun women both socially and sack yet they completely reject the label of homosexual the research was conducted as part of a long-standing effort to better understand Afghan culture and improve Western interaction with the local people when you reach it like that and you read that you like people are dying over there you know and you think like the idea that they're gonna try to change this you think about what they do where they marry off eight-year-old girls cut women's noses off they do this kind of shit pretend they're not gay whether fucking each other and be homophobic at the same time it's absolute madness it's work it's reality your way right away it's like custom-made reality this is what they do this is how they figured out their way around it the Pashtun men interpret the Islamic prohibition on homosexuality to mean they cannot love another man but it doesn't mean they can't use men for sexual gratification what an interesting little gray area there there's a little fine print right there you're a fucking human beings
