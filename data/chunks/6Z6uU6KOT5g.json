the girag an experienced character because because I've done that where I've gone over the line and I've said things that I don't believe and it made me feel bad later yeah like I opened for Nirvana and and I know comics I was like oh you know getting heckled and stuff you know I mean I got hit with teenagers they would successfully throw people from the pit and hit me and I had m-80s going off around me oh my god and I get hit with Bibles a lot too which was weird whoa Wow yeah and so boots and stuff something like that I learned like the serpentine you know I mean I would just go back how many times did you open for that I did I think like 16 17 shows Wow then every once in a while I would go okay which was weird you know but I was more comfortable when it was horrible I know that sounds weird but that was my that felt right to do you know I mean like that's he deserved know I just thought it's kind of funny you know like when you get laughs that means the crowd likes you when you get like rage that means you have all of their attention do you know I mean right like Robin Williams is my good friend right and Robin you know he goes on stage and people love them and then I would go on after him when we do sets and and and in in a weird way it meant more from me for people to go Oh Robin Williams showed up last night yeah and then Bobcat gold it was Ed you know what that fucking asshole bed in a weird way that meant more to me you know it his form of neuroses is way more lucrative you know mine telling people to fuck off isn't as lucrative but uh but yes I was opening for nirvana in Chicago and Michael Jordan had retired from basketball and I went hey Chicago and by the way they hated me to begin with but I go hey Chicago I feel bad but you know for 40 million dollars a year I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head you know Oh God and there was a noise that wasn't even like a boo it was just like like fuck you yeah wish I had that sample it was the best and you what did you think at that moment when you I care about it was funny you know but but I did you know I don't have a beef with Michael Jordan I felt bad I mean even though cuz people just because they're super famous doesn't mean they're still not human so I did like a why'd I do that but you know so you live and you learn it's baby steps but and the only boy isn't laughing that night really was I remember walking by Kurt behind the amp and he goes I can't believe you said that but yeah I had a met Nirvana met Kurt before they broke he was a fan of mine and wanted to interview me so he interviewed me at a college radio station in Ann Arbor I know that blows people's minds it's like finding out that like Jimi Hendrix really loved Buddy Hackett or something but but he did so he did and I love that talking duck news I blew my mind wow that's pretty fucking cool so yes I toured in the open form I repelled a nude from the roof of the Oakland Coliseum on New Year's when with them because they were playing there and and yeah are you did you meet Courtney were year-round cordial a little bit yeah you see their relationship yeah I mean that what I saw actually I don't have any any good dirt for people they seem to like each other I'm not you know I you know I I think people you know I you know people get involved in all this crazy conspiracy stuff and all that stuff I think what happens is with some things and I know where I am what I'm talking about crazy conspiracy but sometimes I think there's like huge tragedies happen and people can't justify them so they have to make up some other thing you know I'm saying I think sometimes it's it's it's just you know III you know Kurt was a really sweet guy but he certainly was a manic depressive and I almost think like again we were talking about drugs earlier people talk about drugs it's like like that killed him it's like well that didn't really kill him you know he had some in his system when he died but he'd cleaned up enough to commit suicide you know there's some people that are chemical imbalances are some people that are prone to suicide and blaming drugs really lazy you know well it certainly upsets the balance though right I mean I isolated again I'm thirty years over and I'm saying this but but you know I think it's just easy to blame drugs do you have any did you document your time with Nirvana at all or with Kurt or anything like that that time did you have like another video camcorders then you kept around now I have a I have I have seen a photo of me nude behind him stage with I have the UH nude row wings on and said and I'm naked with a repelling little thing and then I was in fact and I also have a hat on I like that I don't mind people seeing my dick with my love handles but not my balding pate I got a hat on and I will say this if you're a comedian or performing you're going to be nude publicly give it a tug you'll you'll thank me later cuz uh yeah it was cold really I really wish I did pull my dick how many photos of there of that out there surprising not a ton you know your was this was uh was in the mid nineties I guessing right they have even have digital cameras so now it would have been everybody's phone yeah but still I mean it wasn't hot it was just weird you know there was so much mayhem going onstage too by the way because it was midnight you know fireworks were going off it was just like oh yeah and there's bobscratch goldfarb nude walking around look at cherub I was we were gonna the way that was set up the it was min you know New Year's so they wanted to do an extra thing where there's explosions and and I remember saying the Kirk I said you know you know I go fuck you man I'm tired of being your scatter that was Elvis's chimp you know fuck you and I don't want to cheer you up you know called polish or something you know so I when we set up the thing about me repelling the guy took a cult the stage manager took cold cuts and he built the stage out of the out of the food tray in the back and he's like okay here's where Chris is here's Dave here's curtain and Bob's gonna rappel in nude and these M&Ms are where the explosives are it's so and so I'm I still they go Kurt will count will tell you when it's min that you count back from 10 and or whatever you know and and okay so so it's midnight and they give him the signal and he looks up and I'm holding my own weight like rappelling down but I stop you know so he can count and so I'm giving him the brown eye basically from 150 feet up because he looks up and he goes hey Oakland you want to hear a drum solo and so like I'm barely can have my own way and then finally just goes one and I and I shot down really fast I had rope burns on my ass and stomach and I landed right behind him BAM and then I came down so fast he actually didn't see it and he like he looks up and he's like Paulie Paulie so and so then I ducked behind this amp looking for a cover because they're supposed to be my clothes were supposed to be there but someone had taken him as a joke and so I just kind of had to stand in the middle of stage because everywhere was bombs going off I learned this in your nude at midnight you don't get a kiss like everywhere I went people are like woah nude guy walking around a little weird yeah so yeah so again all this isn't sobriety
