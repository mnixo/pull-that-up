hello freak bitches and I thought I had lost that and I had I was at a point in my life where like I said I was where I wanted to be doing what I was wanting to do I thought I was doing it right and I mean it I thought I was gonna die in 36 hours after getting shot I got off the stairs of an airplane in Virginia Beach and my wife had my son in a stroller and was pregnant with my second my middle son it just was such a bizarre series of events that happened so quickly and I went from going so fast to nowhere to having nothing to do to not understanding why I couldn't train my body to get back to where I was because the only job I've had in my adult life other than working for my father I had too much I had too much invested in that occupational title and I think one of the best things that I was able to do in my military career was to survive it and get out and to move on that's one of the hardest things for fighters as well it's a big thing with MMA fighters boxers too they just don't know what to do when it's over they have they become these incredible winners in this one Avenue and then once that's done they rarely achieve that same kind of success and anything else well they're probably not thinking about anything else within the middle of fighting which is very common with people in military too because the job does require a very focused myopic sense of Drive this is what you need to do especially in the SEAL Teams it's the team comes first team gear personal gear then take care of yourself worry more about the person to your left and to the right and then worry about yourself you know consider the impacts of your actions and your words on the people around you and then on yourself so it's very it is very driven down into a laser-like focus but that's also required to survive and thrive in those environments but if left unchecked you'll end up at the end of your career not prepared for the next phase of your life and say you do 20 years in the military which is what you need to do to get a retirement you join when you're 18 so hey you're 38 well the average lifespan of an American is what 80 85 you go out of time left what are you gonna do if you haven't thought about it it's it's I see guys who struggle I see guys and I struggle myself but I think I think I went through that struggle while I was still in and I think that struggle allowed me to lift my chin up just a little bit to look around and start thinking about the future you know like there's a lot of shows that turns out like whoa there's four seasons of this you never heard of it like maybe it's just me maybe I'm that and it's totally possible because there's always some fucking new musical artist and I go who the fuck is that and I'll go to their Instagram page they have 14 million followers and I'm like oh it's me I'm that old man I'm that old man who doesn't know jack shit we had a the uber coming here was this old probably Armenian guy probably 60s racist Chandra that's not the show he he's listening to what I assume he thinks people want to listen to and it's all this shit I couldn't name you a fucking jay-z from a that kind of shit right I don't know any of it and I'm about to say hey you don't have to play this for us but then I I saw him lip-synching to the lyrics and tapping his fingers Oh on the steering wheel I'm like wow how out of the loop am I if fucking 60-year old foreign opened uber drivers know all the words to these fucking songs but you've never been a music guy no you don't like music no it's not something that is that possible I mean I have songs I like you know what's a great song like Doug Stanhope here's Yolo yeah sits back most of the new songs that I've learned I've either heard playing in a store or on a commercial that's catchy do you watch a cha-cha-cha don't you know that I love you yeah cha-cha-cha by a Jimmy luxury so no yeah it's from like 1997 it was on the soundtrack of the movie go and then they disappeared you can't even find where the band is now but it was on a corona commercial and why I love it and I use it as intro music all the time it pumps me up there you go sing us ow well give you some volume see I'm just seeing the video on mute I'm into this song this is great this is great don't you know that I love you now always thinking of you I like how these gals address like their 1950s cover girls what is about that look right that like cover you know pin-up girl that's what's called 1950s pinup girl type of look what is it about that feeling maybe it makes fat chicks look good how dare you Doug Stanhope do you not realize it was a different day and age you can't say that anymore those days are done wait what's wrong with a fat girl looking good what's wrong with you you latest it was it's a great thing and still is I you know I still write songs for people I still write with people when they asked me to do that for because it's cool to get in somebody else's head you know or kind of sit down with them and try to help them realize some vision of what it is they want to do and I that's still one of my favorite things to do and I'm just as interested in that as I am and doing my own thing a lot Wow so when you learn how to write music um did you when you would write well you said do you sit down with an idea in mind with a guitar do you sit down with a pen and pad like how do you how do you write songs well if I'm writing by myself or with somebody because there's a lot of different processes it can be you know whatever comes up that day for me generally if I was gonna say hey I'm gonna sit down and go over in that corner write a song I'd have a guitar I'd probably have a legal pad and a pen much like we have sitting right here and I'd start strumming until that felt like something and how does that make me feel I don't know I'm keep starting humming a melody maybe and hopefully somewhere in humming the melody a word would pop out that or or a noise I would manage to return to a word and from there you can kind of grow this thing into whatever it is supposed to be now that that's how I would do it if I was sitting around by myself now there's other times you and I could be having a conversation and you could say a phrase or a line or I could read a sign going down the road you know if you're a songwriter you're always writing songs right it's not like a choice that you have it's like a an affliction that you have in some way so you're just kind of walking around unconsciously things will hit you you know and or moments will hit you or visual or hit you and and that will spark something so that's that's really it can come from anywhere and that's and that's the truth here's a problem Western medicine you know we're facing this I mean it's like a war against chronic disease it's like we're being invaded by you know remember Independence Day with that yes you know and doctors we got BB guns I mean it's the stuff we're shooting at them doesn't work for chronic disease now acute stuff it's different you know there's some stuff that we have this wonderful technology but the road in the middle diabetes and obesity doctors are great for fixing broken jump even like arthritis and I saw everyday you know if we were trained properly in nutrition and exercise you know that's what I've done my whole life you know I know what I'm doing exercise wise but you know if we were allowed to do that and instead of training all these you know radiology technicians and blood draw technicians and nursing assistants if you had an army of preventive people we're a better medicine people you know and we train all these people to go into people's homes you know I think Russ was talking about that and just get the crap out of their diet and show them how to be healthier you know I mean you would you would save you know it's funny watching the politicians debate about health care how to fund it you know it's like you guys arguing about the Titanic as it's coming up in an iceberg and you're not you're arguing about the color of the deck chairs I mean we are going over a cliff and we're not fixing it by keeping putting you know band-aids you're not gonna write the technology's not gonna fix diabetes nutrition is you know that you're essentially dealing with the problem when it's already gotten too we're in the hospital yeah I mean there's you know like I said there's a guy Peter attea I don't know if you know he is but he he talks about when he was a certain he felt like he was at the bottom of a building and somebody's throwing eggs off and his job is to catch the eggs gone right fucking thrown out that's what medicine is you're just catching the eggs and so instead of it we should be investing you know we talked about prevention but it's bullshit we don't do anything for prevention it's so little and then the problem the problem is a lot of is it doesn't work the way we designed it you know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
