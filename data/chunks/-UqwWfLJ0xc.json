the gyro can experience maybe that's what book Bigfoot's about daily Bigfoot was about do let's let's create this mythical monster and have people afraid they don't want people to move in the woods the thing about that's not good for the NWO right the New World Order they want people to go into cities so they weigh reason for believing a Bigfoot I've ever heard that's so funny Bigfoot's been around forever though dude they talked about it in the CIA's been around forever and they were in the Native American culture before that's a bit the Nazis like I bet if you go to Germany they have these mythical creatures that they created to scare people out of the woods if they're not new if they're not doing that damn they got to give me credit if they start doing it because that's a good Illuminati move right there right that's how crazy deep you have to be if you're a conspiracy theorist if you go so deep you think that the CIA was in the Native Americans before Columbus landed people you don't even understand it had a different name it was a civilization and they taught the European the CIA of the Apache because you know they had to have some evil elites that lied to their people right maybe they wanted to keep their tribes together so they said there's a created these monsters you can't go out there we're gonna protect you you got to stay here wouldn't that be a good move for us trouble exactly would happen right and I got these crazy stories of these monsters mmm you got to stay here the CIA just building empires 101 you create you scare them with aliens we got a threat from up here so we need to protect you and then we got threats down here to jaws maybe jaws is a CIA movie let's keep people out the ocean we got to keep them in cities it's all CIA everything imagine just work for good instead of do you know what the Native American community people who are talking about AI automating programming have never really written serious code coding is thinking it's automatic structure thinking an AI that can program as well or better than he is an AI that just took over the world that's end game and that's the end of the human species and I can give you arguments but I don't think that's coming either people who are thinking and I know I take the opposite side from some very famous people in this debate but we're nowhere near close to general AI not in our lifetimes you don't have to worry about it even in our lifetimes really it's so overblown it's it's another it's a combination of cassandra complex you know it's fun to talk about the end of the world combined with a god complex like people who have lost religion so they're looking for meaning in some kind of end of history right the reason why I don't think AI is coming anytime soon is because a lot of the advances in so-called AI today or what we call narrow AI they're really a pattern recognition machine learning to figure out like what is that object on the screen or how do you find this signal and all that noise there is nothing approaching what we call creative thinking to actually model general intelligence you run into all kinds of problems first we don't know how the brain works at all number two we've never even modelled a Paramecium or an amoeba let alone a human brain number three there's this assumption that all of the computation is going at the cellular level at the neuron level where nature is very parsimonious it uses everything at its disposal there's a lot of machinery inside the cell that is doing calculations that is intelligent that is an accounted for and the best estimates are it would take 50 years of Moore's law before we can simulate what's going on inside a cell near perfectly and probably a hundred years before we can build a brain that can simulate inside the cells so putting it at saying that I'm just gonna model neuron is on or off and then use that to build a human brain is overly simplistic furthermore I would posit there's no such thing as general intelligence every intelligence is contextual within the context of the environment that it's in so you have to evolve an environment around it so I think a lot of people who are peddling general AI the burden of proof is on them I haven't seen anything that would lead me to indicate we're approaching general AI instead we're solving deterministic close-set finite problems using large amounts of data but it's not sexy to talk about that if you come in last you give us help spread it out electively a million dollars well you're doing better now it's your bus champ yeah tour bus champ you have to think about that oh just sign up for it you're not gonna lose if those are the stakes what is the common wait hold on hold on one second just let's let aside let's talk to our bus champ comes at a price dude my bus it's just so fucking sick you can't just be tour bus champ for because million I was tour bus chair listen listen but Burt do you understand this is strange that you keep failing at these things and yet you keep bragging so much success when it comes to you guys that I think sometimes you guys forget about it well I was tour bus chair do you know I was tour bus Jimmy Nelson alive don't you not the tour bus champ the bus that I was on this week when the tour bus championship was going on are you mean who's - a breast job I'd say what it's me of course how come I have the better bus did you ever take a picture of your bus and put it online yeah oh really yeah you had a fucking photo shop 200 times no it was the outside of your bus doesn't count Tom the inside of your bus that look like a prison yard didn't look like a prison yard did it not did it not have a broken transmission no way internet TV's that didn't work I want you to pause for a second imagine a world where the thing you're bragging about when you've been called out for failing to challenges in a row hard as fucks it makes it a great way the first thing you're talking about is this we're not even the shape of the bus that you drive around in I didn't start or that shambo's - how much is prepared was it was the transmission bad well then I win yeah the point is you have a flat tire well then I'm Leonardo DiCaprio the Titanic we we had a challenge you came at last your champion selector okay so nobody was like what are the repercussions for you fucking pushing out well I'm not pushing out the reasons why I have this right here it's because I read about you saying that you gonna put it on your mantelpiece and like that's never yeah you're a Mickey Mantle piece Joe can you entertain you can you entertain a circumstance in which you think Burke could beat you hip-hop may make a game like the old hustler make an even game where make it be anybody's at this point that worth like you gotta make it only have to be I'd have to have some form of lymphoma if you want to bring together I don't know people who are on opposite sides of the climate debate for example good luck sure right well why is part part of that you could argue is if one side just does not accept science right how can you really bring those people together it doesn't mean you need physical conflict to resolve it in fact I completely agree with you the physical conflict is totally counterproductive but at a certain point on some issues I understand why there's like an intractability to the debate where it seems completely impossible to move forward because whichever side you're on I would argue that I'm on the right side of these issues and others would disagree when you're far apart in a way that you can't even agree as to like what the starting-point facts are about the conversation how do you even how do you start I have some ideas as to how I try to do it but it's very tough it is very tough I just don't think dunking on people always like constantly shitting on people is necessarily the way to do it yeah and I think it's important to distinguish between just straight up at homonyms where someone is wrong and bad because I think they're a bad person or they're an idiot or whatever to recognizing when somebody is a participant in bad faith in a conversation yeah - when someone has maybe fallen prey to audience capture or whatever else might be kind of influencing what what and how they're doing I think that those criticisms are legitimate but yeah you got to stay away from just ad hominem when I woke up that morning I was about 162 I woke up at 5:00 a.m. Windsor at 9:00 a.m. I have to be 155 so I've got 7 pounds to cut which is okay you know it's not too bad I cut about 9 pounds of the day before I'm a little dehydrated you know I'm a little already worn but as the weight cut was going you know we got till about 8 o'clock and I had only cut a pound and a half so I still 161 and a half something at 8 o'clock weigh-ins are at 9 o'clock to the point where we got to do something so they start to put me in the bathtub just because we do most of our cuts in the baths you know when you when you're in a high humidity you you're gonna cut more water weight or you're gonna sweat more and water is obviously 100 percent humidity so they start throwing boiling hot water because we couldn't get the water hot enough to make me sweat Lord's Christ so we're just taking kettles of hot water and just pouring it on me and you know doctors are in and now this twin 12 people in and out of the the the hotel room to make sure I'm okay and to make sure that I could cut the weight and I was just as such a like an adrenaline fuckin like on 10 I'm like just get out you know I'm screaming at everybody literally I was in the tub I was crying like my but to me I was like there's no way I'm not making this weight and six pounds in about an hour maybe two hours cuz I weighed in about nine o'clock or so or I mean uh about 9:30 10:00 or so six pounds in two hours this it was brutal but I think that just kept me at such a such at in on my adrenaline I never really understood how to bring it back down you know and probably try and talk to me and try and tell me like hey calm down like you know take a few deep breaths like yeah yeah I'm breathe or whatever I'm when I wasn't listening to it [Applause]
