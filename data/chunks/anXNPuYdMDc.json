hello freak bitches yes so if we replaced a sacred for Rebecca I think we'd be alright but noses it's one of the things I don't like about labels like I like intent and intent like my idea of sacred is not like God like it's not like us um it's not a deity this unnamed unknown word that's been passed down from person to person it's based on personal experience based on a real thing so when I say sacred like my luck my love for my children is sacred wood you know like I say it now you know I don't you know and say it like in terms of like harps and the clouds and all that kind of jazz and when we were talking about like don't be an asshole to people you care about like doesn't mean it certainly doesn't mean I'm some sort of a perfect person certainly doesn't mean that I have been an asshole and then sometimes when you responding to someone else being retarded or something about being ridiculous you can be an asshole because you don't have the patience for it anymore because you don't have the at the moment you don't have the temperament to maturity yeah what yeah it could be maturity it could be you're overwhelmed there's a lot of variables so like if someone hears this and says you know all well man I've been an asshole lately maybe I'm a bad person like it's just recognizing those moments where you probably could have handled something better and continuing to improve and then also this idea is this is a really important one because people have this idea that somehow I'm 30 years old I shouldn't be doing this anymore I'm 50 years old I should have learned by now that's all bullshit throw that away toss that shit aside you like these ideas of numbers that people have in their head that by a certain age you should stop you are alive and if you are alive and if you are thinking all those numbers that you keep attaching well you know when Einstein was thirty he tore it shut the fuck up stop doing that that that is a waste of your time and stop saying to yourself I should be better by now I'm such a total non helping thought what you need to think of is life you're living you're alive right now and if you've made a mistake and you're still continuing to learn and grow that's all data but the thing that freaks me out the most about Rockhold is the the flexibility and dexterity of his legs it takes so long to develop that kind of whip you know like his kicks aren't just heart like Weidman has strong kicks they're strong like he throws them but there's a stiffness to him that rockhole doesn't have Rockhold's got like a Taekwondo thing going of course I did I took him down in your face I took him in I took him in but don't kid yourself had my hand on his back a couple times Brian came back from Hales loose I got his hair cut just like him I went the fuck you doing is around Luke so I wanted to get my hair cut like away you're 48 copy I was in we caught eyes and I looked at my way I totally yeah and he goes he's smiling he went six three and I go of course you are and I looked at his hair and I go I think you got deeper with your voice that's weird and I went right to Supercuts Luke Rockhold you fucking try and fingers I'm a friend Tariq who trains Luke goes hey counts here I think you'd suck Luke's dick we asked them to alright I'll do it just as a goof don't tell anybody I think by and large people can have the perspective that you have they can say well looks to me like everybody did it so ok then they can look to the line and they that's where they really start to not like it I say this guy lied to us repeatedly but of course you get you know Mike there's no defense to that but if I could if I could share any personal insight I mean once you lie once you just keep lying you keep lying if I'm gonna sit here you know this is 15 years ago and Joe you're a nice guy yeah I mean if I was on this podcast I would have lied to your fucking face a million times just so you know I would just show you know just so you know but that's not a surprise to you or anybody else but but once you're in there it's as if I'm gonna go you know this guy Joe seems like a really nice guy I think I'm gonna be real I'm gonna be honest with him too much money there's no way you can't what's that yeah so I was I was stuck for lack of a better word in that in that distant that lie or that deception but then the way that I took my competitive nature which served me well in training and in racing and took it into the real world took it into a press conference took it into a personal relationship took it into former teammates my relationship was that would that's the part where people go okay fuck this guy forever right I'm done and so that you know you got sort of three phases none of them are good but as it got further away that you know lack of respect for others is the thing that totally fucked me and you know to that I would I would say to anybody that I understand and and I may be in their timeout forever I have the only thing I will add that that may sound like I'm trying to defend myself is I've I've tried to make amends with all those people right the ones that we all know the ones people talk about I've traveled the world I've sat with them I've said I've looked him in the eyes and said what I did was totally unacceptable and I'm sorry and almost everybody has accepted the apology and and we've moved on but that doesn't get to this this you know this crowd of people that that you can't sit with face-to-face and you can't say you're sorry I mean I can talk to you we can talk about it some people may view that as an apology or own or not but but the ones that I could go sit with I did and that's all that I would add to that and I and I and I I mean I'm proud that most of those people and I say most on everybody because not everybody's ready but most of those people said you know what we're good we're done and so if it was my son and he acted that way first of all I'd say the fuck you doing you can't act that way but I had no nobody who's standing over me do it going dude what what are you you're acting like an asshole nobody did that so but if my son did that I would say you get over there and you make it right with that person so that's where it is and here we go well there was that like what I can only describe as like a gun bodega which is fascinating because it sold all these different guns like it might sell like a beautiful antique you know pearl inlaid revolver that like someone's dad had but then also grenades and stuff and grenades grenades yeah because you know in case someone tried to kidnap you you could have it have a fucking great you're coming with me bitch yeah basically basically yeah so you know we're walking through this town and that was I think the scariest thing that I ever did in my life but it all turned out fine and we got to the media office which it was a government building that that these young men had taken over when they kicked out the central government and I'm the director of it had been kidnapped by Isis and the young guys are there like watching watching soccer because the everyone everyone loves soccer there and it was just I don't know it's like this feeling of being in this place where the whole world is both fucking with it and abandoned it both at once you know and and anything could happen so that was the most dangerous thing I've ever done like nothing I've ever done was as dangerous as going to Syria but I think the most personally disturbing thing was I was in Gaza six months ago I guess and I went to Tsutaya which is this neighborhood that was completely destroyed by Israel during protective edge like they bombed it and then they went in with tanks and then they went in with bulldozers like so it's like flattened and it's just like gone like you know you go there and you're like this is this is a neighborhood that has been wrecked and a lot of times when you see houses that have collapsed you can see all of the stuff of people's lives in it like you're like oh there's the cooking pots and there's the bed and there's all the stuff that's just trapped in and then people because there's a big housing shortage obviously in Gaza we're living in these bombed out buildings where their home was and you know with like no real like services or anything like I saw this I was walking it was kind of scrambling through this like building to take pictures and then I just randomly walked into what I thought was an abandoned room and there's like an old guy there you know hang it out and you know I was like I'm really sorry too you know and they invade your home and I was just just talking to him but yeah this he had had like a baller gorgeous home you know before this and now he was just living in a little like the wreck of one of the rooms [Music]
