hello freak bitches well why would I put my job on the line to have an opinion about compelled pronouns I know why because the ability to speak your truth is the bulwark against hell and losing your job that's nothing that's nothing compared to where things can go when they go badly for me it was just preventative it's like this isn't going in a good direction well should you take a risk it's like you don't have that choice you're silent that's a risk now most people don't understand the risks of silence I happen to understand the risks of silence because I've been studying them for 40 years is it frustrating for you to get so little support for these actions and for for your protests well I wouldn't say that that's what happened and I mean so little support because you get a lot of support yeah outside of the in the outside of the university it's okay it doesn't matter where the support comes from like I mean it's it's disappointing in the same way that it's disappointing for me to say I think the universities now do more harm than good that's disappointing but but it doesn't it's not surprising to me like it isn't as if intellectuals are characterized by an intrinsic moral superiority oh they're smart so they'll leap to the defense of what's right it's like no there's no evidence for that intelligence and and moral wisdom aren't the same thing like and if you're corrupt and smart all that makes you is way more treacherous it doesn't make you less likely to be corrupt it just makes you much more you're 50 snakes instead of two or you're 56 headed snakes instead of two like I've had clients who were who had very serious personality disorders who are very intelligent it's like that's not necessarily a good thing for them they're just better at arguing for their pathology to themselves that is a real problem where people automatically assume that intelligent people are going to be healthy yeah well they're healthy in that it's like a lot better in the world you know because more marketable and so on but there's no evidence that there's any relationship between intelligence and morality I mean god let me tell you a story man one time I have this client this woman was just ruined she looked like a street person you know and she had very dirty clothes and she was so shy that she couldn't even approach you she had to shield her eyes from you as if you were emitting light and she did that to everyone on the street like she was bent over and and and and humble like like a Chinese peasant brought before the Emperor you know and one of the things I was doing with her in behavior therapy was trying to just get her to present herself in a more normal manner so that people wouldn't shy away from her and you know be instantly prejudiced towards her and and she'd come to the behavior therapy clinic and she wasn't bright this woman she to think she had only had like a seventh grade education she was quite intellectually impaired and she lived with her her sick aunt who was who was schizophrenic and who had like a satanic li possessed alcoholic boyfriend that was always tormenting my client she lived in absolute hell but she had this dog and she used to take it out and walk the dog all the time and then she she'd actually come to the behavior therapy clinic partly because of her own problem but but she'd come to this place called the Douglas Hospital and she'd been an inpatient in the Douglas hospital and in the in the Douglas Hospital there were these long term psychiatric clients and they looked like something out of a Hieronymus Bosch painting or Dante's Inferno I mean these people were this is way worse than one Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest these people were seriously destroyed and they couldn't be let back on in the streets during the institutionalization like they were lifers and she had decided that part of the reason she wanted to come to the hospital is because she had been institutionalized there and she thought that maybe when she took her dog out for a walk she could go and get one of those damn inmates and take them out for a walk too now that was a person who was immoral dumb as a post just screwed in 50 different directions nothing going for her and she had the bloody moral capacity to decide that there was someone worse off than her and believe me that wasn't easy to find that maybe she could do them some good if the hospital would let her which they didn't by the way yeah well that's the story of the soul that's not the intellect that's for sure so so I didn't expect any support from my from my colleagues and and it isn't that I don't care if I got it but it's here it's in some sense it's irrelevant it's irrelevant to me because my goal was I'm not saying those goddamn pronouns and the reason I'm not saying them is because they're made up by left-wing ideologue and I don't like left-wing ideology I don't like ideology period and I know where corruption of speech leads and I'm not going there and you know one of the things I tried to learn when I was taking apart what happened in our wits and trying to put myself in the position of a nosh wits camp guard which by the way you can do if use your imagination a bit I wouldn't call it exactly the world's most pleasant meditative experience but you can call up parts of yourself that would be capable of taking someone who just got off a transport train and having them carry a hundred pound sack of wet salt from one side of the camp compound to the other and back you can conjure that part of yourself up if you want and that'll teach you something about what you're like people don't do it because it's too frightening but I know perfectly well that I could do that sort of thing and so once I learned that I could do that sort of thing and maybe that I could even enjoy it I thought okay fine I get it I'm gonna see if I can figure out how to live so that if that opportunity was presented to me I wouldn't take it and I think that's the lesson that people need to learn from the 20th century it's like that's what human beings did okay well we're all human okay so how is it that we should live so that we don't do that again well part of that is to try to say the truth no matter what because the alternative is worse and it is worse the truth no matter what and that is the real problem that you see with being forced into using the made-up pronouns yeah absolutely it's my language I'll take responsibility for what I say I am NOT saying your words and being compelled to say your words by law well that's that that that makes it that that takes it past the point of absurdity to the point of tyranny and in my estimation and I've seen some criticisms where people are saying you know he's talking about this but really he's grandstanding because no one's doing anything legally but the potential exists that's rubbish yes they wouldn't have changed the damn criminal they put it in the hate speech category and altered the Criminal Code it's as simple as that and then you could say well no we didn't really mean it it's like oh yeah you did you really meant it two of the social justice warriors that have debated me the last two months accused me directly of hate speech all I had to do was poke them a tiny bit and they came right out with it and then the university's legal team reviewed everything I said carefully believe me and they decided that oh it was not only illegal to not use these compelled pronouns it was probably illegal to make a video saying that I wouldn't use them because otherwise why would they write me a warning letter and tell me that I violated University policy on the Ontario Human Rights Act I did that lightly have they acted on this at all is there they won't know well they've acted in that they sent me two warning writers and told me to stop talking and they don't the idea that I was going to be teaching in January again because I teach all my undergraduate courses from January to May that was on the table and I think the only reason that it hasn't happened one of the reasons it hasn't happened and I'm not attributing nothing but malevolence to the university administration because obviously it's very complicated and they did agree to host the debate for example but the idea that I wouldn't be teaching in January and and still might not be isn't this by no means that was a perfectly plausible outcome and had this not caused a firestorm much of which has emerged in support of me then I would say there was a 50/50 chance that I would have had my teaching privileges revoked it's having two other professors so the idea that I'm making like that this is a tempest in a teapot it's like yeah okay fine why did you change the criminal code then and why did you put it under the hate speech laws exactly so nope doesn't wash and I and the fundamental proof of that is the university's response because for sure their legal team crafted those letters you know what was like recalcitrant employee you're responsible for them okay what do you do with a recalcitrant employee you write them a letter telling them what they're doing wrong and asking them to stop then if they don't stop you write them a second letter that's more strongly worded then if they don't stop you write them a third letter even more strongly worded then you take disciplinary action that's like HR 101 that's how you do it so so here we said at the end of November closing in on December you're literally a bit more than a month away and you don't know whether or not you're teaching your courses in January it seems highly probable that I'll be teaching them I wouldn't say it's certain but if I'm teaching them it's because the cost of having me not teach them would now be too high it's not because the university believes that what I'm doing is either necessary or acceptable if someone who's listening to this or watching this feels compelled to act out in your support how can they do that I think they could do the future altering exercise and that that would be the best way to add I'm dead serious about this is like sort yourself out sort yourself where you try to figure out the world and yes that's the primary objective that's your that's your most important thing that you can do so yourself sort yourself out and and marshal your arguments and put yourself in order so that when someone pushes you a little farther than you should go you can say no and you know what's going on now [Music]
