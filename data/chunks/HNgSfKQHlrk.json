hello freak bitches I was lucky enough to fight there in 2004-2005 and we were pulling 40,000 people every show that's me and then we had a lie 40,000 people yeah and that you'd walk out to the arena and then you check out the stage and sometimes you come up through the floor for your walk out or a kid it was just in I'm blue well they had like some elevator it would make you rise up through the floor remember and the back room once I was trying to find the stairs and I've asked a lady whoa where do I go she goes I stand on that thing it's like no way oh yes it's like fuck yes and then I remember coming up through the floor and then all of a sudden they're all that there's 40,000 people right in front of it's like wow he's amazing Wow and then we had a TV audience to 20 million people in Tokyo also so it would be a let delayed broadcast by about an hour or so but time we finish our fight and then on the bus with a ver TV on the bus and we watch was pretty much what's your fight as your way back on the way to the hotel Wow but Thailand was pretty cool to Thailand wouldn't have crowds and song Choi who was fighting for he'd have he'd make all his money from the the TV production so he do live shows in the middle of nowhere and people would drive four hours to be present for a live event and we'd have 40,000 60,000 there's this one big event once here called the King's birthday and we get a hundred thousand people plus every year on the fifth of December oh no she I was lucky to fight on then a four years in a row so the first time I went on the ring it was the first time that oh my knees went weak because as far as I could see was I ocean a heads and I started trembling and then I've come out in the first round I've tried to try to finish him and then by the fifth round I sort of spent my penny as a fellow over a couple of times and then a and losing on points and then the next year got invited back I said I know I'm not gonna get spooked out this time this time like like the USCG is like you talk about all the time and I had the jitters the first on the second time was like nah I'm not gonna I'm gonna this time I'm gonna love it i'm gonna absorb it i'm gonna run with it so I've got out there big breath in hundred thousand people and then I had the greatest fight of my life there was ten Westerners verse 10 toys and I was the only Westerner to win getting high five from ties on the way back the change room and then the last time I did it there was probably only ninety five thousand people a little tiny kid and I was looking back on ah jeez what's gone where is everyone yeah this is this is sad as I was nuts but nine if you could tell the difference between ninety five thousand a hundred thousand there was there was a little spot near the hot dog stand where you could have been another 5,000 people easy absolutely that wasn't an elevator one time with a guy and he recognized me as a comedian and he wanted to do one of my bits to me but he got it wrong and the bit was this old bit i used to do about saying you too at the wrong time getting out of a cab at the airport and the driver goes have a nice flight you go you tow so that's the bit so I'm in the elevator with him this guy and he goes oh you're the comedian right and said yeah yeah hey doing you know when he goes you're the guy that says and you all the time so I'm not gonna call him out on it i'm honored even those who I am so I'm not gonna embarrass him I said yeah that's me that's me and he goes yeah he goes I do that all the time I'm always saying and you at the wrong time and now I'm like now I should I should have corrected it you know what I mean he goes yeah there's probably not a day goes by that I don't yell and and you and I'm thinking this is getting off the tracks so the elevator door opens its in a casino and with a bunch of people and we walk off the elevator I'm going one way and he goes the other way so he starts yelling to me thinking it's gonna be funny what he thinks is my bit in a casino now with hundreds of people and he's going and yo and yo okay and I'm thinking I'm the only guy here who knows what this guy's talking about and I don't know what he's talking about it was very very straight you could run into people man and just you Zig when you should have zagged and you run into someone who's completely out of their fucking mind and they become a part of your life I mean that can happen you could definitely run into the wrong people especially if it's a girl especially if you're single he just for whatever reason start talking to someone and it turns out they're fucking crazy and then you you know spent with men men are willing to willing to look past a lot of shit of a chicks hot like I know a lot of guys that have got involved with girls that are just completely her fucking mind but they're pretty and they're just like oh no she's a little weird but not enough she was a guy you would be running from her and you imagine if that was a gal and she beats she had giant tits yeah I'd be running back towards Earth exactly yeah that's me I'm that good hey man let's do it up you take it to a restaurant she's yelling out and you and you then when then she sees your act and then like she sees an old recording and she sees that bitch as I was open fuck you can't even tell me you had me making an asshole out of myself you're fucking selfish piece of shit you Brian are you doing it like during the wedding vows and she says and you and you go I gotta tell you that is a joke you know when he hosted the ESPYs in 2001 oj simpson was just forced to give his heisman trophy back to Fred Goldman because oj lost the civil suit right so we had to give money reparations back to Fred Goldman and Nicole so he not any money should take my Heisman trophies wear whatever that's worth so Fred Goldman takes it and now he owns it so the next week of the ESPYs norm hosts the ESPYs charles woodson the guy who won the Heisman Trophy the first offensive guy ever sit in the front row first joke norm tells he looks in the front row and he says hey Charles Woodson man you won the Heisman Trophy no one can ever take that away from your first defensive guy to win the Heisman Trophy no one can ever take that away from and everybody applause it's like a real nice thing and it settles down on the room because no one can ever take that Heisman Trophy away and then he pauses and said unless of course you kill your wife and a waiter as I go or it Bob did it really well it was uh yeah it was a radio city oh it was a ken griffey jr. was off oh my god oh my god what did they expect it's no I'm fucking McDonald maybe not that it makes me love him even more norm and I talked we sat next to each other randomly on an airplane talk the whole way back just shot the shit talk about all kinds is that yeah I quit smoking a while ago just done with it and for whatever reason the plane lands and he goes man I just want a cigarette he just walks in this daily he hadn't smoked in like X amount of months but just decided talking about it on the airplane how he quit smoking that he just wanted another surgery grabbed it went outside and he's just smoking I go what happened I go I thought you quit smoking he was I did haha did you tell us now I just I just wanted to cigarette look the movie me and him die i did a buddy comedy with him and it got bad reviews like so the reviewer in my hometown paper said Artie Lange has all the charm of a date rapist cool I'm so norm looks at and he
