trained my day Joe Rogan podcast by night okay now when you guys watch MMA and you see someone like Stephen Thompson that has very few elements of Muay Thai he uses but he uses a lot of sport karate yeah which is uh you know completely different stance a completely different style what's your take on that when you watch that or what his style or when they just say oh it's more time well they definitely don't really mean well it seems like some leg kicks and some techniques but essentially he's doing a sport karate style well it was kind of the same thing with Anderson so it's like just because someone's throwing an elbow just because somebody's has a clinch doesn't necessarily make it Muay Thai there's a lot of arts that have those things you know what I mean and I'm not gonna view him as a Muay Thai fight I think of Anderson is a muy Thai fighter not at all he thought of himself as a Muay Thai fighter that's okay but but I like I wouldn't of you him as a Muay Thai fighter at all I imagine MMA I think anything he did was very muta even his clench was I mean that's such a fundamental basic clinch you know I mean that's just because everyone else was so terrible at it right so I grabbed the neck like you don't see that in high-level Muay Thai guys going up and grabbing each other by the neck it's in transition when they hurt people when they get tired very it's very much us of struggling for dominance over under those kind of things it's like a big sloppy ridiculous armbar yeah dude I mean like like it's like that's like day one Muay Thai so when you saw the like the Rich Franklin fight which we're going where he was in the fuck like how did he not learn this his first day in training and what was even worse was I had a friend that I trained with that went out to help him for the second one and he just didn't want to hear it like they did not want to hear that like dude you don't know what you're doing at all because as what we talked about earlier these guys get to a high level and think that they're maybe would tie technique is good and like dude you are like a kindergartner like you don't know what you're doing at all what so he didn't want to listen so no wow that's crazy actor I look so who was it that went out with him Anthony Brown all the training partner of mine and he was specifically brought there because of his Motown yeah without doubt like why would you why would you bring you know me and if you're not going to use me I've been brought in for people to and like why wouldn't you use what you've brought me in here to do you know what I mean like you brought me in for my Muay Thai for my knowledge in the singing you just want to keep doing what you're good at like why am I here this is stupid that's unfortunate he's such a nice guy and such a smart guy yeah it was a math teacher without doubt how do you not see the math of that it's when people aren't people have a false sense of where they're at in the sport and what they can do and like you literally know nothing and but you have this mentality that you're decent at stand-up you're decent at Muay Thai and you're terrible compared to someone that really does know what they're doing right you know I mean most people's understanding is very elementary if that mmm you know you take another person and I'm gonna I could beat you without even like touching you you know I mean JIT and just let you mess yourself up because you don't really know what you're doing it's uh it's crazy to think that someone could reach a world championship level in something that involves Muay Thai but there's so many variables like yeah there's wrestling there's two Jitsu there's all these things there's you can get away with a lot more like the striking in MMA you can get away with because of those variables because of the smaller gloves because of the takedowns you know you put that person in the ring with even a moderately good Muay Thai person a moderately good boxer they're gonna get murdered right I mean right right just like you can bring like a really good mood a fighter in but they don't have any wrestling different defense or no jiu-jitsu they're not gonna do it be able to do exactly exactly looks like an idiot yeah it's well that's one of the appeals of MMA yeah is that the guy who wins is most likely the best fighter because if it was just more Thai or if it was just wrestling or if it was just you Jitsu you would see someone who's the best at that but when you throw everything in like it's the kitchen sink get in there yeah and that's when you know you get to see like who's been it's even more complex puzzle yeah well that's why I like I've never really understood the argument of like pitting this person against that person or like who's got the best movie no mate well nobody because they're not doing more they're doing MMA right so that that argument that conversation is completely invalid like oh if you put this boxer in against this Muay Thai fighter who's going to win I don't know what rules are they fighting under they're fighting under multi roles each part going to get crushed right you know I mean well it's interesting that wonderboy Thompson is going to fight tyron woodley who's the UFC welterweight champion and who's is a super powerful wrestler but he's also training with Duke Rufus who's obviously very talented knows a lot about more time great coach um when you see a guy like that what the reason why I keep bringing up wonderboy Stiles because it's so unique you know we brought up Raymond Daniel's in glory who's one of the only guys that has like that similar background here and then Michael Page of course in MMA fights for Bellator has a very similar style to that sport karate style what are the holes in that style like what's what's the pros and cons you see as well as I might what we were speaking of earlier it's it's if you've never applied that in a fight a real fight not-not-not points borrowing not not not not that the kind of thing there's certain techniques and things that are completely worthless and unfortunately in a lot of those sports you're not you don't get exposed by that until it's way too late so you're trying these techniques that you know a decent person just going to walk right through because they look good and they're flashy and they're great on the pads and in and all that but but when you have to damage someone right well obviously Thompson knows how to do that though obviously knows how to fight in its in its using those techniques but applying them in a more fight centric way and it's a completely different thing but when you see what I was trying to get at is that such a weird style where he's down sideways and he leaps in and out and he moves back and forth from the waist like a snake I mean he's got a lot of there's a lot of weirdness yeah the way he moves and it's it's very difficult to find anybody that has that level skill with sport karate kickboxing but also has a really good wrestling base - yeah yeah and I think that's one of the biggest things and why he's able to apply those things because because he can deal with the wrestling and everything else that goes in so so that's why you'll see him throw those techniques because he's not as worried about it as someone who might be just as good as him with those things in has zero grounder wrestling what they're not going to throw because I'm they're gonna get taken down crushed yeah it's like we were talking about your experience in a Taekwondo school that you went there the first day start doing sparring you threw a low kick and then like get out of here get out of here time to go yeah so you do it something too effective yeah so being able to apply things in a real fight and being able to apply them in the air is very different right obviously we see Thompson can apply them in a real fight yeah what is he doing that you see that's different like me obviously is not a Muay Thai fighter he's a kickboxer but like when you see that stance that weird stance at sideways stance think about that oh I don't think much about cuz I don't watched a lot of anime you know I mean I do a little right I don't I wouldn't say I follow it you know I mean I watch when it's on and but I'm not you know like paying attention to the fighters or tracking them throughout the years you know that much I'm just so curious because you're so Muay Thai you know your style so more time you're obviously an expert at I'm always curious as to like how a person like you observes an expert striker in sort of another realm well I think he's an expert and he's become an expert striker in MMA so he's he's applying all the techniques that he known that he knows and have worked for him in MMA so it's different than if he would get in the ring and do Muay Thai yeah how many fighters like him have done more time obviously Raymond Daniels has done kickboxing and some you know in it but it's another one of those things where being able to apply the things from your other sport into that it's so like we were talking about with the Raymond Daniel's and Nicky hold skin like he just walked him down like bop bop crushing the leg valtellina too so so at a certain level it kind of you you lose that like where you're you're spinning flashy techniques are going to work against you know those mid-level guys but you put them in there with the best in the world and a lot of that stuff gets exposed in is not working out so well and you you think that essentially demonstrates the effectiveness of muy Thai at the highest levels you think it demonstrates the the holes and some of the sting and techniques um if I'm not flinching on the things you do and don't really care so much about you hopping around and spin around I'm just walking down crushing you mmm you know that that's where that kind of gets exposed so it's like it's like putting a boxer into a muay thai if I don't to do is kick your legs and you can't punch me right I know I mean but you take a boxer and teach them how to defend though those kicks and stand in a little bit more of a squared up way and where I can't use you use your weakness against you as much you're going to have much better success even if you never throw kick now you just can take those kicks better and just kill me with your high level
