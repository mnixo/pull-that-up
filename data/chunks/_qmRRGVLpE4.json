hello freak bitches Alex oh that weekend in there sometime you and Wako you know wake her first and there now I lost touch with him after that he reeked and he liked me again actually after I wrote the minister goats like he didn't like me after I wrote my book them which includes all this stuff about being sneaking into Bohemian Grove uh-huh because he thought I was too much of a debunker of Bohemian Grove but then when I wrote the minister at goats he liked me again because he felt that I was like the minister goats is kind of like a conspiracy book and all right yeah so um how much different is it then should we keep going with this bohemian girl yeah okay so Alex and Mike decided to go in via the undergrowth like I saw them so they went in through the bushes they wouldn't say the bushes and there was a lot of poison okra just walked in yeah man Rick the lawyer this kind of preppy lawyer oh it's only the funniest thing I've missed out of this story was it was the night before we were going to infiltrate Alex and Mike decided to practice being preppy they woke up at like the corridor outside their motel rooms talking in a kind of effeminate way about micro processes like you know I think I just a nano technologies the future yeah I do Johnny read that tried to kill him so he jumped off a building land in a dumpster first that's what people thought but he lived and he from the government on the first to the bartender and he torment the bartender to that check was done then they throw him out for the first and they were last little about the 18th or 19 when I was a kid I used to torment Johnny Reed he'd gone through you know on the East Coast you lock the bathroom from the outside of the East Coast when you leave a bar at night when they close up right they locked the bathroom then they put like a lock ball so if you break in they can't he would go in the bathroom Johnny really 11 o'clock in the morning to pee and we locked him in there we leave him in there till like 6 o'clock at night we come back to have a drink we'd open the bathroom and he'd come out like nothing I swear to God like nothing happened he was hilarious my dick on a chair see what happens he's like Wow and he just got up so Johnny relived it's like maybe 12 years ago we still get bumps of coke and get them riled up at the bar they just leave fuck you motherfuckers I'll fight all these they just fucking leave hilarious anyway did you uh did you ever have a girl you dated to kill herself no hey should I put that fucking helmet well for police it's even worse because we're perpetuating that situation so work we're the ones doing that cycle so when we see a sixty one time I was a shift commander in Eastern District and I'm telling my guys stop pulling over old white ladies stop pulling over that young cute girl stop we focus on who commits the crimes and who commits the crimes in Baltimore 16 to 24 year old black males that's who's committing the crimes so focus on them that makes sense until you complete the cycle and realize that you started doing that because of institutionalized racism in your organization and so when you are jacking up those guys in the corner and you do find that dime bag so you sent him to jail now he can't go to work the next day so he loses his job and then he can't make it to court so he gets his license suspended and then he's driving and then you are focusing on those 16 2014 also now you're more likely to pull them over now you pull him over now he has a suspended license now he gets his license revoked and now he can't get to the job legally and you and now now he's dealt it's left with selling drugs on the corner so you were creating it we have to step back and realize what the facts are and what we're doing and the number one problem is the drug war and then we have money and politics those are our two big issues that we have to solve before we get anywhere well what is the money in politics how does that play so I don't think we can change anything until we stop having politicians that are serving their donors versus serving the people so somebody that's talking like me is never gonna run a police agency as long as all their corporate donors are saying no no no you keep those animals in the cages because that's what they do I mean that's like a joke in Baltimore that police are actually the zoo keepers you keep everything in and don't let it hit the county so so that's that's our role that's what we're doing so your mayors and your politicians are gonna continue to encourage that they're not gonna take a risk and say all right how do we lower juvenile possession of marijuana you know that I know you do you know you legalize it yeah when you control it and rates actually go down whether we're overseas Aurora Colorado your possession rates for marijuana will go down among juveniles but we don't do that we keep looking at everything like we're a hammer searching for nails and we keep looking for what we're gonna hit to stop it instead of standing back and using science and figuring out what are we actually going to do to fix this problem what will actually have results there are there are behaviors this book the murder rooms so fucking incredible discovery Walter there are behaviors that people do like certain guys will rape and kill a woman but when they're raping her if she dies in the process they'll stop immediately because they don't want the cops to think they're freaks mmm got all kinds of weird shit like but that was the thing about this Green River guys and he didn't want them to know that he fucked them after they were dead right he didn't want to admit it because he had an ego and the guy in the way got him doing those look you tights and you wouldn't be the first guy a lot of guys are done that's right he's like okay yeah actually they used to they got a guy a high-level terrorist who had never seen porn and they started showing him porn and I said and he it was like the carrot and stick and he was like like can do you want to see more of this scene and he started talking just to see it no he was he became up in a very strict Islamic society so they showed him some dicks like these really hot girls you can win much excitement - let me tell you something man belladonna and Kira will get you talking if you held on will get you
