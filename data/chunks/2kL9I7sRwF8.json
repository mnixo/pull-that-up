the Joe Rogan experience join my day Joe Rogan podcast one night all day good idea right yes my feet up on that the first my favorite ask I might have got it from you maybe we're off we recording who citing that simple we're in hike ladies and gentlemen we're a hike you're wearing forty five pounds on you yeah the packs about five or six and the weight plates about forty five yeah close to your face oh sorry okay by the way this is how much this is what I walk around with and sorry this is what I walked around with it up and in Southeast Asia oh yeah about this this setup yeah well yeah I mean the way it hooks onto your waist yeah and then the over the shoulder and over the middle to over your chest oh for a backpack mm-hmm yeah yeah and about the same amount of weight forty five pounds plus whatever else have been hanging on damn that was so you just carried your life on your back carried everything I have did you bring a laptop fuck no wow you're kidding me so tell people did because they were like how to upload pictures shit the two weekers did that right but almost anyone who's gone for like more than a month was like you could just go to an internet cafe right yeah if you have to yeah and you would just log in your Gmail yeah exactly and then but you had to deal with that notification thing right yeah a couple times even though I started that Gmail just the new Gmail just for the fucking travel they still fucked it was still like well this looks suspicious I'm like yeah it looks suspicious should I'm in fucking nowhere I mean Indonesia absolutely but any like can we there's no other way there's no like what's your father's you know what's your mom's maiden a god is gorgeous ready right yeah yeah did your kids are so fucking big now I know it's weird right yeah little humans yeah I couldn't believe it when I saw them I was like I was just like no way what do you see the oldest yeah grown-ass woman it's very strange dude and one day we're going to be old men we were kind of old men right now two kids yeah well all day we're going to be old men yeah I'm getting grades already dude nobody rides for free yeah I was asked cash address yeah everybody pays yeah it's crazy isn't it I mean just and everybody think you know it's the sort of the same feeling that I have when I talked to people about asteroid impacts yeah nobody wants to believe it's possible what someone's smashing into the that and a big rock from the sky I've been obsessed with it for years we saw one you saw that in Joshua Tree oh Jesus - it lit up it was it burned for like 15 seconds my hair those are so tear it was so cool it was red and which is like that's not a we were all mushrooms but everyone had to stay in that same hook that's a I mean to rock yeah I just had burned off burned off burned off until it was just went out but it lasted for a while we were looking for uh what's the cult you know shooting stars and stuff mm-hmm the stars out there so great oh yeah man I'll be out here too huh nah we got some light pollution a little light pollution but it's not bad it's definitely better than the city but um you really want to go out there like in Hawaii holy shit what the stars amazing really yeah I was in lanai last week yeah and the stars were just stunning man he just laid back and look up at him like you see the Milky Way see everything everything you see that that's what's that like that's lying down the middle sometimes you know just a really big line yeah it says thick clouds and looks white what's this on yeah what's that what's this animal dog shit no that's coyote the reason why you could tell is because there's berries in it really yeah coyotes are kind of omnivores they're weird little animals but they don't attack people right yeah they do they do yeah they do if they have an opportunity well like we have some sort of a fucking truce yeah which is like you alone with the coyote well right they would go for it a woman in Canada was killed a couple years back 19 year old promising folk singer there's more coyote you can see the hairs in it that's yeah that's an animal that's been eating things it might be a mountain lion but I don't think so might be a bobcat Wow but I remember that with that female Canadian singer apparently where she was the real problem is they have they have a real lack of things for them to eat and so the Coyotes are approaching well the Coyotes there will even take off a moose no well yeah well as a packer button so as a pack they just attacked the legs until it can't go anywhere yeah just keep chasing it and biting its legs really yeah some of them get kicked in the head and killed while they're doing that mean they just take chances because there's no food they have no food so they found this chick walking by herself whoops and it's a horrible way to die man because they eat you asshole first oh so he's still alive as a girl yeah there yeah she's still a lot they tearing her apart they don't kill you first they have no interest I don't care about hi okay yeah they were eating you start chewing you apart and when they got her she was still alive torn apart and then they took her the hospital she died I think wait would they found her alive yeah pretty sure - oh she was just fucked up like how many made you add no first it takes a while - what do you mean a so first that's what they do to animals they kill you by eating you asshole first yeah that's what coyotes do wolves do the same thing they start at your asshole right horrible reason for real your uncle the most yeah for real like they start at your asshole yeah it's a terrible way to die so I'm hiking in these vibrant alive are there shoes to go to their minimalist shoes is like almost no padding there's just some tread you see oh yeah yeah it's like heavy socks yeah this tread but there's very literate get those uh what's the thing on your heel when it hurts no no I mean go to rock so I'm gonna feel the rocks it's just toughening up my seat just doing it's making my feet stronger the way it's been described to me is that your foot when you're in a regular shoe your foot is liking a cast and that uh just like how if you ever had a broken arm you get that castle the arm is atrophied yeah or yeah I like that yeah yeah for sure you do something with your foot the foot is walking around this cast all the time so it doesn't exercise all the straw strong muscle groups and your toes and and these things actually lost a class-action lawsuit I think because a bunch of people took them they started running and doing a bunch of shit they got hurt really yeah someone's column section here can't believe I do like cool this is not important fuck you fuck you their level class actually cuz people getting hurt trying to run on fucking boulders and shit well because they lost the lawsuit because people were suing them because they said that they they made unwarranted claims or something along those lines that's what illness D cigarettes really yeah because they were like safer than smoking and the FDA is like wait why do you think that yeah obviously like no knob you can't just go be a medical science you have to like test it yeah they don't have like years and years of cancer behind yeah proved I mean they could easily be causing some new kind of cancer I mean who the fuck knows and they can also be wary safer but just like you got up yeah prove it man don't say it so I'm with these shoes I'm one of the things that people who are big proponents of them like this guy mark Sisson who's the author of the primal blueprint he's a he's a really well-respected endurance athlete and then went on to become like his coach and there's a lot of online stuff and writes books about diet and exercise he says you got to take it slow because essentially your foot is just not used to really working it's used to being protected by like your toe basing out another for balance especially with these things these things your toes are all individually moving and essentially it's just providing you a little bit of a thick layer underneath to keep you from getting cut oh well your foot does all the work I met these people in Cambodia it had a on this island this is parasite that lives there and they just get it you see this worm inside your leg and shit oh Jesus yeah and you gotta go to the hospital and take it out but like or maybe drink some stuff I forget how they got rid of it but it's just like everybody was like it's not gonna happen to me and I like yeah happens to you Susan yeah I just need a little bit of scratch as you're walking near by them I know if we're in well yeah you can see it inside your skin like moving oh I can fuck in Wrath of Khan I had this guy on my podcast recently dr. Robert Sapolsky he's an expert in well he's a expert a lot of things but one of the things he specializes in is this parasite called Toxoplasma that's the Brazilian one right yeah yeah and he was freaking me the fuck out do you have it I've definitely have it yeah yeah yeah if it's that anger thing oh yeah the crazy thing to read yeah what is just like get mad and fuck all the time yeah it's to get mad and fuckers ease yeah it's um he says fifty percent of population has in the world yep fifty percent nobody in Poland no one no I'm just like I'm stereotyping it's so crazy how it works how it infects the cat and the only place where it can reproduce is in a cat's digestive tract and that's how it forced itself to survive yeah by like drinking a rat into going near a cat it killed the rats fear of cats so again you see there's two here and there yeah that's an animal it's killing animals most likely that's a coyote but that's pretty big that's that's some big shit that bears on here no not out here but not too far away Santa Barbara has bears or the rattlesnakes here yeah it's got to be that road I ran over one what yeah with my dogs a couple years back was a waterfall yeah where I thought it was a stick there's a big stick across the ground and as I was jumping over the dogs already past it I realized in the air I was jumping over a fat it was huge dude with looking at you know anybody just go for work and try to stay there as long as you could no I puts the dogs away and then I because that was when I had pit bulls and there they would go out there you got all three times by rattlesnakes yep I just have to take them to the doctor and super expensive to get anti-venom you know huge pain to dick yeah but where were we oh yeah Toxoplasma yeah it affects the rats convinces the rats that cats not only does it take away the fear of cats yeah but it rewires their sexual reward system and makes them attracted to cat piss that's amazing they get hard on so that's amazing since that's like if there was nobody reproducing if there was some disease it was like no fat chicks are pretty yeah and then you just have to go for them yeah just like have you heard of this new tick there's a new tick para new tick disease and for sure the answer's no I've not heard of it well it gives you a meat allergy and it's spreading through Texas so it's called the lone Star tick so you're allergic to me tough yeah got it literally and then we got to well there's a is a chemical called alpha-gal it's like Al Fogle actes or some shit and forget how to say it but this stuff is in this tick bite and when it gets in your system it makes you literally allergic to me and so people who are like rabid carnivores radio lab did an art or podcast about it yeah the podcast is called alpha gal alpha gal alpha gal gee al yeah like a girl yeah and so it makes religious to meet so that broke to what end was it what purpose well some no purpose oh just it's just the site looks like Lyme disease it's a side effect of getting bit by a tick these cranky bugs are tired of our bullshit too many of us man if they teamed up yeah I started thinking about it when people said like you know you could could you beat like 12 12 year olds a fuck up twelve twelve year old okay sure maybe one hundred percent what if they're organized I don't they don't have a chance they don't have a chance no they all come at you at once no and they don't care about getting beat up first of all everybody cares about getting beat up you're talking about nonhumans now well I'm but if you start training them at a young age I'm gonna fuck them up but you don't have a chance the first ones going to get kicked into a brillant kick hard for sure and the other ones are going to panic and then I'm just going to start smashing so okay okay I like that's I'm a 200-meter all likely I go right through those cunts yeah yeah if they're just like hey go beat up Joe and whoever beats them up gets the lollipop you can take those guys but if it's a trained army of 12 year olds they're fucked cuz I'm trained listen if I had a fight me and ten other dudes what a fight a 500-pound man that's more coyote shit that one's a weird-looking one yeah Saul Barry yeah you berries eat a lot of berries yeah if I had to get ten friends yeah and we had a fight a 500-pound hulking man yeah I would be fucked who'd be fucked we'd be fucked we didn't have a chance what about twelve like Duncan Trussell could you take that a little bit bigger now his current form hurt more absolutely all up we'd have a chance run by the beard one of them in front of me at some point yeah and all you have to do is hit that one and the other one I'm gonna panic that's why I never said about the Bruce Lee movies when they would come out of one of the time exactly and maybe sometimes two at a time but never in the same place like it was just like oh right I can just grab them just grab them the problem with Duncan is he wouldn't be able to really do any damage if he got close he could punch you square in the jaw and you'd laugh it off like ba Baracus yeah you'd be like okay that's not all you got yeah but if you had to deal with like three Bert Kreischer right I'm probably gonna get fucked up even though he's not a trained fighter most likely you'd have to you have to really make sure you connect hard on that first guy the first guy you have to take out immediately hard as hard as you can yeah you have to ask them you also have to show consequences for everybody else to let them know like hey you're not to get a free shot on me I'm going to fuck it you're the luck stomp their face and eyes are down oh yeah they take my dad's what they taught him the Israeli army and these are the old days you know and they said there's a good chance it's gonna be you with no weapons up against two Arabs with no weapons like that's a decent chance and he said here's what you do look in both in you look at the one on the whatever on the right let's say and then you just keep the one of the left in the balls as hard as you can just as hard as you can and try to incapacitate in that way it goes one-on-one you'll beat any Arab range yeah hilarya hasn't attitude yeah well they're still well-trained in the air which were kind of like you know militia armies yeah doing fucking you know calisthenics you know I'm the fucking jungle gym to Train and they go to be him and then go back and kill the first one hmm interesting then you get up to raise a kitten and then say yeah that's my favorite they make you raise it like the eggs in home AK yeah and then uh then you had to break a snack right to break it's not get to present a healthy kitten that you've raised for weeks was that beautiful pound yeah you get a lot of crayfish in those ponds really yeah when it was raining a lot this would turn into a river and like during the middle of the spring hopes the middle of spring it was pretty thick with water down here he would go all the way up to that high spot over there where over there I see those rocks you got a little bit higher like maybe 2 or 3 feet above where the water was pretty awesome but that was just when all the water was coming down from the mountains it all comes down here huh yeah I was the runoff of the snow then followed by the heavy rains that we had for days and days yeah we had some amazing rainfall really yeah the point where my basement got flooded really yep for people like complaining about it in Hollywood yeah lot because all these days we need rain near a and then it happened two years later and like enough with this dude three days in a row people are going over this room I shut the fuck up no one feels the goddamn drought in in Hollywood exactly they're just like now I get about my water wife but I just turn the water on I don't good the waters right here yeah and then there's no corn suddenly and you're like what happened well I feel like people need some kind of weather in order to really appreciate the good the good stuff like you need some rain yeah like that was like growing up in the East Coast it snowed so when summertime came around you appreciate it you're in your shorts yeah yeah we love Italy I'm it got those 60 and you're like let's do this fucking summer that's my favorite thing about New York everyone feels it together right and then when it's finally gets warm the whole city's like we did it you guys who survived some of us not all of us yeah and then it's like let's enjoy let's go out there's something to that for sure in a over where I was it's three seas instead of four winter summer and rainy oh really yeah and when it's rainy season it's rainy season well I think that it's like just like every single day Wow yeah I think that's good I think it's indicative of sort of family what's wrong with California what directly yeah we're like spoiled rich kids were like a trust-fund baby Jesus what I'm lizard fucking loser but he came right at me Jesus who's threatening which is trust fund babies for weather yeah we're just so used to everything being amazing in January all you need is a t-shirt the fuck is that in January man and what the fuck we went skiing gonna hung out jeans and a t-shirt it's insane yeah help you any of these trails these Gray's are great nobody's ever on them too I go running these things do the same for the weekends oh yeah I mean to me it's like I'll never try to do anything on a weekend because that's when the amateurs come out right like Runyon yeah it's like don't even don't just wait till Monday yeah there's got to be a benefit to doing this kind of weirdo jobs yeah and that is you know like golf on a Wednesday right exactly they'll get stuff all right not just a little window should we go back yeah oh yeah Dennis all uphill on the way back is the first up hill Matt this guy's the fucking ranking man yeah great exercise too man yeah you get some Sun on your skin and hiking with weight on your back it's amazing yeah good for your legs so I did a three day hike in Myanmar and some company like take your stuff to like another location and all you do is go with like a day pack oh yeah yeah but it you know 15 petrol 15 pounds is what you got on you and it's great you come out of it so fucking refreshed and feel good and just like okay now time for a beer I've earned it you want to pause before the uphill we can okay where's the FO right there well usually around here if I'm running a mile and a half yeah I stopped right at that crest you run all this I run all this in those go troops yep no fuck yep Wow yeah I go hard dude I'm trying to get in really good shape for hunting yeah because um the kind of shape I'm in is like jujitsu shape kickboxing shape weightlifting shape quick yeah it's quick burst instead of long a big difference jeans added hiking hiking in the mountains in particular so nevertheless give up what golf ball why is it here somebody uh powers up there and you have a weird thing about litter which I don't but when I'm in the fucking woods that's when I have the weird thing I was so yeah I never let her mouthing up one item people get weird with me about how weird I am with litter well you get weird about cigarette butts on Sunset Boulevard yeah it's like they have Mexicans for this ah they're coming I chase receipts down the street that are yours yeah I know I hate I hate the idea that I'm littering I remember being in Denver once with like with the women we toured yeah as like a posse yeah and we get mad at I think me and red band was like don't fucking go out there what is their home on the ground in beautiful Denver yeah yeah saying people with cigarettes do they just throw it on the ground step difficult go to window their car they just don't want to see it it's out of sight out of mind Oh what is that good a trick some kind of bug yeah that is it dick dude you kill that fucker why'd you learn you kill it well there's a million of them go away and bite your mom just like Peter Parker me everyone Peter Parker yeah the guy killed Uncle Ben you let him go let him go you're right let that take out their lung disease we're definitely thinking about it dude if I go back and I get that fucking meat disease I'll be so bad at you if it's a chick or any chance I was out George I go you find that content of no way no at some time you could find them if you were totally dedicated you think so yeah you can go that far but he's still a good mom foot square I was a tick though right I think it was flat red looked very ticking now luckily for us there's not a whole lot of Lyme disease out here but it does exist and it's spreading what happens if you have a tick that's no longer Z's but it still gets you yeah so they just make you weak yet makes you itchy just kunti little bugs trying to suck blood out of you I pulled them off my dogs for they swell up yeah yeah they swell up with blood and it just Oh to discussed it I was in shock speaking of litter where's that southern southern Vietnam so Ho Chi Minh they took about 10 hour bus down damn yeah my man is travelin but is this like floating forest where these trees grow out of this like just this water and there's like lily pads everywhere so it just looks like grass and trees coming out but you're on a boat through it yeah it's pretty great it's pretty great but then we get off the boat and get onto the dock and this fucking Chinese guys are the worst travelers I mean for the worse he just dumps a cigarette and you're like dude come on oh he's here man uh there's no street-sweeping here in the fucking woods did you say something now of course not pussy oh I don't want conflict but also it's like what am I going like yeah Chinese travels are the worst that's why the Great Barrier Reef is dead really because they say please don't put on sunscreen and Chinese people like I'm just going to put on all the sunscreen I have how about that no kidding so they say don't put on sunscreen in the area of the Great Bear while you're scuba diving also you're covered in a wetsuit right like you don't really need just a little on your neck and prolong like 45 minutes before so that's what's killing the rethus you um screams a dead reef now it's dead we're gonna clear dead wow yeah which means it might be more than 50% dead or something but like it's been declared dead we've holy shit one of the greatest things in our fucking world holy shit killed by sunscreen hmm and man's encroachment dude I used to get sunscreen in my eyes when I used to your factory I would do fear factor and I come to the store yeah and I still have sunscreen on my forehead and I would start sweating and the sunscreen getting my eyes it was fucking terrible would sting so bad yeah remember being on stage is crying tears run down later oh because I have it on for the day yeah head on during the day or at night I'd be tearing not to explain to people so I was shooting outside all day not good and I got sunscreen in my fucking eyes that shit's terrible for you can't smoke odor can a cigarette or weed come on man I don't smoke cigarettes oh yeah you can smoke weed we could smoke someone Ari Shaffir brought we'd hike I like it yes it was like I can't I've cut down a lot on weird you should try weed and yoga it some dude I did a bunch of yoga out there did you like 12 times who liked it yeah I got to the point where it gives one of my goals I want to touch my toes uh-huh and I started right below the knee and when I did it like I've done it I can almost touch your toes now yeah that's a lot more flexible than you yeah that's great yeah that's one of the best things for your health mmm-hmm and then just while I was on boats and shit I would just like do it a little bit you know and you take these classes they would teach you some moves and you're like I'll reproduce that when I'm sitting waiting for a bus well you don't have a phone but if you did have a phone you just use your app or a couple classes yeah yeah well you if you have a computer of a computer obviously when you go on the road or even at your house just turn on a yoga program on YouTube just someone who's got a yoga workout you follow the yoga workout it's simple you have to go anywhere you have to do anything oh yeah it's amazing and once you learn it then you can get in yeah I know you don't use a phone but I have an app on my phone that shows me the move and then times me brilliant tells me to stop yeah good night I could do that at home yeah do that you know there are a bunch of things where I'm like do mr. phone for that do you have one for that well what you're doing is admirable though you realize your limitations I've slacked off heavy on social media I've backed way what for what we get work done right that you do understand that is uh it draws you out my writing it's gotten much much more prolific in much better I was thinking about your approval or the way you puck I've hit your last specials you know I think of it but you think a lot of that got I mean some people said what about this podcast is always working as mine was like who's already doing podcast for years you think some of this back of the store yeah canal just in front of like people yeah I know you back in the store crank me up cracked me up crank me up another solid notch you see some other great comics yeah it's just being back there - I got energized and then getting all the support from all the people because I'm back there again - and being around like a real camaraderie seen a real scene of peers where I wasn't Eddie - like before I was just showing up and I would do gigs and I get out of there like with Diaz you know I do other road with you guys and I'd have fun then but when I was working out the haha or The Improv I just go and do my Stang get the fuck out of there so heck yeah it's still arm hanging in hours for hours - with the carnie just not yesterday whatever last week yeah and what's the first time in there a long time we used to go there all the time all the time for me it was like more than a decade wasn't it idea nothing at Carney's how long he's gone for seven years seven years Wow yeah crazy Wow seven long-ass years but I had really great sets really did good specials and bad specials when I was gone but the bad special that I did wasn't bad but it wasn't real good it was 2012 ramped me up for the 2014 1 which was talking monkeys in space which was really good and then that ramped me up for triggered which is probably my best one but I think this new one's going to be better people are talking about your new stuff of the store I haven't seen enough of it but the door guy was like oh it's like on another level now I think you're like I know what it is it's not like rock stars like 25 was a crime I don't know man I'm just I'm not slacking off I think that's what it is I think we get to this point where we're dedicated to something and it we get good at it or we get successful at it at least and then once you get some adulation you sort of relax like I kind of got it I know what I'm doing now yeah now let me fucking go yeah nobody's gonna make me think about quitting if I do a bad set yeah it's like uh needs improvement so now my opinion is totally different like now it's all about look I know that the only way I'm really happy is if my comedy is good like if everything in my life is going great but I bomb I am NOT happy okay so how do I fix that well I have to fucking work more at my stand-up I've to just whatever it is so I wrote down on my computer and on my phone a schedule that I have to adhere to every week and one of them is I write five hours every week a week oh that's attainable yeah you don't go crazy like Seinfeld where it's like eight hours a day it's like I'm not gonna hit that animal fail and all they tell AAA people not to try to quit smoking that first year mmm because they're like you're it's way harder yeah so you're going to fail at that and then you're going to make you think like I'll get to go back to everything yeah I don't even try that so like make that's where I think make attainable goals yeah I also set like attainable goals for like fitness to like the amount of times a week I do yoga the amount of times a week I run and I think all those they like they build on each other like the momentum of them and it makes the standup better and then also like just thinking about the stand-up like thinking about the set trying to make it better trying to like how much of this is bullshit how much of this is ego how much of this is just I haven't looked at it enough I need to get it better how much of this is I only came out of this one way and I stuck with that way why don't I come out in another way like I've been doing that a lot now that's why I see a tail doing that where it's like let me change one word around now back now back again yeah when it's like I don't know just cuz I've been doing doesn't make it right yeah you never know dude like sometimes you'll be sure to drill down and you'll witch it and it'll be way better yeah you don't know and see until you like get out here you got to do it I always thought that's what helped Bobby leave back for a long time was it he was always like show kids for pussy so he's like this is the best it is right now I'm not gonna pluck it until one time and he's a great comic they're like he's not gonna like risk one time trying it differently or try new shit yeah I've talked to Bobby about it I think Bobby he just never did a special and if he did a special he'd be forced to write new stuff and I think his new stuff would really ultimately be way better than the stuff he's doing not the stuff he's doing isn't really good it really he's really funny yeah I think Bobby has life as a more develop common man yes lucky break genius potential and he's just a little nervous about putting stuff out there I think so um I know man I just been paying more attention to it yeah I've been trying to pay a lot of attention to it just put it over you drew over your drive you think about me together I listen to recordings all the time but sometimes I'm listening to music and I said you know what I should be doing work I should be doing work let's dissect this fucking set and I don't want to and I don't want to listen to a podcast of my house into your podcast or Duncan or burrs or something like that or Joey but I'll just go over my said again I'll figure it out you know figure out it's a Jim Otte I thought uh-oh she said to me um was it who's the guy Jets small e52 Japanese guy in the old bomb squad he was there she'd yakking shigeki yeah but he was like when I started he was like I thought had succeed you have Texas know out there you know where he goes here's what you guys do you got to think about it all the time I could think about just two all the time you'll get better I was like no I already got something for that yeah that's a real problem you have to you have to figure out like how much energy put into other stuff for me whether it's archery or used to be pool pool was the worst yeah because you can't really do archery eight hours a day you'll get too tired no but you can play pool eight hours day easy just got to stretch your back once a month just get more and more psycho about it and then it becomes like okay how much of this is benefiting me is it benefiting me spending all this time tweaking about balls going into holes or is it like a big distraction because I don't want to put that same amount of time into writing yeah learn to think about Stan I mean honestly there's a diminishing point of returns at some point you know but of some of anything else you think about isn't time you're not feeling thinking about it does exactly now that might be like we said not more than like 34 hours a week would be successful yeah so taking away that time is okay above 34 exactly yeah it's interesting that it's like you also want recreation like recreation work your mind out a little bit yeah yeah yeah like maybe like this or save it I'm good good even like video games I think if you as long as you don't get crazy with them I think they're probably fun and beneficial but the problem is if you start like super getting energy Jitsu the way you are in a comedy your comedy is going to take second position Giada SCADA York would you win that award for whatever gains from the dark key work the singer mm-hmm she did acting once lr1 like half the Awards ah yeah and then though I used it out more and she was she said she felt like cheating on music whoo powerful Bjork I saw her house in Iceland yeah I saw her beat up a photographer in a video what someone was falling around taking pictures of wrench dad beating around little Bjork yeah yeah giving bareMinerals what does um lady was like totally disrespecting her she was just like like had a camera like in her face and she's filming her and I get away from your words I don't know the exact scenario but they had words ruined yeah Bjork and York what after all I gotta feel good is s1 honor I believe I let me put up that video Jaime pull up that baby I'm a little high right now I don't really totally remember the story but I'm pretty sure she beat some person I would love decision Fujin most like to see fight where's no fighting experience everything like that like like Angelina Jolie and Trump to the desk oh yes to the death absolutely whoever you choose do then I was gonna say Angelina Jennifer Aniston um Wow dem fighting yeah wow that would be vicious yeah I'd be vicious Angelina Jolie's got crazy on her side though right I think Angelina Jill we take it easily now I mention I like Meg about her she's got crazy all create your drinks blood yeah she had a amulet filled with Billy Bob Thornton she kept around how do you survive out of the career that is full on publicly crazy she's so gangster that's full on out there you don't want to fight that girl they'll be like fighting a wildcat no bite you for sure for sure for sure dude you getting bit she's probably gonna fuck you up you're gonna realize you took her lightly as you're going unconscious so I do I went Rockwell smashing your head off the side of a sink I feel she attack she's an assassin so I fucking move man hello I didn't see that coming shoot in fact you ever see I left them in that remake of that vampire movie oh yeah you know what I did the way that girl jumped on that guy under the bridge oh yeah that's how Angelina Jolie would attach it dude that's a good movie I forgot that movie I saw the original one too and I saw this movie's amazing and then I was like well they're gonna fuck up the remake and didn't they didn't like it I didn't they didn't fuck it up at all I low budget why no they just nailed it yeah it was really great it was good even the remake is great yeah I'm saying they did it they did it well as sort of a new story but the same thing and you know what it's so hard to do a remake that it has to be undeniably oh right and so was so good that it was undeniable everybody's like that's pretty fucking good you ever see another movie yeah actually carry a kid vampire and the old man who was like loved her too because he's been with it for whatever years something about a kid vampire scares the fuck out of us holy shit they could be amongst us a fucking kid vampire little like 4 foot tall thing running at you crazy eyes and you're not allowed to hit that party is like wait can I go no I kicked this you can't even do anything anyway Yeah right superhuman power right even that little girl yeah actually fuck those dudes up there was no chance of her losing them no chance I know where vampires are like on a totally different level than humans was that girl actor she's good she's very good like what vampires not like Superman no no my clothes I like it with you are they no I don't think you can take to the heart yeah but you got to get a stake in their hearts right so it's all you couldn't be like a lot point where you're not done he's gonna kick your ass somehow another becoming a vampire makes you way stronger to the heel at Wolverine I don't think they get hurt dude I think until the state goes into the heart you can't really hurt them they should wear heart plate so those heal up dude like Wolverine yeah but then they started changing that they started changing that right like some of the later movies like what was that movie 30 days of night that was good I think daily is like sunlight like I might get you for sure tell them with like silver or something mm sometimes they make up new rules like you can kill them with silver hey you know I mean it's not where we could do that to move he's got like oh no that was wrong with those people thought it's actually this we got bullets with garlic in it we're gonna kill him why I was at like garlic was kill him yeah and then they had wood tip bullets yeah so you could like use machine guns on them well heart blade the comic book superhero blade yeah had these teak wood knives he had wooden knives and he would hunt vampires and stabbed them to death they were just gonna be a good night but yeah I'd have a wood knife so we got this super hard wood Wow yeah that was good dude the idea of vampires I think is haunted people forever because I think it's what people are capable of at their very worst drinking people's blood just a lot in human being inhuman you heard about some of the shit that went down in Liberia what where during the Civil War they were capturing children from from neighboring tribes would eat their flesh they would eat their heart this guy there was one of the vice pieces on Liberia where he talks about and describes how he would do it how he would go to a neighboring tribe capture one of their children then eat his heart Wow yeah dude I'm going there in December oh my god what he doing I know they're done with that now let's chill chill out of power yeah the feds have all gone back going with us somebody was from there Jesus all right stay at home I was my buddy from college hey he knows right what do you mean do you know how Liberia got started yeah I just not out we never knew that as kids right no no I didn't know about into the Vice series apparently it's a they took a u.s. slave colony freed slave and them back to Africa Monroe Jesus Christ was in Monroe that's why they call their capital Monrovia and liberia just means liberated - and then chaos well yeah I mean whatever that happened later yeah but I mean how crazy is it that that became one of the most chaotic spots in Africa yeah Wow I mean imagine I heard someone NPR there's like 10 years ago they're like oh no it's safe now they want we'll comment how dare they start walking back I don't know shit about Liberia by the way if you're from Liberia I'm just talking Jaime pull that up place Jimmy pull data we go this way oh that was a loop Oh head rush way Q mystic you know where you are got a head rush Sam we went deep stood up too fast oh yeah I rap too high after it was that's what it was that's pretty nice that air oh yeah yeah I have that New York right not really you gets up here there we're not this election and the amount in the fuckin so stillness about it so silly open it up stop yeah yeah though I was up holding back for like a month so it's like I'm really been smoking that much this is nice this is the land of it yeah I get Colorado number one Oh Colorado is way ahead of cowboy when you date - and then like the way Eleanor cow and then SoCo yeah well you know what it's like Washington State or like Oregon in the summer in the mountains of Oregon gets real flush hard to beat yeah I feel like an Oregon everyone has their own plant in their backyard yeah they want to be like hey try mine try mine yeah those people aren't fucking around actually I read an article and said that they were not fucking around Wow officially yeah they come out the article is entitled are they fucking around oh yeah all those Pacific Northwest people they know how to grow some weed yeah Jesus by the way my special is out right now should I um yes today hold your money sorry put this out is it really yeah double negative it's called wine I have to present it to you guys so people get start streaming it right away right now yeah that's awesome yeah are you happy with the way everything worked out dude fuck yeah beautiful fuck yeah this is exactly why I how did I get envisioned I'm some sort of digital type you know we could get one episode than the other right right back to back just click on them there's two different specials but similar that's awesome yeah and then the actual special part came out really good but I worked it hard no I'm lucky about it too I took all the intermissions in Scandinavia and then you were like you gave us a good advice you're like that's Tucker they used to it out there man do it here yeah so I tried 200 here a bunch so I got like the hang of it so there's nothing like new and it's weird you know for the sake of weirdness right well it's very experimental man I mean you you're doing a lot of cool shit you having fun yeah you know that's what I get out of your podcast - yeah your podcast is an enthusiastic view of the world I mean that's your the end of day you're a very enthusiastic person yeah you like you like a lot of cool shit you know like doing stuff you don't for me like knowing you as long as I have and knowing you when you weren't doing so good and you depressed it's so amazing seeing you so happy isn't a weird band's great forget about that starting to good in comedy and also like depression - like everything fucking fun you are amazing you know no and I mean I'm sure there's a bunch of different factors physically yeah yeah yeah and I think I know you don't like those but I think those pills help me no no man you're one of the best examples ever you and beast remember Brian and Warmachine deal so oh I know I went wrong sorry what right do you member how do you think Brian from beast from 10 cent minute yeah I sort of remember him yeah yeah yeah yeah I never ham huh badass jiu-jitsu player yeah Tech guard well helped him bro yeah well then they oversee his life forever yeah people want to put everything like black and white yeah and it's like when they say overprescribe that doesn't mean it's always going to be bad yeah exactly you know that just means too much so almost up with anything it's like everybody that we know that it's had pain pill problems uh-huh they took the pain pills because they worked right you know I kept going crazy yeah yeah I mean it's been having it by far yeah hey to check himself in oh I'll do it but Brendan Schaub his friends really had to take the pills from him Wow he's taking them every day several times a day for like months and his friends came over Southside hey dude dude dude no more of these and he said he attic you know he had a kick it and it was hard but he's a disciplined athlete right he's a strong-minded dude you know he could kick it but maybe if you're like a weaker willed person it's more inclined to give in to things maybe you know maybe it would get you or maybe if you have a chemical imbalance it makes you look really super I think we come off it they're like okay here's the deal you got to come off it real slow see I was on 100 let me think if I'm right and 50 milligrams of desipramine and they were like all right that's we found that through experimentation and then they go when you're coming off it go to 125 for a week every day for a week hmm and then always monitor yourself if you start thinking about suicide at all you got to call me immediately go back regular dose Jesus cry they tell you like really like be careful but not everybody does and they're going look and I'm done with it that was my last position I won't go back to write it well I think the better example might be the pain pill thing because it's like painful for them to stop right there like they ache you know I mean I think they're all crazy it so they're everything as it's this way well everything has its own crazy limits look over there what's my I want to lose cliff oh cool I mean everything has its own crazy yeah yeah I think those pain pills from just the experiences of people that I've talked to not firsthand stuff obviously but yeah they seem to grip you so hard people just can't shake them Wow a lot of fighters men a lot of fighters get hurt have surgery from over and then take a few pain pills and then all sudden they got a problem you know especially if you're a person who maybe had a problem in the past and you took a break and you were clean and sober living the mmm a life and then suddenly yeah and then you hurt your back or something you needed the painkillers you just took them don't worry I'll get off them I mean there's it's just you're you're challenging people with these things in a way that I don't necessarily know if it's fair you're challenging them with chemical addiction to trust for it yourself yeah handle yourself it's I mean I definitely think you should have the right to do whatever you want but I'm thinking like because it messes with your brain chemistry though durability it's like asking a drunk person are you okay to drive and it's like they have the worst judgment right now yeah why ask them you're taking someone putting them on a chemical fucking addiction to something and then say like yeah but use your regular mind yeah you're putting them on a crazy cocktail you know you're saying oh you got pain here have some opiates it's all day and you're just going to be like in a heroin fog you know maybe you get you'll settle into that heroin fog I know a dude who's got a fucked-up back and I know when he's on really oh yeah man I talked him it's just all weirded out we're picking Sophie um this is a good place to the selfie site over there why not okay so why not buy that how come them believe you oh yeah - this is gorgeous out here I don't want to get these feet slip for you because I got this weight on my back oh yeah okay all right Julia yeah sure no I have no phone capable of taking this picture that is by the way anyone thinking about getting a flip phone everyone has a camera you guys never want to be with that one yeah that's true you won't pick on the round and he will AG you yeah I like that white Bush thing on the side of the mountain the white bush yeah the thing coming out yeah what is that I don't know it looks like some avatar shit yeah real life it's so weird when you look at plant life in the variety we could just we just get really used to it uh-huh if it didn't exist it's like the whole world was the desert how was just sand dunes and you got to see something like this you'd be stunned by the amount of radiant energy it gives you know yeah if you if the whole world's a desert also they brought you it's like a creek like their dad look what he built a holy shit I touch it oh my god it's alive around me these plants they're a life force they're saying hi the forest says hi just some of us are not that good at listening man I try give it's my work that I start going to do mushrooms and he was like I don't think God wants me to do that I'm like no how long if it's like in telephone that God left for you to talk to him to be a way to put in it I keep saying you got picking up why else would he put it here that's a good way to put it wasn't man-made dude that's actually a very strong argument God made it stupid if I got on the other side of the glass I'm suckin when you've been somewhere in prison yep because I don't talk pick up the phone you might be right order dude write that down somebody like tied down text it to you you know for real though right so the only people that disagree with that of people who don't do mushrooms yeah for having done it yeah so Neal said that he took him we did him in Banff last year and he said he lots to go an Amsterdam and he took like I think like 10 grams 10 dry grams or something like that try so yeah way too much and then he was like I didn't like it was too much for me I'm like I know no one to do that much well whatever not really people but like nobody knew right I bet those crazy psycho night tight characters I can't handle 10 grams to 3/8 and that's a lot yeah almost a quarter three quarters of a quarter what do you need us we never talked about that did what laughter yeah what you think about that very interesting how different how different how same it's very different it's um I didn't take a large dose yeah I took enough to enjoy it okay it was really what does that mean in real time look at what a tab was something a drop of something I don't know a piece of an Altoid I'm not it was in a candy form okay but what I got out of it was that all of these things whether it is a great time to talk about this when we're on the full are you crying here all these things are somehow related what things all these psychedelics oh yeah or even pot even edible pot mushrooms LSD all of them are taking to you like separate apartment rooms in God's gigantic apartment building they'll take you to different places yeah like DMT takes you to a different room mushrooms have a different party to show you but it's all in the same same realm somewhere go somewhere come over this house with my it's of not here you know you know and acid is definitely almost like what acid makes you feel like is that it wants to sort of change what here is you know what I mean yeah it was like hey I know I think I have a pretty objective view of how I see reality and then acid goes bitch you don't know shit forgive my bad was right we could change it to something totally different yeah forever and you be I know what happens it gets this place of I got some puzzles over so you missed it but you can still catch up how pretty this is but I've gone to the place where it's like like you see the truth a lot on mushrooms ass is a little different yeah well no um I felt like it was pretty intersective yeah but it was also calming in an interesting way like perspective enhancing calming you know I think then where you're like everything's gonna be okay yeah you know no but you see since it was the first time I did probably go into that with some preconceived notions yeah you never know because um Larry Hagman adored them up with some notions like everything Val I think I did yeah Larry Hagman from Dallas before he died really he's doing all these interviews and was talking about ad important lessons in his life I forget what the context was but he said that he took LSD really Barry Hagman and that LSD took away his fear of dying and I never forget that like he looks so peaceful when he said that to the lady who was interviewing him it said thing was a lady that's bold he look like a networker not even better lady might have been dude but I turned him into the lady why draw your own conclusions but uh I think his his statements on it about it made him not afraid of death and appreciating like what life is and how life keeps moving oh you know they're making any sort of efforts to make that legal I don't think so yeah I think you got to tread carefully with all this stuff because you get one of these Jeff Sessions types characters it gets in an office and start smart buckling down on yeah they still have to muscle in though the laws around they don't want state rights to take place you know that didn't yeah elephant an elephant a rock in front of a lion right over here let straight ahead looks like an elephant standing in front of a lion that rock formation rocked when the books are going to bend down from it right down from there it looks like an elephant or as elephant that's same with the truck oh I don't see it alright yeah I know I do see the trunk there and the hot the rock that's like sheer guess I'm else just out yeah yeah yeah yes where's the lion but right behind right behind it about to eat it okay okay okay okay I'm saying yeah it almost looks like somebody carved that shape it seems to me like a roided-up rabbit because I could have a lean Oh some yeah but it's still no matter what it's definite aking about the elephant or next to them yeah something's going on you know I'm simply because I saw that what in God's name were we just talking about we are so high right now my movies now we did that a long time ago and that Hawk who did you grew up with any sort of wilderness yeah a little bit I can stuff like that was it well when I lived in Newton Newton is like a suburb of Boston yeah that's where I went to high school and there was a lot of woods right across the street from my housed the Charles River was right across the street from my house so when I was in high school I mean my friends would go out like the woods is right there it's like a river and some woods and it went back pretty far we were just always going there we'd go fishing go fucking around the woods and really yeah you tell you every would make lyrics and shit you know yeah and then just be out alone yeah jelena scream and always around you yeah we did a lot of stupid shit if it increase fine yeah but it's um there was a little bit of woods like right outside my house I mean it was by no means rural it's a suburb but in the suburbs like around Boston like you get these areas that are just big patches of woods the garage I rarely have it like done anything to it right well their forests are like different a lot around my everything grows they're really cool it rains oh yeah where'd you get all the woods in Maine or something I know the fucking woods man I mean it's thick thick timber man like we drive it up you said that's what the highways like both sides is green on both sides forever woods John woods dude is a rock is a road that you take you know where you were going to where Stephen King lived rock did he live Salem no dammit Portland Maine's I can't report my name no I didn't live in Portland goddamnit him so it was Maine though right I'll come back to it yeah shit the Portland Maine no god damn it Maine people gonna be so mad as many people love me where did you know that manager what we mean people they love Maine they love men to call them maniacs oh really yeah they love Maine talk shit about Maine that's how to kill you Hawaiian hates to go out there and talk shit about man they was fuckin get up and yell at you really yeah mm-hmm came a joke around I love that joke around I got that off down down they get so mad what about strong you think well you're from yeah I'm from sucks yeah all right we're like barely establishing tribalism it's like tribes of states that are competing with other states still you know we should probably break off right some state should break off they're doing in Europe the kind of rakia like why are we still together let's just get out of here you guys go on your way we'll go on ours it's all too confusing man like I don't understand the military you can have like open border crossings between them all or something yeah but I don't understand how how would that work if people just if we Pro the military's the mill has a military work because our we get invaded too fast well I don't think so because we still have the same amount of people it's still the same maybe like the military becomes weak yeah you have to figure out like how does it get paid and how does it make sure that's just protecting us and not under the will of anybody that has some various intentions now that there's no state or now there's no you know yeah one power is know one power you don't want to be like the ruin tree of California man I guess maybe when it was back to where was in the beginning where the states really felt like no I'm a Virginian and then in America well this just be real right that's our bullshit yes sir same reason why countries are bullshit so what have I or see Margaret arts of Kentucky what happened in World War one there happened in World War two States invaded States it's the same thing there's like us being invaded by Nevada it's the same thing we would lose right yeah I'm probably the gun for weak people here you really think about that that's exactly what it's like if Germany invades Poland yeah right right right right now that goes in the EU yeah and it looks just like right next to each other how far away is Germany to Poland how long to drive Germany Poland if you had a gas drive inside a day inside a day progress well yeah I bet about that day I just want a war with Colorado been cool to Colorado in a day if you had to yeah if you like took adderall you couldn't get to you couldn't get to Montana from there from here in a day I don't know no we did backed over to LA took just like 27 hours we had three people we just kept switching you only stop for gas hmm and it took like 27 so I move that line like over some and then where's that Wow yeah I think if you could just stay awake yeah you'd go pretty far where people split me in today yeah if you just stay awake you a pretty far in a day but the point is that's the people that we'd be a war with right that's fucking bananas that's what did you do did you went to war with other states let's go don't call it a state don't call it a country it's just people on that side went to war people on that side it was as close as Nevada yeah you know when Nevada is only four hours way driving but yeah as close as Colorado at least how'd you go in a war with Colorado we might win no no no we fucked dude people are bail people just start swimming they're jumping Your Honor yeah yeah I got the whistle - let's break up 30 England 22 which is getting into a note get out of there wash them ashore yeah watch it lightened flames from the shore oh it's a good revolution this time mmm it's pretty one how do you think we would survive a real revolution like if something fucking bananas happened well you got to think they'll kill all the dissidents as fast as they can and with like a boys hmm and then shut down the internet hmm or at least shut down the internet yeah they'd have to establish their own internet right yeah yeah so they could use it and then it would be so evil yeah it's so like a vineyard you'd be like find them in line I'm in line I'll do it what do you want well I'll do it and said what so I'm the internet back on please let me I'll find you in we surrender can we get back our stuff and they'd be like I don't know if we can trust you guys yeah you guys already broke from the team yeah we're team players over here yeah ready to keep moving uh I mean you get some revolutionaries like I need you like yeah man I'm not fucking strong like that get somebody else mm-hmm like in that homeland remember that I only watched it until they hung that dude what dude the redhead homeland yeah oh well after they hung him I'm like I'm out yo I was before that oh that should be the end of it for sure yeah he was the whole show yeah that dudes badass yeah how do you feel that guy that's ridiculous how do you kill him oh why did you tell my guy contract this view prolene it had to be yeah why would you leave unless you're amazing I don't wanna do this anymore and they would be like all right we'll send it they went on after that yep I looked at it but that's just money Grove Bangor Maine Bangor Maine hey go ahead yeah all right Bangor where we supposed to weigh too much pot for this pot I believe it was the right amount what uh so how is it different than mushrooms acid how long it lasts to say that we're here to do it I just took it at the studio oh do you want to run outside a little bit what yeah okay come on inside okay maybe I didn't take enough to have like a super profound acid experience yeah you know but I've taken in a couple times to stay up way late in the same dosage his huh no well I took him in burro last time and it was like Mako stay out of the Sun came up and then 10 a.m. not even like just when the Sun came up I mean I just kept walking and walking but I found hills like this so I wasn't like look and go to sleep I'll just think about you you just keep thinking though right yeah doesn't doesn't like edible pot did that to reach get you thinking and a pretty profound way to yeah I think those that use no word in casual conversation sound I found your star using it for burgers and stuff such as but before doing the ground beef yeah it's just such a douchebag phrase yeah who ropes of shit ropes go and buy the ropes true story well yeah watch my special harsha fear double negative ah you like it tell five friends welcome to next thanks thanks so it was good for you huh ah shit yeah it's uh all the countries they want to they can see my special yeah Netflix can put something on you can watch it at any time any place you have an internet connection a real one you can't do without a plane yet right you can watch it you're loaded up can't you load it up some of them they have in the seat oh yeah heading on the airplane but how does netflix work and you load it up on your life on your phone before him or no it's always true now you can always stream it okay but I guess that's what solves the piracy qualms sort of but I'm sure people can pull it off a Netflix and stream it I mean I'm positive right yeah anyway whatever regardless of that yeah still pretty low uh accessible yeah it's super accessible point is it's just an awesome platform and they have you know so much stand up there now it's the spot to be they really do have a lot of stand up it's pretty great yeah it's like the place

people and beatin people up and shit unless it's a pre-arranged fight you know imagine how much better the world of this God it just people stopped robbing each other just by just fucking to have your stuff I'll have my huge step yeah it would be pretty good if that never was an issue if Trump was like all right all the rest of the stuff you guys had before it's way worse than you think but I did get no more robbers at all it's like robbing table less where is cannibalism yeah you know I think there is that in America in America yeah not really some of the world for sure there's got to be neighborhoods we were pretty safe most the time dude there was an island Indonesia where as of 1999 there were headhunting whoo yeah and after we stopped for a while and then like another country would come in there so hey you guys go back to headhunting and they're just woods like 40 years okay so I'm really dark about dude chasing out your head yeah they say if you drink the blood talking what are their names I forget now of your enemy that was fighting you is just super powerful oh boy but only they're fighting you cheese good workout huh yeah yes thanks especially when you're talking ah yeah we don't breathe right yeah it's do you have fever people talking shows or the whole time yeah it's a beautiful thing about what the Diaz brothers can do talk and fight yeah I hate when they shut them up I get so mad at that success nothing do with the rules so I'm saying let him talk there's nothing to do with the rule so he's a fucking dick shot no yeah I wonder what that is if he's running and talking you be like hey shut your fucking mouth I just wonder if that's written somewhere I don't think they should say anything yeah it's like dude don't get people to be involved in the fight I agree especially when a lot of fighters enjoyed doing it yeah Dennis Johnson or Michael Johnson Retta Dennis Johnson Michael the Menace yeah Johnson you can only talk trash their hands that's the new rule fucking that it's like I don't think you should do it but I think if you want to do it you're right yeah who's the worst trash talker in MMA the worst yeah whoever seems like dude shut up you're still badness whoo it's good question a lot of them do that and they wait for this applaud that never comes like oh yeah man I went that great along well and eco-tours almost too nice yeah to be a trash talker yeah no I mean other people who do it Oh people would do it badly um but Randy brick never really talked China or anyone do it would be unrelated yeah but do you think that a lot of guys are doing it now yeah to get famous yeah yeah but I'm saying so you got a lot of guys you don't know how to do it right yeah well like a poker players do that a lot where they started like oh if you're flamboyant you'll get on or get more sponsorships but you can't fake in it that's true and also part of what's exciting about a guy like Connor yeah yeah there's only one of them yeah like there's a bunch of the people that are loudmouth and funny and they're all doing it back and forth with each other he's not the Unicorn yeah this pack is kicking my ass yeah well he's like how it adds up after a while huh yeah it does you know I mean it's almost like there'd be too much white noise if there was ten Connors mm-hmm you know I mean yeah I be annoying it's like all right no need to leave them alone yeah Sony really wanted to diminish him so just make a bunch of other dudes talk exactly like mm-hmm nullify him yeah do a copy thing I'm the number one Irish spider yeah all the violins on my side have a massive troll fixed fights got a gut just say that video of him fake and get punched for the mayweather fight what Connor did they were like he looks terrible clean he's just like he's like it's not as bad as I'm doing it but it one step above but really like he doesn't know boxing look at his fights they got a hidden camera oh okay I'm fuckin Connor but calm adoring yeah yeah I saw that video him sparring with that professional boxer it's fake he knows how to punch did he was blocking it like with his fucking I don't think it's fake no way just moving around with the guy was a really good boxer you know I was trying to find his range he's trying to be unorthodox and that guy was a very skillful boxer I feel his name maybe you could remember his name for the outro find out who's name your poker stuff just yours no it's yours how's it mine you're gonna put it out oh I want to put it out the other day that special key piece of shit oh yeah well for whatever we got it now I got it together I'm so high I forgot the timing what was I saying Jamie look up that fighters name it was a skilled fighter of it I'm agree with the guy that Conor was boxing is very good he's very good like you can see big beautiful crisp motions he's a solid professional boxer I got a really high level and he you know definitely are the better of Conor yeah but that doesn't mean that like Conor wasn't working on specific things or wasn't working that much on boxing when did this happen what was you really trying to concentrate on oh right maybe you're just trying to work on range really and see if he can be trying to work on a lot of things he could be a little bit bad though you're right it does he could be trying to take as minimal amount of damage as possible not commit himself very much but see what it's like to move around and spar with a guy who's a world-class boxer at cause like if they had hidden camera footage of you like on your back and you're like no it was working off for that whole two months well most jujitsu guys I think are super aware of that kind of stuff like there's a lot of guys but it will be too similar to that where he's like no what you think is bad it's not bad at all I'm trying to get in that position yeah like you get a picture of jean-jacques getting stuck inside control every day with one of his blue bells he lets you do it yeah so that he gets you in a position and is like okay I want to sweep you now ha ha ha next thing you know you're on your back but like you can take pictures of it right there and say oh my god that guy was getting the better of Jean Jacques you had inside control you like wow John John consent for a second clip yeah I just play that I mean you don't really know what you're looking at but you know you're looking at a guy who's a super high level boxers I got looks sweet I like what he's doing and he's definitely getting the better of Conor it didn't look good on Conor's part but again I don't know what Connor was working on I don't know if he was maybe you know how many training sessions he's doing a day what do you know whether he's got injuries why is he just boxing MMA fight is it is it before the Nate Diaz side when is it exactly but they were sparring oh right oh yeah good point cuz that fucking years ago who is he preparing for you know is he preparing to throw kicks was he working on his reign trough you have any chance in the world that Mayweather who the fuck knows I say no way more than I don't know shit but I say no ways at less than eight for Mayweather know where as far as the rounds ya know you dominate a fight probably 10 to maybe even you would be crazy to bet on a guy with zero profession he's never done it's almost rude to boxing to say he has a chance almost man and he's taken on literally the greatest defensive boxer ever right I mean come on son good yeah exactly it's almost like come on Scott it's like those people think they could stand up just just on the spot yeah it's kind of similar but you Connor does know how to punch and he punches very hard yeah beleaguer guys you're right but he's a bigger guy and he's bigger oh yeah yeah he's a lot bigger and he's are you going off your life no because I still about two shows in DC bitch really where you're playing I'm some theater that's where I grew up oh shit that's right you know what's called um you never know that's do not yeah I'll be there Washington DC whenever your theater is called hey Hebrew Academy go head out and she'd Roshan that's where you went for a little while dangerous day school Wow switch to the bad kid you're a bad I went to the less religious school have you ever met a comedian that wasn't a bad kid mmm like trouble like like like long travel stuff yeah at least troubled were there any kids though that we're not troubled I mean did your kid get in trouble no I mean they'd want to hear they don't get in trouble I mean they you know their kids they do stupid things so yeah they don't understand she'd even say stupid I would say they do careless things sometimes because they don't understand yeah but you know but not like a real total they're a little well I mean you're big one to know yeah I don't know how many comics who weren't in trouble a lot I feel like people are learning every generation how to be nicer to their family members you know every generation they're getting better at it and I had a buddy when I grew up with in Boston his dad was super strict and what dad would you know fucking hit him and scream at him and shit his dad was crazy and you know he had had enough of it by the time we were in high school and it's uh I don't know it's hard to see shit like that enough of his like mouthing off if you had enough his dad hitting him oh really yeah so we hit him back forget about Almanac but he gets closed up I think what my point is like I think in his jazz generation that's what everybody did they beat the shit out of their kids and then his generation before that they beat the shit out of their kids and I think like people today are figuring out how to be nicer to each other like every day we're getting better at it seems like it I really believe that man I really believe that I really believe that people are getting better but being I just like hey how are you just being nice I wonder if some of this like you know the division that's happening now which can you know liberal and conservative and like left and right and stuff where to make people like sort of appreciate sometimes with me it helps where it's like all right we're giving up a lot of free but still got Tom like walking up fucking forest like that right you know nature that's like great yeah so with that you get this thing - it's like look whatever but let's be kind to each other right or no well I just think that people I mean this is a bid well on this more than any other thought off in the last few years is that people are all red lined or they're all taxed out like as far as the amount of stress they go through you know without physical exercise the amount of angst and anxiety they go through without resolution of the world life just seems to stay in the same state there's so many people to find themselves in these traps you know I've been thinking about it more and more over the last few years and what happened to them just it's just nothing comes good at all right you know you know so what does that do it nice most I think that just trying to look at trying to look at what's the what are the good interactions you ever had with people how much of them are initiated by you right how much of her initiated by a situation that maybe could have gone sideways if you were defended just not if we were just like hey what and like Labs are like what and we've all fucked there's so much standoff assurance here right now you look at people they look down like like almost like try to intimidate you it's just like for what no I may be gone but I was like I just saw friendliness before and then it's like there's still there's a difference here but there's like this meanness up there well there's some for sure but this is also an overpopulation issue yeah you know they did some kind of crazy study on a radio lab podcast again right you'll have plugs River they talked about how there's this direct correlation between how fast people are walking like how many steps they take like per minute on average you know versus the population in that city and how many syllables they say in a certain amount of time how quickly they talk which base oh really yeah because you have no time to actually formulate words because I was going to rub trips and so many people so you talk faster probably Wow like they submit it trying to get in quicker yeah you can't you can't just lay back right it's just like rush yeah like like right big families you got to rush to get that chicken yeah Oh interesting fascinating right you know so they found it like small towns they're slower walking slower talking and you could tell by setting up cameras in two locations on a busy street how fast people walked yeah you could tell the exact population of the city Wow really yeah Wow think again walk fast in New York they really do it all fast up you gotta get to the side yeah it's almost like athletic huh yeah they put a hustle to it house walk with a girl if she was like where you going fucking why are you running people bump people - yeah yeah yeah it's a lot of bumping had somebody to call me a dick oh yeah I try to get by just upon our coat waited for a minute and then like I stuck it out skip I Wow and then I walked by she started walking so like you know hit shoulder shoulder not hard or anything and then I kept going and then she was like dick and I was like I'm not gonna get into it yeah so I kept walking she's like dick I can't walk in the shoes outside to remix deck okay how many times probably four times outside and I'm not too inside have you done this on stage yet no yes there's something there dude it was like now his leg go i breached by you imagine when a psychopath what a guy was that to do that a guy was doing that to you how scared Hank oh my god I bumped a crazy guy yeah I better get the fuck out of here sorry bro oh no part of me with like at that point turning around like I'm sorry I didn't mean to it's hilarious yeah haha just er we were camping it goes to that point and we're in this good room looking at us over walk in here with hold on a microphone while we hike I got a backpack on with a weight plate on it it's colored like Captain America hahaha have a shirt on she definitely thinks we fucked lady looked at me like I is the best fucking woods I know I see him there I need those guys were almost the guy to Captain America shield on his back is Fred and I'm sure it on the other guys come rag in his back pocket let's tell us

should be around people who are like high level to I just and also to be around people that are your friends and I'm right in Hardee's on whether it's DNA I don't know this guy's making money this has got an audience who starts doing this everybody's killing it yeah it's a pretty good time they bitch man about the bloggers but that's just a small negative with a giant positive yeah goodness you know what people are always going to have opinions oh yeah but the giant positive is there's a lot of people to get to enjoy your content right here over a while it evens out if you don't like there's a lot of people that are just looking for things to criticize and looking to be outraged and looking to try to figure out what's the next angle for their outrage and really a lot of it is really just a kind of creative exercise looking for easy targets or do target yeah it makes sense to me I was like they understand everything yourself in so troller yeah but I think that we're entering to a very interesting time as far as like your ability to distribute stuff yeah yeah just like to put a cool stuff that people enjoy like podcasts you know you know I mean a bunch of people we don't even know just we're on a hike with us what do you mean oh right yeah already talked about never misses folks I just went on a legit hike with us yeah for a few miles yeah don't forget if you heard him get

savages all right that's the thing about bowhunters in particular yeah like people have no idea that that's an athletic endeavor 100% you have so you're trying to load keep your heart rate low you know going up hills to get close to these animals and if you're out of breath you're going to make a shitty shot you have to do to keep it together under pressure like that's an athletic event a realistic barrel from welcome does not vary he gets no pass throughs everything's ahead oh yeah a pastor is looking ahead so easy why is it go out of your head so you know especially those skulls of those things we can punch that John sometimes he doesn't get any pass throughs yeah like I would think a crossbow those mushy asses on behead you get clean pass yeah you just blow right to the head
