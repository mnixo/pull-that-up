okay boom and we're live with Joey Diaz and TJ English Joey turned me on to you a long time ago mr. English he gave me a copy of the Westies right here was that 98 99 long time ago he gave me that book yeah that's fantastic really fascinating stuff yeah first book I published was it really West East yeah in 1990 how'd you guys find out of each other he wrote a book a friend of mine turned me onto a book named Havana life turned that was a small book a fascinating read and I was just blown away by him and I went to a party one night and there was a little red ageist and I go do you fucking guys read about it like they're like oh we optioned it and I was like that's fucking that's gonna be a great book we just it broke down the the how Fidel took over it from three different cities how it was going down in three different categories and then I heard that he was writing a book about West New York and Union City Cubans where I grew up and I emailed him and I told him who I was that my mother had a bar and I grew up in that shit and he hit me back and we became friends he came to a show and yeah Joey reached out to me you know unfortunately when I was just about finishing this book so I had done most of the work and it was down on paper but it was a trip it was like he was like a character who walked out of the book and I wished I'd met him earlier cuz I hadn't met too many characters like him Union city's amazing place I don't think people realize it it's one of those little enclaves happens to be Cuban it's like a mafia neighborhood but it was Cubans not Italians or it was like Hell's Kitchen which I wrote about in the Westies which was an Irish neighborhood very intense neighborhood high premium on loyalty young males run in loyalty games on each other all the time from the age of six somehow so we how far you'll go how far how far will you go for me you know what are you willing to do for me in the case of Hell's Kitchen in the Westies it was cut up bodies was not only would you kill somebody for me but will you make the body disappear and they tested each other with with the cutting up of the bodies and Union City a lot of it was was political some of it was polluted how anti Fidel are you how badly do you want to kill you know Fidel and help us reclaim our lost homeland that was kind of behind a lot of things it wasn't spoken about a lot but it was sort of the hidden motivation Westies was a really fantastic book like you you went deep into that whole sort of sub scene you know it's a very interesting crime infested area well what what I try to do with these books is to tell the macro story the the larger historical socio-political story and then get intimate and tell the interpersonal stories between the characters that actually live the story that's a challenge you got to find people who are willing to talk to you and share information with you that they've kept quiet probably most of their lives and then you get at the interpersonal stuff because these stories really are just human beings caught up in something that's bigger than them and how long when you when you write in a book like the corporation which is your new book or Westies or any of your books how much time do you spend doing the research and how much time do you spend actually writing the book takes about three years to do these books on average and and then two of those years this research probably Wow yeah so you do you bring this to the book company the the publisher and you say hey this is what I want to write a book you do a proposal and I do very very detailed proposals for the corporation I did a proposal 125 pages long and it's a chapter by chapter breakdown it's almost like a condensed version of the book and so you get more money from a publisher that way as in advance because you're showing them the whole thing practically they can see the product almost and also you know the movie interests there was movie interest in this one the corporation based on that on that proposal interesting yeah it was option two based on that proposal before I even started writing the book really yeah so what is the corporation about the corporation is a story of the Cuban American organized crime organization that began in the mid-1960s and existed all the way to the end of the century and it was led by this mobster named Jose Miguel battle who was kind of a legendary figure in Cuban American circles because he was a hero from the Bay of Pigs invasion the the attempt to reclaim Cuba take back Cuba the invasion 1961 which was a disaster for everyone involved battle wound up in prison along with the rest of the brigade and when he got out and came back to the US he was determined to get Castro and take back Cuba so he set up this criminal thing and it was based on one racket primarily bolita the number the lottery the illegal lottery for the lottery was legal it was illegal and it was controlled by organized crime and it was a huge moneymaker big moneymaker for the mob going back to the 1920s everyone bets the number little old ladies bet the number priests cops you know you can bet a nickel you can bet a dime you can bet $10,000 hugely profitable for whoever controls and organizes well the Cubans controlled and organized it on the eastern coast of the United States from New Jersey and New York all the way down to Miami and the guy who controlled it was battle and he became legendary based on that they controlled the the whole number system because I know there's a lot of Italians that were involved a went to the Mafia one of the first things battle did battle had been a cop a vice cop in Havana in the 1950s during the for the turnover yeah during the era when the mob would Joey was someone Havana knocked her and that's what that book was about the era of the mob in Havana in the 50s Meyer Lansky Santo Trafficante and how they controlled that until Castro came along and spoiled the party and the revolution happened and they got chased out of their battle had been a vice cop in Havana during those years and he knew all those high-ranking mobsters in fact he was a bagman who delivered money from the skim at the casinos in Havana to the presidential palace so battle knew how the world went round and he made those connections and when he finally gets to the US and wants to start his own thing first thing he does is go to Santo Trafficante and says can you make the proper introductions for me trafficante introduces him to Fat Tony Salerno in New York City who controls the numbers racket for all five families and battle says look things are changed in Cuba over the next couple of decades you're gonna have tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Cubans coming to live in the United States they all bet the number that's a huge market if you let me take over this thing and organize it you will get a piece of you will get your piece of everything and the Mafia said yes and so the Cubans took over and they control everything I mean in New York City in the 70s and 80s there were probably 200 to 300 bolita spots where you could go bet the number that's the Cubans called a bolita little ball and so they controlled it and they took care of the the Mafia and everybody was got fat and happy for a while until it turned bad and they started killing each other now in Joey when you heard about this book this is something that you were very intimately involved in when you were a kid very you know I come on your show and I tell you there's a hundred stories I could tell you and there's a thousand I can't and when he told when I read the thesis for this book I just know I just fucking know you know I grew up in numbers when I went to Catholic school on Saturdays when I came home on Fridays and Saturdays at the age of eight I was sent to different locations in the city the Bronx Brooklyn and I wouldn't make $50 going to run errands running numbers they'll tell this guy the first number of the day is to you know so I grew up and I grew up in a house where the book he would call my mother by three o'clock and go what's the numbers for the day and my mother would give him a fucking laundry list you know and it's very interesting in this book he also covers the mysticism of the number so if I'm at your house and your daughter walks in with a hockey shirt her numbers 13 how lucky and go Joe give me a number from zero to nine five and I pick up the phone and I bet five thirteen if I look out my window and the cop car is 506 I put five hours on 506 if I have a dream about an eagle when I go down to the bolita spot there's books that they sell books to dreams and I take that book and I look up Eagle and if eagles number eight I'm a 813 it's you know you you were mentioning and a couple months ago that your grandmother took numbers yeah grandmother was Sicilian Sicilian people have the same everyday they live today's today yep days a day Joe road yeah today's the day I'm hitting the no I'm not getting you know she talked about that dream that dream again we're gonna be immigrant mentality yeah those three numbers today if God wants if God is real what he says it's true my numbers gonna come out today yeah when is my ship gonna come in that you work a plain Jane dream you're a blue-collar person and on the way home every day by 3:30 you put the number it that's it that's we do something to believe in that's like a religion yeah numerology and with Cubans it was very mystical it was tied into dreams and belief the idea was you bet the number and you try to make your dreams come true that's literally what you're doing you're trying to make your dreams come true and the bolita guys the bully tarot is the ones who control it they're the dream makers they're the guys who are making it possible for your dreams to come true so they had tremendous stature in the community really every dream sobs so you work tjs jose battle and you're an independent bookie your job is to sit at it bring the lounge in West New York from 10:00 to 3:00 drinking and all day long people come in and go Joe give me 517 $3.00 give me 303 $1 at 3:00 o'clock 3:30 a number comes out if that number wins if I give you 500 you get three thousand from battle you give me 2,500 so you make five hundred off the top and then I tip it the thing that battle did was he didn't take ten points he let you run your independent fashion unless you called it in to him you know it's very you watch the movie what smooth Mickey Rourke and the Chinese people you're the drag great fucking movie ape movie when he says you know for years the Chinese were bringing in the heroin and they were selling to the Italians you know $50,000 investment to make you $500,000 Chinese weren't saying that like they weren't seeing that why because they didn't have they couldn't bring it out they couldn't sell it black people and Spanish people will bitch-slap him to death so the same thing happened with bolita Fat Tony Salerno knew that he had a big thing coming with the Cubans but Cubans want to put a bed in with Cubans hmm yeah do you understand yeah yeah Italians they want to put a bed in with Italians right Puerto Ricans they want to put a bed in with a Puerto Rican isn't that a big thing that was with the numbers it was that there was a community thing it's a community I would talk about the numbers be like the lottery is some sort of a government-funded gang and it seems like it's got a lot of red tape and official and there's no legal room the the number seemed to be closer to like the community especially with Latinos especially with look yeah it was the in some ways the core of the community the numbers spot or everybody would hang out you'd go to hear the neighborhood laboulaye in like ia the there's the gossip in the streets you'd go there here in the neighborhood gossip yeah was an end it was never meant to be violent back in Cuba bolita was not violent it was illegal but it wasn't violent and it turned very violent in the United States the corporation became so profitable I mean we're talking about millions of dollars on a monthly basis billions of dollars over the course of the life of this organization billions of dollars more than they could the artists thing they had was what to do with the money I mean they would literally strapped money to people to as money couriers to try to get it out of the country to get it in to get it into offshore bank accounts Wow and launder the money they had more money than they know it was a license to print money was hugely profitable that's what made it violent then you started having gangsters vying for territory territorial disputes greed greed took over and it got very ugly no this is between Cubans between Cubans between the Cubans and the Italians see this guy battle was very charismatic leader with some great leadership qualities he'd been a hero in the Bay of Pigs invasion he saved some guys lives when I first heard that story I didn't I said I gotta verify that maybe this is just a story and I told about himself to burnish his legend so I found the guys that he saved and I found the guys two brothers who went with him to save that the guys that he saved and I went to Cuba to the Bay of Pigs to the exact location where he saved these guys to verify this story and it was absolutely true he in an act of incredible heroism he saved the life of a number of his platoon members and so that was his reputation from then on he was revered in the community he was a hero and people defended him even even when it it turned ugly and he became a ruthless boss who was killing people left and right he had his defenders because of his legend as a hero in the community and so the power that he had but he also had this Joey and I were talking about this Cubans have this Latinos have this everybody has it but Cubans have it desire for revenge this guy you know the Bay of Pigs invasion was an attempt at revenge to get revenge against Castro and they were humiliated by that process and a lot of the guys from that generation had an unfinished agenda for revenge so if you wrong this guy battle in any way he was gonna get you even if it took years and years of calculation I mean there's stories in the book about this one guy who killed his brother named Pololu he took it took nine years and twelve attempts before and they finally killed this guy pallulah they shot him in his hospital he was in the hospital they shot him had a assassin dress up as a male nurse and go into the hospital and shoot him between the eyes because there had been so many failed attempts they weren't gonna fail this time and that's in battle took 12 years I mean took nine against the assassin no never caught him no bang just seared it out I believe the assassin got killed later because he was talking about it having done it and so battle had him killed Wow yeah so that the revenge motive the revenge motive kind of drove battle off the deep end and somewhere along the line he broke bad so to speak I mean I don't know if he was ever good and had to break bad but he started doing internal killings that really had nothing to do about business they're all about revenge well this is a theme that happens a lot with organized crime people right it's like they just get a taste of killing people and it becomes easier and easier and then they'd like that was the thing about murder machine right about Roy DeMeo right yeah you just can't was killing people anything after a while that's another book yeah I was reading all those books on the road yeah because I was auditioning for so many Italian roles I never really knew the history of it I was just trying to read all those books just so when I went in I had an idea what these characters and who they were I saw him growing up I saw these guys you know growing up I just didn't the interesting thing about this book was talking to the bay and paces that they knew they they were coming like Fidel no Brian coming you he put Bob Y or some and his quarrel they that the soldiers all slashed at feet as they were landing there was four battalions I think there's two hundred and fifty well you know what happened when they landed well there were klieg lights set up on the beach yeah they knew they landed like they flipped the lights on and lit it up like a movie set right when these guys landed Jesus they got slaughtered they got slaughtered and and they they felt they'd been betrayed by Kennedy yeah you know that there was supposed to be air cover and the air cover never came and why wasn't because Kennedy Kennedy always had this operation was started by the Eisenhower administration and the CIA was a CIA operation Kennedy inherited it and he never really he always had mixed feelings about it I mean it was illegal it was a an illegal secret covert operation and attempt to overthrow a government it would have been seen as an illegal act in the eyes of the world to do it so Kennedy was trying to do it so it could be done in such a way that it could never blow back on his administration and so he withheld air cover at a crucial point in that in that war lasted three days and they got slaughtered and they got and they got imprisoned and they had a lot of resentment towards Kennedy I mean I go into the book though a little bit about the Kennedy assassination and the belief that a lot of that a handful of those Cubans may have been involved in the Kennedy assassination along with the Italians with the mob because they were working hand in hand with the CIA yeah that was one of the leading conspiracies outside of the CIA killing him and even the CIA killing him was a part of the bacon the Bay of Pigs conspiracy yeah and also the the idea that he wanted to disband the CIA there was a really interesting article recently there was dismissing almost every single conspiracy theory about the Kennedy assassination they said except the CIA one there's legitimate possibilities that the CIA well you can bet your ass that if the CIA was involved in Cubans or yeah now let me add book you speak about Fidel's mistress yeah that he got the only I wonder with her at this particular one Morita she had gone to New Orleans yeah or the Taoist my retail Lorena was very interesting the Turia's figure she had a child with him and had an abortion and didn't have the child she got pregnant with Fidel in fact Castro admitted as much she got pregnant with cast oh she had a she had an abortion and then the CIA used her to try to assassinate Castro she had was supposed to slip him a pill and she put it in her face cream and the pill dissolved in her face cream and that was the pill she was gonna try to slip to Castro her her case agent was a guy named Frank Sturgis who want to be one of the Watergate burglars see the thing about Bay of Pigs and the Cubans the Bay of Pigs invasion is the key to understanding the whole latter part of the 20th century politics in the United States the Cold War because the alliance between the CIA and the Cubans rears its head constantly throughout the latter part of the 20th century the Watergate burglary five out of seven of the burglars were Cubans Bay Pigs veterans really they had been recruited by a new a Howard hunt CIA age and who was one of the orchestrators of the Bay of Pigs invasion was also one of the people that on his deathbed said that he was involved in the assassination he entity yes this so the CIA would come to these Cuban exiles the militant exiles and they'd say go to this operation go do this burglary at the at the Watergate and then we go get Fidel go do this assassination and then we go get Fidel and the Cubans were always ready and willing because it was all leading back to getting it was all leading back to did you ever see the images of what they said was a Howard hunt he was one of the people that was arrested there was a series of there was a bunch of guys that were arrested that were on trains they were calling them hobos yeah they were all very well dressed right that were near where the grassy knoll was on the grass yeah yeah yeah oh there's lots of rumors about that that Howard hunt was one of those men there was even a reference that Jose Miguel battle was one of those men but that couldn't have been the case cuz he was in the Army at the time of the US Army no so so it's like a it's like a subterranean narrative that runs through the latter part of the 20th century the CIA and right wing elements in American politics using the Cuban Americans to do all kinds of dirty covert deeds and we're talking about terrorist activity assassination of a ambassador from Chile right in Washington DC blew up his car because he was sympathetic to Castro a bomb planted on a Cuban jetliner flying from Panama City toward that a 73 people killed innocent people including the fencing team from Cuba young people a dirty war a dirty war was waged by the anti-castro underground in combination in partnership with the CIA and this we know about it now because a lot of it has been declassified and it's come out we didn't know about it at the time it was taking place why they blow up the plan it's just an act of terrorism against Cuba to to show them that it could be done to instill fear and paranoia in the cute the the concept was to destabilize the Cuban government so they'd be vulnerable and then you could take him over so any any act against Cuba I mean asking why blow the plane would was is asking like why fly planes into the World Trade Center right you know it was instead a destructive act it's pretty amazing how resilient Castro was I mean unbelievable the guys 90 miles away from Miami and just ran shit through the 60s the 70s the 80s the 90s into the 2000 they say there was something like 632 known plots over over the course of four or five decades to kill cast incredible 632 that's not movie 101 ways to kill fit down yeah and he went out he got a little train in New York I know like are you fucking crazy and they check to see they got a pull of proof vest on he's like he took the train to the UN Wow he's fuckin nuts yeah he was fuckin nuts so so what makes this this gangster story of the corporation so interesting and different is this political context the framework that all this shit was taking place against the backdrop of this desire to kill Castro and take back take back the homeland and anyone who was involved in that was seen as a hero within the community Joey can tell you about that Union City New Jersey and Miami were the hot beds of the anti-castro movement there was an organization in Union City called omega-7 there was one in Miami called alpha 66 these were terror organizations secret organizations that existed to plant bombs they would plant bombs at embassies in the United you know in New York City they would put they would put bombs at Lincoln Center when it went out when an orchestra from Cuba was making an appearance they were trying to shut down any relationship between the u.s. and Cuba and governments that were sympathetic to Cuba they would they would do actions against them and this went on for like 40 years man that's unbelievable mentioned four down the seventies in Union City like a joke it's not a joke don't even don't you know I don't even bring him up dog because you will get smacked now was there any probe Fidel support amongst Cubans there was and bad things would happen to them in the United States and Cuba though what about in Cuba pro-castro India oh yeah sure I mean was it real or was it out of fear no there's real it's real I mean I've been there numerous times you know the killer people made a choice and the Revolution I believe would have happened with or without Fidel Castro the guy who was empowered by teesta had taken over the government in a coup d'etat he wasn't elected so he was kind of a fraudulent president and there was and ever since he got in people knew he was a fraudulent president and there was attempts to - ow stir him and that's why he was such a dictator he knew they wanted to house to him so he used the military to repress any kind of movement against him and it was ugly and the people rose up against it that's what happened it wasn't so in my belief that revolution and cue happened for a very legitimate reason after it happened in power it was revealed that Castro and Che Guevara were communists he Castro was very cagey about that during the revolution they never talked about Marxism and being communists or any of that and in fact Fidel came to Union City came to the United States to raise money for the revolution while it was going on got arrested in USA my friend's mom the ask Elise's she says she still remembers taking the bus in the morning in Union City and Fidel talking to on the way I'm talking to you how are you doing Susan what's going on Wow he got in a barroom room he got in a barroom argument in Union City and he got arrested over what probably politics I'm sure was a political discussion so so then the revolution happened and and you know Cuba becomes a repressive communist Stalinist dictatorship but a lot of Cubans the way they saw it is that was a choice they made to go with Fidel he did have I think the the popularity of the people following of the people some people are quite proud of Castro standing up to the United States Cubans are very proud people and they take a lot of pride in the fact that even though there's so much hardship there that it's a choice they made to go in this direction at least they have their there is self pride which is more and that can be said in some ways about Puerto Rico and Jamaica and Dominican Republic all these other countries in that region that are just as poor is Cuba so he has his supporters he always had his support obviously he also had his to try there's even within Cuba most of those people are the ones who got on rafts and tried to leave the island at great risk to themselves to do anything to get out of there because they realize Fidel was so popular from within the country you were never gonna be able to take him down so they made the decision to go out in the ocean and try to brave the the risks of of either swimming or sailing across the Florida Straits what the fuck happened with Che Guevara how did Che Guevara all of a sudden emerge as this like leftist political icon but in this really weird sort of clueless way like they really didn't understand his background really didn't understand who he was and what he had done and the atrocities that he had committed but these fucking t-shirts that all these dopey liberal kids like those fucking things it's fucking crazy if you find out who that guy is you're wearing a mass murderers t-shirt like he was a fucking ruthless cunt and these people were wearing this shirt as if he symbol he symbolizes like liberty or freedom from a oppressive government or something like that it's but it was a long period of time where you didn't have any Che Guevara there was no no discussion of it and that it seemed like somewhere in the 2000s it picked up am I right about that yeah hey let me taste some it was so personal for a while like I have Argentinian friends but in the 70s there was a rift between Argentinians and Cubans like that's how personal the chain is Argentinian days Argentinian right like there was a rift because of him because of him like opens the fuck out of here really talking that accent the fuck what is it what is that you know anything you know they talk they talk or sister like Spain yeah what humans would go to Argentinian really that's how deep the hatred red you mean Spanish how did the Lisp thing where'd that come from Smith bike it's from Sonia why I don't know it's just a regional regional thing and they they're the number ones on the Shawn the top like if a Cuban what look look at Cubans the is considered that were the Jews of the Caribbean but Spain has one over on us like people like my father's family was from Spain and I went there one time never went back really get one time to meet my grandmother and never went back why because she was talking shit no shit about my mother you never gonna see my mother see Spain is the colonial powers to Cologne often often Spaniards look down on the on Cubans and Mexicans I'm sure as well so I went over there one time my mom took me to meet my grandmother in like 10 minutes and they'll call my mother you fuck my mother came over knows what happened this fucking bitch is talking about you five was about five miles to wrap my relationship she was like my father's your father wasn't a beard that because she was from calm away so this shit didn't stink Wow my mom was a peasant from Havana so she was like my son had big dreams until he met your your that animal yeah fuck you you fuckin Hagley she made my mother move in whatever in Cuba I cook the dishes see see Spaniards all my fault me offended just by the way Cubans speak Spanish yes really like a lot of people tortured me when I did the y'all thing I don't speak Cuban Spanish I speak I said hey Cora I speak the Spanish of the streets that Spanish I picked up in Union City that streets well let me stop Molina on that moment on anybody they give you a hard time about translating this is what I always tell people I'll talk in English repeat what I said good luck in English yeah it's fucking hard it's hard to remember what someone said especially yo I was speaking

mom didn't hide nothing from me growing up that's good and bad that had good things for me but a lot of bad things for me you know one of the things that he touched upon this book was not only about Jose battle but the political corruption that came with it in my 20 years have I ever talked to you about power things I'm gonna have I wouldn't listen to politics if you paid me because it's all bullshit I saw him and and a micro-level you know when you when you're president could he get donations from big farm guns whatever when you're a small mayor will you get your donations from the pharmacy the pizza place the numbers so I came from a society where those numbers were controlling everything in in North Bergen Union City and West New York remember that shit's a felony in Jersey it's a misdemeanor in New York really numbers it used to be mr. mean as a matter of fact they would call you you never good Joe lieutenant we wouldn't say that because the phones were taped he would just call you and go you're getting a visit today that means if you got five thousand in your pocket give it to Jamie clean out the house leave some paperwork mm-hmm at two o'clock I come my handcuff here I take your money I write your summons and bring it down to the station we giggle and then after I let you how to meet you around the corner if you had twenty five hundred I'll give you twelve fifty hmm and that's a cost of doing business right you know there's a funny line in Goodfellas when he goes how can I go to school with all that goody-goody bullshit and saluting the flag when I don't look I was the same way yeah like I saw what happened I saw the political system I saw two cops coming in one detective once a week and one beat guy my mom would give him a drink in an envelope yeah I don't know what my grandmother did what house she was involved but I told you she went to jail right to jail for running the numbers she went to jail because she wouldn't give anybody up they wanted her to give up whoever the fuck was at the other end of the organization and so first like six months we were always trying to flake where the fuck is grandma and she all she's visiting her sister so she's visiting aunt Josie okay and just no one making the Jersey six five months right and they put you on house arrest and you done she would knit sweaters and shit for the fucking guards in jail well a lot of times battle would on the judges so you wouldn't do any time you all you might get it you might get as someone's you go before a magistrate judge and and they you go what's fascinating to me is about this is also fascinating about the mob itself is that a lot of it is basically dissolved that all this came from immigration and that this this melting pot of the United States and they all came from all these other places and all this organized crime sort of like was running the cities in the East Coast but most of it is kind of gone the wayside no I would dispute that a little bit i I think traditional organized crime as we knew it in the twentieth century is gone by the wayside Italian Irish Jewish that sort of assimilated into the system and has dissipated but there's new generations residents that are playing this out Jamaicans to make Americans Russians Mexicans it's happening and I'd further make the argument that the corruption that was created during prohibition in the 1920s that's where this system was created during Prohibition in the 1920s the alliance between the underworld in the upper world the connection between the political apparatus law enforcement and the criminal rackets that template was laid down during Prohibition and it was in effect for the next 100 years I think that template still exists you pick up a newspaper in any US city large or mid-sized city and what are you gonna see on the first couple pages some local representative who just got indicted for taking money from some criminal element to see that they got a law passed or that they got some municipal contract that hasn't gone away mmm that still exists everywhere what happens is there's a band flow certain rackets come and go it was legal booze and it was labor racketeering now it's narcotics it was Malita at one time there's always something you know as long as there's commerce being done on a large scale there's always room for corruption as long as there's things that are illegal where there's a market for yes like marijuana yeah right the big argument about marijuana laws in the United States is if they made it legal it would severely limit that the cartel in Mexico has cut all that violence out right basically the same shit that was going on with Al Capone and and everything during the liquor there this time what liquor was a yeah because the criminal rackets feed the system your human beings are you know it's a flaw human beings at every level of the system dirty cops cops on the take I mean is it more difficult now for them to pull something like this off it's less systemic you know what I mean I mean back in the day you know you'd have corruption that was all the way through the chain of command you know and everyone was sort of in on it now you see the 75 yes I did I also saw your your interview with Michael yeah yeah that was fascinating yeah yeah I mean he he and that was 20 years after the nap-nap Commission which revealed that level of corruption ya know there's you have social systems and you will have corruption hmm you have a money-making system like capitalism you will have corruption that doesn't go away organized crime is the face of organized crime has changed quite a bit but the core of of that corrupt relationship between the underworld and the upper world still exists so is it the most disenfranchised sort of members of the community the the most recent immigrants like what what is it that yeah I've written about this a lot you know two different books and through journalism I've come to believe that it's the American story this process of going through organized crime and gangsterism before you become accepted as a full-blown American every almost every ethnic group has gone through some version of it in the US and it's still and is still going through and it's part of the American process you get here as a group you're you're cut out of access immediate access any way to to power and so you create your own path and initially in these organizations it's usually those ethnic groups preying on their own preying on each other that's usually the first stage of this and then it it becomes creating a system to try to deal with a larger system of corruption I mean Jose Miguel battle what he did was so brilliant by creating the corporation is he created a path for himself within American organized crime which was controlled primarily by the Mafia and he created an alliance with the Mafia that made it possible for the Cubans to have their thing and and fly below the radar I mean while the Italians were getting busted left and right the Cubans the Cubans this corporation existed for 40 years because they didn't really get messed with much why is that like what was it the the way the Italians like they were so flashy like particularly when you got to Gotti he was the most ridiculous well humans were pretty damn flashy too so some of some of them some who listen they couldn't some of them I I till this day I detest nice cars I detest show calling attention to you sir because I saw too tight like right now like I would love to talk to the producers of this film because they're gonna miss a lot of authentic stuff well in fact I have a present for you I ordered you the same shirt Bruce Lee wore and fists of fury they're called Tommy said to us chained us Cubans when you when you were success my mom when Tony goes in missing his mother my mama success I I rarely die gastro when you become a success in Union City the Chinese t-shirt is your first sign of success because it has three buttons here right so you cut the buttons off and you what's your middle name James so it's Joseph James Rogen in diamond initials you put J jr. and that's when you reach success okay and they need that they they they that's part of their you know like there's so many little things the Cubans did but but take a guy like want for example my stepfather brilliant brilliant you know Paul II didn't talk on the phone Paul II didn't move for anybody Paul II had his messages delivered 10 in 1970 I'm looking at both of you gentlemen so I'm telling you that one would not even have a conversation if there was a phone in the room and it was hung up because in his mind that phone was fucking tapped right he was a genius if he had to meet Joe Rogan for a meeting at 9:00 at 5:30 in the morning he'd come and put a gun under a car just in case there was a problem with Joe Rogan he would hug you and you'd search him he would hug you and tap you back for a wire and tell you you will lose him weight and rubbing weight not all that hug you but they're feeling you for a piece right right one when my mother died he still had the same car he had one and he died with five million cash and he lived in a four-story walk-up when he died one of his friends said what a miserable life to make money and have to hide it like that hmm wad would walk around with jeans and t-shirts the same shit every day right and a wad of hundreds like this the hidden one the other one was single so you thought he was broke if he talked to you he talked to you in English once the cops came me no biggie and when you know who was the interpreter for all the attorney meetings with all those high-level guys mate really so I'd be it's who I'd be at home and my mom would go tomorrow you have to go with jail to de luca's office Sam de Luca and Sam to look would basically look at you and go I do enjoy great to see you today you'd have to bring him a suit he loves suit Sam De Luca so the more suits you brought him the better he was like the other guy the guy that had the thing but Sam would treat you just like this Joe Rogan go away being okay you gonna interpret this was how fast the conversation was you got busted for conspiracy of bookmaking that's two years listen this judge she's a motherfucker but thank God I know the prosecutor so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for 300,000 we lose the evidence for 200,000 you get a year for a hundred thousand you get probation and you do more year and a half way house and 450 thousand he just give you a menu when you decide what you want to do get back to me always a pleasure to see it and you had a week to decide yeah what you were gonna do Wow so you gave him that amount he knew his way through the court system you didn't don't know there's no time there's no time I know for a fact that he had caught with a gun in New York you get what's the law yeah oh yeah mandatory there's no stopping goal there's no trial they take you right to my stepfather Wong got caught what he done he was other than that the Lucas don't play game now now an answer Joe an answer to your question about the Cubans and why they existed for so long and didn't get busted you know the rumor was that they had a certain mystique because of this CIA could pedigree and that they were untouchable and in fact there I mentioned it in the book there's a case where the FBI is thinking about making a case against battle this is way back in the 60s they contact the US Treasury Department because they figure he's not paying taxes and they can make some kind of case against him on a tax violation they got a letter from the Treasury Department saying we're not gonna go after this guy because he's anti-castro and he's a veteran of the bad Pigs invasion it's right there in a in a letter from the Treasury Department to the FBI Wow so there were elements within the government that were protecting these guys particularly Bay of Pigs veterans we will not prosecute them that's incredible and so he had that kind of protection what a name to huh Jose battle Bosley yeah his name in Spanish was ba ta ba TL le and he changed it to battle it's a good one right if you're if you're a writer and a novelist and you're trying to think up a good name for the character that can't do any better and I grew up with a kid named major battle guy did Taekwondo with his name was major battle maybe back motherfucker too bad motherfucker name major battle which is merely a bad motherfucker major bad money but it was yeah Black Belt state champion and the only reason why they existed they were very careful they have a systemized union city ran Union city becomes Jersey City and Hoboken Union City ran 7th Street to 88th Street to White Castle but the Cubans really controlled 7th to 48th Street Bergen line and then when you went to New York Avenue they control from 50th up to about 60th Street and they kept to themselves and they didn't have social clubs and they didn't play cards outside and if you wanted to the bar they wore dress very moderately before them were bookies and they only stayed there till 3 o'clock because that's when the number goes in so you have from 9:00 in the morning to 3 to play that number but there's also a thing called the singular number which the odds are a little less that starts at about 12 so I'll see you at 12 and go care for numeral claiming I win my motherfucker I'll never listen to that fucking kid of mine again now I gotta go back to the bookie and bet the second number who leader believe that's one number at a time so I have an imagined dollars on the number five and is what is the number of the other potential numbers talking single digits only I could play it's normally a three digit read did you bet three digits so why would it be a single number well that was just a way to different it's a different one there were different systems for differences the sort of ways you could do it but let's explain this where the number comes from okay the total mutual handle at the racetrack is published in the newspaper every evening daily news and again in the morning how much money was bet total at the racetrack that day the last three numbers that's the daily number so everyone you know has it's the same number for everybody you know what it is as soon as it comes out in the newspaper and that's how it's determined so you have you have the individual numbers and then you have the early number with which is called won't come out of Brooklyn gas a Lyon Brooklyn and then you have the late number what's the New York number the number in the New York not all the side like what it would be based on that was decided probably a hundred years ago by some by some you know Guinea who ran who ran it for the Italians and maybe it came from Sicily whatever the origins are the don't try you couldn't fix that it can't fix it was because it's the I don't know what the track is gonna make how do you fix that right how would you fix the last three numbers it's now check this out certain organizations like the corporation part of the reason people wanted to bet with them and like to bet with them is they would have somebody at the racetrack so the minute that number was posted they'd know the number so you'd get your pit you didn't have to wait around for sports you had to call sports nobody remembers that you remember that TJ how you doing welcome this is Joe Rogan it's called what's line you gotta sit by a payphone and put thirty five section and they would run all right let my gel and after check the scores and they give you the score but whatever you bet was the last fucking day away so you had to sit there and take that holy a beat you motherfucker give it to me and then and then when it came to them saying the number the subway go by he just lost another thirty five cents but the whole numbers system like my mother was a degenerate numbers and then she could what killed her with the Yankees and the Red Sox later on but her game was the numbers the three numbers to do your track and now let's get greedy why don't we go to OTB yeah now see this is where why don't we just go to ODB to really complete your fucking day you degenerate I did the brilliance of battle and his organization was he didn't do sports betting and in fact part his arrangement with the Italians with the Mafia was you get bolita you get numbers but you don't get sports betting and you don't get these other things and so there was a there's a there's an example in this book of of a member of the corporation who starts against battles wishes starts playing doing sports betting that guy wound up dead battle killed him himself because he was going against the agreements going against the rule going against the rules that could turn the Mafia against them and bring the whole thing down right right wow that's amazing now in answer your question about how they came up with that number you got to remember it's all gambling this is the culture of gambling you know you're at the racetrack you're betting card games you're betting betting the number so it's logical that somewhere in that universe would be how the number was determined so it came from the racetrack right and then you also have the Puerto Rican Lottery and that comes in paperwork yeah it's different that's completely different paperwork paperwork so you buy paperwork that comes a lottery tickets my mother would buy the whole fucking sheet it's like ten dollars a thing but she would you could just buy the sheet and what is it it's a Puerto Rican them now you know that the corporation used the Puerto Rican lottery to launder their office yeah so you hit the number you're my friend what are you gonna win 220 thousand by the time they give it to you let me just give you 18 you know that's how whitey bulger laundered money that's how Sammy the bull one lottery tickets do yeah so whitey bulger won the lottery twice twice there's people in the neighborhood won the lottery he bought the ticket from him gave him money or whatever the fuck he gave him check this one out today's paper front page of USA Today confessions of a lottery scammer I brought this along I thought if he hadn't a lottery scam this is a guy big fat guy 300 pounds sitting on his ass in Iowa or somewhere who was on his device who figured out some way to intrude on some algorithm and he started scamming different states he scammed the state of Colorado out of four point eight million dollars and there is a total of sixteen point five boy you guys are good sixteen point five million now I'm thinking if this guy had scammed the corporation led by Jose McGill battle he he'd be he'd be dead he wouldn't be on the he'd be on the obituary section look what he says here was never my intent to start a full-out ticket scam yeah yeah he sent us up to 25 you could not scam organized crime in this way how do you scam lottery like you figure out you figure out how the number is determined and then you're able to play with it you're able to play with it see an organized crime you couldn't do understand that how could he like isn't there just a random system a computer program he found some way to to tap into that computer system to tap all women hack into a hack into it and I altered the number oh yeah whoa that's crazy wow that is crazy what what is fascinating to me is that this what you were talking about earlier what we're talking about about like that this was it gave them an opportunity for hope and that it was a part of the community oh yeah we're missing that in the West Coast the West Coast like off-track betting there's no fucking money here there's a few weirdos that go to the Hollywood Park but that's gone now you know I mean there's nothing here well yeah the West Coast never had this there's nothing yeah there's nothing like seeing that like I saw that and I saw what goes with it and it may sound oh he's spooky to most people but it's not who he spooky to people who are really really Sicilian and people who are normal Cuban when you're Sicilian in that culture there's women that you go to and they tell you things they're witches they're Sicilian witches whatever the fuck you wanna in in sleepers remember he goes bring the eyeballs to this lady what sleepers sleepers is a movie about for Irish kids that lay there was bullshit we have what I remember that movie it's about the four kids dinero plays a priest priest met Brad Pitt oh that's we smoked grandson okay there it is movie and then they they got the guy on Letterman and he started backtracking like Steven Seagal oh by the CIA involvement he said he will Arends oh Clark attack yeah he later on me said it was a true story and it was not a with bass but if you look at it one two or four those two kids were supposed to grow up to be West yeah but it wasn't it's emotional to bullshit mm-hmm I think the to one of the four those guys what are we talking about well you were told all their witches and he you know in the Cuban world is the same thing I want my kid to go to Catholic school right if I play this fucking number today this is gonna save me we you know we don't when you're a comic you have that hope I'm gonna go to the improv Jess Austin's gonna be there maybe you know just may it's it's a but it's an ethnic hope that comes back from your country it's hard to describe you understand because your grandmother was a fuckin bookie but if you talk to her on a daily basis about it and why she would play that particular number like my mom played 517 those are the last three numbers on my dad's gravestone hmm you know 604 was some other fucking hallucinogenic she had if I go like this if I go like this and I go you know what you're looking good today it don't take a yardstick most Cubans look at and go give me five hours on 2:53 because it's the last three numbers of 20 you fucking game now is this still going on oh yeah the numbers are still going on yeah not enough not as a that is a 10 bad office when I was a kid it was a 10 man office you were downstairs you had a bodega me and you ran the bodega that's to use and yesterday's paper always selling the book of dreams and then you come in and you give me 604 517 it comes on three sheets of paper with with copy paper so right away I rip the top one I give it to you I keep the other one and the other one goes upstairs to the department where now there's a big wall with zero to nine on the wall and I parked there so Joe just came up and played 219 there's two and awesome there's a list that goes down I'm a bored guy I just worked the board I got six guys with phones yelling nothing y'all rogon fucking just put a hundred miles on that number that motherfucker killed me last week fuck that sends fifty dollars of that to Miami cuz I could unload it to create the Union Opia you know when you when I take the sports bet I'm taking five hundred on Pittsburgh Pittsburgh's playing New England I can't take ten thousand on Pittsburgh and five thousand on New England that's not quality utopia I'm gonna make money on the Vig the ten points from you losing so if you bet ten thousand on somebody you bet five I unload five to another bank somewhere across town so this is how and I mean when I was a kid my mother had a bank in the Bronx and the guy that cooked was black Mike he was a Vietnam vet and I was five and he would give me ten bucks you'll get him blackberry brandy black my Italian food that was so fuckin good it was 1970 even if you hated black people you ate his spaghetti even Italians came to eat his spaghetti on Wednesdays he cook corned beef on Wednesdays he made Cuban food they have an office and every phone has a little tape recorder with a wire connected to the phone so you can't call me and say you played doing yeah it's recorded fuckin bust your fuckin cord way to tape for you so every hour the tapes come around destroy and those get destroyed the week after or that night after everything settled but to see those offices and actually you're a kid and I'm going to get cigarettes and then give me a time to go get a three dollar pack of cigarettes like keep seven now did you ever see the money what do you mean the more all the money that was gathered I saw how the money would be taken up I'd be a separate location I would be a separate locating room now there's also they move locations every week you also have to stay ahead of the cops so every week you got a guy like Joe Rogan that just rents apartments for me so every week we move locations so nobody ever gets comfortable with three months in one place then with three months in another place then with three months in another place because not only you have to worry about cops you got to worry about Jaime getting a little fucking cocky Jaime found out from Jody is that they make forty thousand a day Jamie's gonna look to guns but the two guns and try to go up there see because they got two guys on the third floor that just got two guns waiting it's like you to come upstairs the fourth floor it was you sir wheel it was surreal so in the morning is my mom would go you want to go to school today oh you wanna go with my mama cuz max I'm going with you because these bookies would all give me 20 40 bucks it's part of that Google now check this out at the end of the day every day that this is going on there cuz betting is going at every day seven days a week this system that Joey is talking about so money is coming in a lot of money's coming in it goes to the counting rooms so at the end of the day you got a lot of money and like to 300 different locations all around the New York area what they would do is they have people whose responsibility it was to come around collect the money that money would go into a van and that van would have a police escort as it left New York City went through the tunnel and in New Jersey it was met by New Jersey police who picked it up and escorted it from there into the apartments or the houses in Union City where the money was crazy Wow so the cops got paid so how can I tell you this at the age of 10 I knew this but I could never tell you guys you wouldn't believe me so I had to keep it to myself well most the kids wouldn't be able to shut the fuck up he was all out to talk about of course my world I didn't when were you Saturday we played handball all day gonna play with my uncle well those the drunks you worked for a sports betting place too later on as I got older but when I got out of high school I was such a loser then I went to one and 18th Street the guy's name was chair Jose Torres and the son I went to him like a man they were around the block to this guy named Rowley and Miguel and they ran a complete different operation from the cooperation Rawley spill around if I had any balls left I can go put a bullet in Ronnie's head because Raleigh was tight with my mother my mother helped get Rowley started on an 18th Street when my mother died he got tight with my stepfather when my stepfather died he took that money and gave it to my stepfather sister that money to me so today I'm still pissed off at Raleigh's because when I was a kid I saw trolley every fucking day he'd give me 50 bucks every time I went over there those guys lived their life I'm a karma based life so whenever they see Joe Rogan come in come in you know how many things like did with your father come in there's a hundred islands go get your dick suck my mother we would drive her crazy like how much money did you get today two hundred could give me for her to do that I used to buy knives and fucking stars to throw at people but that's there was a very generous Joe role mm-hmm you know you can't do that when you come over to my house with your daughters I can't first thing as they do is put a 50 in everybody's hair so now the girls know whenever they've come over uncle Joey's they get a fifty right so even after you're not around they'll come over when they're 14 and they're gonna go to Hollywood don't come over bounce but uncle Joey where you girls going you girls got money it's 50 so I hadn't people give me money because it's a karma based business hmm the more I came my mother would hit the number for 10,000 she'd give away really yeah because that's the generosity part of it mmm it's part of the community its yeah that's the thing you were talking about the communal communal barnable and I think that was even more pronounced with the Cubans because of the history of bolita and the cultural significance of bolita going back to Cuba that's something they brought with them to the United States and it was just you know like I said it wasn't seen as a as a criminal thing it wasn't seen as a violent criminal thing now what happens with Jose Miguel battle is at a certain point 1985 he moves from Union City to Miami and he moves the hierarchy of the organization to Miami but the money still being made in New York City the organization is as strong as ever and the money's being made in the five boroughs of New York and it's being shipped down to Miami where this guy now lives like a gentleman farmer on an estate he surrounds himself with memy trees man is a fruit from Cuba he associated the Sheikh oh yeah there is wonderful fruit beautiful great bullshit so he associated with his childhood so the first thing he does is he surrounds his estate down in Miami with this fruit from his childhood and he lives down there now far removed from New York meanwhile back in New York a war breaks out between the Italians and the Cubans over this thing called the to block rule when the Cubans and the Italians form their alliance they established the rule that you couldn't nobody could open up a bolita spot closer than two blocks to a pre-existing bully to spot somebody violated that rule I don't even know after investigating it who violated that rule but I real got violated and it turned into a nasty war an arson war they started fire bombing each other's spots and a lot of innocent people got killed men incinerated the four-year-old girl got killed it became horrific lasted for about eight or nine months there was something like 70 murders maybe 25 fire bombings at different bolita spots it got so ugly it brought down the heat of the feds nobody could ignore this corporation thing anymore so it brought a lot of unwanted attention to the lino who initially started off who violated yeah yeah he became a snitch and told the whole story the guy who violated it oh nothing I violated it but the guy who became the number one arsonist and set up the whole campaign of arson he became a snitch and and told the whole thing chapter and verse so it's basically just one cocky person just decided fuck this to blow he was probably authorized by his bosses to do it yeah go over and burn that spot will show them and then that happened and then the response was well we'll show them go burn his spot but burn in the spot came out of someone's violating the original deal yes who blocks well that's that was the reason the first burning how do they know who the guy was that started the first today kind of sit down and a sit-down about it here's our failed it was the the Italians and the Cubans had a major sit-down about it to discuss it to try to resolve it to keep it from exploding into war at that sit-down they didn't resolve anything and after they came out of the restaurant where the sit took place a drive-by shooting occurred and one of the Cubans got shot at the restaurant coming out of the sit down and then the war was on man it was on like battle said we're at war with the Italians that's what he said with with his people and battle was ready for it man he was good to go I mean he was ready for that war he seemed to want it he seemed to cherish the idea that they were gonna go to war with the Italians and so they were ordering all these horrific and you know how they did the arsons they'd get these mama Luke's to fill up a pail with gasoline not not even a can not even a clothes can an open pail and you know they could spill and they took that pail of gas and they'd walk into a bodega bolita spot and they dumped it on the floor and light it on fire and whoever happened to be in there too bad for them and people would die a horrible death they got incinerated I have some pictures in the book that are almost too horrific I had others that were so bad I I didn't want to use them in the book really you put something in that book that really blew my mind you said that in 1975-76 in Hudson County where I'm from there was 40 car bombings oh man 40 car bomb well I remember one bombings not all car bombers yeah in Hudson County from 7th Street to 88th Street there we have Bayonne Hoboken that's up there was 41 car bombings there was a time in the 70s in the US where bombings homemade bombs were like the preferred weapon of organized crime there were there was a there was a bombing war in Cleveland over this Irish gangster in the 70s it was it was pretty common really - they made a bomb with the nails the guy had gotten the Sicilians were good here they did make a movie about Danny Green yeah and now they were doing it again well they're doing the Irishman a different movie yeah it's fascinating stuff man now did anything surprise you when you were you were putting mean obviously you're well versed in organized crime and well versed and these kinds I think the dominant feeling people will have when they read in this book is the dominant feeling had when I was researching which was why don't I know this shit right I mean this is like really this is not only a great story really interesting but it's really important history all this political connection to anti-castro movement and the role the US government might have played in it and the idea that this criminal conspiracy organization was allowed to go on for 40 years because certain elements in the US government didn't want to go after them because they were afraid it would open the lid on the Cuban relations with the sea the anti-castro relations with the CIA the politics of it that's that's an that's not only interesting history it's important history to understand a certain social political relationship between the u.s. and Cuba the Bay of Pigs the residue of the revolution that's way the way that shaped the Cold War shaped u.s. politics over a period of about 50 years so I was like why don't I know this this is amazing this is like almost like a hidden history I mean I knew what got reported in the newspapers but you know you lift up the rug and you look underneath the rug and you start to get into the details of it it just makes me so aware that what we're receiving is information on a daily basis from the meat mainstream media and everything is a version of what's happening there's a whole other version of what's happening that we don't see and you usually only find out about it thirty years at later thirty years after the fact and that's a good thing to know yeah I mean it sounds to me like this is I mean I haven't heard a peep about this I mean when you brought this up to me Joey I was like what the Cuban organized crime the corporation what what is this like this is not discussed it's just not well hopefully this will change I grew up in it and I never talked about it because like I said I have a hundred stories we goof around a lot of shit I say in that I don't say it because number one you're not gonna believe me and number two it's not my position I was raised is not for me to say do you no matter yes but I saw that as a child then what made it worse than me was moving to North Bergen once I moved to NAS Bergen I saw what they were doing in Union City in a bigger way which is all political I saw things that'll make it tongue drop that's why I don't give a fuck about politics and the way well I see people talking about politics I want to go up to him and go if you knew what you were talking about you wouldn't say a word because you have no idea where real politics means how it works if it works like that and a microsystem I can't imagine in a real so I don't want to pay attention lets me ask you a question guys because I joined I connected when I had more or less written this book already if I had come to you way back at the beginning of this out of the blue all of a sudden this guy TJ English I don't know you guess you knew the West he so you knew who I was he knew I was legit if I had contacted you and said will you talk to me about this history would you have done it with everything it would take us a week to debrief me so you would have been ready in will I would have told you now you see what's interesting about that thing I would have known because somebody has here here this fucking story he opened up the door for me I have a responsibility now that I have another story to add to this yes he does I have the nuts and bolts of how this worked have you thought about in addition to this I think there's gonna be a number of spin-off books from this this is really your book that comes from this is one will tell their personal I was shot I will end up dead really I will end up dead not because of that because of what I'm exposed where we know who did it in in a you know you know I grew up when I was growing up the power in that Hudson County was the water frontage II that picture in New York City that people see thousands of people died for that waterfront that waterfront was controlled by Wheelock but everybody wanted a piece of it and North Bergen wanted a piece of it so my eighth-grade teacher was the Weehawken man you ever have a teacher that was a man why would your teacher be a mayor of a town why who's ever had a teacher tweet that was the mayor of a fucking town at the same time I did and guess what at the end of my eighth grade the I saw ATF come in and pull him out of that real he did 11 years okay is he doing he was selling the waterfront all that there's a particular family I will not mention because I won't even make it to the 405 and they will buy that property up no change the 60 and no no it will bind that property up in the 60s they were posing as politicians they chopped up 30 million a month now between four and then sell it no no this is from all the Papa property they own in Hudson County they bought everything Jersey City Hoboken but they make their profit selling it no no they made their profit renting it Oh renting it someone the fallen before brothers chopped up 30 million they go their own ways every month they chop her 30 million so I saw it from North Bergen when I tell you stories about carmine bolzano he was a cop he was a cop that I I got invited he opened up his home to me then his son died the one that was my age so I became his pseudo son so here I am running with the Cubans during the week they're talking about numbers and drugs and everything and I'm growing up in a cop's house that's also the driver for the mayor and he would do whatever like I saw him handcuffed dudes and throw beatings on him and they called him Vinny the tortes they called him karma in the towards Manzano because his job was to burn your building down the last one he burned down kids were like mister mister there's smoke he's like he's ten dollars go get ice cream I'll call the fire department he never called he faked a heart attack so you'd have to talk to reporters first thing you do is you think a heart attack huh because you have to talk to reporters that gives you two days to get your story straight with the attorney you have no idea what No now now the reason I ask show you the question about what whether he would have been willing to talk is a lot of people reached out to me early in this book process the the the movie rights were optioned before I even wrote the book based on the book proposal and I got a lot of media attention and I started getting emails from nieces and nephews of sons and daughters of key characters in this story and these were people like Joey who had kept this personal family histories bottled up dirty you hadn't talked to anybody about it and now they saw I was doing this book and they and they needed to get it off their chest they needed to talk about it I would go I met these two these two girls who were daughters of one of the guys who became a snitch testified against the corporation the family went into the witness protection program these girls had never talked to anybody when I met went to meet with them in a bar they weren't even sure they were gonna talk to me we were just meeting to talk about whether they were going to talk to me I got to meet them they talked non-stop for three hours once they thought they could trust me they just they couldn't stop talking about it they had all the stuff they needed to get off their chest we were raised not to say oh gosh oh gosh the first raid I saw on my mother I was fired they sat me on a couch and rated my mother had already thrown the coke golf about theater lady downstairs the landlord had already called and said the cops are on the way out the door we lived on the Westside terrace facing New Jersey and the lady downstairs she would pay her rent and tell her hold this bag my mother threw it they came up sat is down they asked us to leave we went to 88th Street 88th Street we never got raided when I moved to North Bergen I would get raided before I got raided the phone would ring and become my mouth a no tell your mom to clean the house I'd wake my mom up sided to clean the house and come over here I don't want you to see what's gonna happen cops are coming to arrest my mother I would walk the car my house my basketball right past the cops and it was that easy it was daddy's Wow do you wish you were ran into Joey before you started right it would have been a different book he wanted why I enjoyed this book so much is because no matter how much history this motherfucker dropped on you he let you know who Jose battle was he kept you reminded who Jose battle was that's big for an author he never got away from Jose battle and when you read the book no matter what type of person you are you kind of get mad at Jose battle but there's something about Jose Ballia right cuz you want that guy in your go on if you knew Jose battle and you knew that he got in the truck and said I'm going out there for my men yeah that's the guy I want with me all the time I'm gonna hang with this fucking idiot he gets Canada if ambulance goes by this guy actually went out and saved a guy's so he had that Cuban royalty that anti-castro Cubans shit that's big so growing up there were so many things I wasn't allowed to say I wasn't even allowed to talk about hmm now here's how ruthless this guy was let me let me let you answer the question though do you wish that you would run into Joey ah yes I do but how the thing that fears me there was so much research to do in this book if I would have met Joey I would have gone down a rabbit hole with Joey's stories and that might have taken me off this specific research I was doing so I almost Joey Joey's thing is like a separate thing yeah it's almost like a a sequel to or a sub or a son the son of the corporation sort of a spin off of it and there's a lot of people probably who have their version of it like Joey does that they could tell so yeah but let me say about battle because Joey's saying a very interesting thing how charismatic he was and how you partly liked him and admired him which was was is the case of any good leader right that's what you want from a leader but here's how ruthless this guy was he had a guy in his organization or Nesta Torres or Nestico who he met in Spain battle was on the run in Madrid for a brief period of time when he'd been indicted on gambling charges and there were a bunch of Cubans living over there and they all hung out together and he he discovered this 19 year old kid named Ernesto Torres who was sort of an orphan and one day he tells the kid he's gonna mentor the kid one day he tells the kid I've got a guy coming over this afternoon to the apartment I want you to watch he owes me $10,000 I'm gonna scare the shit out of this guy I want you to see what you do how you treat somebody who owes you money show them that they can't play around with you so he's waiting for the guy to come over the battle and he sit in his apartment he hears a pop pop from out in the street he goes down he goes out earnest eco 19 year old is there with a gun in his hand he shot the guy in the backseat of the cab arriving to meet with battle and killing him and he says Padrino Godfather says you'll never have a problem with this guy again I took care of it and battles looking at it going you just cost me $10,000 I didn't want the guy dead but then again he looks at her nasty corn he thinks I can use I can use this guy I can use this guy so earnest ego becomes what he calls his prodigal son and he grooms this guy to maybe be the next Godfather when they come back to New Jersey they come back to Union City he he sends this guy or Nestico out there and no one else in the corporation can understand battles affection for this guy they think Ernest ich was a thug he's a killer he's a street thug yeah the organization can use guys like that but you don't put him in positions of authority battle scene have a soft spot for this guy he makes Ernest Tico a banker he makes the other bankers bankroll put up $10,000 each so that Ernest Tico can be a banker they don't like it most of them don't like it but they go along with a couple of them don't go along with it Ernest Tico doesn't have the brains to be a banker he fails miserably as a banker he's humiliated by that and so what he does he start kidnapping bankers from the organization and holding them for money very self-destructive thing to do he turns against the organization he goes rogue one of them he shoots a banker he kidnaps and shoots happens to be battles brother-in-law the bankers come to Jose Miguel battle they say you you created this this fucking monster you brought this kid in you created him you got to take care of it battle being the man he is realizes that's true it's his responsibility he hires a few assassins to try to take her in asti clout they bomb his car in Union City they try to kill him I can't get the job done battle decides he's got to do the thing himself by this time earnest eco has fled to Miami he's hiding out with his girlfriend in opa-locka battle gets together his brother one of his brothers and another assassin Gino hakuna and they go down too they go down to Miami and in the middle afternoon they burst in this guy they find out where he is they burst in his apartment they engage in a wild shootout with earnest eco and then shoot him it in the closet of his bedroom and battle goes in grabs him by the hair and shoots him right right it puts a bullet right between his eyes now that's a boss I mean aside from the horrible nature of the act that's a leader that's a guy who takes matters into his own hands he wants something done he goes and you know does it himself and uses that as an example for the organization he comes back to the bosses the bankers in New York he says you're not gonna have a problem with with her nasty Co anymore he says you know what he died like a lion he fought to the death he empty he fought until he'd empty his gun and then we shot him in the closet so he's telling all the other bankers I still admire the kid he fought like a lion but I took care of it it's done and you know the other the other bullet the bankers were in were in awe of this guy because he had a certain ability to do that that they didn't have this in the book oh yeah yeah there's pictures of it what was the logic to take this thug and turn him into a banker in the first place yeah sauce my forum battle was a sentimentalist he took in stray dogs he'd drive around this he'd drive around and he'd see a dog on the street he'd opened the door and he'd say coming if the dog come he took the dog in and in his home in Miami as a state of Miami he had like 25 stray dogs and they said or NSTIC always like a stray dog he had a soft spot for the kid before I piss real quick hmm you know Cuba the dog is a big symbol my toy is Lazaro big you care when Michael Vick got convicted there was a lot of jails he couldn't be sent to because they hadn't I'm a qua population and they don't play when it comes to dog because their devotion it's the same Lazzaro hmm my Saint Lazarus who got he's the one with the crutches that got his licks and then Rose mystical battle was a lot like you bro when people would say thee why do you bring re and Jody is on the road because I love these motherfuckers and fuck you you got a problem fuck you you know I'm saying that's when he was he was very loyal and and tell you until you turned on theater no but you know they almost canceled the soprano HBO got really pissed at The Sopranos and Episode seven when he drives his daughter to the school and he kills the guy personally because HBO felt that bosses should never do it that was he did that all the time HBO phone HBO felt they were that they were that chase fuck does Ross Greenburg yeah they were that chase and said we don't think in real life a boss memory went and he picked up the guy by his neck when he drove whatever Willow to college mmm that did HBO threatened The Sopranos not to add that episode to cut that to make somebody else kill the guy that wasn't the only guy was that because they wanted Tony Soprano they still wanted him to be some sort of a hero clean hands clean there's no ridiculous because that was one of the more appealing things about that show sure he was a murderer but you still like that at the end he killed pollute oh he tried to that was right that section brother they cut his leg off oh yeah let me tell you let him on fire tell you the pirogue we had the Palouse story pallulah killed battles brother his youngest brother in a dispute shot him in a in a bar in Washington Heights very public murder I mean a an insult to the battle family so now Jose Miguel battle is fucking livid and at the funeral in Union City he gathers his men together and he says you know I want this guy's I want this guy's head on the wall I want I want to be able to mount this guy's head on my wall and he puts out a hit on this guy for thousand dollars and this is in the 70 so you know that's probably a million it's probably a million dollars earnest ich was the one that takes on earnest econ another assassin are the ones that take on that contract and they go out trying to get Pololu I mentioned before there's there's something like nine attempts or twelve attempts on pollutes life they had a shootout in Central Park with machine guns in the middle of the afternoon guys with machine guns shooting with you know mothers with baby carriages and stuff Pulu who got shot up so bad he loses his leg he winds up having to have a prosthetic leg they still go after Pololu when pallulah goes to prison they hire a killer to stab him in the prison yard twice to several times and he survives that he keeps surviving he survives so many of these assassination attempts they they they think he's not human they come to believe that he's got some Santeria spirit who's protecting him so when you think someone has I was sure he was here for this when you have someone you think has a Santeria spirit protecting them you have to counter that with a Santeria spirit of your own you have to have what's called a Bembe where you were you where you create a kind of voodoo energy to to kill this guy so they so they continue to go after Pluto finally battle as he did with earnest eco says I'm gonna take matters into my own hands I'm gonna I'm gonna be there on this one they find out where Pulu Lou is in the Bronx and they go on one night and they trap him they cars come from all sides they trap him he gets out of his car they shoot him in the street they shoot him full of 11 bullets he falls in the street bleeding loaded with gun shots the last thing he sees is Jose Miguel battle standing over him laughing at him and then he goes unconscious in the street they think great he's dead they're almost ready to celebrate the following morning they find out nah Pulu was rushed to the hospital he's not dead he's recovering now they're beside themselves with Kony all they've tried everything everything they say you know what we're not going to give up they hire an assassin dress him up as a male nurse he goes into the hospital shoots Pulu in his in his hospital bed right between the eyes and I got to they got the job done he was talking when you were gone about how if you felt like a guy had a Santeria spirit protecting him you had to have your own Santeria figure to come back yeah about it Santeria became a scam after all like I was raised in Santeria from the age of five I had little disturbances when my dad died I was weak I didn't they didn't put me into Santeria to be a witch doctor explain Santeria to people who don't know it it's a religion that originated in Africa and Nigeria and then the slaves brought it over to Cuba they hid it from the plantation owners through Catholicism so that's why there's a lot of cross it's kind of a mixture of African and Catholic religion when I was five I was brought up to 140 h3 and this lady had a collie a dog and I loved the collie I love dogs and I was allergic to him so I was playing with the dog she would talk to me and I fell in love with this woman I fell in love with her she was like my mother and then as I got older one that they asked me do you want this do you want that do you want get that like wah which is the first one you get and like why no goon yo Romero those are the first things you get and you put them by your door and they guarantee you know your safety for me it was health that big black woman is my godmother okay and then after that when I was six they finally said they were gonna initiate me and my mother because my spirit took my father so they wanted my godmother they wanted me and my mother to be twins in the Santeria so I made st. Hodge in the 48th Street and Broadway and but for me it wasn't to be a killer or to be anything like that I can't carry guns I can't go on cars with strange people I can't do business with three people I can't say I hope Jamie fucking gets hit by a car I'm not allowed to say all those things I don't use it the way in the late seventeen you do business for three people because two of them will saddle up against you that's the same thing that happened to me on my kidnapping I robbed somebody with three people I can't stay in everything look at my life now look at my life when I was smart and white powder my Saint in my head is controlled like that's why I always wear a white t-shirt on Mondays it's a dance what you always wear a white t-shirt on Monday look at my shoes white on white always my step out of the shower I walk on totally mad every day every day every day I some still very Santeria in my head I wasn't when I was doing the coke because I knew I wasn't allowed to what happened in the in the mid 70s with Santeria was I would pay you to tell me what you wanted to hear listen I got a big cargo coming in from Colombia with 200 kilos what would the Saints say I do it's fucking religion they don't fucking transport blow but these people got enamored with it so it was like you know TJ you know I want to kill Joe Rogan let me put his spouse he's supposed to yeah write your name on the thing and then take a tongue and put it in a cow's tongue like there was a big story when I was a kid Fatah T one of thoughthey story that he's in a book he's Omega 7 I didn't know this growing up he went to court one time and his godmother made a powder and before the judge went to make a verdict she's played the power and image and the thing and the judge fucking couldn't remember what the fuck he was about to say so I dismissed the case and she became a star after every fucking criminal wanted to give her thousands of dollars clothes the powder would like the thing they made there's a movie they called years ago it was the devil's advocate with with Donna Reeves and Pacino yeah and there's one scene where he has to go protect the guy the guy's a Santeria guy New York is prosecuting him because he's killing animals without a license and he goes watch this he takes the tongue on he puts the tongue down he blasted tongue with like a thing and they says he asked a guy what's the judges name and the judge gave his name and he took chun-hee rolling with nails when they pull it away and they go don't worry about tomorrow the next day at court the judge starts to fucking talk and he goes into a coughing spree he can't fucking talk now that person looks like a hero these were all subtle coincidences that these fucking specks were fueled by now so now I gotta have a big week Joe Rogan what is the saint say and you get four pieces of coconut you throw them on the floor and the Saints say this is gonna be your week let me give you $20,000 so now drug dealers started doing it with Noriega got busted he had Santeria in his closet Fidel was well-known for Santeria in his closet these dudes well they have a special you haven't you have an alter I made a promise when I lived in that apartment that have got if I thought I got me a house he'd have his own room go to my house my Saint is in my office if you if you get into the Cuban thing you it will get you they'll get it will get you it so I have enough you have to have peleg wise my oratory she's a little boy you do this it's a belief system why did you do because you can't really understand that culture unless you embrace it on some level you understand it and live it unless you continue it even after the book oh yeah why's that people talk to me when I've thrown cards about you throwing cards about women people have done my readings they have mentioned you and my readings really that you're around the bureau bottle eyes son all the way to the end was that mean about the lies on the old wise st. he has 24 different passages he goes my passages or yah guna that's the one you don't want around cuz they were supposed to push on going my head but to time me down I was her Chango son Chango means thunder whenever you see thunder is shit that's chunko chunko is a bad and a woman you can't kill mice around him they behead of them because a mouse woke him up and he woke up and oh it's fuck look like it's a mansion you have no idea drum the conga drum was just a thunder you know summoning the Thunder yes well they put a bow on my head to calm me down I'm not supposed to carry weapons I can't have knives on me I can't get into arguments my mother and the sand is no chewing she's just a whore she's just a tomb is the horror of the saints she gave him her kids so yeah my outer raise if you have problems with your stomach or you want to have a kid you have to pray it or chill you know but the women saints of worse than the male saints you don't fuck around with the women saints cuz they will fuck your world up soon is he probably Mary Magdalene yes and yeah my yah sent a message to my mother my mother didn't do it my mother died oh you know he says that there's another side to the story and you know like I told him it didn't last I'll be honest Michael my mother hid me for years they sent me the Sacred Heart School for Boys yeah she sent me that are you gonna go to education but she sent me that because it was a lot of shit she didn't want me to say it that thought and when I got it at Catholic school I was introduced to it and one of the things I got introduced him one night was the end of Union City the end of that political era where everything was running smooth to an end like in 76 that's when allegations started to come up because there was two cops that would shake my mother down very decent people him coming one guy came well-dressed would have a drink talked to my mother in Spanish my mother would feed him it was a price of doing business Joe Rogan now here's how I knew Joey was legit because when we first started communicating he mentioned the name of one of these cops and that name is in the book Frank Mona yeah a well-known cop in in Union City at the time so I knew right away Joseph right Mona came to your house and you had two hundred thousand only on a thousand one make it to police station so my stepfather Juan wanted to kill him he confiscated ones Electra 225 that was like free you know like when Tony Montana picks up Michelle five and he goes why it's a Cadillac right let me tell you so you could put a Porsche the best Porsche in the world in the 1975 Cadillac mixed to a Cuban he's gonna take the Cadillac because that's that's a scheme that's radical that's what it is to be fucking America yeah when Mona took that Cadillac from one he didn't shut up about that for ten years he wanted to shoot that fucking cop but that cop was a clean car that was a dirty cop and he always busted my mother's balls but he wouldn't come in for the shakedown there was two other guys then about 76 this guy started coming that kind of looked like like Jim Morrison Cuban good-looking dude with another white partner and they would come in and they would yell at my mother and my mom had up the bar the pool table in the back and then she had him a main office if she had to take a number or somebody wanted to play a number she rented an apartment she owned the building so she rented the apartment upstairs that had a wine to the back so you couldn't you follow him st. Ian so you could she go in the back office I wasn't that back office one day and I heard yelling and I came outside this cop was pressuring my mother saying fuck you we know what the fuck you're doing we want our money now at that time Union City ran from 7:00 to 48th Street and there was a bunch of bars with gulen Teochew cafe la-dee-da the cafe of artists and brindis these were all well-known Cuban bookie spots and this guy started torturing Cubans and the Cubans were like what the fuck is going on we pay and Austin this guy but won't best the Cubans off the most was that this guy was cute his name was Nicky Gerardo and he was you know whatever and just kept on in one damn and I used to go to McKinley school and I would walk up to my mother's bar and one day I walked up there and every one of those Cuban owners were in that drinking fucking yelling and that Castro shit there was one way before the Sopranos his name was boiled Lisa that means sad pussy he owned the club on 35th Street now in Union City you also gotta remember there's a bar called the bottom of the barrel and if you read any mafia books the bottom of the barrels and every mafia book its sound it's where Henry Hill hung out Dominic Montague Leo and nino gaggi it's right there I'm burning Lionel so all this was going on in Union City is the real fucking deal okay is the real now fucking deal now before we get off Santeria yeah I told you the story about earnest Eco right after a nasty cool got murdered and they searched his apartment they found a bunch of tapes he had been taping phone conversations with all the people around him and he taped some conversations with his mother back in Cuba earnest Eagle knew he was hunt a hunted man he they had been attempts he was hiding out in a phone conversation with his mother like three days before they got him he's talking with his mother and she says I I know I'm worried I know they're trying to get you I'm worried I'm gonna do a bambe to try to protect you and he says yeah I need it you know he says I'm caught in the middle of a war of the saints I'm caught in the middle of a war of the saints and she says I need some names for my Bembe and he names the weasel it's a Bembe a ceremony you know a ceremonial summoning of the spirits for one purpose or another and she was above allow a priestess so he gives her the very people who are after him Jose Miguel battle he says Geno a Cunha he names all the people who are trying to kill him so his mother can use those names in her ceremony so when the cops find this obviously the the Bembe didn't work because they killed that got to earnest eco and killed him but on the other hand when the cops found this tape it was like earnest eco speaking from the dead and fingering his the people who killed him and they were able to use that as evidence they knew exactly who killed him because of that tape conversation with his babalao so how the fuck do I fit into Santeria what do you use a couple years ago I rather and some guy told me that you have a couple strong about a lot people in your life and that's definitely you you're a hold of wiser guy you're not violent you're very controlled you're a lot more controlled than I am which is more of a I'd lean towards the Chango face my my my main thing is a YA guna hug when I was the yellow bottle ah he's the one that took a sword and wiped it on his chest with red and they asked him why did he like to kill him he said because blood makes change something stupid he read he has but I don't practice that I don't my Martha is very calm but one one guy goes season he's a badass motherfucker he mentioned didn't mention your name didn't meet they don't need to mention names to me once they tell me I already know what they're talking about I don't really know what they're talking about so I still go get readings like when I go to Miami next time I go to my godmother see this is the reason what thing on my head I still follow it this is the reason I still follow you were asking me why I would still follow it it's because once you get to an understanding of the idea that there are certain spirits within you and they all the orishas represent different spirits once you understand that that's not something you throw away even if you don't follow the religion anymore you still believe you still have belief in that you still believe in that so my Orisha is ellegua ellegua is the saint he's a trickster eligos a trickster plays little tricks and also the saint of passages so people put le gua of their door cuz you're passing from one room into another room and so you identify with that spirit and that becomes part of your identity you can't whistle in the house why did you have my like why you can't whistle in the house yeah I don't wish you can't go in the house cuz he'll leave so you can't fuck them whistle whistle No Wow when I was a kid I'd sit at the table and do ya you can't whistle my mom was gonna cut that fucking table you're gonna wake your fucking head cuz god lives in the table now Joe I grew up in it they ain't same to me like the one when I made st. was in November and they'd end up in the Bronx River so they had to break the ice and there with dark-skinned Cubans and I'll never forget that they rip your clothes off and then they take whatever your st. is they hit you with the number of water so if your st. is five you get hit with five things of water and they dry you up or you're freezing and when I saw them ripping my mother's clothes off that was about five I'm like fuck you black motherfuckers I started running down Bronx Boulevard they had to chase me I didn't want to do it it's an all-night ceremony on a Friday that's crazy twelve hours long Oh Mike you're sleep and then Sunday is when they read your future to you and then for a week you just live in the corner white they paint your head you're bald I had to go back to school on Monday bald with a hat they said he's not allowed in here with a hat my mother gave the principal a small nickel and I was a lot the way they have from 9:00 to 3:00 but then at 3 o'clock I had to go home and change into white clothes for a year not for a year I'd address some white for a year a year so for my cause I would just have to wear white socks and white t-shirt cuz I was a kid I can't keep wearing fucking white every damn I'm ripping shit right so that your hair has to grow back so when I walk into I don't there's a ton of Santeria in LA well I don't deal with it at all because it's all the same thing like everything else in LA it's a bunch of white people who didn't grow up and in there and there's a hot black guy and they want to really just suck his dick please tell them about spirits I saw a video today I saw videos I own my shame on them it's all confuse I could white chicks that sucked at him dude dick when they go to hot yoga know that guy that sacrum Bikram Bingham is a pig you got is a bunch of white chicks with hummus flavor in their mouth dick he he gets to me inside he you suck that fucking dead dick that smells like hummus chips you know that's what it is in that way like I've been invited to two parties first time I went you know who's in there who fucking the dude from that play et on me Forrest Forrest Whitaker Santa isn't big really to check that won Miss America feed and pussy from behind the ladies in this area they're all individually Oh Vanessa yeah it's not my Santeria I grew up in the cube mesentery different Santeria because it's not cute is it Mexican influence oh no this is why they oh my god Forrest it's very watered down yeah and look at the guy from lumber Danny Glover Forest Whitaker dressed up like yeah like fucking monks great I don't do it I don't pop the plate came up hilarious I came up under the very strict shut your mouth nobody need to know you fucking business ladies too yeah it was his stepping and this is what it is here it's more of a you know like whenever I the guy like the guy that gives me the reads is tremendous I'm gonna tell you this man-to-man tremendous really tremendous I even took Duncan home tremendous you took Duncan told us we had him on the podcast and everything the problem with him is I don't like his the people around him yeah it has too many people that don't know when I didn't join this I knew what I was getting myself into right you don't say I'm like I knew I knew I liked it I'm not doing my mother I was to do my godmother I and it was my relationship with her in fact my mother couldn't even say shit to me in front of my god mom when when an 85 I my mom and I moved in with the Bender's I couldn't bring my Santeria shit with them they're fuckin Italians so I left there with this gay guy named mark fag money and money gone he sold coke at night who is that he was a seamstress in the daytime for a big New York play when I was a kid he would go to CBGB's every night and sell coke use all these fags walking around today should give thanks to Martin he was getting his teeth knocked out and black eyes back in the 70s because he was gay but right I like Martin I ended up my I left my st. with Martin and then he is later in the Robin Martin my cocaine fucking Heil so my godmother asked me in 1985 was you Saints I go there at Martins house she goes you know you're not supposed to have you were saying to the gay man's house I'll go get him listen to me I never saw my godmother we're gonna have to 95 I did a I talked to Duncan about Santeria and some company approached me from London and I did the Santeria podcast and I got an email on Twitter we know who has you Saints there in Miami 34 years later I flew to Miami I've got my say-so to get him I flew together shipping back you know how my godmother got him to Miami out on a bus whoa so six cases on a bus with all your future and your stuff I got my notebook and if you look at my notebook I bring my notebook next time and you reading you go Joe really oh yeah so you you you you believe there's something to it I till the age of 11 I thought they were a bunch of hocus pocus motherfuckers but there was a lady of 26 in central and I grew up with her kids her husband was that big book in on an 18th Street and once a month she passed a spirit and people go there ten eight people who were invited and I could tell this cop was eating away at my mother first of all my mother didn't lay down for nobody my mother was going to shoot that motherfucker I self she if she was that type of Cuban woman she didn't like being spoken to that way I could see it in her face of his eat and fucking on line and one night we went over to this lady's party the first time I saw the lady drink a bottle of fire you know that hundred and forty proof aguardiente hmm so I thought this is bullshit this is bullshit this is she emcees that bottle out in the daytime so at night I would watch her bottles and they had the label like they were sealed because I have my mother had a bar so I knew if they were sealed in her probably this woman would pass a spirit and then tell you what to do and what not to do on this particular night she wanted to come my mother she goes I know it's bothering you and she took a white dish she took a white dish that was just there and she took a candle and she turned it over and she went like this this circular motion I'm gonna Campbell how much 10 or 11 Joe Rogan at that time that I believe I don't believe in dick I didn't believe in dick I didn't believe in Jesus I don't even fuck it's the story they tell you she flipped over the dish and it was a circle with a guy that looked like a beard she goes just was bothering him and my mother goes yeah she goes and she broke the dishes she goes seven days he'll never bother you again four days later looking up Nicky Jurado was his name they shot him a thousand fucking times at a place called rapido taxi it was a front there was a taxi thing that was a front for cocaine they delivered cocaine rapido means quick they never had a customer in their cabs he wasn't to make a collection they were wait this is the one you told me about ki turanga they said they got the witness wasn't no witness was the Union City cops from shop Wow because he went by it's like if me mean you were partners and also that come around and start collecting from giant is how corrupt to sustain in the papers they said he died a hero that he was shot by a street criminal and he was given a hero's burial no and Joey says he was shot by other couple I know they know it they always knew city was that dirty did you hear this when you were doing your research no I didn't why I told him yeah he told me and I did some research on it found out that the guy I read the public account of what happened it was quite different and what how Joey describes it there was the cops in Charlotte because he'd take the food and that's why I was saying before about the what the the story we see on the surface and then the real story underneath see I know all those don't you know like after that the political system I mean in his book he has a section where you actually see battle go to the police station and to make payoffs like that's how easy it was you know battle got arrested in North Bergen in my hometown so I call one of my friends I go do some research on it they said they never even put the cops on he own the town he owned the tea on the mayor and the police chief and if you all do say they both went to prison eventually for taking money from the gambling from ya know mayor Jamie when you get a minute no mayor has ever left Hudson County if it's not through prison you don't know the mail the fat Guinea he died cuz he was eight hundred pounds every other man ends up in jail the fact the mayor Union City is up for corruption charges as we speak and this is what thirty years later I read that is that recently it's never stopped Joe Rogan it's never ever stop that's why when people tell me stories I wipe my ass now and also this is when you say organized crime is diminished well we're talking about organized crime right it's still there it's deeply rooted in the system in certain jurisdictions and it's not gonna change it's just crazy to me that you got so deeply entrenched reading the story that you started getting into Santeria I was actually interested I was married to a Brazilian for ten years is called macumba and what's different about their verse it's almost exactly the same that they have all the same Saints it's the same thing same thing because the slave trade came through Africa Catholicism mixing they just the music is different but the Cubans it's a rumba all this wonderful rumba music that you hear there's a whole bunch of great music that grows up around it so you were married to a Brazilian woman yeah get divorce to keep the religion yeah I can't go to places like Cuba in Brazil because I get so influenced and overwhelmed by the changes the direction of my life really I went to Brazil like the first full day I was in Brazil I fell in love with the woman that I married and lived with for the next ten years Wow when I go to Cuba it's dangerous to me because I'm so seduced by it I'm so intoxicated by Havana by Cuban culture what is it well first of all it's the most sensual place you have an is the most sensual place I've ever been everyone flirts the women flirt doesn't matter if they're married or not married they flirt with you I suppose guys flirt too everyone flirts there's like sexual energy everywhere the sky and and the climate is just kind of sultry and and and sensual the music is makes your body move Joe would you let me play a video for you to show you some of the dancing in Cuba sure when women dancing humor they cover their pussy because what I'm trying to do the whole dance is me baiting you it's one of the prettiest things you've ever seen in your life it's me coming up to you with this movement like when I played it like you all I was getting nowhere with you all I was getting on Kass way before the podcast he was tightening so I had to play the poppy mistake my pan sauce and once he heard that I could see Nigeria coming alive he even got up and kicked his leg one time which meant were wrong because it's so any better than your culture but in Cuban dancing I'm coming up to you oh and every time I come out oh and I'll go like this and go like this yeah you gotta come and put your ass but the whole time you'll be covering your pussy because on the exchange I'm gonna grab your pussy hobby why Steve would do phenomenal with you here's how it's not serious I take it by the way what is this oh I I love I love Afro Cuban music Latin jazz so I'm hosting I'm curating and hosting a Latin jazz series in New York at a bar called sink every Thursday night TJ English and his Latin jazz explosions so I get to choose the music the musicians that perform there and I and I host the evening Wow you do this every week yeah we're gonna try to just keep keep it going indefinitely that's phenomenal so this to you was a natural subject to sort of in gross yourself well I had written I published the book Havana Nocturne which was about the mob in Cuba in the 50s and I really got into it then made numerous trips to Havana for extended periods so this book was almost like a sequel to that yeah it was a nice way to revisit that culture pick up the thread of that story because this one is sort of an answer you get to the end in the event of an anak turn and you you ask yourself so then what happened what happened after the Mafia got chased out of Cuba what was their response how did they take it I want to show you this is a Cuban yeah what does it say what's the name of the Wankel well I call this a little bit watch you see how everything is look look at this yeah so I told me always about 90 watch him move so the game's not about genes little about what was it with yo el Ziggy what the grandma pussy is a seduction is a duck yeah they're both there they're engaged in a mutual seduction this is a crazy dance Jamie what's the name of this show it to me gwah i unco is the rhythm one goal is the riddle you a legitimate a beauty and Mooney Iquitos mony Iquitos mu n e qu i t OS d Matanzas Matanzas is the province Wow watch how she grabs a pussy every time he comes close now that mutiny you tried to grab it he just you try to grab it and she blocked it oh yeah they don't fuck around that's hilarious so the drumming you're hearing and the use of what's called the shaker a that gourd there and the chanting that's going on that's you at all you would hear all that in uh Santeria ceremony Wow this grabbing the pussy shit is hilarious hilarious yeah he got his junk too occasionally but he's probably just checking how we doing down there see like he's grabbing it he's like squeezing to see he's just playing with it he just threatened the grab and she grabbed it that's hilarious so it's very playful its flirtatious right this is the culture there that's Cuba you know it's funny in 1985 I lived in a building in Fort Lee and there was a Panamanian woman and she told me that she went to Cuba twice as a young girl and she wasn't surprised what was going on in Cuba there was God's punishment she goes it was such a disgusting fucking place and then it was weird a couple days after I'm talking to TJ somebody on Facebook I did a joke from my see so special about Club 38 the owner whose name was Willie Vandy and his claim to fame was that his grandfather had the biggest dick in Cuba I grew up with two kids that had a claim to fame one of them his dad was the best pool play in Cuba and Americans would go down and he beat the fuck out of him and pull he played they played Chicago eight-ball whenever Michigan yeah the other guy he's blamed the fame was that his grandfather was the guy in godfather 2 who had the big dick and they called him Superman and I'm Saturday nights at Club 38 in Union City he would on Saturdays he recreated and he's had people come down and it'd be like a comedy show $10 ticket and 200 people he would get some coke out chick tire up to Cubans like that would play to Congress and he'd come out and fuck the lady in public you could go crazy with the biggest dick in the world and then my job fucker in public that was a whole fuck show that was a public fuck show but it went all the way back to - like 55 like the name of the place was the Shanghai theatre shanghai theater and yeah godfather to michael takes they take michael there and all sudden he goes i would have never found this place if it wasn't for Johnny Ola and that's when Michael finds out that he betrayed him so it'll show the guy wouldn't it have been simpler if the guy with the big dick was also the greatest pool player cuz he could just oh my gosh that would have been perfect so they did this article about two weeks ago it's on my facebook and it's called in search of Superman Joe Rogan it was the most disgusting article I had ever read in my life that these white dudes went on a fifty-year looking for Superman and the legend of the guy with the big dick in fact Duvall went to Cuba to the location even though it's closed just to see where it was and what the story is that us as Americans will go down and every week and that was our first stop to see this big black Cuban dude fuck the shit out of some poor white chick you know yelling and screaming the place was sold out every night I mean the guy was a gardener the article is sensational if you could find it it's called in search of Superman and they is Superman Ivana but when it came out the same week that they said that what are you fucking know fake that's real that's why they call him Superman afraid of now you know I saw I saw a video of Superman when I was researching Havana Nocturne I found out that Santo Trafficante had a lawyer named Sam Reagan Oh since deceased but Sam igano used to take a lot of Super eight videos when he'd go down to Cuba his son was currently a lawyer in Tampa told me that he had super 8 footage of Superman that his father had made in the 50s Superman at a private sex show fucking a girl and I said ooh I gotta see that could I see that I mean I think that's the only existing video footage anywhere of Superman and he says yeah but I'm not gonna give it up you got to come to Tampa and I'll show it for you so I go down there I'll never forget he's a lawyer too he says you got to come at six o'clock after the after the office closes so then we can watch it and I get there in the cleaning ladies still there so he brings me in the conference room where he's gonna show me the film I we got to sit there and wait until the cleaning lady's done because he didn't want to put this film on while the clink while the cleaning lady's in the room so he puts it on the plates office completely empty and he shows me this footage and his father had scored it to like vogner or Beethoven like triumphant classical music and it's it's at a private show it's in somebody's home they had private sex salons in Havana where you'd go to like some rich person's house you'd pay some money you had cocktails and then someone had to clap at a certain time and you knew that was time for the show and everyone would sit down and Superman would come out and he he fucked this Cuban woman who was who was small he was big and she was small and he's banging her from every conceivable angle it was the least sexy thing you've ever seen in your life I mean it looked like it looked like some kind of torture really and that was it and this guy had this footage which is probably worth a lot of money big was dick dick dick was big it wasn't no I say that because it wasn't like it wasn't the I'm not sure was even the biggest dick I've ever seen I mean it's bigger than my dad's bigger than normal it was bigger than the guys today it's almost like athletes like if you go back and look at you know when Jim Brown was playing football he was very impressive but was he Herschel Walker you know I'm saying like athletes of today's era are different and if you go back and look at John Holmes yeah he had a big dick but was it lexington steele you know like these guys have bigger dicks now but the people that they're more advanced people are growing the thing that freaked me out of the human species is advanced advancing but then that freak yeah about Santo that I'll enjoy from your first book of an elector and I want to tell Joe the stories that one time Kennedy went to cast Cuba as a senator and they were having some type of meeting but fucking Kennedy can focus right what are you just like and that they like what the fuck is wrong with me sample traffic can't because I know exactly what's wrong come on and they tap them on the show then they bring him in a room he's embellishing this a little tell me guys remember this is better this is what I remember I read and that I guess Santo he SiC them on to women well he set up they filmed it he said three ways yeah no they didn't film it no they wish they they wish they had filmed it they said they set him up in a room with a two-way mirror and they watched it happening and then one of them turned the other and said shit we should have filmed this this would make great blackmail material right well I thought that was kind of a freak the freakiest of the freaks right yeah well but you got to keep in mind he wasn't married he was a young senator he used to get this senator from Florida named George Smathers and the two of them would go down to Havana this is around 1955-56 when the whole thing was in its heyday and that was a big part of Havana politicians and businessmen would go on junkets to Havana like you know paid for by the company we can retreat go to Havana and they'd go to the sharing eye theater and they they'd have trysts sexual tris and they'd go crazy and it was out of sight out of mind it was the original you know what happens in Havana stays in Havana it was all different country I wasn't gonna make the newspapers so they go there and they rub elbows with Santo Trafficante and Meyer Lansky and it they loved it it was exciting it wouldn't it wouldn't do them any damage back home you know it's amazing when my mother died in 79 and whenever I did something like if I called my head differently or if I wore like a an arm and shirt my mom would go what are you fuckin Rock Hudson and I go what the fuck are you talking about Rock Hudson you know when they asked like the why do you always call me around godson and she goes Chris Rock Hudson a little muddy go and I go what the fuck are you talking about she told me she died in 79 my mom told me in 1978 flat out to my face that fucking he was gay as could be and I'm like you know what I've heard I'm sick and tired of you fucking Cubans because cube is like these tell me when I was a kid that they smacked bruce lee in cuba one time that he went down there talking shit one of my uncle's smack them in the face cubans a lie to you just to fucking fuck with you right so i thought my mother was fucking me she's right Rock Hudson is as gay as a $3.00 bill and I go what the fuck are you talking about me think what I'm talking about right when I was a little girl Rock Hudson would come to Cuba and we would all go to the hotel you Michael Michael Jackson goes to hotel they clap right he shook the kid outside the window he would be out there like waiting to see Rock Hudson but the hotel guy would tell us he was up there in a room with a man and I would call ma are you fucking crazy like I didn't believe it my mother died in 79 85 Rock Hudson comes on says he's gay like Campbell was just a hiding place for people but did your mother know that the Marlon Brando was fucking Richard Pryor no not from this article if we would have scroll down a little bit it says it that they asked his neighbors and the neighbors were like no he was bisexual and then his number one guy that was known every time he came to Cuba was Marlon Brando he was Marlon Brando was walking there with two showgirls and then him and fucking Superman would leave by themselves well Brando loved the music played by gonzo he was really into it well Pryor's wife was saying it back then they were doing so much coke that everybody just fucked everybody that's so crazy he didn't make jaga fuck some by like oh that was one of uh Mick Jagger's wife said she caught David Bowie in bed with Mick Jagger I've done a lot of coke but I've never wanted to fuck you up the ass Joe Rogan's I'm saying like I do a lot of coke I never want to fuck another guy it's in the story Brando who was bisexual took off with Superman ditching the dancers so Superman was bisexual - yeah in fact I heard he had died of gangrene gangrene yeah and here it says he was infected yeah he died with a lover from sex Oh he slept around but gangrene from sex well how hard you got a fuck to get gangrene maybe fuck this chick that got shot in the ass he might have fucked animals together yeah Wow bro Cuba was dirty it was dirty oh let me say something else there's another that whole society that he hasn't touched in on you that I know he knows about and

like he grew up with my father so I told Joey when I first met him and I was sort of almost done with this book I said I said when you read it you're gonna need to sit down because for a guy like him he knew a lot and I knew he would come across names that he knew but there's no way you could have been part of this and known the whole thing right no no right so you you like you knew who he was you knew he's a bad guy he didn't know that he was a professional assassin for omega-7 I knew Todd he killed my mother warned me my mother used to go when he picked you up at school please don't get in the car with him cause he's gonna get shot one day another way in a people new battle and they knew some things about him but they didn't know no one who was part of it they thought they knew the whole story but there's no way you could have I don't know all this you couldn't know yeah it blew my fucking mind I went to a dance with my daughter and I came home and the book was waiting for me you know Amazon drops it on front house and they had ripped it and there was other kids with my wife and I all I did was put it in my office and when I opened it I saw a toffee and mochi and my fucking knee dropped he kept texting me as I was reading at 12 o'clock at night I go you have no one yeah well yeah but I didn't know that this guy used to go away every six months and his wife was tight you know the story I told you about my mom would play cards and then I would put tighty-whities on and dance for the women shots of tequila and make me dance Nina was in that book Nina is in that book my mother died I gave me to my dog I couldn't take that dog so I used to go to Nina's house on 51st Street and cry in the dog house like this is my dog so soon as I saw Tati I knew he was on to something because Tati was my father's friend and he was the type of guy that would come visit me every week just because he was my father's friend and give me 50 bucks and take me to the city get haircuts but his claim to fame was in the seventh grade my mother told him I don't know what I'm gonna do it he's got some fucking girlfriend he won't even talk to me this guy came to my house and gave me a capsule and right in front of me he filled it up with coke and he goes let me tell you something seventh grade seventh grade he was next time this girl comes over here you sprinkle his coke on a pussy and you lick it and I'm like I didn't even like a pussy then I had touched it outside the jeans that coke capsule was in my drawer for like a year like in the back of my nightstand right I didn't you know I wasn't that it wasn't a drug nothing and one day my mom came home with three cocktails and she's like I got fucking news today from Tati then he gave you cocaine when fuck is like what's in my drawer I didn't use it she fucking smacked me she goes don't you ever fucking take drugs and I said she wasn't did it hey you know I'm saying that she went did the blast but that guy when I was in the seventh grade gave me a capsule of coke Wow I said put on a pussy who drive a four-pack crazy like that's how demented he was the text I remember getting from you as you were reading the book I was getting every every every 30 minutes or so I get a text from him be enough names I can't believe you have this name finally the last one was the text said Nene could arrow was an exclamation mark and a commenter said you bad motherfucker he couldn't believe some of the names that were in there and I know that he it was must have been emotional I said this is my mom I was crying because there was two banks when I was growing up there was Brawley and me alito and they were partners with jail Miguelito people used to goof on him he had a pigeon town and they would goof on him in front of my mother and go you know he could be Coco's father so Miguelito always duped me a hundred bucks and harassing him but he had a part of Rican wife his name was Marlena that was fucking hot and I guess the name Marquez under and the farewell and he went in the name Marquez was the barber yeah Nanuk Adair Guerrero yeah and when I was a kid I remember some a lethal shot and make her arrow and the foot he walked right into the behind that Joe and BJ and become the Wild West yeah like Union City had become if I shot Jamie I know the only person who come after me is Joe I'm saying like there's no cops Wow there was no cops well and it's like that today still I don't know this was the 70s and was still corruption oh yeah they robbed from fucking everything they just when I went home last week there was problems at dog burger right when I was home I stayed in Edgewater so I didn't even go up there but when the book came out I got a call from battles longtime lawyer a guy named Jack Blumenfeld wonderful guy interviewed him numerous times for the book new battle as well as anybody defended him in a number of different cases over the years knew a lot about him I sent the book to him he called me and I don't know him that well so he was a little you know stiff at first we he corrected some factual things in the manuscript and then he got real quiet he said you know this was very it was very emotional for me to read this book he said cuz just all kinds of things kept flooding back you would use a name or you describe an incident and all of a sudden it would flood my memory same thing that was happening to you when you read it the little detail would go on my god it was almost like an out-of-body experience that's the power that's the power literature man yeah that's the power of like losing yourself in a book to where it engages your memory in your imagination that you're almost reliving it as you're reading and you talk about 3901 Kennedy Boulevard the home of Charlie oh man yeah project only basketball games I went into those projects I used to go to at 7 in the morning and shoot 300 jump shots because there'd be nobody there so imagine you reading a book and you come across that address and it like remind you of what he's saying it was down the block up the block down the block was a bar named Ernie's in North Bergen for years or you have you ran out of beer 5:00 in the morning you went to her knees what the fuck you want I won't be ready all right what do you want I'm gonna be 8 bags all right you should've said so we got emotional for you could be better Ernie would sell you beers and there were the coldest beer in town that was his reputation when we were in high school five in the morning Ernie open up you fuckin spic fuck you
