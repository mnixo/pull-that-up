the girag an experience I'm not you know I don't spend a lot of time with with other war journalists there there were those who were deeply admire who I see every now and again like Sebastian Junger but I'm not I don't I don't hang out with them day in day out mmm so there's levels to the involvement yeah to whether how deeply you're immersed and it's it's it's completely upside-down in the state because the TV new gen TV news journalists aren't deeply involved and just want to get that quick shot of them looking like there's somewhere middle east Annie right closest to the front line with the flak jacket on their perfectly ironed shirt and they're not they're not sweating or even worse the Brian Williams type situation yeah yeah or on the roof of the 5-star Hotel sometimes you might see people report about what's happening with Isis and they're in Beirut right and I think they're relying on the fact that a lot of people don't understand that's a different country right but you know those guys some of those guys are paid millions and treated very very well the photographers and print journalists who are immersed and there are spending weeks there are sometimes struggling to make a living and aren't well-known and aren't well supported what is it about the talking head in front of the camera that we want so badly I mean I think it's it's it's a way for the news networks to you know claim credibility and then when you see them get deployed they're not focused on getting material from the war in these countries they're focused on that on the two-way right now talking to our guy from wherever right that's more important than actually spending days collecting footage of what's actually going on it seems like you see that rarely if ever these days it's more and more rare it seemed to me that during like Desert Storm in the 90s there was always someone that was over there and it seemed like there was real threat and it was really going on but now everything seems to be done from the desk and you don't really see a lot of I mean am i right about that yeah I mean I think it mostly a lot of the major news network said to their crews you're not allowed to spend the night in Mosul you know you can go there and film a street and interview some refugees you just escaped isis territory but you can't spend days on end there whereas the freelance photographers and some of the writers they were spending days on in there and getting getting the is it because the on-camera people will be targeted I just think the risk is too high . for the entire crew and certainly if you know when the story is really big and you send one of the very well-known correspondents there then yeah they can't be running around you know filming house-to-house fighting so when you're over there and you see these guys show up and you know that they're just gonna be hanging out at the hotel and what does that feelin like yeah I mean I'm pretty disdainful of those yeah ask you have to be yeah yeah well you see these films like whiskey-tango-foxtrot about Afghanistan idea I just don't recognize that that world that you know partying every night at whatever bar a restaurant I just think if you're there you're in you're obviously in the wrong place right right and it's not it's not an adventure you know it's not a fun trip for you of wild times and you know it's it shouldn't be that it should be I mean for me it feels like an endurance test every time you go it should be hard and you should be spending time with the people you're covering and you know sometimes you can you can think you've finished with someone and just go for dinner or tea and just by having normal human conversations you find out so much other stuff that you didn't go there to report that's what you have to be doing and then that takes a week weeks of getting closer to them and gain their trust yeah yeah yeah and just just just you know spending enough time there where you you then end up being in the right place at the right time to show something really happening yeah it was unfortunate that I had to take that from him and I kind of in a sense I felt like I was taken away from what he was doing for them so when I saw her walking backstage I just couldn't control it I just let my I just let go and I just can't help but cry on her shoulders this is a great it's a great video what is her name was woman's an actress as Roma Downey yeah yeah that's right the video is amazing cuz she's hugging you and she's telling you congratulations and she's telling you that they're coming they're gonna be coming for you so train hard yeah and just like her attitude mint its it's beautiful man it's it's um it's amazing her character that she handled that I mean this is her baby her baby just lost and lost every round and it was a you know pretty dominant victory by you and for her to treat you that way afterwards just shows amazing character yeah and it's there this right here you can see it up here look at her she's embraces you open arms it's all good it's all good baby look at that amazing that's an amazing woman right there oh wow that's amazing man yeah and even Tyron the waiter in here that's crazy right it makes me cry cry when I saw it's making me cry now yeah man huh in the way she treated tyrant to the same thing I mean she's just that's and that that's that's kind of that's how my mom is to that so I felt such a connection to that to her you know my mom is the exact same way my mom weren't done the same thing to tyrant and um it just it was powerful man it was moving and because it's and it goes to attest to how the sport has abated sport is as well yeah like it's not all man just a regular fight you guys hate each other and you're fighting no this was a competition yeah you know this was two men that went in there to for a competition and one guy won and you know and you saw the aftermath you see the family receive each other people love that man they love when people put all that bullshit aside I mean you guys had a lot of trash talk at the press conferences and there was a lot of that going on but that sells tickets and it's good for everybody and it's it's natural and normal but after it was over it was nothing but respect can I kind of pause here yeah leptin is produced were yeah leptin is produced yeah let's talk about left in a little bit it's produced in fat cells and it's produced in proportion to the size of fat tissue so the amount of body fat you have the more fat you have the more leptin you have in the circulation and basically what this is it's what's called a negative feedback loop which is a really simple engineering term that works like a thermostat so with your thermostat you if you set your thermostat to 70 if it starts getting a little bit of hotter your AC turns on to bring it back down this starts getting lower AC comes on or the heat comes on to bring it up that's called the negative feedback system and it maintains the stability of the temperature of your house we have many negative feedback loops in the human body to regulate body temperature to regulate blood pressure to regulate all sorts of things one of the negative feedback loops we have regulates body fatness and the hormone so your thermostat measures temperature by using a thermo stat sorry a thermometer your brain measures body fatness using this hormone leptin that's in the circulation and then particularly when your body fat level drops your leptin levels drop and your brain hears that and it kicks in a starvation response basically and this is the main reason why weight loss is so difficult because your brain is like no I don't want to be losing fat and it makes you hungrier it increases your yes is that a certain level of body fat as a sum so here's just when you're losing body fat in general like even if you have a large person that's overweight recked when you're losing body fat in general your body exacerbate your hunger and this is this is the thing that's really important to understand about obesity is that people with obesity have a higher setpoint so it's like turning your thermostat from 70 to 80 and then your thermostats are regulating around 80 people with obesity they're not regulating around 170 anymore they're regulating around 250 and so when you cause a lean person to lose weight you see the same thing is when you cause a person with obesity to lose weight you see this reaction in their brain circuits that regulate body fatness that drives them to increase their cravings and their hunger so metabolic rate drops so it would be an evolutionary mechanism to force you to seek food correct and not just to force you to seek food that is the main thing but it also slows your metabolic rate does everything it can to get more energy in your body and have less leaving and it keeps doing that until the fat comes back can I pause here yeah so when you're eating a sugary diet a high high calorie diet you will produce more fat your body will get fatter right um it depends on how many calories you're okay if you're overeating yeah I'm consuming a lot of sugar a lot of carbohydrates your body will get fatter your body will produce more leptin correct so it comes from the diet yeah indirectly definitely I was pleased and I played nine holes of golf with him was he like and it was well there's still security Secret Service all around him right and so it was a private golf course Larry Ellison that owns Oracle Oh owns this private golf course it has 14 he's a big tennis guy so he puts on the tennis stuff out in Palm Springs and nobody plays this course and he doesn't play golf and it's just as private as is the deal his own course cuz yeah he's got his own courses he played through our group and Shadow Creek and Beverly Hill I mean in in Vegas a really exclusive course impossible to get on and and he was playing by himself and he was gone the tea box and I said it's lonely at the top in Hilaire he goes yeah I went off by himself but he went even there but but Clinton was and he told me a story goes his friend of his is a record producer rap records big didn't tell me who it was and didn't tell me who the artist was either but the artist was all dug down he was in a Ferrari store and and the salesman goes are you thinking about buying this car and the guy goes no I'm gonna buy the car I'm thinking about pussy the Clinton told me a story that had the word pussy in it Clinton told me that that's a great fucking story so so Nietzsche and Schopenhauer talked about the idea that there's the will right so as a human being you're stuck in this fucking I gotta eat I gotta fuck I gotta sleep and I got a breed and I eat and I sleep and I'm fucked so I can breed you know and I can stay alive and then might you know further my gene pool and you're stuck in this kind of like will to live there's there but there is a respite and that rest by this is when you when you see a great work of art or you're doing great works of art somehow when you see something beautiful when you're laughing really hard a great standard when you're seeing I'm an amazing movie like American Beauty the state puts you in is so incredible because it gets you to forget momentarily about your own biology about your own urges your own needs your own wants for whatever reason you you rest in this state of majesty this sort of high relief this your higher self and you go you go man that might be what God's about that might be what it's like to be touching something bigger than myself or bigger than all this other appetite stuff like I it's almost like it's almost like something you you forget that you forget about death and you forget about your fears and everything else you know those feelings of inspiration that can happen when you're listening to great music or it can happen when you're making great music but that is almost the only time you have I guess and of course we can talk about flow and you're climbing a mountain with no ropes or whatever it might be I think that puts you in those states of true focus and true flow and that's what we stay alive for we stay alive for that and when you are not that you know everything else becomes drudgery almost because everything becomes and I would even I would even equate like we stay alive also not just for our accomplishments but like when you're with your friends like we're doing my companion and we're laughing and being silly gazing for no other reason there's a flow to that oh yeah there's there's a you you are you are removed for temporarily from the world from from from the reality of your own limitations and there's something that's so beautiful about that I think needs you talked about the idea that you can you can actually make your life that Dec your life should be a work of art live dangerously and leave a good-looking corpse don't don't don't worry about all the other thing [Applause]
