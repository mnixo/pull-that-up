I'm not supposed to smoke in my building so they don't let you smoke weed yeah what kind of because it's legal oh yeah that makes sense okay we can't do things that are legal any smoke cigarettes in your building right no no no no no oh you have a smoke-free building yeah health conscious mm-hmm well I get that kind of if have you say no cigarettes you kind of have to say no weed - but cigarette smoke stays yeah like that gets in the walls and in the fabrics and all that snug like the weed just kind of for us right but I think other people that don't smoke weed they smell it yeah those people need to get out of California I mean you see you smell it everywhere you go now I'm so numb to it everywhere it makes me laugh when it when I can see a tourist they're just like oh my sis Lonnie yeah it's so funny my wife kind of gets that way and she smokes weed it's funny but like when were the kids if we go somewhere so Oh lovely like she'll smell it like women are so funny like when they have kids they'll suddenly get like real protective of a new one that's where conserve mamabear people yep yep yep you wanna protect that den oh great yeah lovely out in public I was doing an hour ago yeah it was me laughs like what it's in the morning and you like in um and someone's just woken up blood outside a brunch well yoga there's just one dude that I go to yoga with this old fella and he has a van and he parks his van right next to the yoga place and he gets fucking blasted box blasted it's like a Cheech and Chong movie he opens up that band and climbs in the yoga class you could see him just whacked out in class - hotbox yoga you could see him in class just like he's in the middle of doing his guy had the steam room at the gym doing that he was just like someone you know he could be on anything it's demon with the gym as a dangerous area like people are having it and they get weird yeah steam makes you do crazy things I just closed my eyes and just meditate mmm and it's trying to - attention to the sounds going on also like everybody it just like you're just sitting there right so people get anxious to get antsy just sitting there and then you get like those really aggressive breathers who are just like oh you're like a climax what was that that's annoying oh by the way hold on before I get so five years ago speaking of climax five years ago I came and did your podcast

more yeah just a good old fashioned see that fucking video which one of China where they're spraying disinfectant in the streets no they tried to kill the corona virus Jamie it's on my is that bullshit but they do that some of them are real but some of them I think are not accurate videos I don't know I've seen it a couple different spots a tattoo I've seen very various ones some we don't know any better watch the video because it's fucking bonkers man they're they're driving through the streets spraying everything at street light the thing I saw going around before which is you didn't they were pairing with drones they're using drone sex see they do that you a South with mosquitos yes so it's kind of like that fucking terrible for YouTube out what works if you breed that shit in if it kills mosquitoes it'll kill you tear solutely that fucking stuff is off all of our relatives like go play outside we're like is this safe and they're like yeah just off to you you know let me let's watch this real quick Oh fine it's on my Twitter also along with my man Eddie Izzard is running 28 marathons in 28 days in 28 countries could all through the month of February all in drag I have socks on my floor look at this look how crazy this is yeah this is nothing fucking people there sprang shit out of cars there was street spraying buildings it's all disinfectant apparently this coronavirus they say can live outside of a host for three days so if you have like corona virus on your hand you touch a railing that shit will exist outside of your body for three days which is very unusual that's like some parasite shit well it's this is what these doctors have been saying forever the one that died that's one yeah but the doctors that studied at the CDC Duncan and I went to the CDC down and Galveston I think it is and we were talking with these infectious disease experts and we were all conspiracy theory like we're like you know like we were worried about like manmade viruses and this he goes listen you'd have to worry about manmade viruses he goes these motherfuckers are making them they didn't they're mutated he didn't used to turn motherfucker well right well he wanted to are you saying they they make themselves and they happen all the time and we barely can keep up with them and it just takes one big giant one like the Spanish flu this crazy thing in Spanish flu is 1920 yes is 2020 so okay everything every hundred years yeah I don't want to say before that was what like yellow fever or some things probably some shit in the 1820s yeah like down in the South like the Carolinas and find out what was the pandemic in the eat oh here's the drones Jesus army of drones deployed across China dispense disinfectant see here's why I call that bullshit on that how much fucking disinfectant can they carry that little bullshit ass bro then I get a kill you know I mean there's so little that I ain't gonna kill I can go refill I love army of drones there's like three calm down the thing them driving to the streets freaked me out more than anything yeah that's intense it is intense it's just like a follow the other thing to that which was scary I think it was real there was a drone that followed a woman out of her house she didn't have a mask on and it was like you ma'am you're not you don't have a mask please go home go home you don't have and it followed her home in China yeah like that I can't translate so I don't know if what I was saying was there someone just made a video to be scary but the shit really is like a movie it is it's it's totally a movie because everyone's got to be locked down in their houses and say kids are starving to death because they're locked in their houses and their parents are in the hospital they just had like another I think I got a notification last night that said there was like a guy in San Diego that's being treated and I'm like God yeah it's it's just a matter of time just let me do the Rogan podcast before I get coronavirus you're here and Jew late the say he's supposed to wash your hands a lot but that was before they realized that it's transmitted through the air I don't think that happens what's going on this is the lady this drone is speaking to you kichul Matt she has no idea what's going on she's so hot didn't walk without wearing a mask you yes you better be home don't forget to wash your hands she's got blue hair iced yeah I'm fucking around to make a scary video maybe but I also could be real now a drone is what it could be real what a mask hmm the show were melt itself in a few months what a few months is that a haiku what is this stay at home with food and drinks why do you always come outside you can sort this out this is my pee bullshit but it might be real I know I'm not feeling good about it it scares me man it's like these things absolutely can wipe out millions and millions of people before they can get a handle on it I had it I was on a plane a couple weeks ago flying from New Orleans back here and I had this Viking woman behind me just open mouth coughing and I had I was like first of all no yeah second of all I had to turn around and say hey can you please cover your mouth and I had to do that to an adult woman and it made me feel weird some people were just fucking self just yeah on that plane some people just don't care they're just selfish yeah yeah they don't even care that other people feel uncomfortable they just like I have the call yeah and you're gonna all experience it yeah some people if they're sick they want you to be sick they don't they're not happy malicious fuck and malignant assholes mm-hmm I'm worried don't be you know what I've been worried about a lot about lately is glyphosate I've been - wife's a same what is that you can't just glyphosate me what is Roundup it's a it's a chemical that they use for pesticide for agriculture and I was reading this whole thing about glyphosate and how toxic it is and how many people have gotten cancer from glyphosate and how often they use glyphosate on vegetables yeah I'm like motherfucker that's why I have to wash your vegetables yeah it does it's all in there anyways here it is many 85,000 glyphosate cancer lawsuits significantly closer to settlement after federal trial suspended yeah there's a lot of motherfuckers that got cancer from this shit that's the round if that's the yeah the weed exactly thing right hmm yeah kills your weeds I think it kills pesticides it's its weed and what does it say there scroll down scroll back up there know the actual image of god damnit these pop-ups how's it say it says weed and grass killer okay so it is it's not a pesticide it's just it's just for weeds yeah but when I mean I bet it kills pests - how it kills everything but they're they apparently a lot of people that are gardeners and that are working on golf courses golf courses apparently get it a lot because you know they spray that shit everywhere because I want everything to just be grass but does it leave like a brown spot or no I know it's fuck it kills the weeds and doesn't kill the grass yeah that is we want to that the other stories that are going around with EPA reaffirms that glyphosate does not cause cancer don't worry folks just drink it there was a guy there was a guy at a press conference he was saying I could drink this glass of glyphosate and they wouldn't do me any harm and some guy goes drink it and he didn't he didn't drink course always he didn't drink it yeah he's talk talk the talk yeah talk talk is cheap fucking that glyphosate stuff it's like look your Swedes are supposed to be there man they're supposed to grow along with everything else that's how it's supposed to work you can't decide well and what shit are you guys are supposed to pluck those we gonna say just pull them out yeah you fucking lazy thank God but if you have a garden among your weeds but if you have a check antek mono crop agriculture farm 6000 acres of corn or alfalfa or some shit can't really dreyfus a walk you know spray that bitch I don't know man I just whenever something happens like this coronavirus thing I get worried about all kinds of stuff I start worrying about all kinds of weird fucking toxins camels you know that make sense yeah well that's when I always I think about that all the time let you I do well like I grew up I grew up in the south so it's like I remember like crop dusters like flying over and I remember kill mosquitoes right yeah well the mosquitoes and then actual like planes that would come over and just dump everything and then I look up and then I start thinking about chemtrails and then this is just a Tuesday you know but I think about like that that shit like you know when it rains and then that stuff gets into the water supply and then you're just like oh I got a Brita filter but is it really you know this is a another yoga guy that I know that teaches yoga and he didn't know that you're not supposed to swim in the ocean right after the rain what in Los Angeles apparently it's super dangerous to live in that ocean yeah because all the runoff because the way la system is you know the LA River and all that jazz which is sort of a fake River it's not even a river but it's perfect for LA calling the LA River the LA River is perfect when you look at it like oh yeah it's fake it's perfect literally just a concrete stream yeah yeah well it's like a fucking gross drainage that's just enormous well when that bitch goes down into the ocean it carries with it all the garbage all the chemicals oil from the streets my stuff needles yeah and it's all in the water and so when you go surfing right after that you get really fucking sick and he was telling me he got deathly ill because he just didn't know any better he was just out there and he's from Argentina mm-hmm I guess where it's not as much of an issue there and he was in that water he got fucked up he said he was a wreck for like two weeks yeah that'll knock you out I mean if you're oh that's just gross just sewage Stu yeah right just floating around at it it's just weird that they decided to make the LA River like dialect I've never seen anything like that look at the LA River fool that's after a bit was this year January 19 okay look at that motherfucker hmm oh just all condoms and poop I'm listening and fucking gonorrhea that's what they did with the reservoir don't they drank they had to drain it because it was filled with shit filled with shit and bodies and cars and stuff it's like whoa well they say so many people are on antidepressants and SSRIs and all that jazz that the water supply has a certain amount of it in it because people flush and they fly well apparently some of the water that we use is actually recycled they take your piss water and they turn it around did you know that nope but now I do yeah it's everywhere drinking so you basically drinking recycled piss water yeah hmm oh man essentia have you seen that giant tube it's basically an aqueduct but it's like a big pipe it's like hundreds of miles long that's how we get our water here yeah I've actually someone like wants to get someone walked it I think researchers a video I saw but I've seen it in person so see it's it goes through these I think it goes through to own ranch it's an enormous pipe yeah so what have we learned this Valentine's Day trash no it's Friday oh this I think yeah people are just not supposed to live that stacked on top of each other we're supposed to live in small villages in the woods with just enough food I'm down for that I want a tiny home do you want them little mobile yeah little tiny home in the woods with a fire pit out front could you survive in the woods probably not have a lesbian friend yeah her name's Denise lesbian friends are good yeah ones with those Patagonia vests oh yeah every carabiner she she's on survival mode 24/7 she's captain we have earthquake drills every day yeah really not really she stated building she's in the building yeah okay yeah she's my alpha does she keep food oh yeah really can preserve oh yeah storage you know you're going deep when you have that fucking preacher food you know that stuff like that Jim Jim Baker was selling Oh God what did you ever see that it makes sense but it was just was it just like it's almost like spam but can live for its like buckets rule bucket rule but he in Jim Baker's show used it as like the base of us of it like a table like he's like you could use it underneath your table this is how you keep your kitchen table and he's got like these stacks of this stuff and then they were sitting on it like that you could use it as a stool like so like your house is filled with like survivor food yeah so in case the shit goes down it's everywhere in your house you just have to open up one of these buckets you don't see that video Jamie bucket roll there's that smash cut video right who made the smash tiger that's right that's right yeah it's a victor ger smash cuts fucking hilarious because that burger makes a bunch of very funny Internet videos as it is but as you're watching Jim Baker and this is the same Jim Baker from the old days when Jessica Hahn just he had they had a fair at the fair see these are this is all this stuff is the shit he's selling this is stacked look he's gotta roll up the stairs and shit Shumway get a shovel these are foldable shovels you know go in your backpack Jim pick you and where the fucking backpack yeah yeah these guys are like really so he was banging Jessica Hahn and Sam Kinison wound up bangin Jessica Hahn and then handfuls that's what is that is coming out of his mouth bucket oh Jesus Christ Jim literally he looks weird yeah he doesn't look like the same guy that's Tammy phase yeah yeah yeah yeah she's dead now yeah well isn't he - she died from diet coke well I think she had some of that new bulk sampler she died from dico I think he said she drank like a hundred kids a diet coke a day and she got brain cancer southern people love that yeah that's what it looks like much good that will keep you alive just Martindale oh people look at that imagine eating that with and you and your fucking mixing all that together like what's in there diarrhea that's definitely what's in there diarrhea and nacho cheese that's like that's like queso from Texas you know how dare you like real real real cheesy case own hmm no flute like Miss Texas queso yeah I was just there that's good I was just in Houston were so yeah yeah well you went yeah I was there uh two weeks ago I was there two days ago okay yeah is there Saturday night or the UFC Friday in town oh right yeah but that um that kick well that was a good kick which one the the I don't know their names the girl did that round off kick to the other one oh that was a couple months ago oh it was yeah that's Valentina Shevchenko I'm trying yeah she fought this weekend we get to hold a fag in all the comments no it's okay it's the reason I'm here what is that cheese stuff though that cheese that you know that cheese that's it's like watery it's not really cheese where they call it cheese no no no no no no it's like you could squirt it scorches yeah but it's Cheez Whiz is it cheese with the one in the tube yeah yeah it depends on which company black I'm not saying I don't think I'm thinking about that though there's a type of like liquidy cheese that people would put on nachos and stuff like that do you know I'm talking about I don't it's not so cheese I don't fuckin equity cheese but that's what that Jim Baker gruel looks like that he was serving up people but that's a big thing with preachers right they always want to prepare you for the apocalypse with food yeah cuz they're caught yeah well it's like I don't want to be a prepper but I think you probably should have some food at your house ready for a couple of weeks I know she'd be ready for a couple of weeks and they have these things where you fill your bathtub up it's like a bladder that you put in your bathtub and then you fill your bathtub up with water so you always have water because if the shit goes down if it really lasts a very couple of weeks you're gonna need some water I think sense yeah it's really gonna make sense I just have bags of box wine in my fridge that's a little help I'm ready to go listen people used to live off wine yeah yeah they used to call it travel it would prevent travellers disease because they will everything because if you get water from a lake right like that waters got all kinds of garbage in it right like if you hit water from a lake you're drinking a bunch of different bacteria and parasites and different I mean even if it's a Clear Lake you're really not supposed to drink the water unless you're above a certain altitude like I was in Alaska and I was with these guys and we were hunting and they told us we could drink this water because above you know 8,000 feet or whatever beavers don't live that's it you have to worry about you have to worry about beaver slavery they call it beaver fever it's Giardia it's a different beaver fever than guys get at clubs look it's a different beaver fever or Denise yeah or did you get that beaver fever oh it's just a polish upper Patagonia jacket put on the best patchouli little musk you know why is it that lesbians have never been able to form a proper neighborhood but gay guys can do it in almost every town hmm I feel like gay guys push the lesbians out you think the lesbians are smarter because they'll form their own tribe yeah but they never develop like like boys town is legendary right it's like it's it is it's a gay five blocks of gay right I call it home that's your spot yeah but if you think about it there's no lesbian equivalent anywhere on earth that I know of is there like a legitimate lesbian community where it's only lesbians and they get together and do lesbian things and wear cowboy hats yes things yeah they have their own I mean that's the thing I feel like guys are more they want to be in charge more we're lesbians can kind of just form their own little side neighborhoods they don't need the credit you know what I mean but do they know I feel like people would know there's a no like a legit lesbian neighborhood like girls town people would know but would you want to go to girls town oh yeah yeah guys I think that's the problem that's the thing I think guys at a girls town guys go there and they ruin it yeah like omens although I named yet next door and that's fucking hope you would trash oh you wanna fuck away from me exactly you sure you're good come on yeah they get that a lot there's a lot like there's a lot of like little organizations like I have a lesbian friends that do a thing called babes on bikes where they like motorcycles yeah and then they go travel and that's cool yeah and they go hiking and camping and all that stuff would it be fair to compare lesbians to cats and gay folks to dogs gay men - dogs are dogs like no I'm gonna reverse it but gay but dogs like to be in packs I know but dogs are loyal no they're not not sexist well but I don't know how many dogs your fucking hump your leg then I'll hump Jamie that's true yeah we'll just cancel just like they'll just get out of here that's true Terry temperamental very sociopathic but they don't like to live in like a big pack mmm like the lesbians this makes sense it does make sense I think I'm on to something yeah I'm gonna lose sleep right people always say men are dogs but dogs are dogs are loyal they're loyal but men are loyal they're just not that loyal sexually right but they're loyal to each other good friends but my best friends are all men I mean I am girl right female friends but if I need some shit if I need like if I'm calling Bryan Callen I'm calling a male friend yeah you know there's a difference I think I feel like gay guys are probably dogs and lesbians are wolves whoa yeah that's dangerous yeah then wolves are circling do ya you've got your alphas and your betas and they all just know their place wolves eat dogs you know yeah do you think lesbians eat guys totally every day in fact five are being eaten right now as we speak viciously have you ever heard of a lesbian and a gay guy getting together in deciding they're both straight yeah they're in the south it's called conversion therapy does that work no No who's it anymore Timon you like I feel like that was in a documentary somewhere was like pray to get away well you have like a yeah pray the gateway it's like I met my beautiful wife oh right and they're all she's she was lesbian and I was a gay man and like cuts to him tapping his shield under a bathroom stall yeah that's a chit it is weird it's just brainwashing well it's just weird because those guys that do it I read an article about this man who went sort of undercover to one of these prey the gay away camps he was talking about this counselor who was literally sitting behind him like holding him during this ceremony with a boner the guy had pressed up against his but he could feel the guy's boner he's like what in the fucking Sam Hill yeah Sam hell I always want to say that what the Sam it'll shot Elliot it's the new porn parody of tombstone tomb bone that's got sad shit though man yeah just still the thing well would be just for men that aren't gay to understand what it was like imagine if there was like gay conversion therapy where people were saying like you the God wants you to be gay you've got to stop hooking up on all these ladies and we're gonna get together and we're just gonna pray that gay into you we're gonna put on some Moulin Rouge soundtrack we're gonna all dress up like Cher dim the lights lock the doors and we're gonna get this party started yeah yeah that's fucking it's a ruthless thing man it's a weird thing that for whatever reason society has it's taken so long particularly this country for people to accept it that this is still up for debate with some people whether or not gay people should be allowed to be married oh yeah for sure did you see the woman of the the God it went viral it was a lady who was a pro Pete Buddha judge two for president yes and then she was like what he's gay oh well no it's like you see me find that I find that it can we play it or will we get in trouble protocol why would you get in trouble we get pulled off a YouTube there's copyrights on those so that they own the and so they want other people to go to their page to have the clip so we put it on our page think we need to pray the copy right away that's yeah some yeah she was like what yeah what he's gay give me that fucking coat back out of here I had a woman god where was this I was I was doing a gig somewhere out out of town and afterwards we had the meet-and-greet and she came up to and she's like I really thought you were really funny and I was like thinking she's like I didn't care if you were gay I'm like okay I didn't even care still our job is done I still laugh I still laugh and that's always how in bed it's disgusting yeah and you made me laugh through that so I don't talk relation yeah like doesn't define who I am right it shouldn't no it's I mean I you know I just can't believe that it's still such an issue mm-hmm unless you're trying to fuck you what do you care like why do you care yeah the the most interesting thing about Pete Buddha judge is that but it's not that he's gay that's the least interesting thing about him yeah he's a very like basic yes it's very like but it's like that's what the reason why he's the guy is because he checks a lot of these progressive boxes mhm and he's also got a shitload of people donating to him here it is he's married to him what I mean first are you saying he has the same sex partner look at her look she looks like a woodchuck she should be concerned about her diabetes are you kidding me I don't want anybody like that in the White House yeah but also like this is what's this is what breaks my heart is this woman's clearly doing her job and then she has her son with her and she's like no but I'm raising my son to be open-minded because I'm a Christian as well and love is love and that's what we need more of is when people cherry pick the Bible like a Jim Baker who's like you know or even our amazing Christian commander in chief we're saying in the Bible of my woman then it's yeah it's just sad it's just like I in the Bible that says this and it's like well in the Bible that says you can always counter go against what the Bible says from a different verse it's like it doesn't say to eat shrimp or pork or anything like that but you know I'll see half these people at a Chili's buffet you know just go into town yeah eating a lot of shellfish you imagine if you got all the way up to heaven no God was like look I don't care about guys fucking guys all that clams you guys are assholes it says in the fucking Bible don't eat clams why why'd you eat clams did you read what I said it was Mardi Gras I couldn't help myself why are you wearing two different kinds of cloth you don't wear two different kinds of cloth I know that's in the fucking bag that's the gayest thing to like if God if I did my whole job on earth and I got to have it and God was like girl two kinds of cloth I'm like wait what back to hell you go well also the Bible says clearly seen the hand of man I'm sure there was probably some things that people had figured out whether it's from psychedelic experiences or what have you that they had there's some core tenants we should treat each other as if you know these are our brothers and sisters do unto others as you would have them do unto you don't steal don't murder all that stuff we can keep together and live in peace yeah and then people got ahold of it they exactly they're greasy little mitts on it I think the shellfish and the cloven hoof shit like with pork like that that is in this in the Torah or the what a great word cloven hoof yeah will you not some and with the cloven hoof that eats its cud yeah I like pork you're not supposed to eat pork but that's probably because they had trichinosis but this woman sews she's a witch what the fuck happened with Noah how did Noah like what was he doing up there he was doing the work no I mean Fisher yeah they were all doing drugs doing drugs yeah they were all doing drugs I guarantee you yeah I think that's probably the root of most of these religious experiences those guys found mushrooms they were tripping balls they came back with some really loosely put together commandment that they got from God like Moses when he came down from the mountain in Jerusalem The Jerusalem scholars now believe that the burning bush that talked to God or talked to Moses yeah was the acacia tree which is a tree that's rich in DMT so they believe this thing of a burning bush was actually them smoking this plant and having these psychedelic experience and talking to them talking to God word makes sense that's cool what does Jobe in the whale that's always confused to me everyone right yeah 40 or was it 40 days in the belly of a whale maybe job's full shit how about that I would think so maybe job was like you know like a beloved guy and everybody's like I don't want to believe he's lying to me Jonah was Oh Jonah Jonah who's Joe Joe Joe like work get something to do with working oh he's a worker say Joe grew up on the south didn't pay attention about the class I'm sorry and look how I turned out well I lived large family so he had a large family oh great great story and then the woman and then Lot's wife when she turned around and turned into salt sure she fucked up yeah that was her fault well how about I mean listen how about Adam and Eve mm-hmm how where does that one and lilith that dirty bitch wanted to eat that Apple she did and you know she didn't want to listen which they said the Apple was a pomegranate mmm Apple could have been a pomegranate yeah because it's the it's the fruit of life because it has so many antioxidants in it there's another theory that the Apple is actually the term Apple is actually based on the color red and that it actually represented the Amanita muscaria mushroom which was the mushroom that they believe Christianity was based on the first place there's a book called the sacred mushroom in the cross by a guy named John Marco Allegro who was an ordained minister yeah see that that is an original fresco from some France see there's 13th century fresco depicting a Domini in a tree of knowledge so that's mushrooms and that mushroom is a mushroom called the Amanita muscaria the Amanita muscaria is a really cool looking mushroom that you can find I found one in Colorado recently what Colorado yeah you can final growing well are they that are they big like that yeah they're truly well those obviously you're exaggerating those are really tall no it's the Bible nothing's exaggerated stop that's really cool I never thought about that the sacred mushroom in the cross go to the cover of the sacred mushroom in the cross you could see the the image of this mushroom and you realize like oh that thing looks a lot like Santa Claus that's red and white yeah and there's a lot of weird parallels with Santa Claus the mushroom grows under coniferous trees like pine trees there's a micro riser relationship with coniferous trees and it grows like almost instantaneously you know that looks like a pomegranate mmm it does sure looks I mean it looks like an apple - it does yeah so that book is a really weird book it's hard to follow it's really complicated but the book is essentially saying this guy John Marco Allegro he studied the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years and his conclusion after he was one of the people that was on the committee to decide for the Dead Sea Scrolls from aramaic to english and after 14 years he his conclusion was that the entire christian religion was a gigantic misunderstanding and what it were really was about was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals whoa yeah and that huge pagan yeah take it all back to paganism which we're not supposed to celebrate but we are but we are Christmas was a pagan holiday move a bunch of the holidays to coincide with pagan holidays just to get pagan people on board gap you know it was at which blew my mind it came out like ten years ago is that site guys about everything and Jesus and everything you know whoa I had no idea check that out that's yeah have it there's really no it's when you stop and think about how long people have been telling the story of Jesus and how weird it's gotten over the years and how many times has been distorted and twisted and changed and turned turned from ancient Hebrew I mean the original Bible the Old Testament ancient Hebrew and then they converted it to Latin and Greek and then English and then the New Testament and then it's so hard what if and then God's gonna punish you and bring you to hell if you don't follow these words but they're also screwy you're supposed to believe in all this nonsense like people coming back from the dead there's John Mark roll Allegro so the Dead Sea scrolls were found in this it's a crazy story because they were found in Qumran which is in Israel and they found them in these caves and they were in these clay pots and they were made out of animal skins they were written on animal skins and they actually had to do DNA tests on the animal skin so they could line up the pieces with the ones that were from the same animal so they can make this sort of assumption that this all was one piece because a lot of it was all broken up so they had to put it all back together again and try to figure out what it all meant and he came up with this one theory that the word Christ it comes from an ancient Sumerian word which means a mushroom covered in God's semen what yes not semen it's come the rain comes from the rain was come the rain was like God semen and then these mushrooms had come out of the ground right after the rain right because you know you've seen like when it rains the next day these mushrooms are huge yeah they're massive yeah well they eat them they trip balls and they think that it's coming from God and so all the stories in the Bible were essentially about them trying to hide these mushroom rituals in allegories and parables and all these different stories you know that would made sense to them but wouldn't make sense to their conquerors like the Romans whoa bro cuz I mean I feel like if after a big rainstorm because those mushrooms pop out really fast so they probably they don't have TV they don't have Instagram probably like whoa these weren't here like two days ago let's try them out well you ever talk to Duncan Trussell about when he used to live in Asheville no when he still lived at Asheville they'd actually spray things on the manure to keep the mushrooms from growing because so many psilocybin mushrooms grew in the manure out there and they even liked added things that cows diet and they were trying everything to kill these mushrooms because these college kids Duncan dr. Russell and his buddies would go out to the fields and they would be fucking mushrooms everywhere yeah cuz you know Asheville North Carolina is like great environment human yeah moist and everything's green and lush these cows just fucking later it's and these mushrooms would grow out of them and David all these kids would trip ball yeah and Duncan talks with with great fondness of his college days just going out into the fields and finding mushrooms and they would all just trip there fuck I'm just set out in the field and it can do it overnight like it rains and then the next day you go out in the morning and it's like fucking five pounds of mushrooms just floating around oh good times good times that's next that's next for decriminalization mushrooms yeah that's next they're gonna make that happen they're gonna make it happen it's already decriminalized in Colorado my friend shot Evans was here yesterday he was talking about it I think they're gonna pull that off in California as well they have to they just even from micro dosing if we could just get everyone to microdose the world would be so much better I feel like that's the new trend right now I hear that all the time yeah there was just like I just micro does it is my girl I've done a bunch of times someone I know I know somebody who micro doses acid I'm like shit a lot of guys in Silicon Valley is crazy and they think it keeps all their negative chatter at bay I had a buddy of mine who was just here the other day micro doses he says he takes it every three or four days that's his thing no no mustard mushrooms like the little capsules little pills they grind it up the ha they grind up the mushrooms and he'll take one capsule every three or four days and it keeps he said just keeps negativity out of his head keeps him positive keep some healthy yeah that makes sense yeah a lot of fighters are into it now yeah I feel like that's what they did with with weed it's like I just feel like especially now in California just feel like more people are just kind of chill with it yeah I mean I just remember like I can't even go back to like back in the day of like I got a joint let's go smoke in the car on Shh shut up shut up cars driving by look especially if you were traveling yeah yeah Joey Diaz is a famous film of we went to Austin Texas and Joey Diaz used to hide the limit of his balls and he's on the Alex Jones Show talking about a hides weed under his balls and it's there now it's probably stuck there so probably forgot about it but he used to that's what he used to do is take a little baggie put his weed in the baggie zip it up and tuck it under his balls in his underwear god that's crazy no you had to you had to be careful yeah I knew guys that would put it in coffee yeah yeah coffee then now you just have a bag of companies in you're like whatever didn't even know what it is I mean how many people exactly yeah so guys a vape pen oh yeah cool they don't check they don't give a fuck there's looking for bombs of whoo and as it spreads across the country the the legality I think it's legal state legal in what nine states something like that and then medically legal and like 18 or something mmm how many let's find out let's how many states let's do it let's try Siri I think it's uh I'm gonna say nine states legal I'm gonna go 18 states medical okay is that right Jamie let's find out I think look at that whole shit all those green the dark is enabling the dark is legal yeah and the father other ones are what medical yeah so everything's medical well Texas isn't I know I

Wyoming what is that state right next left left Idaho I don't know yeah see that's how they keep people out cuz Colorado man when they made it legal in Colorado fucking everybody move there yeah they did Colorado boomed of course they're real estate jumped tremendously they started making a shitload of money I think Hawaii's got it like weird too this is mixed yeah what does it say okay so it's reduced penalty and then Alaska is like free right yeah legal powerful friends in Alaska yeah that's crazy it is crazy but look that just what we're looking at there Massachusetts legal main legal Vermont Vermont lega what is that Illinois is New Hampshire still illegal what is New Hampshire medicine all I never do dis so I don't really care they're just like Austin you know they're just like we're in Texas but we're cool but New Hampshire's weird because that's supposed to be live free like their bumper stickers or their life alert diehard notice died yeah and Florida is what medical yeah so there's really only a few backwoods states well the Florida bath salts are fine so one two three four five always worried because it's fully legal in DC and that's a not a state or a thing that's the federal government city but it's not legal get that cursor off the state so I can count them one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve twelve states fully legal over legal so what you say nine I said nine twelve that's good that's progressive yeah it's nice it's nice it's an election sure we got I'm sure some people are putting it on the ballot to legalize it maybe well there's a picture of Bert Kreischer taking his shirt off in the green room I know crazy had some cuts I've never heard of such a thing but it was the moment that we became legal in California Bert's trip t-shirt office I've run around on stage we were doing end of the world podcast and in the green room are in the main room in 2016 when when Trump was elected that was a weird night that was a weird night I remember where I was I was at the improv that night yeah because we're supposed to be doing a show and it was like a UH that's right you guys were all on stage at that table right that's what you Sarah Tiana it should have been the Bill burr show yeah Hilbert was on fire he was roasting everybody it was amazing was an IRA member like we were at The Improv watching the election happened and all of a sudden everyone was going red red red and never and someone looked at me I was like are we in trouble oh my god yeah we're totally fucked well people didn't think it was coming they had this idea well people have these ideas of what's good and what's not good what's gonna happen and not kind of which brings me back this mayor Pete guy mm-hmm they they came up with that guy because they said look here he is he's a young handsome guy he's gay he's a mayor he speaks well I think you served in the military yeah so like this will be the guy but he's also backed by all these billionaire's like it's a fucking it's a shell game what do you mean he's got a wine cave leave him alone he's got a wine cave what does that mean well didn't what's it like Elizabeth Warren said something like he had this fundraiser at a wine cave like yeah I was like all these like rich billionaires it was like a cave what is it called a wine cellar but it happened to be a cave somewhere out here in California just trying really hard to keep it from being Bernie really hard don't want Bernie Sanders and get if he gets in there apparently you know he was an independent for so long and he doesn't want to play ball and he doesn't accept any money doesn't cept accept any money he's just been cool grandpa yeah I think he's I mean shit I I love Bernie you know why cuz he like you could say a happy Martin Luther King Day that's but then you look at an old picture of him and he's marching next to Martin Luther King for civil rights yeah that's amazing you can't be like no like where were you right you know it's like I just I don't know I I have hope I hope for somebody just to I have hope for him socially yeah I like I like what he stands for socially but then you look at I don't know if it's feasible because I don't understand economics like when when people start talking about he when he was on here he was describing that if they just took a very small amount of money from every transaction that they do like less than one cent from every transaction that Wall Street does that it would add up to more than enough money to pay for health care and a lot of other things cool who's explaining it all and he was explaining it like very calmly and it didn't seem like he was bullshitting I was out I don't think he is a bullshitter I don't think he's been in the game for years he knows how it works he's on a bullshit he knows how these people with money work you know yeah it's something and it's just so it's such a weird upheaval politically like things don't make 100% sense anymore yeah I have no I actually had a friend of mine asked basis you know cuz we got our our voter registration because we vote March 3rd here so they're like who do you are you gonna pick him like I don't know I mean we're gonna go blue anyways but it's just like I honestly don't know it looks like Bernie Sanders gonna be the nominee first he's winning in New Hampshire it looks like you there are they saying he won in Iowa no I think Pete did he pull shit he beat him by six thousand votes it's such a it's so book we beat him in a dance-off so oh did he get down I would love to see Pete just more coin flips oh oh that's right how about that fake coin flip they robbed that coin whoever that is that did that coin flip put that kid in a jail cell what son of a bitch did you see that coin no I want to see the coin for the coin flip Solaris was in Iowa yeah hilariously rigged watch the coin flip hold on do it from the beginning watch this watch how bad this coin flip is go go fullscreen go fullscreen please and do it from the beginning watch this flips it catches it look so we can see and then Wow hey fuck you and no one said anything oh they're all happy yeah it's mayor Pete look yay that's what they wanted they wanted to be mayor Pete so this dude rigged this coin flip in front of the whole world watch this pulls it looks at it okay how shall I flip it I'll do it like that horse shit that's not how you do a coin flip god damn Oh at all I learned a coin flip imagine if you were betting $100 with that guy so I'll bet your hundred bucks okay I'll flip a coin oh I win I mean you win you fuck you rigged it look at that hey what what what is his jacket what is the patch I'm a cunt mmm poor thieving cunt to cut for so that's really bad wind flips I love that woman who's like every mom in Iowa like I'm proud of my son how's that old guy watching right next to move hey you fuck that's not how you flip a coin what country you're from kind of nonsense is that that's why anymore if it's just people calling out bullshit yeah is that from is that you do it in Greenland it's not are you doing in America you don't get to look at the coin then flip it over to the other side you asshole look at it he looked at it and it turned it like manipulated it with his hands so like do it again just do it again yeah well so you do it flip that bitch let it land on the ground yeah let it land on the fuck everybody back up so they doing football yeah and I know that yes I mean flip that bitch yeah but yet this is literally could it could change politics like one way or the other if Bernie gets it or if mayor Pete gets it the delegates it all add up to one guy or I mean go down to the wire I mean that's bullshit creep the whole thing's bullshit bullshit what does this did they went off on this of course they did but this is what they did to Bernie Sanders in 2016 they rigged the DNC rigged my memories then they don't want him and they're doing it now because he's cuz you can't he won't work with them it's not corrupt yeah they want someone who takes that money you don't want tulsi and they don't want Bernie they push them out yeah right they effectively eliminated them as threats slow but they can't Bernie's got too much grassroots behind them but who do you think if say if he gets the the nominee nomination who do you think he'll pick his vice if he picks Tulsi he'll be smart two of them together would be a dynamo with a dynamic team if he picked AOC no she's too young she's only 28 can't be President she could be vice no I don't think so I don't think it's 336 to be President he gets shot in the head then what happens oh god sorry the but I mean if he caused Wall Street billions of dollars and in losses it could be real ugly for him I don't think they're gonna shoot him but they definitely poison you have to be 35 yeah she's too young she's 28 yeah well that's why she says things that don't totally make sense sometimes well we all do but one of the things she said it's impossible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps in this country by the shoelaces yeah yeah I saw that but here's why that's not correct she used to be a waitress now she's a congresswoman she's literally living proof that you can you can pull yourself up from the she just works hard she worked hard I understand what she's saying she's talking about working families that are really poor and then have multiple jobs and that are struggling and they're they're never gonna be rich they're never gonna be wealthy then everyone be middle class she's right in that regard that's there's a lot of people that because of their circumstances because their responsibilities they can't take any chances they can't do the things that she did she's young and single she's right in that way but I don't yet see I have a twisted relationship with this whole idea of democratic socialism I'm a hundred percent in favor like me personally I love paying more taxes if I really felt it was going to make an impact for the better of humanity if it was going to improve schools for kids that live in bad neighborhoods if it was going to be developed community centers in bad neighborhoods it was gonna you know provide better health care for people I'm all in for that I just don't trust the government meaning I don't trust the kind of people that you would give that money to and then they would allocate it however they were the way they'd like to do I just don't know if they're efficient I don't know if they're reasonable I just most people that work in government like I don't know if they have the capability of change on a large scale or if they're already so compromised in so many different ways that it would just be throwing money away right right did you see the video with um I don't know what it came out it's Adam Carolla sat down with Tucker Carlson did you see that what did they talk about they talked about like California they talked about the homeless epidemic that's here in California and how I'm gonna train quota right how he says the government just kind of looks at blind eye because we are a city in a state that lives on permits and parking and licenses and you know we just want that money you know so it's like if he says something you know for Memorial Forest Lawn Memorial mm-hmm like how you look across the way and there's all these you know immigrants and whatnot like selling flowers you know but like a woman driving without a license but she'll get pulled over and charged but all the sudden it was kind of interesting and I hate saying I hate being like Oh Tucker Carlson but it was just it was actually a really interesting interview that's probably a good point yeah California would care about the homeless get money we can get money from them Sean all the way over here - I was just looking at all these tents and it's just so fucking sad it's so sad it's really sad and it keeps growing it keeps going I live in West Hollywood and I remember like a couple of years ago cuz you know it went from downtown and then downtown pushes them all out so they keep going west keep going west so I'm go to the beach so I'm go to Santa Monica but now it's like I live in an area that you know 6-7 years ago it was it was fine but now it's like even on the way to go get coffee this morning I walk everywhere I go it's like I saw like three three homeless people just outside just screaming at nothing you know they're in tattered clothes and they're dirty and they're you know I went I used to work with a girl years ago at a restaurant when I waited tables and she's now homeless and she's like out of her mind and I feel bad we should always never mind no no she hurt you know her name was Lotus you know she did yoga and now what happened I don't know I don't know try to talk - I did when it was like I got to watch the progression of the critical illness yes so I would see her every now and then I was like hey what's going on cuz like back when the recession happened you know we were rating table so we bounced from job to job because one day we'd go to work and there'd be chains on the door because they couldn't pay us so we had this little kind of group that we would go apply together at different jobs and then I started seeing her out on the street and just walking around I was like hey what's going on I hope you hope you're doing well instead of a nun she just kind of never let me know how she was really doing and then like a couple of years would go by and I'd see her and I'm like she looks a little out of it and I would say hi to her and she wouldn't respond and then now it's full-on like teeth are missing and running down the street crying and it just breaks my heart cause it's like I don't know what to do and I don't know if she would be willing or how tight were you with her you the other phone number no no I don't I mean I don't know she has a phone I can't write but did you at one point in time think so yeah yeah and it's like it's just that that like inner guilt and you're just like God how did it get so bad should an apartment you know I think her parents passed away and that might have like set her you know it's spiraling but yeah I remember just like doing a spot at the Laugh Factory one night and walking outside and you know how everyone they just keep everyone outside like you do it and she just like barreled through everybody just screaming nonsense and like she had like teeth missing and it's just sad it's just really really sad and then I'm at the gym working out I'll see her like down there you know with her garbage and everything and yeah she doesn't it's just sad it's a lost cause when you knew her she didn't see much any mental health issues no really no I mean she would talk she would do yoga I mean I remember her she's always with Lotus well her name was lotus harmony which I don't know that's a real name but at the time that's how I knew her and she was always just this sweet lady you know just beautiful skin beautiful smile always in a good mood when she got mad you were like oh man Lotus has pissed you know because she was always so friendly and yeah and then now you're just like damn and I you know I just want I don't know what to do I would love to help her because it just breaks my heart homeless people break my heart but female homelessness really really is sad for me yeah because we're sexist well it's it's I feel the same way you know it's just like someone's daughter someone's wife someone's just out there you know vulnerable to the elements and predators and it's just you know it breaks my heart no it's awful but I think most of what you're seeing with homeless people is people that are severely mentally ill so you gotta wonder like what cause maybe she was on medication and her yeah her you know or insurance ran out yeah she couldn't full-on Joker yeah yeah yeah that's real it is real fucking real there's a lot of people out there with giant mental health issues yeah I mean I mean I I I know I know several people who you know they would have anxiety a guy that I use today is like you know we dated for a long last time it's like if he didn't have his his anti-anxiety yeah like and he got off that I mean he would full-on have a panic attack and that would get nerdy and I had to witness that which was insane yeah people that lose it because of their off their medication yeah that's a sad situation because you're like you're always gonna be tethered to this thing the good works and use it twice today did it yeah you said it earlier before we started the tether but use it all today yeah I just hope it works Heather Tuesday hashtag Heather Tuesday it's you know like what happens to them if the fucking corona virus hits and they get right doors for six months and you just become a agoraphobic and lose your shit well we were talking about this the other day that most of what this is all happened from the Reagan administration during the Reagan administration they changed the standards of what it means to be mentally ill and they just release people from asylums because they didn't want to pay for it all mm-hmm and you know that look if la is la is a city of 20 plus million people which is as many people in LA as I think is in all of Australia so think about that think about the amount of money and that they can't make asylums here think about how I abandoned buildings there are sure how much money how much money would it cost is there's currently somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy thousand homeless people yeah they said there was some statistic that said there's more empty apartments in this town than homeless people the thing is though that those folks don't just need a place because they'll fuck that place rehabilitate punch holes in the wall shit in there and stops Meerut yeah they're crazy they what they need is help and they need medication and they need counseling and they need I mean some people I don't I mean I'm not a mental health expert I don't some of them you might not be able to do anything to some some was so gone right now and also they get so filled with despair I knew a bunch of guys that were homeless back from my pool hall days there was a bunch of guys that would hang around the pool hall they would even sleep on the floor and you know I knew guys who try to sleep in people's couches they'd sleep at the bus stops and then they'd come to the pool hall and try to hustle up enough money to get some drugs yeah it was they were stuck in this place where they could never get past where they were they were just in a rut and they can never get out of it it was just it's heartbreaking yeah despair so much despair because you're just like what happened the for instance the other day I'm walking down Santa Monica Boulevard over by Barney's Beanery and I just hear up and I look over and this kid's like had to be 20 to 23 years old and I was like what happened where are your parents one too many auditions blew a few yeah just snapped if I hear know one more time I'll show you Hollywood Reporter motherfuckers guys there are people though that you meet in this town where you meet them early in their journey hmm and they still have hope like it's not worked out yet but it's gonna I'm gonna make it and then you run in comics yeah so I mean that's the thing I think it's so relatable in our field as well because you know those people yeah we do know that I've all I want to say I almost was one of those people where are you oh yeah when what time I mean give me a time where was like 2002 and then 2005 and the villain shootout yeah I mean there was I didn't meet you until when 2007 and I want to say yeah I think I met you at the ice house when we were podcasting out there yeah and then and then when you came back to the store that was like a 14 yeah 14 yeah that's when I saw you again and even then it was like you know I make it work and I remember you looked at me you go Jew so we're just gang I've ever I was like fuck yeah why did I say that I don't know they're probably all really high yeah probably so Oh didn't know what I was saying when I was saying rap but I mean I feel like that's you know you get through that struggle and you get through the gears of being hungry and the years of like can I pay my rent this you do whatever you can to just scrounge everything up and and do it so you had those moments where you like this might not work out I might go crazy hmm or what's my other option move home or suicide damn yeah I mean this town's hard it's very hard well it's also you see so many people that are doing well right like it seems so far out of reach like when you're broke and you see some guy driving by and a Mercedes convertible you're like you know you see these people go into those big high-rises off of La Cienega you know dorm in there and everything but nobody lives there no one must know no one can afford that shit I mean there's maybe like what I've heard is that the they build those and then the Saudis want their kids to come to school here and get an American education so they just buy them for them but nobody have you done any research on this or is this just I've overheard some things well where the real money is is that Wilshire stretch oh yeah yeah that is and that's always been there yeah yeah there's a the weekend just bought some fucking redonkulous yeah penthouse up there that makes sounds yeah you get some crazy ass view but there isn't it weird that that one strip is where all the luxury apartments are well sure yeah yeah that one does this way oh yeah yeah like one area around like the Santa Monica area yeah where the fire happened right right that was yeah the Palisades right no that was Wilshire and Brentwood yeah it had a fire in the Palisades Westwood Westwood there was a fire the Palisades there was a fire but this fucking desires every Icefall everything's catch on fire any day now so what turned it around for you what what made it feel like it's gonna be okay do you remember you know what I'm gonna say something and it's gonna come across really cheesy and but it's real I just believed in myself cheesy that's I had to be like you know what I know I've been doing this for so long I know who I am I know what I've got well ever since I've seen you you've been a killer thanks like you're really funny Thank You Man like I've seen some sets from you in the main room like this motherfuckers you're free you know you're up there you're free yeah you're like you're you're loose and unrestrained you know you're fucking funny thank but I didn't see you when you weren't so like when I saw you you were doing well right like from the moment I saw you Norsemen and a lot of it I think was pressure from Mitzi because I skipped all that I skipped the open mikes I skipped all of that I just remember being at my lowest of lows and being like what do I have to lose and I remember being a kid and being like you should do stand-up cuz I idolized you know Joan Rivers and Robin Williams and I remember being like fuck it let's try it out and I remember getting holy when you constant doing stand-up first time it was 2008 yeah that was your first time first time yeah so he thought about it for a long time I did it for a long time and then so from 2008 to 2009 or October 2008 to June 2009 that's when I had an open mic at the store and I just remember Michael Jackson just died and I just remember saying this energy was crazy that night and there was an open mic there was like 16 comics in the main room and I was like 14 and I was like no and then they were like Justin's going third so we didn't start doing the podcast of the Ice House until 2009 yeah it was right after I got passed no I don't think we started at the nice house until 2011 now that I'm thinking about I think we mostly did it at my house yeah first year right - it was mm yeah 2011 that makes that that's probably when I met you so you but you were already rolling well no I have no idea on stage you were doing well I was doing well but I didn't know who I was hmm I knew how to make people laugh but I didn't know like what I didn't know the process and so mitzi was the one who like passed around the last guy she passed at the store and so I just remember being like oh did she say to you she didn't say anything she just pointed she looked at Tommy and said make him a regular and he was like like development spots and she's like no he's ready and then I remember being taken away and they were like you've just been passed by Mitzy shortly it was like a weird like Ren Faire wizard thing what has happened to you never happens and then I just remember being like oh shit like I did my research about the place and I just remember being like hot damn and I'm looking at her right now yeah and just that feeling of like I've got to make this happen I've got to make sure cuz she'd never I don't even know when the last time she came to the store was but you know everyone she was ill yeah and I just wanted to be like god I hope this wasn't like just her having dementia and being like oh she's insane she picked that guy dude when she passed me I didn't sleep that night really no I was lying in bed I remember thinking I can't believe like I'm a paid regular at the store I was already on TV yeah I was on a TV show yeah that didn't mean shit to me yeah what meant something to me was like I was all I was a real comic now it's a stamp of approval the guy had already been paid you know I'm starting to cry Oh Joe get in touch with the emotions it's normal I um I had already been doing stand-up like for money you know I've done a lot of headline of gigs I you know I travel I did some road gigs and I did a lot of stuff around New York before I came to LA you know and then I was out here in 94 and she made me first sure maybe a non-paid regular and I would go I'd go on last every night and I was here every next I didn't have any friends I was staying at the Oakwood Garden Apartments those pre furnished apartments and I was on this television show that was terrible and I was just going to the store every night I would work all day during the thing I didn't have any friends and then I would go to the comedy store and that's that's where I feel like tried to find a home a family yeah yeah so I got these late-night sets it was like you know it was always like five people in the audience takes people in the audience and then one night she passed me she passed me I've told the story before but there was a guy named de Todd and the Todd had he's eventually he developed like some pretty severe brain issue like and he went insane and it was really sad because back then I had seen him before I ever came out here on MTV on the half hour comedy hour uh-huh and he sat down next to Mitzi while I was onstage and laughed his ass off just ha har Manor in the Oh are in the or and then I came out stage and she just goes okay you're past that was it that was it yeah that was my second audition for the first one she made me a non-paid regular and I did that for months and then I became a paid regular but did Todd pulled me aside and he said he goes I sat there and he was really funny he was what i sat there and i laughed really fucking hard and I told Mitzi you're really funny and he goes and you're gonna do that for other people someday yeah it's a cool feeling it's a cool feeling too I actually had the moment of seeing her I think it was at the the it was a reunion of what was the 40th reunion something a couple years ago and they had me on like the class of 2000 was like Natasha and mmm some other people were on the lineup maybe even Duncan I don't know and she was sitting in the back they brought her in and in her wheelchair and I was like I have to say hi to her you know I'd never I didn't get to say hi to her I didn't get to meet her the last time she just pointed and took off and I kind of like I went up to her and I've looked in her eyes and I shook her hand and I said hi I'm Justin it's it's a honor to meet you and I just want to say thank you because you changed my life and she just stared at me and I was like she doesn't even know and then all of a sudden she just squeezed my hand and that was it oh that's all I needed so that that to me was like oh she's there she gets it yeah you know she'd had those moments that she'd be in and out mm-hmm but I mean that's everything that I've done that's led up to where I'm at now has been for her too because I haven't had other than my other than my mom and my friends back home I've never had somebody really believe in me like that you know what I mean right it's very special it's very special and just yeah to be a part of a family her you know and that's what it was I mean and that's what helped me getting out of that like I'm not good enough and I'm moving home it's like oh wow I actually have a home now and every time I go there now I just feel so welcome and you know it's it's it's nice it's a fraternity it's a sorority it's a university you know Dean yeah it really is it's hard to describe for people that don't know mm-hmm you know like I was talking to Bill Maher and he was telling me he doesn't go to clubs mm-hmm I'm not going the fucking clubs I'm like why would you go to club you don't like going to clubs it's like I graduated from that I'm a gun with that much graduate I'm like dude I'm never leaving congratulate at least you have an alma mater you know go back well it's not even that it's just like why that's that's the gym yeah it is the gym yeah I mean it's totally that you're not done learning never done stand-up is never over mm-hmm and less journey and especially if you do new specials right cuz you abandon your material then you're starting from scratch every few years you're you're never done like you have to be around I don't think there's any other way I've been I've done it different ways you know there was a time where I was gone from the store where wasn't I wasn't doing my best work and I wasn't doing way more gigs for the UFC and I wasn't working in the clubs as much and my stand-up just wasn't as sharp it just wasn't as good there's no way around it it's like you have to do the work there's no other way and it's also there's something about that environment that place it's so nurturing it is you know it's it's crazy because it's like I'm now on the road and it's a it's my first time actually like performing in theaters which is crazy but you know I feel like the main room in the o.r and all that has been that Jim has like you said yeah where you're just like okay I'm ready to do this I remember doing the Grandal pree last year in Nashville like where I grew in as a kid from the Solomon Theatre the Ryman yeah and I like they just were like alright get out there and I went out there my mom's in the crowd like I was just it was so over I didn't even think about it until afterwards and I just remember walking out there just be like holy shit Grand Ole Opry and it was just man I just let's go yeah like this is what you were this is what you're made for let's go I try to talk to people about what it's like to hang out at the store mm-hmm like people that have never been like why are you there so often like man just come with me one day mm-hmm it's come with me one day when I walked through the building yeah it's it's pretty we're so lucky its magical is really what it is and you know it's it's a place where you know there's egos and there's you know rivalries I guess and it's a few that I've heard of yeah I don't then I try not a couple of gals that don't like house a couple of gals don't like each other that's all I know about I know about a couple gals yeah I don't know about any dudes you know a dude rivalries yeah do you do i yeah you don't have anybody anybody right do you you might we have to discuss it yeah I don't have rivalries I just here's my thing couple people are annoying couple people are annoying and a couple a couple people need to check themselves because there's a lot of like I just said ego and bullshit and I just don't have time for that right Yeah right but you know for the most part it's just all hugs right yeah yeah yeah yeah I will say that like if you see somebody can just catch up you haven't see them in months you just hug them yeah and you just pick up right where you left it so it's like an empowering environment like it nurtures you like you get there you feel great mm-hmm you know that's why people come there even if they don't spot like there's a lot of comics there on the road they don't even want to do a spot but they want to come to that back bar and hang out like I was just in town I wanted to hang out Ron White does that shit all the time oh yeah runways always yeah well here's a house here's a house in Beverly Hills so he just gets in his cars it fuck it up come on we'll hang out yeah that backwords great back bar changed everything yeah you know it gave us a place mm-hmm it's gets infiltrated some days but some days it's all it's now being infiltrated where me we need to stop the infiltration because all sudden they'll be there asking questions like hey this is not what this is for yeah it's not here for you to grill me on how do you get started and how do you do this and how do you do hey hey hey I'm here with the comedian's yeah just to hang out with my friends I'm not oh I did it I did a spot up in the belly room oh did you really get out of here did you where's your name on the wall get out of here well that's the thing right anybody you up in the belly room if it's one of those weirdo shows weirdos hey man that's how people get started I started a show there that got picked up it's coming out next month what is it in March yeah it's the show that we got already laughing cuz we started it two years ago in the belly room what is it it's called what was called stand-up to the streets and then he end up to the street yeah it was a dance battle you know yeah and so we started at two years ago my friend Justine Moreno and the first day we were supposed to do it you actually bumped us out I don't know you're just like I'm doing tonight we're like ah damn it Joe wins again nobody told me no no of course not but then comedy sir must have just offered it to me I think they did but then we did it like monthly we go every month we went in there and did it sold out every night and then this network was like hey let's put this on TV and me out in March what's it on it'll be on the E Network I was hoping you didn't say Bravo well same thing [Laughter] isn't that with Keeping Up with the Kardashians your lead-in oh no I don't mind life is in the gym the other day watching that no walked and I go why yeah you're smart yeah you're interesting what are you doing mm-hmm she likes being distracted by nonsense well that's it that'll do it for you if you fuckin know how to do it - it's like a hypnosis show they have these smash cuts they go quickly from one person to the next and they this is just enough drama like how are they gonna resolve this but it's also no mind hypnosis because you're just watching they're like the other day had a salad and it was really good and like why do I care but tell me more answering arthritis cuz my wrist hurts we want to have a Candyland themed party but with no candy well I want I want to take them and swap them on naked and afraid absolutely take them and just drop them off in the jungle see how they survive naked and afraid ah that's it you know I mean have them do something really difficult like retire just fucking anything hard their life is I mean it's really interesting because I made sort of a I don't know what she was saying not an oath but uh I decided to stop making fun of Kim Kardashian I started letting people out of prison yes I'm like that's powerful she's real like that she's really doing something like genuinely good so I'm gonna stop mocking her really you have to but it's like you know she wants to be a lawyer there's report well yeah she's in law school is she really yeah she's going to law school yes does she go there or she do it at home did she ever assistant do it and tell her what the answers are gets the cliffnotes yeah yeah she probably was all the Kardashian he got the OJ off yeah or helped as part of the dream team yeah that is apparently the one that him bag of bloody clothes you heard it first it's what I heard oh man I don't know if that's true but I don't you know and you got a I don't know I can't knock I can't I know she's doing good I talk shit about him like it sucks cuz I have like videos up from like years ago and then I went to the of me just shitting on them and then and then I went to the People's Choice Awards and I had my friend Trevor rains like do this like he designed this like amazing country-western tuxedo but it was all their faces crying it was so awesome check out my Instagram it's so good it was all and I sat and this waiter came over to me he goes um you know they're sitting right next to you right I was like shit I was freaking out and so then they all come over and they're sitting right there and I'm like oh like my body weight your oh look at your jacket Kim looks up at me and she just goes oh my god that's amazing and I'm like oh and then she's like mom look and then Chris is trying to turn around and she can't and then and then Khloe's there and then or make Cortney loved it and then they start taking pictures of me on their Instagram stories that I'm like oh my god and then I got up to go say hello yeah it was it isn't that dope that's when I worked at E well they're not all crying they just but they all walk II there's crying it's it was awesome that's a great pic and then I got up to go say hi to them and that's when I security guard almost like body slammed me really hit the one at the bottom you'll get a full one there's a security guard they have overzealous security guards oh yeah but after she got kidnapped and basically I'm like just what the hell are you doing you can just you're six foot four you can just walk over and like a normal person sit down you fucking common or know your place well not only that you have pictures of them all over your jacket a security guard might think you're fucking inside by the way you look insane look at that face what are you talking about that's just a strong jawline look what's going on here look at you that was yeah you look a crazy person you definitely you look good though thank you it's not bad yeah represent for a ridiculous jacket that wanted it if we look off it was stupid I wanted it to be stupid and fun and campy and so what were you doing there Willy therefore I was there at the People's Choice Awards because I used to host a show on E called what the fashion what the fashion yeah oh it was like that it was like the millennial version of fashion police what is it like working at email well I don't work there anymore well what would you know was wasn't that long ago it seems like an incredibly frivolous pursuit well I didn't really I didn't really get I worked there for two years so I built this show up from the ground up called what the fashion and then oh shit we're doing an exclusive aren't we oh yeah yeah it was for snapchat discover and it was awesome it was a great platform it started on snapchat mm-hmm yeah those guys one of those guys who knew and then you know I used to write for Joan on fashion police a couple times you have a youtube channel no you should do is still a thing - I'm starting a podcast oh you are yeah we definitely should have one of those I'm gonna do it yeah but why don't you have a youtube channel I don't know like it's a great way to open up content yeah I'll take the note and do it well I'm going to but - you'd be trying well what the fashion has a YouTube channel so it's all in there I know another in December but I left just because I didn't get to really do all the fun stuff they just come on stuff well you know like red carpet and like go to the events and stuff you have a popular YouTube channel you can do that and bonus no boss yeah no boss that's what I had to learn I had to learn to be my own boss at the end of the year yes that's right here you're on a show with no boss wait you don't have a boss no boss Wow yeah that's bitch-ass bitch I know so that's what I'm learning this year is to be my own boss yes you can do it 100% I just try to encourage as many comedians as possible to do it it's like you can put up content of your own you can do anything on your own I mean so many people like Tim Dylan perfect example is that him in drag it's him as Megan McCain oh I got blocked by her you did on Twitter yeah Tim doing of course he did you get black fire I just said something on Twitter it was just kind of like I don't remember but I I told her to fucking calm down and now she's like she's my father my father my father my father and now she's like I love gay people and I'm like okay bitch um but yeah she but if that's a good stamp of approval to getting past my midsi getting blocked by Meghan McCain well she blocked him Dylan and he was who's very excited about its kind of an epic thing I got blocked by a Chloe grace Moretz and who's that she's an actress why'd she block you cuz I yelled at her in a movie theater whoa she was on her phone really yeah and I was watching the purge so I was like in the moment she was talking on the phone and a fucking movie no she what she was on it she was like checking Instagram full brightness just no yeah and she was sitting in the front and I oh I was living talked about this several times and I'm still fucking try how did she know that it was you she didn't know it was me because it was dark and I went over and screamed at her and told her could offer fucking phone then I turned around the audience started clapping because everyone was pissed off so I was a movie hero and then as I went out someone was like that's the girl you were yelling at and paparazzi were all around her and I was like oh I'm taking this stunt winner I'm gonna tweet and I started tweeting at her saying hey bitch get off your phone in the movie theater especially if you're an actress and we're paying money to see you doing movies you know and then she blocked me so then I wasn't done yet I'd sweeted uh her boyfriend at the Times mom who happens to be a Victoria Beckham posh spice and was like hey your son's dating an asshole you know who didn't block me Victoria Beckham probably didn't like ya but she didn't fucking her son she's probably angry that dirty bitch got her bad breath over my son's dick God wait I just got a notification she just blocked you on Twitter you ain't good I don't check oh my god blocked me all day on Twitter I won't never notice who's the most famous person who's ever blocked to you I don't have no idea you don't know you're there I stopped reading Twitter mentions and all that stuff a long time ago I need to get better at that I don't read shit I'm gonna do it though I'm gonna read these comments why because it kind of gets me hard I just think I think the whole premise of comments is fascinating to me how someone takes time out of their day to just like you know it just it just blows my mind you know and it's funny because sometimes they're very supportive like once once I left the show you know people are coming and and tagging me and stuff and be like we want Justin backwards just at the shows not the same and I'm just kind of like well it ran its course you know I did my thing and I'm moving on right but it just it's just so funny how some people are just like you know it did what's it called lights out with David Spade the other day and it was like get this faggot off how rude I know it's just but it makes me laugh because I'm like well who's on the show me not you so hmm who's the faggot now mmm I don't think that changes I don't think that change of the people say things all day long doesn't change who you are I don't think it changes I think what the real problem is that people have access to your emotions if it doesn't fuck with you right then I don't you know if you're them one of those people but for most people who fucks with them like Bert Kreischer said it best he goes I was looking at Twitter the other day and he goes and then I was thinking why am i risking the fact that something might fuck with my head or hurt my feeling right then I get off of it that's what he said I was like that's a good point yeah that's kind of what what it is I live in toxic times you know it's not a good way to talk okay because if someone's in front of you you would rarely be that mean it would it would it would take a lot for someone to be that mean in front of you but on Twitter there's no real connection plus they don't like the fact that you are the guy who's on TV and they're not that's a big thing right fuck camp why would you why are you on there not me and people have this weird idea about people who are doing well that if they're doing well you're allowed to shit on them you know like I fucking saw something where someone was talking about Kobe Bryant's wife and they said with all her money she'll be fine oh my god imagine thinking like that like your emotions are attached to the fact that you have money so no you're fine you're fine you have money you fucking daughter and your husband died in a fiery helicopter crowd and these people this one person was like with all her money she's fine just some shallow broker doesn't have emotions move on I mean she's got three other daughters it's also this thing where they feel like they're allowed to do that because you are really successful right you know cuz and then with you it's like you're on TV they're not so they're allowed to just shit all over you yeah and there's a way that they can do it through Instagram comments or Twitter comments hiding yeah or an anonymous what's it called the little the direct message no that when they when when there's not a picture when it's just a the egg shell or whatever they can go and you can create multiple accounts yeah it's just some people just have too much time on their damn hands yeah it's just it's it's sad and that's just that yeah that's fucked up when people just think well there's so many voices they're not people - yeah well they just feel like it's a free shot mm-hmm look I would have felt the same way if I was 15 if you gave me a fucking Twitter account when I was 15 and I was frustrated at the world I would have said the meanest shit to everyone and anyone I could have gotten a whole yeah a hundred percent I would say the meanest shit you know I feel terrible for kids today I do say that their growth in their development is going to you know it's gonna be permanent record yeah there's a there is a really good ad for god what was it for it was a cell phone at it it talks to a mother it talks to three generations of people and they talked you know the grandpa what was it like when you were a kid he's like oh I went outside we'd caught fish I remember getting chased by a bear and throwing a fish down just so you know and then I ran out of fish because the bear kept eating him but I got away and then he talked to the daughter and she was like oh we built forts when we were kids and them talks to the kids it's like what's your best thing about being a kid it's like well I play video games and I talk I check emails and it's like hmm and they show the videos to the grandparents and the parents and they're just like the socks well friend of mine works at Disneyland and he said they're having a really hard time recruiting young people that know how to communicate what does that mean they don't know how to communicate with people they're stunted because they spend so much time tweeting to each other and text messaging each other that talking to strangers they've they haven't developed these common courtesy skills and just the ability to talk to people and actually be curious and that they have to tell them put your fucking phone down oh yeah they're on their phone they check their phone like every 5-10 minutes they're just addicted to checking their phone and they're addicted to this weird little dopamine rush that you get from looking at your meds what is it someone talked about you it's really fucking weird is that there's a new there's a new way that that younger people are getting in touch with each other is that they will take a picture of themselves and then they'll put a text like what's up and then someone will text back with the picture not much you why so yeah does that make sense so they'll actually just so it's like say if you and I were talking on the phone it's like I'll take I'll take a selfie I'll be like hey to you so it's not just the taxes test with a photo yes it's a new face photo with a message like a snapchat or an Instagram like what's going on do you have friends that they they send you or they'd rather call you FaceTime just out of the blue yes and I don't answer them mmm I hate that that's a new thing it's so we gotta be we're doing that you know what's even weirder is looking at somebody crossing the street or something and they're just like yeah my favorite is I have a friend of mine who's my neighbor as well and he was he was talking facetiming he was FaceTime on Instagram promoting his brothers his brother has a not a club but it's like a social experience but he's trying to promote it or whatever and he was like yeah go check this out and this guy on a skateboard goes right by him he's like he was like okay that happened and that that's not all heroes wear capes you know mmm painful face and I hate people who face time on planes and in airports yeah that's weird right it's loud and you're talking to the other person loudly mm-hmm put your headphones on that you Savage you fucking animal oh what's wrong with you yeah it blows my mind but the FaceTime thing is seems like it's within the last year or two guys start just facetiming me out of nowhere facetiming you yes my friends know and you answer it sometimes it'll like them how do you feel a lot of rappers rappers all the FaceTime makes sense yeah they love it they like FaceTime just want to see where you're at I just think it's just a more fun way of doing or something have you done a group FaceTime what stop it it's happened on axe and a group text you can accidentally hit make this a FaceTime call and it will call everyone in the group text when everyone answers it's kind of interesting because everyone's like what the fuck you see what seven people are all doing at once it must be an emergency well you would have to have an iPhone max for that yeah the New Orleans big one you want the big one you want the small phone for that I switched over the small phone so I look at it less that's how stupid I am Oh like if I have a small phone I'll look at it less the new Samsung funny no no no okay announce that yeah and the Super Bowl they know it's a new one that that's got seven inch screen what by default god damn it's like 7.1 inches I think they said what is the know hundred megapixel camera Oh God and a hundred times 108 megapixel David where we get to see each other's pores now is that time zoom on it nostril hairs I want to see that the eyelash lice that you're carrying yeah crazy phone Samsung is always raising the but I mean they have to keep up like in order to jump people off of the Apple tit they have to make sure that they really provide something exceptional I know you know I'm so glad that guy was barking about the Apple keyboards the other day I was typing last night on my Lenovo ThinkPad which is my preferred method of writing it's so much better because I have a macbook the new one too they like oh we fixed the keyboard and they didn't really fix it you didn't fix it for a writer it's it's I can write on and I have written what do you have a pen and it just kind of no you're right keyboard the keyboard blows it just sucks it's not good the keyboard in the lenovo is like effortless it's so much better to it the little keys have like a little c shape to them so it's a little dimple your fit fits your finger fits in perfectly Fingal finger dibbles yes and you just you just gently caress the keys and they cut has named ty Kiewit Katie Micah what tt what tt yeah Savin love hassles month what does he do he just he was the director of Georgia rabbit he just went for Best Original Screenplay I heard Joe's rabbits

fucking keyboards yeah Jamie sent it to me immediately and I was like yes yes did you say yes yes what's the writers guild to take it up but fucking Apple because it's causing people how much he hates the Apple I don't think it's really causing people pain a little bit but it's not good the fucking Lenovo's are so much better lenovo thinkpad if you I want a Lenovo ThinkPad what does it look like I'll show you Oh ThinkPad get to the ThinkPad x1 carbon that's what I have this is shit it weighs nothing it weighs nothing is beautiful it folds completely flat it's so superior the thing is that it's just like if you're caught in the Apple ecosystem right which by the way Windows 10 is not bad it's excellent it doesn't fuck it's never crashed on me I've had Lenovo keep I've had three different think pads now for the last three years and they haven't crashed how many want that looks sharp it's fucking so those keys are magical man your fingers just glide over those keys you make so many less mistakes so many less so many less so many so much fewer mistakes much fewer mistake look at look at all the stars it has 4.6 stars you have fucking twats you shit together Apple it's just a it is and by the way you can also get it in a touchscreen what yeah it's a superior laptop if you right if you like look for me I like to come home from the store I spark a join up and when I'm you know everyone in my house is asleep all my kids are sleeping my wife's asleep that's when I get my writing done it yeah and that thing is a breeze man I just my fingers just go hide over those keys and I like I brought my um my MacBook on the road and I was riding on that dog shit that's so interesting Paris I can't write on my back book cuz it's just too hard and then I I find myself writing on my phone but I want something mmm like you said sleeker smooth her it's way socket joint not some shoddy yeah anytime happen her she's around she's like the McRib every now and then she'll come back

nineteen things that's legit that's what shit put my simmer down light an incense ah it's the best like that lighter get that spoon out prepared the heroin mm-hmm black tar only the best is that the best allegedly have you ever tried down no oh well I don't know why he's guilty oh god yeah yeah I have not tried heroin have you tried cocaine yes how dare you I have you ain't coked up mmm streets you hooked up right around anymore how kind what happened because you don't know what that shit's cut with anymore that's true and that dabble I saw some video and they're like that'll do it one more time and it'll kill you don't like nope fentanyl yeah well I had a guy in here who's the guy's name Ben was it Ben West Hoff the writer who fentanyl wrote a book on fentanyl he used to be a he was a journalist he used to write for LA Weekly then west on rank yes fentanyl Lake and he said they were reviewing all these raves where people are dying and they're dying from MDMA and like it didn't make any sense so they did some tests they found it's not really fentanyl or it's not really MDMA they're dying from it's MDMA cut with fentanyl yeah and plus they're not hydrating themselves because that you sweat because those people will know what it is we'll just rave until their heart explodes it's probably some of that too yeah it's probably a few of those but a lot of it it's just overdoses of fentanyl because they're cutting it you know like stress drugs anymore that's why drugs should be legal you know that's one of the mayor Pete things he had this weird conversation with one of the journalists were there he was talking about decriminalizing drugs and the guy was like would you so you would say heroin would be legal and he goes no wouldn't be legal he goes well that's what decriminalizing is like this is weird conversation where they're trying to work out the legal logistics of what's decriminalized and what's not but it sounds totally counterproductive that if you wanted to have a healthy happy Society you'd make cocaine and heroin legal right but the problem is if it's not legal then people are gonna get it anyway and they're gonna get it from the fucking cartels and you're gonna get it and it's gonna be spiked I don't want anybody to do heroin I don't want anybody do coke I don't want anybody to do any of these drugs but the only way you're gonna give them pure versions of that drug is to make sure that it's actually from a reputable source mm-hmm reputable yeah that's a reputable it's a weird way of saying it tomato tomahto no I'm beautiful I've done I was like weird people let's say nucular nucular nucular nuclear nucular that I've done ice that was one things ice so I think it's math yeah how was that good times I fall how long stay awake Oh all night oh shit I was like I think I was 22 and like a friend of mine at the time I guess it was like hey we're gonna smoke this out of a light bulb I'm like I don't know why how do you smoke it out of a light you're just it's like a it's like the end of it was cut off and you just light it underneath it's like a whole one cut a light don't fucking know I like I oh man I did that and I just remember going to a bar and just talking the fucking bartender's ear off just non-stop I remember going home and then I remember being like 3 o'clock in the morning I'm like you know what sounds good I'm gonna move all my furniture around it was just like my neighbors were probably like you fucking asshole and then I remember going to bed finally at like 6 o'clock in the morning and it was the worst feeling I've ever experienced in my life like my body just felt broken rotted alright yeah just just corroded yeah Erin she's coming out of somewhere well but cuz once twice once you do it you're addicted so it was like really I was yeah is like right when it ended is when my body was like you need more you're going through withdrawals so high I was one time one time that's all it takes really mm-hmm and then I I literally sat in my room and just shook it all out and sweated and I remember making a vow to myself I was like I am never doing this again in tooth and then finally it was like someone asked me they're like have you ever I was like yeah I'd never done math I mean I've done ice and they're like that's what that is you dumb fuck I was like oh man I mean it was not not pleasant and you see how quickly people can become addicted to that one time once you're addicted all it takes Wow so at the end of it you're like oh my god I'm so wrecked I just need a little to get me over and then next thing you know you're doing a little all the time that's exactly without a role by the way that's what adderall is just a very slow release I think that's what xanax is I think that's what negativeness you know thinks different different kinds of drugs they're not and feta mean well right the amphetamines are a real issue for people that that seek productivity yeah right that's why you're trying to clean your house and organize and stuff that's what happens with housewives they want a real house there's no real ones real actual house so I want to organize la housewives the ticket take a fucking adderall start put it in a smoothie putting all their books and the shelves in alphabetical order and that kind of shit just listen to a podcast calm down no just put your podcast do both who would've all at the same time with a butt plug in it just it what a multi-tap no specific multitask get the old butt wrecker that's a good brand a buddy of mine who used to date a girl that liked to do speed he said they're the best girls to have anal sex with because they never eat so they never shit and I was like I didn't need to know that and that is honesty he's like you never eat there's nothing going on down there because there's nothing worse than getting a get an oil slick wow that's not fun yeah that's I mean that's what it's over there's no coming back from that some people can come back some people a nice bitch who's my dipstick yeah whoo yeah you have to plan that right you do you have to do it correctly I mean I'm your food intake and make sure you don't drink too much coffee mm-hmm it's a lot going on there's a lot going on but if you find the one mm-hmm you can do it right the one that's the one area where the the good Lord has done a disservice to gay folks and giving them a lot of options uh yeah yeah I mean I don't it's good not to I can't notice I don't trust my but honestly I don't it's like you shouldn't it's like I don't trust my but I do not trust well I don't want anything in there good move I don't want I feel like it's like I feel like there's an octopus beak that comes out and I'll just snap I feel like it's the Sarlacc pit that boba fett fell into in Star Wars I don't trust my butt mmm I don't if you try to put anything in there I'm just like yes just who I am nope just do a lot squats no way nobody would want to it's just too tight it's just deadlifts but those that's kind of hot though big legs are hot yeah but not too big like if your butt is so tight they're like literally it clamps down you know like people get sleep apnea like football players do cuz their neck is so big like that's off the air pipe that's real yeah yeah there's so much muscle in the neck that when they lay back like they they they choke to death like football players have choked to death falling asleep sleep apnea just from giant necks that way your butthole makes sense but then dudes with little dicks would seek you out like ha ha behold I found a place where it can be tugged on a small deck nothing well yeah but but it's that that's a weird thing if you okay that's all like gay guys even though here what you don't want it in your butt you still want a big one yeah right I mean I get it but I don't get it I do get it it's like genetics do you want small tits I don't mind see I don't mind either but I think a lot of people in the in the I mean put weight whole straight community and the street a lot of people would like let me speak for the straight come you don't take whatever they can we speak for my people huh what they like is butts girls with big butts yes why is that it's because it's jeans it's like the jeans are signaling that this is a healthy woman who will give birth easily oh it's the old medieval hip trick it's all she can it is all she labored manymoon children like shit why does someone want someone with perfect features was because you want someone with great genetics like just there's a bunch of things that are favored right like height tall men or favored strong men are favored genetics big dicks mating yeah that's all it is it's all like genes so like if you see animal genes if you see like a kendall Jenner who writes who's not like her sisters she has none what happened because she wants to model so she can't she can't have she can't feel her ass up with like silicone and oh I thought you were talking about like facial surgery is that Kylie or Kendall which 100 oh my god let's play a game called name the Kardashian with Joe Rogan model Kendall's the youngest like there's Kylie and Kendall those are which one had her face changed Kylie okay so this is I mean which one but Kylie Kylie did but Kendall's the one who kind of kept herself normal not normal I want to say that the filler put up with she didn't filler brought up she's a model she's doing fashion week she's yeah that's okay so the one oh my god I can't one switch Kendall's on the left Kylie's on the right okay so see though the ones on the left is natural and the one on the right is the one she had her face fish yes sir Kylie's like the billionaire who's you know selling makeup and tits and ass and look at those fake boobs yeah good lord the Kendall I mean so kendall has real ones kendall has I mean those are normal those are normal the ones next to those are balloons so which which ones more attractive to you depends on how horny you are and how drunk you are interesting and who's interested that is a good factor whoever's who's interested yeah that's gonna be a nice and drunk I bet you have yeah I bet both at the same time huh oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah well the store - I've done it tried it gene come out of the pickup out of the audience mm-hmm I like you jeans are strange man they are weird what attracts people to others I mean there's a lot of factors right like mean people are very unattractive right boring people are very unattractive stupid people are very unattractive there's a lot of factors but then then it gets down like animal stuff like shapes shapes of bodies size of hogs right right sighs besides the hog I think they're at Coachella this year uh well I think not true I think I think everybody and that's always been fascinating to me is when you see like the study of the law of attraction where it's like you see something you like how your pupils dilate and how you how you kind of like pheromones and weird shit I got a cologne god I can't remember what the oh it was called so that's your blacks cologne huh okay guys what am I wondering what who the fuck's buying Cologne me clothes you have in your house I probably have about like ten whoa you know a connoisseur yeah do you have like different like tonight is the night yeah no I sign up for scent bird with that scent bird is the Cologne they send you a different cologne every month it's a cologne club it's like Dollar Shave Club it's like from home it's like 1495 you get a little Cologne Christ hey I've been with them for two three years sent by oh my god but I do it every every year I'll goo I have my January through my December smells you

little spicy at the end of the year little oh she gets spicy towards the fall in the winter yeah yeah yeah I go like a pumpkin e-service on man no just like Becca Dolce and Gabanna little dragon bone a little bit uh yeah and they have them all on there and they're nice have you I've always smelled good okay I like people are like to him you smell good I'm like fuck yeah you're right so you put like a tiny bit tiny bit just a touch just that's it but you have ten yeah so and they keep sending you more mm-hmm are you worried any gonna run out of space he's wallowing in his own filth no I have usually I'll use for the month I'll use that as my month and then you know if I don't use him I'll save them oh but them there is a cologne that I had it was called sexual sexual is that even a word or some asshole it's some assholes let's go tanning does a you say like when people would say in Spanish can you tell me where o is the restaurant oh oh yeah actually thanks you out but it had pheromones in it sure it did so what had pheromones in it and every time I would wear it women would be like mmm hey yeah good as they probably took some fat guy and made him run on a treadmill and then they'd ripped his fucking underwear in each bottle it's just od Bert Kreischer he's thick with - no he's just Google Bert is no you're fun I know but the death that's mean he's thick Tom and Bert call each other fat the bear trap shamed each other what is it the butt yeah where's 1k bears yeah that that's a chance at a term tell them she tell them that they should know they probably made it's done to change repairs one cave they're both bears in the gay community those are bears so they didn't get the joke they don't get the reference think they know they should are they technically bears you have to be kind of little buff to be a bear no no no just hairy yeah fat I don't know what you are you're not a beard huh a chimp no yeah what is Joe Rogan in the gay community mm-hmm that's I think that's why we I don't have a thing either good congratulation I used to be a twink and now I'm not and now I've wet wilts my Harry what changed I grew up Joe yeah mature I felt that issue with gay folks right as you get older the older guys that are straight can get hos oh absolutely gold diggers yeah yeah I love a good old ho I know some dudes who are just really old and they have young hot girlfriends or wives oh yeah it's hilarious cuz they got that job yeah but then that doesn't work guys does it yeah it does for twinks right it does for young gays the younger there's definitely somewhere I've been like this guy's like 85 years old it's like said a 19 year old oh yeah like yeah oh yeah but that's okay in the gay community whereas that's disgusting in the straight community if you see an 80 year old guy with an 18 year old girl you want to beat him to death you piece of shit but if you see an 80 year old gay guy with an 18 year old boy I don't found themself a fella yeah okay you also can look and be like that'll do Pig well you know also the other way if you find 80 year old lady she's got a 24 year old boyfriend well yeah go girl go bitch you go mm-hmm good for her good for her nobody's mad at her yeah if anything you're mad at the guy for like playing that old lady and getting her to buy you a Corvette see that's how I feel about Britney Spears right now really yeah what's going on with her she's kind of going through a thing what is her think she's just you know she's in a concert what to call the conservation ship conservatorship I don't know serve it and serve it like her dad's in charge of her and she's like almost 40 right yeah she's got like mental shit going on if you look at her Instagram she's just walking down just flipping her go to industry ah Jesus here we go Brittany I love you came up a week ago I thought you were used to this but I've heard like we didn't get there but I knew this was when I was having a conversation with Bill Maher because I talked about this well I said she's hot and Bill Maher said what what are you talking about and then my wife gave me a ton of shit for saying that Britney Spears is hot she's like what the fuck is wrong with you she's you know there's a whole thing saying you know hashtag save Britney because they just feel like she's not in control of anything in her life anymore like her dad owns everything that she can't drive she can't do right but don't you think there's a reason for that if she wasn't so she whoa hasn't cracked out yeah but she has like this hot 24 year old who put that photo up she did let me see that somebody's gogo large with that picture bro she looks completely insane come on was she taking her pants off she's got tattoos right next your pussy well I mean who doesn't me can't wait for spring what that's her that's her cat all the emojis yeah every emoji should go like a shoe and eggplant and look at that what's good what's going on with this one yeah 2020 I will be doing a lot more so yoga let me hear this please oh you just killed my fantasies yeah she looks like a seven year old lady what what is this what's going on this is AcroYoga she just does that show she looks crazy to walk from her house and she does these little fashion shows where she'll put on like her outfits and just spin around and you're just kind of like what and now doesn't she do residency in Vegas oh she did what is she doing now she cancelled her residency like days before it was supposed to open at friends of mine who were supposed to dance and her and her her second residency that she was doing days before they cancelled it because that was the whole thing like her dad said no apparently like her dad even slapped one of her kids in front like well I really fucked up yeah this is true are you just no no this is all real it's I'm sure no no it's out there it's out there it's real oh it's real yeah she does look cuckoo for cocoa puffs yeah and so now you know everyone wants her to like everyone's rooting for and everything and it's it's just everyone they are we're rooting for Britney Spears what's going on here she's in Hawaii it's my birthday bitches how old is she she's probably 37 38 I'm sure she's bowling whatever never but where they go that she's gonna bow strike yay no it's so sad but where was I going with this oh yeah she has like this hot 24 year old good boyfriend good I hope she buys him was that him yeah look at this guy I'm sir he's a moose it's a handsome fella he's an elk what's going on around his neck it's on a neck pole for airplanes just wear that everywhere probably on that fucking neck pillow god I mean and that tree come on she does look like she's out of her fucking mind yeah so Bill Maher was right I'm sorry bill yeah that that one where she's doing the Aqua yoga that that was sad yeah that's that there's a lot of em where you're just just seems crazy I know I mean yeah it's just a lot of head flips and then I yeah yeah well she's probably insane wasn't she like 16 intimated I mean that's the story loosely wood you know it's like you start out at like six pump you full of pills and then you know who's all right kind of sort of who Macaulay Culkin he's on the cover of uh what's it called this in March Vietnam hey affair they just released it this morning Esquire he looks good GQ something like that supported up a hill yeah he's doing well bears and caves bears a case he he's in here Manolo yeah we had a real good conversation yeah II enjoyed his company he's yeah he's a nice guy and he realized this Macaulay Culkin is not like you the 39 year old yeah Esquire that's what it has Esquires March 2020 cover boy has been never in longer than he's he's an interesting guy he really is um he's gone he knows he's gone through something that you're not supposed to go through like he knows he knows that did something you're not supposed to do he developed as a human being really young in in a gigantic population of people like everyone knew who he was yeah he's hugely famous when he was a little boy and that's not good for anybody well and people would see him on the streets and be like do the thing - the thing I'm sure I'm sure he still gets that and you can't say no that you're fucking mad either want to kick you yeah but Britney Spears man like she's no when did she make it how old was she knows she made it she's in 1999 was her first she's also on that Mickey Mouse Club Justin Timberlake jay-z says a she's she's double triple fuck yeah yeah she's fucked she looks crazy she's probably pilled up probably got her on all kinds of stuff she had a show with her husband at the time called uh got chaotic with Kevin Federline followed her around and she was like jacked out of her mind he's one of those gold diggers on the male side we only have two him and Tom Arnold the villains have made it those we got to up on the board there are so many women who have made so much money man and divorces and only two men that I know of that have really scored hard well well it's someone else yes Anna Nicole Smith's oh really I think so yeah Kevin Federline it's all fat now he's got a giant belly just takes care of the kids he's got custody - which is not a good sign you know when the ex has custody and it's a guy that usually means you're a fuckup yeah or you've got some issues mentally so it's like give me that's what happens well you don't like kids yeah okay bro you can have them that's what happens here's a Ferrari it happened a Whitney Houston happen to Michael Jackson happen that's half at Amy Winehouse Jackson those are not as kids oh yeah what do I mean oh you mean going crazy yeah sorry it's like you go you go down that route you start to have it all well I don't think anybody's supposed to be famous and I think being famous is probably one of the weirder fucking things that could happen to a human being and I think that as it's happening to you your reality just distorts you know what a that the you're not no you don't have normal interactions anymore and so then your foundation of who you are as a person deteriorates now if you grow up that way it's even stranger because then your foundation never existed you never had a foundation you were always in this weird strange world and then oftentimes it goes away like remember when Gary Coleman was a security guard and people would show up at his job and mock him I was just trying to get enough money to eat well it's like literally I mean when you're working as a security guard you're getting what $15 now if you're lucky you're just trying to eat that's all you're trying to do was like that guy from Trader Joe's who is on like The Cosby Show yeah what's wrong with a guy I don't make a living at they're like look how gross he is it's like no what do you do that to everybody that's had the fucking Trader Joe's no you say hi you say hi they bag your groceries and it's fine but it's almost worse to have been someone and then not be someone than it is to have never know it is worse in people's eyes but it's that same thing it's like when people look at you when you're on television and go like oh fuck him you know like what they were saying like would people take shots at you like fuck him he's on TV I'll fucking take shots at him but then when you're not anymore and then you have a regular job then it's like they have an extra desire to shit oh yeah those same kind of power yes now rose now they're doing better in power yeah yeah down they're doing better than you I got my own house if you fucking lose around your apartment ATM card I got everything yeah you ain't got shit you used to be on TV hmm that went away I bought a round of drinks I had a guy shit on me once it was work he was working at the corner Ellis not really behind the counter at a CVS and I couldn't figure out what he was trying to do he's being rude to me the CVS he's like he goes hey you're that guy from that show I go yep he goes what happened to that show huh I don't know what Fear Factor I go we think happened he was I don't know you tell me what happened to that show I mean to me I go it got canceled it's a yeah I might bro you work in fucking CBS yeah relax what are you doing this is Fear Factor yeah I didn't go after I'm almost like this is so ridiculous I was like this I was he was lucky I was high I was like this is so weird cuz he was he was literally trying to insult me you know not realizing that I had done things since mmm-hmm okay but to him I'm not on TV anymore so it must be a fucking loser so he's trying to make me feel bad what happened to that show hmm what happened what happened I wish I could tell you but it was like a weird like yeah I didn't do anything to you man I just came here to buy gum or whatever the fuck I'm buying yeah could I have my mile-long receipt she's not I'm already why are you being weird with me but he was just a dick yeah behind the counter dick yeah like yeah yeah you used to be on TV nothing anymore btcd behind the counter dick people are weird with with people that are successful you know that that there's a thing where they don't look that in general people don't look to people that are doing well as inspiration they look at them with envy it's like a natural human instinct and it's that attack and that's where we're at now with like canceled culture and stuff it's like oh we want to see somebody stumble or fall because if we do we can drag them down and then we'll get you know and if we see that and if we post it then we'll get all the likes and the favorites and the retweets look what I found look what I did look what I discovered yeah fuck yeah fuck him yeah but they don't realize all that's just gonna come back around get them he's gonna come back and bite him in the ass I'll compete with a satyr it feels bad it just feels bad even when you're doing it you think you're gonna like if you say mean shit to people that you don't even know it can't feel good it seems like it would feel good but it doesn't feel good it's gonna come back around on you yeah it's a weird way you know giving people the access to things like social media it's a weird way to communicate and it's not natural and so many people using abusive so many kids using it oh my god and that's what's terrifying all those people being mean to you on your Instagram if you could find out what the median age and who these people are and what their life was like you're probably like oh I'm gonna feel bad yeah you're fucking 12 F we're your parents and you're a 50 year old loser and you know where are you parents yeah yeah how'd your parents even know you have an Internet account you little fuck I mean I've had I've had instances where you know when we started the show on snapchat cuz snapchat I guess used to be like for new 12 year olds but like you see it one time and then would go away it would go away so you could be like here's my deck and you're like oh and then it goes away but it doesn't go away just screenshot it well but there was some times where was like you know I had to like call and be like hey um no no I had like a girl who would had a dildo and was like using it on herself and you call them and say don't know I had to call I had to call like whoever was in charge of the shows like hey like because it was snapchat it just come out and I didn't know what the hell I'm like I'm not the demographic of snapchat but I was just kind of I felt bad because it was like clearly the girl didn't know that was like how did she not know well I don't know it was really she didn't know that's how she drops a customer but it was just it was just I mean it was fucking disturbing was it oh he's going hard in the paint oh yeah but it was just like oh like where's your parents wishes Oh 50 mm where's your parents they're dead yeah mantle with his beer bottle she was young oh yeah a lot of people are bad parents bro they do a terrible job do you ever think you'd adopt kids no good for ya look at you like how quick you know Oh some anything not even a cat right now I'd have a man I'd
