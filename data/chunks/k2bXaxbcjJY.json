the girag and experience okay let's not get crazy Tommy yeah I've never been a big comedy store guy like I just recently like this year I've done like three sets there and that's what well I it's I've enjoyed going there and hanging out like I think the last time I saw you was there when I ran into you a few years ago and you know good friends of mine play there but I always had a strange feeling about the place which I'm starting to get over now because I've enjoyed playing there this year but I'm from the Orlando Florida area and when I was 19 years old I won this contest the funniest person in Central Florida contest not funny first in Florida funny person in Central Florida which I think it's clear yes it was kid in South Florida it was a real badass and the grand prize of this contest was I got to go to fly to Los Angeles and do a set at The Comedy Store and I'm 19 years old man I've been no comedy for two years LA the concert oh my god you thought I was doing Johnny Carson this is my break baby cool in LA man and in retrospect it was an open mic night and I only did five minutes but there was a very famous comedian there I won't mention the men's name and he acted like I was the funniest comedian ever seen in his life and then he I see a big guy I'm not saying it was a Polish or no no this is for the record state who was not Pauly Shore leave some mystery anyway so so here may not be a big guy he invites me to hang out with him and then he asked me to take a drive with him and oh my god you know who wouldn't want to take a drive with famous guy and we park our we parked in front of the rage on Santa Monica for like 20 minutes was a bar well years later when I lived in LA I find out the rage is like the biggest gay bar in Los I had no idea at the time so this guy is showing off his young meat and then he says he needs to go by his apartment in Beverly Hills and we go in and they on this wall he had all these photos of him and famous people that were signed to him and so we go from one side down all the way and he's showing me you know this is me with Gandhi and Martin Luther King and whatever whoever whoa whoa and and then we get to the end of the wall and it's the corner this was the guys move to show you the pictures you start at one side in the boom you're in the corner and he makes this move on me ten years old and and they kind of rate your raging steps in on me and then what's the man like and I just like I just like kind of oil then and the guy steps in on me and he he cupped my ass Oh with each hand he's got you why are you afraid to say this man's name I don't say it don't don't I won't say I won't I promise you I won't say it but I will say what it rhymes with don't do it please don't well I'm so anyway you know I said can we go back to the comedy store and I can't help but reflect on that moment all these years later and think how much further my career would have gone if I would have just fucked that yeah I don't think so you would lose all your street cred anyway but that was why so like you know when I go back to Florida I'm 19 like people hey how was your trip to Hollywood I don't want to talk about and have you talked to him censors never I never seen the guy ever again but but yeah so that kind of made me shy away from the Comedy Store it is already what the fuck son
