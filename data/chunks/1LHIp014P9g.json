the girag an experience but I was I was living in Dallas and I was 42 years old when ecstasy hit the streets MDMA and I had never taken any drugs I didn't even smoke pot came out of the Navy and everything else you were an attorney right yeah in in Houston I was an attorney then in Dallas I started a computer company I had a personal computer company that well in 1981 we out-grossed Microsoft you know I had for color picture in Forbes magazine made the front page of The Wall Street Journal and really then IBM came in and crushed us like a bug Wow what was the name of your computer company ready for this is in Dallas Texas named dynasty Oh my name is the computer corporation that's hilarious it was we were the Amway of computers I had like three thousand distributors around the country and it was crazy and we sold we sold this machine you want to hear this I'm sorry yeah there's an 8k machine with 16 K of RAM and it was a 12-inch black-and-white monitor and a cassette tape deck is what we used for input and output and you'd have to load your your your boot program and then you get a CRC error so you're just the tone and rewind it and then load it again and and we sold hundreds of these for 3,000 bucks each Wow and and parents that say you know why do I need this you know you got recipe program and pong and a couple games and I said I don't know why you need it but if your kids don't have this they're gonna be left behind why that's when they're 30 years old and later I was talking about one of the Jabba conventions in San Francisco and a guy came up to me and gave me his card and he's CEO of a company like a hundred programmers and all and he said you don't remember me do you and I said no he says my dad bought a computer from you and you told him that would help me Wow so I don't know if anybody else got help at least one customer turned out what what year was this let's see we went out of business I started in in 79 79 and we made it till 84 Wow and it was it was great it was you know you heard of the dot-com bubble well this was the PC bubble you know before IBM got in and you know we'd run short on memory chips and I'd call it my friend at Osborn he'd shipped me some and then when I got some back I'd it was a closed network is pretty good old boy thing you know fascinating and there's a lot of fun it was great fun but we didn't know what we're doing you know we were geeks and I didn't know anything about cash flow or business you know I've been an electrical engineer and a lawyer but I didn't know anything about business and so we we just sort of sold ourselves out of business and by the time we were done the last six eight nine months I was financing the thing by selling ecstasy so how did the ecstasy come into play I was I was doing this computer thing and and close friend of mine a lawyer in Biloxi called me one day and he says what do you know about ecstasy and I said what do you mean he's oh it's a drug and I said why don't do drugs he says it's legal you know now this isn't Texas and at that time you're getting thirty years to life for a single joint and so there's no way I'd touch something like that you know and I get ya joy for one joint yeah and so he says no this is legal and I had a friend a friend of my wife's actually and she was a model in town ran with a fast crowd and I met with her and she fixed me up and so I got involved and then my friend wanted sums I sent him 50 and I started telling friends about it and I became really evangelical about it and pretty soon I'm buying hundreds and five hundred six hundred and and I didn't realize it at the time the guy I was buying from was actually the main man and the big guy that started seeing ecstasy hit the street in Dallas he'd been out here in West Coast for several years with the therapist and all but Dallas in the star club was the ground zero and the star club was just the star club was so big Madonna moved to Dallas to be close to that club yes there's a documentary gonna be coming out soon called the stark project and it was an insane place it's really the genesis of house music before even Chicago is called star club music Wow and then it and and there were bowls of ecstasy on the bar where you go by 20 bucks and get a get a hit because it's all legal and you know they had chill space it was a crazy place that you would it was like Burning Man in a building in fact Larry Hagman was a regular there and and in the in this movie that's coming out he's quoted to say he lights up knees oh is the greatest party on earth he says the only better party is Burning Man but that's like putting the star club in the middle of a desert but people some people will get all dressed up Burning Man type and we're talking name-brand people you know the Talking Heads and people like that Madonna even W showed up George W have been there and it's just wild and crazy and they played this house music and had a chill space and coed bathrooms it's just a wild place and that's that's really where ecstasy started spreading now I was selling to all of my friends and and a lot of co-workers and everybody and we were really serious about it that I would make people read all whatever literature there was you know there wasn't very much so there's a speech Sasha gave and a talk that Rick Doblin had given at the International Health Organization but not much but we were really serious and I was sort of not in the club scene I was getting people together in small groups and doing it but I sold a lot of ex and I was getting deep discounts and so I was using that money to cash flow of my business
