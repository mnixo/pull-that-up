and we're live so literally this morning I had this thought um I thought about it a bit yesterday and this morning I thought of it I was like why don't just do it I said I need to do like some sort of a an MMA recap show because there's always so much shit that's happening did I miss a lot of it I don't get a chance to talk a lot of it I love doing it with Brendan he's my favorite because we get so silly and because he loves MMA as much as I do you know I could talk to him forever about it so I'm sure I'll do some of those definitely in the future with him he's really good at breaking down fights to men he has a he's got a skeptical eye for things and he has a great obviously was a high-level professional heavyweight fighter but he also has a real good understanding of where someone is at various stages of their career I think that's big because fighters have like these peaks and valleys and you never know where they're at you know like fighting is a hard hard business and the idea that you could stay and like a super high level for a long period of time that just doesn't seem to be the case it seems like everybody's body starts giving out after a certain period of time after a certain amount of time cage fighting your body's just giving out unless you're a guy like GSP that takes all this time off which I think was brilliant now in in retrospect he knew what we all didn't know he really was in fucking amazing shape he really was fighting I don't say amazing cardio shape because that's one legit criticism that Brendan had is that he looked like he was getting tired and was pretty early in the fight the guy was off for four years and he's stepping right in fighting Bisping who's the middleweight champion that is not easy that's very hard Bisping keeps a fast pace he's got amazing cardio he's tough as shit like there was a tall order like to see him come back like that but he I think he recognized that grind was too heavy on him but he wasn't done yet you know he was only 32 I think when he retired 32 so right somewhere in that range comes back at 36 I'm like wow what are the odds he's actually gonna be better than he was before or look good he looked fucking amazing he looked like a bigger better version of the the Walter Wade champion George st. Pierre was weird it was weird to see I mean is I don't want to say that I doubted him because I did not doubt him because I'm very open-minded and I have a deep respect for George I think he's amazing he's just a great person a great example of an in my opinion like how a champion should carry himself like George has always been like one of my favorite examples because you see him and you like like that guy is like well-spoken he's friendly he's genuine and he's super open-minded in terms of like his willingness to listen to coaches and formulate a good game plan and always be trying out new stuff like he spent a lot of time working with those guys in hens Oh Gracie's that Danaher death squad there was a lot of images of them training together if he's training with like Gary tonin and some of these fucking animals I mean John Danaher is a wizard and he's he's done just this amazing job with Eddie Cummins and these kids that he has in New York that is these leglock masters I mean it says Gordon Ryan they're just animals these guys are killing people and for George to be in the mix with those guys like he's getting down with some serious fucking strangle experts so for just knowing that he's training with those guys cuz Eddie Cummings has been killing tournaments Gary tonin's been killing toured the vault Ryan's been killing tournaments that all those kids Nicky Ryan his brother - they're all animals so he's got like Danaher has this great group of really savage jiu-jitsu players and George is diving into that mix comes to LA he's doing boxing with Freddie Roach you know it was one of the best boxing coaches in the world Manny Pacquiao's trainer so he's like getting down with like real boxing trainers he's getting down with real jujitsu coaches and he never stopped he never stopped which is just amazing it's amazing he could just jump right back in Dominick Cruz sent me a text message right after was over he said I told you ring Ross is bullshit and unfortunately Dominic just broke his arm I don't know the the specifics of it but that's a that's a huge bummer he's he's got to be chompin at the bit now to get back in there now that TJ just knocked out Cody Garber and he must be chomping chomping at the bit so a few the fights that went down really recently this past weekend pedis and Poirier holy shit what a good fight that was that's crazy that's a crazy fight and Dustin Poirier at 155 pounds it seems like a different person he's just so much healthier at 155 and he looked awesome that Joe Duffy fight too and this this fight was a big big win for him though former champion and pedis guy who is a champion of Strikeforce too I mean shit that's a big win you know Anthony Pettis is a tough loss it seems like he had broken a rib or something like there was something going on like when he got mounted he had a tap you know that's that's very unfortunate but Pettis just looked really good in his last fight who did Pettis fight he fought and beat in his last fight did he fight Gilbert Melendez Jim Miller that's right that's right who did Gilbert Melendez fight you know what I just watch the other day I rewatched Gilbert Oh was it the kicked his legs god dammit can't believe I'm forgetting this Jeremy Stephens that's what sorry Jeremy Jesus Christ those like one of Jeremy's team is firemen finest performances I forgot who did it there's too many fights I have to erase my brain data I gotta erase him Dan Severn footage from the 90s I said I can't though out of respect but I have just too many fights floating around my fucking head that fight was a good fight though because that was the Pettis emporia fight is a fight between two guys that are like legit top ten contenders like either one of them with a couple of good wins could be fighting for the title and maybe for poor yay that was enough to get him in there and fight for the title but it's like you got out just a shark pool there Tony Ferguson is the interim champ who knows what the fuck is gonna happen now with Conor cuz Connor was involved in some sort of an altercation with referee mark Goddard where he jumped into the cage while the fight had not been called yet apparently this is Mark Goddard's interpretation of it and I think Connors Connors uh he made an apology and I think what he was basically saying was that he was angry that the referee had not stopped the fight first he thought the referee had stopped the fight and then he was angry that he had not because he gets like really concerned when someone's taking a beating too much and he felt like this guy really was out of it and taking a beating I think where the confusion was and I hope I'm not fucking this up we'll check the confusion was I think that mark Goddard was saying essentially that he had not known whether or not the Bell had gone off he knows he knew the Bell was closed but he did not know whether it had gone off it was too loud in there for him to hear it and he was concerned I believe that it went off and so that's when he stepped in because he thought the round was over he was not necessarily calling the fight yet then when Conor McGregor jumped in since he hadn't already called the fight he was in a bad situation because the fight technically speaking was still going on I hope I'm not fucking this up did I fucked it up he made a statement on yes and by the way I felt the way he wrote this statement was really it was it was not just like very professional it was it was very poised I was very impressed with it I don't want to read the whole thing but he essentially says the first round was progressing and then so when the guy when the guy got hurt he said he connected Charlie Ward connected with a left hand that slumped John read been to his knees and at this exact point I could not and had not made my determination that John was either out of the contest or not in the position to intelligently defend himself the punch and the action that followed naturally resulted in a surge of crowd noise one that was so significant I had already made my determination that I could not audibly hear the bell sound for the end of the round I had made my decision to step in with the belief that the Bell had indeed been sounded which in actual fact it had not this is a critical fact to the ensuing proceeding so apparently there was a massive amount of confusion because of the noise and so it looked like a it looked like a very reasonable stoppage see if you can find the video footage to me because there's a bunch of video of the brawl itself and all the craziness that that happened with it but it definitely seemed like if they if I remember correctly I've seen it but last time I saw it was a couple days ago it looked like a really reasonable stoppage like a smart stoppage I could see it and you go yeah that guy's he's getting hurt they should stop this and then I think Connor just assumed when he stepped in which he would especially what's that fucking loud he assumed there's no Bell and mark Goddard steps in see Connard runs in and he tackles them to the ground and then but there's already cornermen in there and so these guys are hugging and mark Goddard is trying to get control of the Octagon and so Connor comes at him and pushes him and he's yelling at him there's this is a just a terrible scene terrible scene you know and I'm sure Connor if he could take you back would take it back because I'm sure he'd you know realize this is a disaster and he even apologized you know you can't you can't do that you can't run in you got to be sure that the referee stopped the fight and you know I mean they have to have control of the octagon otherwise anything can happen right anybody can get it in any time not just a friend but somebody wants to hurt you so they don't know what I mean obviously they knew that Connor was probably coming in to congratulate his friend but dick you can't make them give up the rules like the rules are in place for a very good reasons to protect the athletes people get super emotional about fights there's many times I would believe that if they weren't like very very stringent in how they allow the athletes to behave like have a really stringent set of rules if they didn't do that those guys have to fight a lot I mean it'll be a lot of chaos people climb into the ring and beat the shit out of each other we've obviously had a few incidents where corners argued with each other but relatively speaking when you think about how many fights take place it's a very small number and it's one of the reasons why is because we have pretty clear rules like you have to listen to the referee at all times it's real simple like there's there's a time where the cage is shut and the referee is in there and that guy has control of that until he brings somebody in and he has to have control over it if he calls the fight then he he calls time and then he brings the doctors in or whatever he wants to do or he stops the fight that is entire this guy entirely be his call and I see that Connor thought it was over and he's probably like completely caught in the moment he's fucking happy for his friend he dives on his friend they're celebrating he's thinking that there's gonna be a bunch of people in there any second now because the fights over he's thinking they're gonna open it up and Bruce Buffer is gonna step in but no it would have been Bruce Buffer is another organization but you know what I'm saying whoever they're Bruce Buffer is but then somewhere along the line he realized the fight hadn't been stopped and then I think he got very upset he said because he has seen people take unnecessary punishment and he felt like that guy was done and he felt like to not stop the fight right then would be a terrible thing and I totally see this point of view that makes sense too that makes sense too just you can't you can't push officials you can't jump in when you're not supposed to be there so mistakes were made but I don't know what you do about something like that I don't know how you I don't know like if they have standard punishments for shit like that but it'd be a shame if that instance took a Connor fight away from the fans I'm not saying he shouldn't be punished I would just say if he was punished it would be a shame I mean I guess you have to set a precedent I don't know how that works you ever shove an official Jamie no I've definitely yelled at him though but I mean playing basketball right yeah man they're real strict about that like when people do they get very upset you definitely can't put your hands on them you know Roy Roy Nelson just was pissed off once at a late stoppage and he he kicked Big John McCarthy in the butt but it was like the most gentle kick ever I mean he didn't kick him like he was trying to hurt him you know he like touched his foot on his butt I mean it was nothing and Big John said it was nothing but he shouldn't have touched him so there's it's just there's rules and you get crazy and it was the same thing in fact big Roy was pissed that he he let him take so much punishment something similar happened this year in the NBA the Steph Curry is one of the top players he's known for throwing his mouthpiece when he gets pissed he always takes his mouthpiece out a lot when just one play is not in action so he does well for whatever reason something happened in the NBA Finals last year he turned around and tried to throw it out like the the scorer's table and it hit a fan that's so nasty it's definitely really gross if I are throwing it into the crowd like some nasty mouthpiece I can nobody want well that's some fighters oh no some people would dive for a UFC fighters mouthpiece but if he's throwing it at a referee that's like spitting in his face boy he it bounced off the ground and hit him I think is what happened here like he didn't I don't know if he even meant to throw it at him but either way he shouldn't be thrown his mouthpiece know when he's pissed sort of like he didn't get suspended which a lot of people were saying like what do you think early in the year you should have at least got a three or four game suspension not just a $50,000 fine which is a tenth of what he makes that day probably I don't think anything would happen to you if you're a fighter and you threw your mouthpiece at the ground in front of a referee I think because the UFC is so violent that that would be taken as like I'll come on throw the mouthpiece on the ground but I think in basketball it's probably a pretty big deal right you can't your spit your gum at them no you can't spit at people man you're spinning at people you're just throwing it with your hand that thing's all slobbery and shit you know what the fuck you did sweat and everything is it as satisfying no to take out your mouthpiece filled with spit and hit someone in the face with it as it is to spit in their face never done either to be honest with you but I spit in the face thinks a dangerous move Hawk a big loogie yeah because you've got to be close real close this bit it's like a it's like I've I'm ready for violence move you spit in someone's face like that's not just an insult it's like the only way to respond to that insult is like something more intense it's like there's always like a moment when someone spits in someone's face with is this like terrifying moment of anything could happen here like how does this go does this swing left is this wing right how does this go but in MMA like that happens I mean you're involved in these violent altercations if someone just threw their mouthpiece at the ground like you people would barely even notice it you know you know you couldn't do it at a referee like obviously at a referee they would warn you or something like that maybe I'm wrong could you throw a shadow punch or shadow cake never gonna hit him I wasn't even that's threatening that's threatening you know if you if you it's like fake kick even if you were five foot away from someone you're kind of threatening you're at the very least you're doing something that's totally unnecessary look why would you do that you're doing that to elicit some sort of response from the for a he's trying to get him scared trying to get him to realize that he's in the cage with a trained killer you know I mean seriously if you're in the cage and Francis and ganas mad at you what a fucking terrifying position you'd be in that guy is a Smasher he's just a super athlete in the history of MMA like in a big fight in a cage that a fighters gotten pissed and taking us I've seen it happen in boxing I think you know a few times just doesn't happen often obviously but I think to the UFC fighters credit I don't think anyone is ever taking a swing at a referee I don't think that's ever happened I don't think so that's good yeah I think that like if you if you stop and think about how many fights there are and how few even like bad situations are in between fighters I'd like to think that even though it's a super intense endeavor to be fist fighting another person male or female like for the most part they're like really friendly people that do it for the most part they're very you know they're they're accomplished there and they don't have any time for bullshit but lately there's been this trend and I think it's because Conor McGregor has been so successful with it oh shit talking to like the enth degree like who can be the biggest shit talker and Coby Covington is just going for it baby he's fucking going for it and I gotta tell you I don't know how I feel because part of me thinks it's attaint entertaining as fuck when I read some of the shit that he says and I see some of the shit he says like he is just going for it but it's working see here's the thing and this is one of the things that he said you gotta understand like a lot of this is your tree just trying to get your name out there you trying to do something that makes a splash even if it's a bad splash even it's like pissing off the entire country of Brazil he's making a splash you know and I could see the point that like you shouldn't do it that way I get it I get people saying that what I don't get is people saying they're not paying attention I'm being attention I'm not encouraging it I'm just being and I'm analyzing it from an outside perspective as a person who's a huge fan of the way Conor McGregor talks shit I enjoy it I fucking enjoy it when Jeremy Stephen says something nobody goes who the fuck is that guy he's a he's a magic man with that shit I think he's amazing his fucking timing whoo the things he says he's a character he's a fucking character and he fucks people up there's no denying that you know Conor McGregor's a beast and I think probably not even in his prime I mean I think his athletic prime might be a couple of years away I mean he who the fuck knows what that guy can accomplish but one thing that's clear is that he's changed the landscape when it comes to shit talking like now everybody wants to be a shit talker now shit talking is like it's mandatory for the gig you know shit talking has become some thing that like it's like an art form in and of itself guys are just some guys are just going for it so Colby apparently got into it with Fabricio Werdum because one thing about brazilians if you talk some shit about Brazil they will get really mad at you they're very proud they're very nationalistic they love Brazil and I don't know if that was what the argument was about but Fabricio Werdum hit co v covington with a fuckin boomerang see the problem with that is I don't think Fabrizio was trying to kill him right but the problem with that is that's a weapon like that it literally is what it is like it seems like it's goofy because it's a something that we have when were kids you know it never really works have you ever got a boomerang to come back to you like come on man you can't just stay in the same spot and get that boomerang to come back to you has anybody ever done that can you really do that sure I've seen it happen for sure you got to do it up in the air or something there's the way you throw it yeah but does it go right back to you see if you could find a video of someone actually getting a boomerang to go right back to the same spot where he's down they do that you can do with the frisbee - I see like I do it with crazy frisbee so like they invented it so they can kill things with it though they invented it like throw it birds and shit so this is a real weapon let you shoot like you're literally you're literally hitting a guy in the head with a weapon I mean I'm not look at this guy that's Australians fuck what's he get to say guys English he got you he got you he got you I believe someone probably can but the point is it's a weapon so it's like Kobe got hit with a weapon fur dude he hit him in the head with a piece of wood and apparently punched him in the face - according to Kobe Covington this guy looks like he'd be really good at a boomerang let me see it come back oh shit look at that that's fucking crazy Oh flew away this bullshit - it comes back to the vicinity that you're in sort of like I mean I don't know like even if you sent a falcon I left will come right back to the same GPS spot that you left it let it go from but pretty pretty close yeah how does that work Falcons you just don't know what to do I have no idea on that so this dude it's like a boomerang expert looking I'm just whipping that boomerang how long would you have to practice to get that good at a boomerang that is what a weird fucking weapon it can catch it couldn't catch it but what a weird thing you know that someone figured out how to do that like how smart with those goddamn people like how many different shapes did they come up with look okay if you had to guess how long you think the boomerangs been around thousands of years obvious a it's gotta be one of those accidents someone figured out and was like whoa look at that and just threw it right hey comes back look at that it comes back yeah but do you think that like there's a conventional academic view of like when it was invented it must be right so you can find that I just heard that there's the one one of the most popular VR games or VR experiences I think I showed to you probably done it called tilt brush that virtual painting right experience yeah yeah I just saw yesterday a tweet that said it was started as the guy who made it started out to make a 3d chess game but a bug was found that one of the pieces was dragging light behind it or whatever and said oh look at that and now he made the most popular VR thing there was based off of a bug that so similar to someone could just throw in a stick and be like hey look I say this one comes back to you what could we use this for right sort of like how they invented viagra because they were trying to come up with some blood pressure medication or some shit those wins no one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was invented hmm anyway Colby got hit in the head with one that works man that seems like assault I mean that's like I I know he wasn't trying to kill him if you watch the video let's see if we could watch the video boom right 25 to 30 to 50,000 years ago wow that's a big gap yeah they're like um I don't know he just bothers I think someone might yeah you might have bought her someone gave it to her something they give you boomerangs on there but he's got it in the back and he just fucking whips it he hits him in like side of the head he hits him in like the shoulder in the head and Colby still talking shit to him they give up boomerangs like plays in Hawaii is that probably enough to give you one yeah it's Kobe like when he hit him with it he's like whoa yeah this is crazy that just happened today right I think so I just found out about it like right after the last podcast was over krei and they talking crazy shit to each other we don't have to broadcast they shed talking I find it rude and vulgar it's weird man it's like some people like it some people like the trash talking but these two guys are obviously in different weight classes so they're never gonna fight but some people like this like tough guy conflict that fighters have with each other and some people hate it there's some people that think that some people are martial artists you know and they think that this is all like offensive that you should conduct yourself like a martial artist and some people have said that you know a lot of people like agree with it and think that this is the better path for the sport for all of us but there's no denying the entertainment value of being a shithead it's entertaining you know I don't want people to fight but I am entertained often when they do I think we'd all be better off if they didn't fight but there's something about like John Jones going I beat you after I did cocaine like there's something about that that yeah it's not like it doesn't feel like the embodiment of the true spirit of what we would think of as martial arts being a vehicle for developing your human potential in the path of the warrior samurai and the noble poet you know we have all these like quite Chang Caine views of what martial arts are but one thing that martial arts are is a psychological warfare as well it's undeniable that it has a big impact and who you're fighting you can get emotional if a guy fucks with your head too much you can get to a point where you're out of character and you take chances you shouldn't take you're nervous beyond like your ability to control because you're so worried about losing to this person that you have this big emotional investment with that's real I mean that's one of the things that miyamoto musashi used when he was a sword fighter in the book of five rings he would talk about all the different games he would play and people have documented it like when Musashi would have these duels he would show up like hours late and let this poor fuck just freak out worrying about a sword fight that he was gonna have the guys sitting there for hours and hours then finally Musashi would show up and the guy would be like a nervous wreck and he would just fuck him up and kill him and he he had all these tactics that he used and that was just one of them so psychological warfare is something that's always been a part of the martial arts but some people feel like the most noble path for both warriors is just be respectful and just have no no emotions on the line with this in terms of like hate for each other instead just respect each other like warriors and go after it and there's been some amazing fights or guys took on that mentality that's uh you know that's an it's an interesting it's an interesting thing the way people express themselves when they're doing what I think is like the most difficult athletic endeavor the way people get to express themselves do you decide just put on a show or do you side to be the stoic warrior you know who doesn't talk much and takes care of business it's interesting man like we were talking about Steve babe Miocic before the podcast I was going back and forth of steep a steep a sapphire man he's the heavyweight champion of the world and he's also a fireman he's the baddest man on the planet he's the UFC heavyweight champion the world he's smashing people he's also a fireman you know like that guy doesn't get enough love like that's the that's the heavyweight champion of the world it's crazy it's what a weird position that guy is in you know and it couldn't be nicer but you got to think what if he was like a crazy shit talker what if ste paimio chick was like Colby Covington just talking mad shit you know instead steep a shows up to knock people out and he looks like he's in at in line to like take the bus to get to work like he he barely looks like he's about to fight he has like the most Doh extra special before he fucks people up much like phaidor did he's got his own sort of version of that I was one of the more amazing things about phaidor his career was like he would be in the middle of a firefight just a full-on firefight and he never let his expression shift you never saw fade are like gritting his teeth and making a mean face phaidor didn't waste any energy maybe if he made one or two mean faces in his career I might have missed it but most of the time he would be in the middle of these fucking horrific wars and pride with like just dead face you know I mean he in hindsight especially since Caine's been injured so many times he in hindsight I think has to be recognized right next to far breezy over doom as the two greatest heavyweights of all time which Cain Velasquez's right in there that makes two and if he wasn't injured so much I think Cain is probably with the most difficult one for all of them he just was when he fought ver doom not making excuses for him but I think he really didn't have enough of an opportunity to adapt to the Mexico City altitude it's like extreme altitude and ver doom did a very wise thing he got up there way early and he lived up there even higher than Mexico City he lived up he set up his training camp like way in advance so he totally acclimated so for the first time in Kane's career somebody had a cardio advantage over him which was crazy and then on top of that for breezy over doom is just the nastiest submission artist in the history of the sport he tapped out Fedor Emelianenko he tapped out Minotauro Nogueira any type doubt Cain Velasquez those three guys have to be considered top three all-time so top three or five all-time guys maybe Taro's tap three of them excuse me for breezy over doom was tapped three of them Minotauro tapped a bunch of them to you know Minotauro when he tapped mark coleman that was gigantic for jiu-jitsu to show that a guy could tap somebody off of his back that was a UFC heavyweight champion and still a murderer like Mark hammer Coleman watch him in tutorial tap him was giant just gotta think of how good for doom is for doom tapped Minotaur oh he tapped cane and he tapped phaidor so for Colby to talk shit to him like Jesus - I want to see the rematch between for doom and steep a I hope they can make that if ver doom wins his fight he decided to take this fight on short notice fairly short notice for mark Marteen Marteen how do you say it Marcin Tabora who's very promising young guy and he was supposed to be fighting Mark Hunt which was gonna be a crazy strikers match I would imagine but Mark Hunt got pulled from the card there's some concern about something that he said in an interview and he said that the UFC is that they want to remove him because of his lawsuit and the UFC was like look we we've already paid you 1.6 million dollars since the lawsuit was filed like you fought for us and made a lot of money since then like we're not trying to stop you I believe that's what they said pretty sure I don't want I don't want to misquote that but the point is like they decided for whatever the reason was to remove Mark Hunt from the car and Fabricio moved right into it and it's right after he just submitted Walt Harris so for resale still in the mix and like having that quick win like that over hair it's got a nice submission beautiful armbar transition from the back it was just nasty his is just so high-level on the ground I don't think people understand or appreciate it he could do that to almost anybody the thing is like his level of jujitsu he he was a legitimate world champion in jiu-jitsu he won Abu Dhabi I mean Fabricio Werdum is just a straight-up killer his jujitsu is at such a high level still like most of the heavyweights that get on the ground with him are gonna be in deep fuckin water it's just the level of jujitsu that he has is so high they're like the average MMA practitioner you know that a high-level has a really good level of jujitsu but Fabricio Werdum is a guy that taps those guys like that's how good he is he if he gets anybody that's anywhere near his size on the ground that's competing in the heavyweight division there is a huge likelihood that he has a massive jiu jitsu advantage and until you've rolled with the guy who has a massive jiu jitsu advantage to you you don't realize like how big the difference between like him being 5% better than you him being 10% better hidden being 15% for appreci I was probably 20 to 30% better than anybody else in the division when it goes to the ground so it's even if you're good and strong and you're athletic and you're quick he puts the smush on you you stay smushed man I give the Brandon Vera fights a great example that Brandon Vera was a bad motherfucker and he's and he's good at the ground he knows how to fight he knows how to submit he knows that a kick box he was on fire at the time but for bricio put the smoosh down on him he got on top of him that mount was just inescapable and he starts smashing them Fabricio super underrated Jiu Jitsu I think even though people know it's a strong suit they know how badass he is when you watch like this shit that he can do there's not a whole lot of guys that are like that as a heavyweight there's not a whole lot of guys that have that kind of guard there's not a whole lot of guys that are just so dangerous from everywhere and his striking he's got really good too you got to think he knocked out Marc hunt with a flying knee you know and that's how he won the title he's a beast Fabricio Werdum is a fucking beast he just got super emotional when he fought steep Bay in Brazil and just really charged out I'm almost uncharacteristically aggressive and steep a just set it up and just dropped a bomb on him and knocked him out but steep I could do that to any living human any living human that chases steep a Miocic around like that and steep a can just stop and cork went on you as you're moving in the only one I think he might be able to take something like that was like a prime time mark hunt like prime time Mark Hunt had like the greatest job all time cro cop head kicked him full-on left high kick to the head and mark hunt like barely wobble little cuz I wobbled a little like he might have went down to one knee for a second and bounced back up like that would smash people most people got hit with that crow cop left high kick and it was night night but there's a video of it I'm pretty sure cro cop was wearing shoes I think he was wearing shoes when he had kicked him he's wearing shoes yeah that's crazy they let Mirko Cro Cop kick cock kick box with shoes on probably didn't give up fuck let's see that he's throwing kicks with that boom hits him in the head look what happens a little wobble that's it that's insane you have to know how insane that is folks you don't know I mean that is crazy Mirko Cro Cop puts everybody to sleep he didn't even make Mark Hunt sleepy that primetime Mark Hunt had the most ridiculous job of all time the most ridiculous ridiculous ability to take a shot I should say of all time because it wasn't just his jaw any worried he just could take a shot just insanely insanely tough for Beast over Dumke owed him so you have to realize you know we're talking about a a straight-up killer now and he's 40 it's interesting he says he says he feels great though with guys like that almost wish they could get him on some TRT he almost wished she was legal like there's only they could administer it monitor the levels because if Fabricio Werdum could do trt if we could have like TR TV tour type physique remember that does though those are the glory years of chaos the TR TV tour years if you get a trt ver doom holy shit son I mean goddamn that would be insane I wonder yeah there's TR TV tour and there's regular read tour with the cross on his head and then there's the first V tour which was probably like some other shit Vitor yeah crazy but that is prime man like when he knocked out Luke Rockhold or when he knocked out Michael Bisping or Dan Henderson in one round he's just terrifying he was just something different just smashing people in a way that like was kind of stunning like wow feetoes never been better he just understood more because he was older and experienced and then when they let him take tests his body was performing like a young guy's body so he has this young guys body but this old guys brain and he just has incredible confidence from all wars I mean he's been in there with so many just assassins and survived and lost and won you know I mean V Taurus it's been around forever so to see him on the TRT makes you go god damn man you're not supposed to say that you're not supposed to say that but here's one way that a company like Bellator or one of these other organizations could get ahead is if they allowed that I don't know how they do that I don't know if that has to be a State Athletic Commission thing but if there was a way where a Bellator decided listen let's be honest here fighters would be a much healthier be able to get through their training camp better feel more physically strong if we just allowed them to do just a little bit of TRT well do we'll monitor it we'll make sure everybody's okay extend the career of a lot of the older guys what's up with that Heavyweight Grand Prix they just announced a big tournament yeah they're doing some big crazy tournament Ryan Bader is gonna fight as a heavyweight King Mo's gonna fight as a heavyweight big country's in it Mitrione phaidor rampage Chael Sonnen xin it yeah it's gonna go like for a year they really I don't know I don't know what the schedule is I just saw the announcement for it the other day and I saw some pictures I was like shit yeah interesting huh a trio I like Ryan Bader as a heavyweight that could be interesting Ryan Bader were not having to cut any weight maybe even putting a little weight on fast as fuck man that might be his weight class who knows you know and Ryan Bader isn't that he's the Bellator champ down what happened the picture cut someone off isn't that Frank Mir I think the pictures Frank Mir how dare they cut Frank Mir off you sons of bitches you sons of bitches have some have some fucking respect whoever edited that shit have you heard any I haven't heard his name come up yet do you know that is Kyle Schneider he's a wrestler from Ohio State he won the gold medal in the Rio Olympics he's really young he's like 21 he won it he just won the 2017 Gold brento for a heavyweight to beat a Russian I guess he's I've seen his name pop up a little bit but I haven't heard any even thing about him training with a particular team I think he's done at Ohio State now he won back-to-back like doesn't want to fight MMA so I was just googling it that's why I was asking if you heard anything it said that he wants to fight in the UFC and do the 2020 Olympics damn East he'd have to be matched up carefully you know the thing about the 2020 Olympics like man I got to think that would take up all your time how would you have time to like kick box and learn submissions I don't know I mean he's a badass wrestler obviously yeah I don't know what he doesn't know or what he needs to well I think everything he escalates right everybody gets better I mean there's there's outliers in every generation like Michael Jordan type characters but I think in every sport people get better and it must be the case in wrestling too right it's got to be I would imagine I don't know what no I only wrestled for one year in high school and I quite honestly don't know enough about modern rap but I could always call Cormier up and he would school me on it but I think like if you look at the level like he's a put a great example look at the level of technical wrestling dollars that Cormier has in relationship to maybe some of the earlier days wrestlers you're talking about a completely different level like one of the reasons why Cormier has been successful is how technically is as a wrestler how good he is like his his wrestling is he it's like him Yoel Romero is probably number one like uol Romero meddled in pretty much every international match that he was ever in every international major tournament that he was ever and he meddled the alal Romero was like one of the scariest wrestlers it's ever done MMA for sure there's no doubt about it I mean he was the freak of freaks he beat Cael Sanderson twice and who's one of the greatest wrestlers ever I mean you know L Romero was a Greek anything I remember hearing him when I was growing up yeah I don't believe you ever fought him in May could pull that up find out that's true there was a fake MMA fight I found out that the Russian experiment did goddamnit what can I remember his name coaching after he wrestled yeah probably didn't probably decided not to what the fuck's that dude's name the giant guy the experiment can't believe his name slip of my the giant Russian dude the one I'm always talking about what how how does that happen where does a an idea go and just vanish no the Russian experiment he's the guy who lost a rule on garter gardener Jesus Christ I can't believe I can't remember his name this is so embarrassing now the guy right about with the red singlet keep going keep it right right right yeah that's him go to the webpage thank you Jesus Christ how come I was coming up with some weird fake Russian names we smoked pot before we did this I'm sorry sometimes it's not good for your memory there's a perfect example cuz Karelin is like a guy I've been a fan of his forever he's just one of the scariest human beings has ever lived I don't even know what my point was was my point about Karelin why would we bringing him up oh we had a fake fight he had an MMA fight and everybody was always like wow if that guy only fought MMA it would be fucking amazing and then he had like a pro wrestling match I don't believe it's not not saying it was like a fixed fight I'm think it was like a pro wrestling type situation and it just looked weird to watch but at the time I think before Rulon Gardner had beaten him he had won like who knows how many fucking matches in a row who's such a terrifying person he would scoop guys up by their waist and they would try to flatten out on their stomach to try to avoid being thrown they all received video hello did we blow out what happened there we go yeah all right we're back we had some issue I don't know what the fuck happened but we were talking about Josie aldo vs max Holloway to dos which is only happening because Frankie Edgar apparently got injured I do not know what the injury was do you know what the injury was I'm Jane do you disclose it there's a bunch of people that were talking shit online I was watching one of his Instagram pictures or as a video that he made a bunch of people called him a bitch for pulling out of the fight like these fucking kids I gave all the people to call a bitch Frankie Edgar is one of the biggest studs that's ever fought in MMA that guy's an animal he's I mean he's like one of the most durable tough and like mentally strong guys in the sport so when someone calls him a bitch it's it's it's actually hilarious it's like you read that like that is one of the craziest fucking things anybody could ever say you called Frankie Edgar a bitch like that isn't even making that's preposterous that's like saying Joey Diaz is a hot chick or something it's just what are you saying it doesn't even make any sense like if Frankie Edgar is a bitch do you know what kind of benchmark you have set like you have to be more of a man than Frankie Edgar or you're a bitch that is crazy we're all gonna be bitches we will all feel you're gonna look at a nation of bitches if that's what you're setting your bitch benchmark you're calling yourself a bitch for sure for sure because I guarantee you if Frankie Edgar is pulling out of a fight for an injury you would have pulled out quicker so you're more of a bitch than him you'd have to be there's no way you're less of a bitch or anything anything remotely close to him when you're talking about a guy who's a former UFC lightweight champion in a weight class that he barely even cut any weight for that was he would walk around at 155 and he won the title he beat BJ Penn like get the fuck out of here more than once the beat cubs wants I mean Frankie Edgar is a fucking monster he's an animal whoo he's the wrong guy to be calling a bitch she can't just it just shows you how ridiculous people are online Oh is Joe Noble you're getting it bro he's a bitch for pulling out I guarantee you that's not true I guarantee you if he pulled out of that fight it's because he's fucking injured period end of discussion he's not a bitch he's not afraid of anybody and that's not taking anything away from max Holloway who's fucking awesome max hallways a savage he's a killer straight-up killer and not even close to his prime max Holloway is a long way away from his prime he's way better now than he was when he first got into the UFC he's continued to get better with every fight now he's the champion he just stopped Aldo and then when they offered him the rematch because Frankie Edgar got injured they offered although the rematch so Aldo took it now it's going to be max Holloway versus Aldo - which is still a huge fucking fight and all those when he aldo got accepted max Holloway wrote on his Instagram it is what it is like no big deal well what are we gonna do like what you're about to fight the greatest featherweight of all time for the second time and he's like it is what it is like that's how badass he is he just figured if I fucked you up once I'm gonna fuck you up again like in his mind this is not a good fight which is hilarious that's that's what a beast max Holloway is that he's facing Jose Aldo and he's like it is what it is it's not what I was looking for yeah it is what it is what a beast he's a fucking killer that kid he's a killer it is what it is you're fighting Josey Aldo he's coming to get you because you knocked him out to win the belts he has a chance at revenge he's like he's an animal man fucking kids the real deal what's so exciting about him I said he's not even close to done you know he has massive potential and he could easily move up to 155 if he wanted to like if they could if say max Holloway wins this fight spectacularly and then starts talking a bunch of shit about Conor McGregor and then moves up to 155 I think max Holloway could easily compete in 155 you wanted to do some sort of unification bout I think that I'm not the unification bout but you know a champion versus champion bout I think for sure max Holloway could be competitive at 155 and max Holloway's only lost in his career mmm what's - Conor that's the only loss he has on his record that's what a badass he is and he was the only guy that went to decision Frankie Edgar released a statement after UFC 218 withdraw max I'll see you down the road what's the statement it's got a facial surgery to repair a facial injury it's a minor setback Oh start training in about six weeks I wonder what it is maybe it's a face problem bro it might be I'm just saying facial surgery can mean a lot of things you know it can mean you got something wrong with your jaw which is not good you could mean you got something wrong your cheekbone which is not good it could mean you got something wrong with your orbital which is not good or it can mean something I don't understand so if he's not concerned about it maybe it's something I don't understand maybe sound of broken something maybe like something was like detached or something need to be stitched back on yikes you think about all the elbows people have taken all the shit that gets displaced all over your face a John Wayne paar I sort of documented all the stitches that he's ever taken multiple time world Muay Thai champion just a fucking straight-up savage from Australia and John Wayne par was still fighting it's fighting for Bellator now it's one of the Bellator on the Bellator kickboxing roster but he's had God he's gonna be pissed at me for not remembering but I think he's had more than 300 stitches in his face he's like documented them - I think they did something which shows John Wayne par and it shows all the places and they put stitches on all the places where he's had actual stitches they're like you know dr. de min yeah the pictures just straight crazy you're like you are in a business that shreds your face yeah that's it right there that's all the different places in his body where he's been stitched up which is just incredible I mean you look at his face it's like a mask of stitches but he looks normal when you meet him they did a great job stitching him up I mean definitely looks like a guy you wouldn't fuck with you know you want to fuck what they do to us scars all over his face probably not a good move but couldn't be a nicer guy that was a fight that he had where his cornermen took that big cut on the side of his head and started making mouth things with it and talking that's how morose these guys get but you know he's he's still after it and that guy's you know I mean it comes to like the amount of facial damage that he's received and delivered delivered a lot of it to shitload of it oh no who's that Ron Stallings but first suffers nasty cut eyebrows hanging off that's the choirboy he's a very good fighter that sucks yeah there was a real bad one with Marvin Eastman Vitor Belfort hit Marvin Eastman with a flying knee not a flying knee but like jumped into it jumped knee and just smashed him in the forehead and cut his I hope I brought open terribly it was like this really long cut it was like oh my god yeah yeah that one pull that up yeah that is a enormous cut I mean literally I mean four inches long maybe third eye yeah like a huge third eyebrow going off his eyebrow and you see all the meat in there and everything and they have to stitch all that together I mean I don't know what happens with the muscles underneath it shit that one was bad what was that one is that it Marvin Eastman oh my god that's that other that last angle is even worse go to that one right next to that one yeah look that you see from that angle oh it literally looks like he got attacked by a machete like someone stuck a machete in his head yeah those are nasty I don't know how he got to that now he got on that we're talking about damage you know I don't know if we said enough about the the Goddard McGregor thing but it's it's always this is very disappointing I wish he hadn't done it but I get I get where he I get how he thought the fight was over I get why when he thought the fight wasn't over he was furious I get all of it it's just very uncomfortable and I think Goddard could not have handled himself better that guy is a fucking man I love the way handle it I love the way he wrote about it the way he wrote about was like so clear and so concise and it's the way he wrote about taking control like his job inside the cage when he was trying to do makes you realize what a great referee he really is like how he's taking everything into consideration and following the rules even in the middle of chaos but you got to do you got to do it's fucking tough job that is one of the toughest jobs in sports to be a referee in a professional MMA fight it's one of the toughest jobs in sports there's so much craziness going on and it's so dangerous if someone loses the moment between someone getting hit and Kayode and being okay the two taking five six seven eight unanswered blows and not being okay there is a difference there's a big difference and a great referee is very very important and it's so subjective it's so hard to decide when a guy's done and how do you know and you take into consideration how tough the guy is cuz like Frankie Edgar can survive past the lands of doom where most people drown in their own fear he survives past that and comes back and can win there's guys like him and then there's some guys and once they get hit and once they get hurt they're just they their ability to recover is not the same and I don't know what it is I don't know if it's just the person who recovered didn't fight someone who hits hard enough or in the correct places to do enough damage where they couldn't return or if they're so damn tough it doesn't matter who hits them or where they hit them they figure out a way to make it back it's who knows there's a lot of arguments on both sides but man you got to take into consideration like if you're watching say a Frankie Edgar Gray Maynard fight and you go oh my god this could be stopped at any moment can be stopped but it wasn't stopped and Frankie came back to win you had a draw on one fight one on a second fight and the second fight where he won by knockout it was arguably even crazier because Gray Maynard was fucking him up in the first round again like gray Manor was a beast and he was huge for 155 but Frankie Edgar got through that storm some guys wouldn't have and some referees would have stopped that fight and I don't know who's right that's I want to be really honest about this I have no idea who's right I don't know what the right move is I don't know if the right move is to let a guy fight and let him recover and and give him every chance he can to win that fight even if it makes him take unnecessary damage give him the benefit of the doubt or err on the side of caution and safety and different fighters would have a different opinion you know there's there's there was this archaic idea for a long time that is pretty much since been abandoned but the idea was that if you tap from strikes you're a bitch it was a real thing you know that people would stick in George st. Pierre's face because he tapped with strikes to Matt Serra Matt Serra was just blasted him and he was on top blasting I mean George knew he was going out so he just he had a tap Matt Serra was a ko artist too he could hit fucking hard but when you tap two strikes if you you know if you know that you're not going to recover I think it's a smart move I think we have the wrong way of looking at it if we denigrate just to talk shit I know it's that I don't you know you're testing some courage but I think between fighters there should be a difference between the shit-talking that fighters engage in and then the way that other people analyze the actual sport itself because I think if you analyze the actual sport itself you can't see anything wrong with tapping the strikes if you're just you're a pundit you're a sideline err you're an MMA fan you're in my opinion if you really trust the guy's judgment as a champion and as a high-level fighter like George st. Pierre is you can't be upset if she taps the strikes it's cuz he's getting fucked up and he knows it like the you wanna you and Jay check she said she didn't tap the strikes she said she was moving her hand around it looked like a tap to me she was getting smashed though she might not have even known she was tapping she might have been in a memory short-out circuit where she's getting blasted blasted blasted so if she even remembers tapping who knows she's getting cracked man I mean she got clipped with that left hand and then Rose gets on top of her and starts dropping haymakers on her just boom boom boom boom and you see her reach over and tap right as the referee gets in and rescues her and she might not have meant it she might have been just you gotta realize when you're getting smashed in the face like that everything is chaos it's fireworks and sparks and every situation is different in one situation you might have a guy who's fully aware of what's happening and knows exactly what he's doing he's getting bombed on but he can get through it versus a person who gets hit and from the very first shot they don't know what the fuck is happening they're just on queer Street they're Gon's Ville they don't know where they are they're like whoa and you can't see it from the outside the only person who knows is the person that's getting a hit and the only person who knows their ability to recover now how much is that is psychological how much that is their fighting spirit how much of it is physiological guesswork no one knows it's a combination of all those things for sure 100% because you can't just have the physical and you can't just have the mental if you have the mental and someone has the physical way better than you you have to have all of it that's a big there's a the the idea that any person could be an MMA champ it's like oh I don't know because everyone that's a champ is fucking super exceptional if it's not just physically it's physically and mentally like it's not an easy game it's a crazy fucking sport and who knows if you want to chapt it looked like she tapped who knows if she realized what was going on you know did you see that thing about that football player that was diagnosed with CTE for the first time while he was alive we sort of glossed over it when we were talking to Dan Carlin this is the first time a living football player has been diagnosed with CTE there unnamed mm-hmm yeah I wouldn't want people know I guess man they're saying that even high school kids have it but high school kids who play a lot bang heads a lot you're gonna get it like that is that is so hard to deal with you think about how many people play football how many people box how many people fight how many people are gonna walk out of that thing does Gon's ville and how many people are gonna be really clever like Mighty Mouse and avoid the damage and just have a technical understanding of like where to be and where not to be what's coming next how to keep somebody thinking how to overload this their their mind with possibilities you know it's like you've got two different styles you got that style did the super technical upper echelon of MMA where he's like gets super aggressive and picks up his pace towards the end of the fights and wind up finishing guys just add up just excellence like that crazy suplex to armbar thing that he did on ray goddamn it what's his name ray Borg the Tazz Mexican devil I fucked that up all the time and when I do the weigh-ins I call them the Tasmanian devil it just comes down to my mouth like an idiot but Rey Borg who's a very good fighter and very tough and fast man when Mighty Mouse just put it on a most like you're watching an artist you're watching someone who's just clearly head and shoulders technically above anyone in this division that's why this fight that TJ's asking for it gets really interesting TJ Dillashaw versus Mighty Mouse is gonna be one of the greatest fights of all time if they could pull it off if they actually wind up making that fight holy shit will I be excited I'll be so excited cuz I think this would be the first time in a long time where Mighty Mouse has been challenged I mean you got challenged by ian ian mccall had him in a really bad spot he certainly been challenged by other fighters you know he's certainly like fought fighters early in his career where he had like really good fights with them joseph benavidez but at the stage that he's at now he's like he's so fucking he's so advanced that I think it takes someone like a TJ Dillashaw like a real super confident world champion killer to give him the fight that we need to see cuz if TJ really can make 125 and he says he really can make 125 then holy shit what a fight that is ooh that's a good fight because TJ will have a giant power advantage right I mean TJ's knocked out Hannon barão TJ's knocked out Cody Garr Brandt his last fight TJ avoided all all the chaos that John linacre brings into the cage TJ avoided all that he shut him down like TJ right now is operating at a real high world championship level and the only fight that he lost he lost to Dominick Cruz by the narrowest of margins some people don't even feel like you've lost that fight there was an argument that if you look at the damaging blows that he landed more damaging blows to Dominick picture particularly if you factor in it the leg kicks so it's it's arguable that that was it at the very worst a draw that is such a close fight to call that's arguable or you could argue the Dominic one too but the point is he's a legit world championship caliber fighter like TJ is a fucking killer he's a killer what he did to Henin barão is insane and then what he just did to Kody coming off the deck and kale and Cody garb rant like that that's fucking insane - he's in rare form so him versus Mighty Mouse is the fight that's the fight we go holy shit which one of these guys is arguably the best fighter in the world cuz right now we think it's Mighty Mouse but that's that thing always moves up and down like who's the best fighter and you know that always moves around like when Jon Jones wins and knocks out Daniel Cormier you go damn you almost want to give it to John like he's in a deeper shark pond you know there's more killers he's fighting Cormier who's just as good as they get after beating Rumble after holding the title and John kom you got cap and you almost have to give it to John but then John tests positive see like what the fuck man so here's the heat right it's John and DJ right Demetrius is probably my ideas number one and John is in this situation where he's probably gonna get suspended or something but then you got probably TJ if not George st. Pierre just be moved up on the official list so you go to number one number two of course that's interesting you give him that with one fight against Michael Bisping that just shows you how badass you have to be to step in and fight Michael Bisping after Michael Bisping knocks out Luke Rockhold after he'd beaten Anderson Silva defends his title against Dan Henderson he just jump in there and beat him and then jump to number two and the pound-for-pound rankings like quartz welcome back man it's crazy so what do you think about all that stuff they're having all this these conversations about who's ranking the fighters and that the organization shouldn't be able to rank the fighters like do it shouldn't be able to make the matches it's done technically right now through writers write mostly writers is it I think you can see who the writers are right who writers voting panelist I'm sorry but they're all people from let's see like yeah but at the end of the day the UFC decides what they're gonna do listen George st. Pierre is gonna fight Michael Bisping shot the fucker so it's gonna compare it to to something I came out this week the way at the college football runs their big playoff is they have a panel that takes into account all of the official rankings that are done a couple computer rankings but then at the end of the thing it's still the seven or eight people are gonna decide that this team is ranked over this team and it really comes down to money dick the matchups they want to see and what they can sell in ads but they don't officially say that it just creates more post like why did they do this we don't understand it and they won't yeah well it's the UFC has the ability to do whatever it wants and they're in a situation and this here's the argument for it they're in a situation where they just bought this organization for four billion dollars they need to make money motherfucker so think I have tyron woodley fighting ideas like hey that's gonna do some pay-per-view numbers and it will that's an interesting fight I like to see it I like to see I like to see how Nate deals with the biggest fastest welterweight in the division the biggest knockout artist Walter Wade in the division I mean there's no doubt about at tyron woodley is a tank he's a tank who throws getting missiles your way boom boom and he's got it very tactical people got mad at him for those two wonder boy fights but I I suggest that they don't truly appreciate what those fights represented they represented extreme consequences for any mistake you're fighting a guy who's like one of the best counter strikers on the planet Earth in wonder boy he's one of the sneakiest slipperiest strikers in the sport he moves like a world champion karate guy who also has takedown defense and he's got a ton of experience in MMA now and he just fights weird he throws front leg roundhouse kicks to your face he jumps in and hits you with shots you don't see coming cuz he like has that blitz karate style that he employs sometimes very difficult to hit his hands are always down low and Tyron managed to not just beat him and they were boring fights I'm not gonna lie to you they were boring fights but they weren't boring to me while they were happening it was boring in terms of the overall result because it was a five round decision we're not a lot of exchanges took place but it wasn't boring when I was watching it and this is why it's cuz now that you know that what how it ended you'll just sit through the fight and go oh my god this is boring but when you don't know what is gonna happen they don't know either and they're making these decisions and they're so evenly matched that they're cancelling each other out and Tyron is doing a very smart thing by not engaging and he's not doing too much because if he does too much it leaves these openings and he doesn't want to even remotely risk that he's going to put himself in a position where he gets open and wonderboy catches him so he makes wonderboy do all the leading and then when the bombs get dropped on both occasions tyron woodley was the one that hurt wonderboy which is crazy when you think that wonderboy is one of the best kick boxers it's ever fought in MMA he had some insane kickboxing record I want to quote it out of the top of my head I think was 57 and oh he's 50 70 though as a kickboxer this is a guy that George st. Pierre said was the best striker that he's ever sparred with that's how goddamn good Wonder Boy is he's he's he's another level striker and those two fights between tyron woodley and Wonder Boy essentially were striking exchanges for the most part except for the first fight the first fight tyrant did get him in a guillotine for a while and it looked like he was burning his arms out you know like you couldn't believe that wonderboy got out of it but the point is the in the points in the moments of the fight where one fighter was in trouble it was always Wonder Boy and that's enough in my eyes to give tiring the decisions for sure just just that if we want to look at what is a fight I think the current system of like ten points nine points it's too flawed it's a we adopted this from boxing we should have a way more comprehensive system and I think it should be a system that's probably over a hundred points or up to a hundred points rather that you you have points for significant moments in the fight like maybe significant moments when someone gets dipped that accounts for a certain amount of points significant moments where a person almost gets submitted and figures out how to power out that accounts for a certain amount of points do they power out and wind up reversing the position because that should be worth a certain amount of points you know there should be at a cumulative effect it shouldn't be just like you won or you won should be like how do you know who won like can we look at the stats can we look at the numbers and then can we look at it from an expert point of view because every punch does not have the same impact that other punches do every kick does not have the same impact of other kicks do and every submission doesn't have the same probability of succeeding so if you're watching all these things happen you need real world-class experts to assess what's happening at any stage of the fight look you should the only people should ever judge a fight are guys like Matt Hume who used to judge for pride guys like Duke Rufus like world-class guys for rasa hobby we could you could get that level of martial artists to judge fights and I think you would have the opportunity to create a totally new system that's not boxing base because the 10-point must system is just so flawed have a new system and just only have high-level world-class martial artists and nothing less do all the judging because they'll understand what the difference is between someone just taking somebody down and someone taking something down and threatening them someone who's on the bottom was winning with elbows or was threatening with submissions maybe they understand how close these submissions are some people don't know what triangles locked up until it's a fucking tap you know there's if you've never sparred a day in your life and you watch someone who's tapping someone with a wrist lock you're not gonna know what the fuck is happening you're just not most likely unless you're a real aficionado that's just never physically practiced it most of the people that are referees unfortunately or I should say judges is a lot of them I don't most of them a lot of them are real martial artists 100% but there's quite a few that we're sort of grandfathered in from boxing and they don't necessarily know a whole lot about MMA now this is not representative of the vast majority but I see them every now and then and some of them are very nice people and I say hi Mike how you doing I mean we're just talking disagreements on things and maybe different levels of appreciation for what's happening but some we get every now and then you get a decision where everybody looks at everybody what in the fuck does that just say like everybody you mean everybody look over at Tony I look over at John Eric he'll look over at me I look over at daniel cormier he'll look over at me and like what the fuck that shouldn't happen that shouldn't happen when all the experts are in agreement that this is a bad decision no no we're not talking about like debatable moments like there's fights where you look at I go man I could see the argument for this guy winning and then the other guy could say well I see the argument for that guy winning and I'll be like damn you got a point you know Brendan I will do that all the time he'll make an argument for why he thinks that Connor won the second fight easy and I'll make an argument like I don't know man I don't know about all that I mean what we're not using the same system back then when someone got dropped it's not an 8 a 10 8 thing right it's not like they don't give away ten eight rounds it's quickly back down I'm pretty sure that was the old rules was it not god damn it I should know that yeah anyway point being some people think Nate could have got to draw on that fight and like maybe maybe it wasn't far enough away where you couldn't see that it was one of those with a bow maybe this has been a bunch of fights like that and I could see the argument for Connor winning a hundred percent he hit him quicker faster harder won the first rounds bigger you know but man oh no we're adding points if you're just doing his ten nine thing and then occasionally ten eight but now most of the states are adopting the full new MMA regulations and as they do that we're gonna get a much better we're gonna be much better range of rounds like what would around scores ass which is a good step it's a good step in the right direction I just think it is an incredibly critical part of the sport is who judges the decisions and then again is not to disparage anybody's currently doing it but I think it is a position that should be held in the highest of esteem right up there with referee I think this position is is it's crucial for the future of the fighters it's crucial for the legitimacy of the sport itself because when bad decisions happen people get angry and they question whether or not the sport is legitimate and that's dangerous to the respect that the athletes face like here's a perfect example Canelo Alvarez versus Gennady golovkin everybody was a boxing fan I was good not illegal f1 that fight unless you're a huge Canelo fan and you just you're just absorbed in Canelo you love him if you watch that fight golovkin seem to control way more of the fight than Canelo did it didn't mean the Canelo didn't win rounds didn't mean canal didn't land good shots but he lost he it seemed to me that he lost and they didn't give it to him golovkin didn't get the decision it was a draw and people were watching it going what the fuck and that's what Brendan called in advance Brendan Schaub called it in advance he's like unless golovkin wins by knockout he's never winning in decision and I go you really think so he's like fuck yeah he nailed it he totally nailed it when that when they read the draw I put my hands on my face like Macaulay Culkin and home alone and oh oh you fucked him you fuck you not eagle of kid Oh what do you think of that you said when I bid the instant replay as I think it was the first time at the UFC in New York it's a good move man they keep doing that or is that only a one-time kind of thing mm I don't know they should keep doing it know wasn't Walt Harris right which fight wasn't it they said they did it because of the Massassi Weidman fight right they used it I guess it got used though during those two fights right yeah it was the Walt Harris fighting there was the other fight oohs Damir yeah yeah yeah so I came into play and was used yes yes it was well all Harris things very unfortunate he had kicked that dude but the other one owes Damir got knocked out by who was a gentleman owes to me was fighting don't try to remember hook it up lost then you came in and told him that he didn't actually lose yeah is that the duty thoughts a beast this is a weird time weird time for the sport man like this is like a transitionary period I feel like and Connor is such a gigantic star that he's almost eclipsed the sport who was it it wasn't oh volcon goes to Mears the guy was gonna fight that's hilarious just pull up the last card yeah it's not Alexei Olynyk yeah Curtis blades beat the shit out of him yeah that's right Curtis blades is a really interesting prospect is a big big kid he's super athletic and he threw an illegal kick but it literally just touched the ear that was the god beer won't hear that was the illegal kick that was God beer Walt Harris yet the other one was the doctor stoppage right but wasn't there something that happened in that fight that was also controversial I think he was beating him up and then there was a who did god beer fight he fought Walt Harris he got head kicked right yeah God forgot the win on right but then when Curtis blades he accidentally kicked him in the ear or he just touched his ear referee stopped the fight after blades delivered an illegal kicked down the ponent yeah doctor called in to check hmm see that that kick barely touched his ear he was already done yeah he was hurt and really bad Curtis was putting a beating on him and when he went down Curtis threw this wild kick and just touched I mean literally touched his ear it did not hit him but the referee saw the contact and then it went to the instant replay to make sure that he was okay but as soon as the referee saw the instant replay is like okay clear he's okay but the doctors looked at him and they asked him like this guy's fucked up like this is this fights over and I think he said that it was over he said he couldn't continue I was bringing that up to begin with do you know how the instant replay works no like did they all just get into a huddle and watch the video or is there someone the referee probably watches it and they probably watch it with like Mark Ratner one of the officials you know and they look at it and make an informed decision you know and I don't know what the parameters of that are no know who gets the call but I would imagine it's a group I would imagine there's very little disagreement when someone's looking at film like that because they're not biased they don't I mean these guys are the if you have John McCarthy and Herb Dean they're looking at film I guarantee you they're gonna agree on what it is and it's there's a lot of debate dispute about that kind of shit you know it's it's really important to have those guys that really completely on top of the rules like there was one fight where Tim means fought cowboy Olivera and he hit him while he was down remember that and we were trying to figure out whether or not it was legal and I believe it was Dan Merck leotta and we even got mark Ratner on the air and Mark Ratner thought it was a legal knee because he was down on one knee with one foot and no hands he said under the new rules that would be legal and Big John McCarthy says no it's not if anything from your feet other than the soles of your feet are down on the ground you're still a downed opponent I was like oh so he had to explain it to me after the fight because everybody was calls it three points of contact but Olivera literally did not have a foot on the ground he just had his knee his foot was up in the air and his other foot was touching the ground and he got kneed in the face and we got kneed in the face they said it was an illegal knee and we were like how is that the case because there's there's only two points of contact there's the knee and the foot like you're not talking about Nia foot in the hand it's just two points of contact but apparently it can't be anything other than the ball your feet what it could be is you have the both balls your feet down on the ground but you have one hand down that's three points of contact and under the new rules that would be legal under the old rules if you touch the ground at all it's illegal super confusing right so in that one it was really important to have a referee like Big John waiting right there yeah see he smashes him like see how he's got yeah the knee means more than one right that's what they're going with well I think when it landed that right foot was elevated and was off the ground then something similar happened where the guy delivering the knees like lifted him up off the ground yeah get him off the ground yes yeah guys have done that to lift him up off the ground and slam knees into their body because they were touching with their hands you can do that that's legal it is a weird rule and it's a rule that we're gonna have to figure out what makes sense because the knees to the head do a downed opponent I feel like that almost makes sense because that is a real legitimate move and if someone can do that to you why is that different is it too easy like why is that different than being able to elbow someone in the face when they're on the ground because it hits harder is that what it is okay so it's better so I can't use it cuz it's better so you can just elbow me all day long in the face but you can't knee me in the head and put me out of my face I don't know who's right or who's wrong but it's an effective martial arts technique and they've eliminated it supposedly for the safety of the fighters but you got to figure out like what's legal and what's not legal like here's another thing this is a fascinating fight that just took place between Matt Brown and Diego Sanchez crazy wild fight as long as it lasted Matt Brown lands this fucking beautiful elbow knee palms away and just boom drops his beautiful elbow on him I mean it was just picture-perfect and Diego goes limp like a sniper just shot him from the sixth-floor depository I mean it was perfect it's like the perfect ko but Diego was complaining that it was the back of the head but here's the thing nobody gives a shit if it's the back of the head if you're standing up watch this boom look how he goes limp I mean that is Diego Sanchez a fucking warrior dude for him to go limp like that look at this boom totally on the back of the head but that's okay when you're standing up that's it's weird if you punch something in the back of the head like when Matt Serra fought George I'm pretty sure some of those shots he blasted him with you hit him in the back of the head might even been the first one because if you're swinging sometimes and your hand goes around like your hand hits the back of the head all the time head kicks head kicks hit the back of the head all the time like if you neck kick somebody like if you go over it like say if someone's standing with their left shoulder to you if you go over that left shoulder and drop down with that kick that neck kick shit that a lot of time goes in the back of the head it's a lot of times where it's landing it's coming around you're coming over the shoal you're literally slamming your foot the instep right into the back of that dude's head and that's a hard fucking impact from a leg happens all the time it's totally legal it's weird because if you get on the ground they're gonna watch the back of the head watch the back of the head like even from the mount I mean even for the guard rather if you're in someone's guard you're punched and watch the back of the head everybody's watching the back of the head how about protect the back your head no let's just watch your eyes what don't hit the eyes you don't say it don't hit the eyes but the back of the heads off limits it seems like a good spot to hit could we do it I mean well it's so dangerous it's everything's dangerous this is fighting this is MMA look it's we shouldn't you know what works the best if you can elbow someone in the back of the head sometimes how can we can't do it all the time I'm not saying that anybody to change that result the result was perfect Matt Brown by KO I'm not saying that what I'm saying is open it up let guys do with whatever they want to do and no gloves I'm tired of saying this take the gloves away no wraps no hand wraps that would save a lot you would not be able to get away with nearly as much everybody would look like John Wayne par though you'd be all cut up but I just think it's more realistic it's just so weird to me if you put pads on your knuckles but you're allowed to elbow someone in the eyeball what oh you're protecting your hands oh that seems like cheating you should be like if you only hit someone with your hands so hard that should be how hard you can hit them shouldn't be able to fucking put them in a cast I mean that's what you're doing you put him in like a soft leather covered cast that's what that margarita fight was you know when margarita got busted with shane mosley when they found some mat in his gloves it took it too far that's what it is you're you're making it so you can hit someone harder it hurts almost as much doesn't have the sharpness to it that someone has when they hit you with bare-knuckle bare-knuckle house like a sharpness but the amount of power that someone can generate just with no regard to their own safety is more they can swing drop bombs on you did he get caught because of that picture because I saw it and I do not know did they see it there you can see it there I mean it's hard to tell what kind of they're oaken that's what that can you make that bigger that's it's hard to tell what that is that could just be the gauze that's all wet I mean it's after the fight like Craig looks like it cracked I guess that's what they're trying to say is it whoa really I mean I don't know that God shouldn't crack like that right I should rip yo imagine if that's the case what if it really did turn to like hard shit like real plaster whoa I don't know how they found it I mean how did he get caught I don't know either I think they someone from because that's how you catch Sugar Shane Mosley's team watched him watched him wrap his hands I think you're allowed to rap watch your opponent wrap their hands and he noticed something in the raps and had it pulled out so then everybody decided that that's what he had been doing his whole career which is why he had been smashing people because he had been smashing a lot of people he just had more power more pop his loaded gloves prior to the 2009 Sugar Shane Mosley Antonio Margarito fight Mosley's trainer Nazim Richardson was in the Margarito dressing room so he could observe Margarito's hands getting rapped prior to putting on boxing gloves as Margarito's trainers we're wrapping their fighters hands Richardson noticed what appeared to be a plaster of Paris powder on the wraps Don Tom Tom the plaster of Paris hardens when it comes into contact with moisture and any fighter will sweat during the course of a fight oh shit as soon as Richardson saw the substance he accused Margarito of fighting with loaded gloves Margarito's hands were rewrapped and Mosley hammered Margarito he did - he beat the shit out of him that day I bet that dude felt guilty knowing that you were gonna try to fight a world champion like Sugar Shane with you yeah that's not good but I think that bare-knuckle would be different I think it would be better for submissions for sure way easier to secure chokes your hand slip behind things way easier when there's no gloves and it'd be way harder to hit somebody you you would have a really hard time if someone ducked and you hit the top of their forehead you could easily break your hand like people break their hands all the time that way Oh what else do I want to talk about I think that might be it dude we covered it all Oh aldo max Holloway we covered that a little bit I want to see if although still can compete at a world-class level and improve because you know that he can compete at a world-class level you've seen the last few fights that he's had he still mean other than the fight that he had with Connor where Connor starched him did he fight Frankie Edgar right after he fought Connor I believe he did I believe that's who he won the title from is that who it was yeah and he out boxed him you know he fought a guy in max Holloway that's at the top of his game top of his game for now and with more height to come but I mean he's just peeking he's ramping it up right now max is a fucking beast so it's interesting to see whether or not aldo can recover and he doesn't have a full camp for this fight either you know he had to take this fight on I want to say four weeks notice see if that's true but I think max Holloway is one of the best up-and-coming fighters for sure in the world a world champion when I say up-and-coming I mean I've been coming in like the pound-for-pound sort of away I mean he's just got greatness written all over him if he just keeps up with this pace and he's got the attitude he's got the skills he's a straight killer but you can't look past an old warrior like Aldo not saying that he is I bet he's not but everybody else can't look past it either although still fucking super dangerous he's gonna be real motivated and a win by Aldo would be two gigantic at this stage of the game if although could bounce back the way he bounced back from the mcgregor fight and outbox Frankie if he could bounce back in some way figure out what he did wrong in that first fight and solve the puzzle oh that's big that's a big fight and the other fight we talked about tyron woodley and Nate Diaz that's the other one that's crazy five days ago I found that says he was supposed to fight Ricardo Lamas two weeks later now he's been bumped up to this so it was only five days ago they made that fly so yeah whoa and so he only has two weeks then yeah so yeah November 11th she that's confirmed auto replace Frankie Edgar so I guess that was when they announced that Jesus Christ that's crazy well I hope he's training a lot I hope he's in great shape I hope the weight cut isn't too much either cuz he's a big guy at least he was for a while he leaned out quite a bit I think he was having a really hard time making that cut from like well into the like he looked like he's about 170 something and they would cut down to 145 and real hard for him he would suffer in the last round of fights like if he didn't smoke guys early on sometimes he faded towards the end like he did with Ricardo Lamas like the end of the fight Lamas was on top of him like he had done enough to win for sure but at the end he was fading he's getting tired and I think a big part of that was probably just getting the water sucked out of you you know those guys they torture themselves man the card for this weekend dun dun dun dun for Dumon Tabora is interesting I like that Tim means and Balaam ahamed that's a serious fight some good fights on that card alright and that is when Saturday Saturday night in Australia oh shit Australia I'll be in I'm gonna be in Phoenix I'm gonna be in Phoenix Arizona I'm gonna get to see my Goldberg I haven't seen my kid forever he's killing it in Bellator man I like the fact that Bellator exists you know I love the UFC the UFC is my home I'm not doing commentary for anybody ever the UFC is like family to me but I think competition is important I think it's important for everything I think the system's competing with each other makes them greater I think the more opportunities that young fighters have to perform and fight in the more you're gonna see higher and higher level of ability and performance level of fighting knowledge just this more competition is a higher level for the UFC it's higher level for Bellator everybody's gonna accelerate this is a growing thing right now and as long as you're not competing with each other on the same night they don't do anything dumb and that fights in the same night I think they complement each other I really do I think there's some fighters that would do better in Bellator I think there's some fighters that prefer to be in the UFC it's all good man it's all good you know the UFC has way more world-class fighters but Bella tours got some tough motherfucker some real legit world-class fighters too now and there the rosters growing like Rory MacDonald was one of the best fucking welterweights on the planet and he's over there now I hope we get him back I really do I love commentating his fights Lorenz Larkins over there now Lamas is like there's a there's a bunch of guys Diego Lima I think Lima is or Douglas Lima is one of the best fucking Walter waits on a planet for sure his brother Diego I think it's still fighting for the UFC but there's a bunch of talent over there now like real legit talent it's good it's good for everybody it's good for the sport gives people opportunities makes people raise their games up for the athletes the more Michael Chandler's are out there the boogieman in the woods Michael Chandler is a boogeyman 155-pound division he's terrifying for everybody doesn't matter what organization you fight for that guys have a straight-up killer so this like there's enough really dangerous world-class fighters over there in Bellator for it to be excitingly competitive for everybody I think it's good and I like the gold he's got a gig because I love him so I think that's it I think we did more than an hour we're gonna call it the hour but I'm a mouth motherfucker and I can't stop talking I don't feel the need to apologize for anything I said I don't think I fucked up and offended anybody if I did I'm gonna blame it on the weed anything to add young Jamie nope I think that was a good first episode one I think we'll do this more often okay I'm not I'm not guaranteeing every week but we'll keep it close all right bye-bye you
