hey everybody its Joe Rogan and this is my podcast and this is the new way I'm gonna do my commercial now cuz I can't keep saying it the same fuckin way but it turns a regular way halfway through it somewhere along the line I give up I always give up our podcast is sponsored by on it which is essentially a vitamin supplement and fitness company it's a company that I am a part of I own a part of the company the reason being that I got involved in it and I believe in that the ethics of the company and I believe what they're selling we sell the best quality nutrients some of them in nootropics some of them their sports exercise ones like shroom tech sport alpha brain is the the famous nootropic one we also sell hemp protein powder with maca and raw cocoa it's fucking fantastic stuff kettlebells and battle ropes it's all essentially fitness and like lifestyle and health supplements and it's all stuff that I believe in it's all stuff that I've always been taking like long before I ever got involved in this company so um if you if you're interested in it if you're interested in nootropics uh very controversial area good I want to just go to Google and just Google the word nootropics and oo TR OPI see it's all about supplementation to enhance brains ability to produce neurotransmitters so very complicated stuff and that's what I need a retard like me should not be really talking about it because I don't really know what I'm saying you know I'm saying I'm just like repeating scientific shit that out of it but I believe that if you believe in it I actually would take that to heart because you you actually don't really I don't know your finances but you don't seem like you need a lot of money but you were on a network hosted network TV show for a lot of years you were a star of talk radio news radio and everything well I'm also an idiot I could have spent that money I could cut right through that shit folks yeah he's got gold buddhas um yeah this I would never get involved with anything that I don't believe in I just would I don't have I don't have another life to live just got one and while I'm already ahead and I'm you know I'm not a I'm not worried about paying my bills and everything's going well the last thing I'll ever do is get involved in anything that I I didn't really that's not true though because I did do Fear Factor again for another term but you got a really I really like those guys that I worked with those years phonetically that's why and I would be sick if I saw somebody else doing it I really would have that even though that show was retarded that was my baby yeah I did 148 of those fucking things um but uh there's no way I would be involved in a company company unless I believed in it and everything that we sell it on it is all stuff that I use in my daily life that I've talked about long before I got involved in this company especially kettle bells which I feel are the the best is as far as like strength and conditioning if I pick one exercise I think kettlebells is like the best piece of exercise equipment that you can have it's like a cannon ball that's got a handle on it and it's all about controlling this fucking cannon ball and they come in a bunch of different sizes I use sometimes as light as 35 pounds sometimes 50 pounds sometimes 70 pounds and they give you amazing workouts that directly apply to jiu-jitsu for me but for any athletic endeavor where you would it relies on explosiveness and and and muscle power and it's all exercises that make your body move as one complete unit as opposed to like isolation exercise was a lot of people do at the gym when you see them lifting weights this is something where your entire body like there's things called Turkish get ups when you hold this weight up you're lying on your back and then you slowly and controlled least and all the way up to your feet and then bring it all the way back down it's a really odd thing you would think but it's really applicable for like strength and fitness in real-world athletic pursuits and even just for picking shit up and even if just for having a strong body it's better to have a strong body than a weak ass bitch body there I said it alright unless you date like girls are like bisexual they tend to like the bitch body look do they really like that to grocery by sexually like like a Oh like that guy that's not guy like right that's too much of a gamble to my secret yet she's gonna get for a niche market I say you could probably get them anyway if you bulked up anyway of supplements go to goto on accom use the codename Brogan and you will save 10% off any and all the supplements the kettlebells and the battle ropes that shit does not work on we sell them as cheap as we can in there you know especially the kettlebells it's very difficult it's like you're sending cannonballs through the mail but there is durables fuck and they'll be here forever alright that's it Mike Birbiglia is here Birbiglia excuse me Mike or Biglia pitch al fucking Hyperion's join my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day sorry this commercials are brutal it's interesting to me that it's like something that I not I've never investigated I've always just kept at arm's distance that kind of knew treated the nutrients and the vitamins and things like that I've just I don't understand it I'm not gonna go near it but you and I've listened and watched this podcast you seem to know a good bit about it well I know my from my personal experience it makes a big difference for me what I eat if I like if I really concentrate on like the most important thing I think is nutrients from food that's the most important thing you gotta eat healthy food and then supplementation on top of that so we have to have the actual neutral what do you eat for lunch today this morning I had to have protein shake I only ate once I just had a hemp protein shake whereas banana coconut oil and I had two cigarettes and coconut water ya know I I don't eat I don't need heavy in the mornings I really light in the morning you just have a shake or have a kale shake that's my most common thing that I have I'm just if I'm lazy or if I'm running out the door and I have time to make it but it takes a few minutes to make it's I have to clean the kale and clean celery and cucumbers and then I take chunks of ginger and raw garlic and it's a thing called a fuck what is the name of the blender it's a bad ass blender but it's specifically designed for this purpose yeah it's got like a plunger and shove everything in there makes is that it Vitamix yes that is it thank you and it fucking whips it down to like a drinkable consistency yeah put like pineapple in it to make it taste good and it's fucking great man it doesn't taste that good but for your body it's great you know it gives you just like this charge of like good stuff it's like your body knows it's got all these nutrients to work with but is there an inherent contradiction with because I know that you're you know you do the ultimate fighting stuff yeah is that what it is LTS all over yeah it's called the Ultimate Fighting Championship but that seems to be people murdering people like other people slamming on your making it so that your health is no longer a possibility you can look at it that way and then that is certainly part of it but what it also is is competition in the highest and most dramatic form sure for that a human being can see other than war right the way the Olympics is I mean it's not that healthiest thing to be an Olympic gymnast yeah maybe but this is even worse because this is another person dominating you yeah you know the the idea of losing in gymnastics is you know I'm sure a cruel bitch after years and years of practice and you slip when you land yeah but it's nothing like getting your ass kicked yeah there's nothing like getting just the fuck beat out of you in front of the world and there's the motions that are involved in out of control the would where the place to look is to look at the very very best guys yeah if you look at the very like the guys like Anderson Silva you know he's this insanely good fighter he's insanely good but such a nice guy like a sweetheart of a guy always laughing and always joking he's just controlled all of his demons and all of his bullshit with like the most intense form of competition physically available so it's a there's a lot going on that people don't see they see people just kicking people's asses it's not just that there's there's a whole side to like the cure we are I'm not even kidding I swear when I came there people say I'm from you're from where Spags is I think there was a gig there that's why I'm remembering it I think it was one of those Boston comedy gigs did you ever work for Boston comedy oh yeah yeah yeah the serial there's an octorok too and yeah yeah yeah I grew up driving by the aku-aku where it would say comedy night and yeah was that little how many stop yeah is it still in next Comedy Cellar I don't know actually and then there's a giggles out there and Saugus that's Mike Clark I never do that Allen great clients yes really oh yeah pizzas great it's right next it's pizzas very under it and very under it's Greek pizza it's good giggles was a great gig Mike Clark is Lennie Clark's brother yeah I know I'm fucking great nice guy yeah he's the best but we had through in my town Shrewsbury very small town we had lied for pizzerias within a half mile she's three pizzeria village pizzeria Dean Park in White City I thought that Massachusetts piece it was really good until I moved back to New York and I realize there's a few places like in Yonkers yeah there's a there's a place in White Plains yeah Nicky's Nicky's pizzeria yeah they have a white pizza that it's so fucking good I got it's like how come they can't make this anywhere else like why is this not in California there's a we have a in our in my movie sleepwalk with me the there's a pizza pillow there's a pillow made of pizza as a prop and it was done by Roberta's which is in Brooklyn is fantastic check out Roberta's it you can yeah there's some like legit old-school New York pizzerias it just can't be fucked with their artisans Arturo's on how students like that oh yeah just a lot of them yeah a lot of them there was a crisis like that I just remember placing Yonkers and I remember the name of it but my friend used to know liked it was like his his buddy's dad bran it for you know a hundred years and well it just was ridiculously good in Krauss pizza was like now this is just some weird place like you look on the outside this is right if everybody knew about this it'd be a fucking mile long line I mean you go to that Pink's hot dogs isn't that the craziest thing you've ever seen yeah because they cook the hot dogs at night are outside rather dishes a line of people who are basically waiting to get them very mediocre hotdogs yeah but this piece is I love that phrase if everybody knew about that's like that's like the thing that they say in advertising rooms like if we could just get everyone to know about there's some shit like that yeah sneaks through like we all know comics like that that have just snow yet if everybody knew yeah yeah yeah no for I mean do you know Brian your friends know brian Holtzman for sure no denying home Brian Holtzman has made me laugh harder saying inappropriate ridiculously inappropriate shit than anyone well that's how I feel I mean Brody and I'm talking about Brody talking about somebody starting to get a little famous though yeah a lot of people know Brody now I'm talking about someone pretty famous but but I feel like Stanhope is like that extent where it's like yeah he's very famous he's a big following but like if people saw live yeah his 90 minutes he puts on yeah if people would be like oh that's the best comedian alive he's doing what I love to watch as a comedian as a comedian he like in me and I had a conversation about it too it's like what one of the things as you get older you really appreciate guys that are still doing real fucking comedy they're still saying what they really think yeah yeah so cuz someone wanted me we were not we're not naming names Orton's another one he's another way he's the one who told me to come here oh really wait we're at the Comedy Cellar we're talking about podcasts and he goes have you ever listened to Rogen's podcast like I know he goes it's incredible you gotta you got to go on it's incredible and so then I started listening to it and then I just dropped you a note oh that's awesome I love Norton Norton and I went to see dice in Vegas we went sat in the audience Norton and I and Bobby Kelly and Brian and Anthony COO Mia and Sam Roberts we all went there drove a big fucking limo together we all had dinner it was like a gentlemen's night his grand it was fun we ate at a steak house and then we all went to a show that's final yeah absolutely I did that with me yeah I did that I'm gonna counter that with a much dorkier version which is my wife and I what my wife and I in Ira Glass who co-wrote my film and his wife the four of us went to see Stanhope at Caroline's Oh last comedy show and I couldn't cuz IRA had never seen Stanhope and I was a geek gotta see this guy there's nothing like him yeah I loved I love dog and then of course Doug when he finds out I was there makes fun of IRA makes fun of the public radio for like 15 minutes and and IRAs like hey you know how did this become about me I just want to go see a show listen man if you're on National Public Radio it becomes about you you in your room yeah if you're in the room it's just that that is a silly topic it did not have allowed to have any emotions everything has to be talking about it like this completely unreasonable but Irish shows incredible it's very different is it different This American Life have you ever listened to no never oh you'd love it really this great life is incredible it is I it's funny I've never had to sell it to anybody before cuz people listen to it so much but like it's like I've seen it in the rate it's a radio it's a it's a weekly radio documentary imagine your favorite film documentary and take that to radio and it's it's incredible what they do it's like a fucking miracle really it's a fucking miracle you would you personally would love it dude I'm on it I'm on it I'll get on it today okay calm you should go on there yeah you go on their website and look at like you they have like a list of like these are the legendary episodes the gateway tro real eight-way drug of this american life yeah oh that's a good idea sound like the episodes that you guys probably should have - yeah I'm lazy dude where are you on that where are you guys on that what's about anywhere on that where we just put them up there but there's a lot of websites that sort them out we can only do so much yeah you gonna leave some and we're doing like three and four of these a week sometimes Wow yeah lately it's been four you know seems like we do like we did we're doing three together and I did one yesterday with Brian Cowen just me and Brian oh cool and then we use it right it's another one cool ends another one but 'we comedian you might not know yes fucking hilarious hilarious ridiculous yeah he came over my house last night we hello family barbecue it was fun yeah he's nice he's just such a silly boy yeah he's so fucking silly he's such a fun dude and Norton if people know I love that phrase if people knew about this Norton is a guy even though everybody knows her from the Opie and Anthony show and yeah there's not enough people to know how funny he has a stand to stand up yes I saw him in Austin I was in town doing a UFC and I just I you know another thing I got a chance to just sit down and watch gig oh yeah it's really it's really fun fun yeah and especially if it's a guy like Norton he made me change my act a little bit really yeah yeah because I realized I was doing a lot too long sets I like I did I wanted to do like these really long sets because I didn't want anybody to feel like they didn't get their money's worth I feel that way too really long that same thing but Norton did like an hour and just fucking laid it down and I was like you know what man maybe that's a better thing maybe so I cut my sets down from like an hour and a half plus to like an hour and ten minutes because I feel like nobody should you talk for more than an hour in 10 min was bad right when I started working the door I I started working the door at the DC Improv and what is that that's a stupid clock yeah he's gonna fucking cat clock no that's not a distraction dude you're right nobody I start out with my the charm working the door at the DC Improv and it was and it was really like comedy College because I was opening for like you know every we'd be like Jake Johansson Brian Regan right now Mitch Hedberg Dave Attell you know and uh and Pablo Francisco oh yeah that's a lesson in comedy you watch him he's another if people knew about it yeah what up a live Pablo Francisco shows like he does back then at least the week I open form did 45 minutes blew the doors off the room in a way that I've never seen like I've never seen anything like that Pablo doesn't just do a comedy show it's like a multimedia presentation it's because he can make so many crazy noises with his mouth and it has so many good nutty impressions people yeah it's like a multimedia presentation sometimes he's somebody who if you if he really opened up and did some personal stuff combined with the talent that he has with the noises and the sounds I don't think he can oh wow would that be a good show yeah would be a very good show every something else yeah he's a great guy - really nice that's somewhat the one of the coolest things about comedy is that a lot of people like assume that every comic is fucked up and that you know so many of them are antisocial and depressed and that I don't find that to be the case I find to be the cases like there's a lot of funny guys like like Stanhope yeah they're fun to be around they're nice guys I love what Stanhope said when there was that whole comedy school debate happening oh yeah yeah I'll see something yeah in Stanhope says that he's gonna have a free one and in Bisbee rayless I just love that it's just like everybody should show up you bring some drinks like Stanhope's whole things just like you learn about comedy like offering the comedian you're opening for drinks after the show just asking questions that is a better way to learn I think that's how I learned I am I have a real problem with comedy classes that are taught by people or non comedians I've seen that yeah and I'm like that's just craziness yeah like that's that's like that doesn't even make sense it's like English speaking taught by people don't speak English like yeah if you don't if you haven't actually done stand-up and you you have to do it for years here today you have to get your dick kicked into the dirt numerous occasions you know I mean don't you think that made you as a comedian those really tough sets in the beginning we kind of realized what you got to do to fix and that's what my entire movie is about just it's about just failure and failure and failure and then finding at the end the movie the character has just kind of what you see one sequence of oh this guy's gonna figure it out yeah eventually I think we all like start off terrible I don't never met anybody that started off good now I think it's up for me like I worked I always tell people all comedians really people want to be comedians get a job at a comedy club yeah like I worked at the DC improv of the door and then after I punched out from making minimum wage I got to watch the show for free yeah and that's that's what you need yes just need to see comedians over and over and over again and go eventually go okay I can I can do something like that it's it's a weird thing when you figure that when you start to realize that it's a craft but that yours is day might it seems like it's kind of similar to other people's but it's not it's it's your weird take on shitting you got to find out what the fuck that is you got to find the silly fix years find the preposterous yes it's so long man and you get conflicted and you don't know if you're being full of shit am I being is is this an affected attitude that I'm putting on is it obvious yeah when I was starting out I was totally putting on an ass well I hate that because I'm so embarrassing because I it is embarrassing cuz I look back on those sets well no cuz I was and everybody does though I mean I like Geraldo is one of my favorite comedians of all time and was a friend of mine and like he even said like he's like when I started out like my first TV sets I sounded like Dave Attell I was on TV sounding like somebody else before I figured out who I was and then he I mean I think geraw was one of the great comics and but like for me it was just I sounded like I sound like Steven right want to start out yeah then I sounded like my Chad Berg and then eventually I sounded like myself yeah it's hard to avoid man it's hard to avoid being like really influenced by the guys that you know came before you that were really good I caught myself sounding like rich Jenny on stage once really just almost exactly it was like so such an obvious ripoff I guy I was in the middle of a set like I did not kept going with the bed and I finished my set like the audience didn't even know yeah but to myself I was like ill you fry hey yeah I was like you fucking rich Jenny clone what do you do I'm like a year in or something like that you know but I'll never forget like how embarrassing it was that I like was like if I was in the room and I saw me on stage I'd be like who who's this guy ripping off rich jack because you know this but you know when guys will do that whether it's you're not even ripping off material you just rip it off being that guy yeah people say that I had that with Stephen right Mitch Hedberg and then inadvertently Todd Barry people were like you sound like Todd Barry and I was like I'm not even watching I mean I liked how Barry lies a great comic but it wasn't like I was watching a ton of Todd Barry at that time well I think you just have a similar tone to your voice and it's only mildly sad but people are crazy they'll find connections yeah fucking anything yeah I got offstage once in Kentucky and some guy came out to me with a list of people it was like he said you know Patton Oswald this I go what are you talking about he goes you sounded like these people okay and I was like listen man I don't know what to tell you did you have a good time fun I don't know what to tell you you look like are you what are you saying you saying that I'm not me and then I'm all these people that's like what are you saying I like that response there was a bunch of haters you have a good time yeah that's all I could say to him listen I hope you had a good time the comedy show crazy yeah I gotta sit here you gonna analyze who my influences were yeah and you're angry at me for being influenced by great comedians but I don't even think that's what it was I think it was like you know the people will try to find a connection in anything oh yeah you know when I listen to my recording after the guy said that to me I was like what the fuck is this guy he like it was there was a couple who ex cure obscure ones in there too I don't remember who is references worth but it was like like Richard Lewis was one of them yeah and I was like why do you what the fuck are you even saying yeah and I went and listened to it and I didn't hear any of it somebody wolf if they're looking and then there's people that just are crazy and their perceptions are just off they don't get a thought in their head and they don't have the ability to discern whether or not it's an objective thought whether or not it's a reasonable thought they just got that thought and they fucking and run with it and yeah with you they like Todd Barry sounds like Todd Barry well it's funny because I I the person I listen to the most was Woody Allen but no one ever accuses me of sounding like Woody Allen because I'm like a suburban white kid grown up and he's a short Jewish man from New York City we just don't look like brother in any way shape or form I think people don't make that connection so do you feel like you were influenced in delivery wise yeah I realize what a great comic he was he's incredible that elbonian that one album which is a compilation of I think three records is in crazy Bob Woody Allen's stand-up comedian I think it's called yeah and it's so good what a weird guy huh I mean married his daughter in front of the world that is intensely weird as hard that is intense intensely in superhot also is she super I said it and it's kind of super hot awesome oh man I don't I don't see it yeah you can't get behind yeah it's a P it's just crazy creepy man yeah I mean how did they ever even develop that kind of a relationship that doesn't make any sense to me yeah it seems to me like that should never be able to happen it shouldn't be on the table yeah like not one of the options and I wonder what the blowback was for him for Woody Allen this great director you manage clear yeah there's a big blowback he there there are people cuz I'm such a big fan of his there are people who I talk to to this day who go once that happened I will not see his movies again yeah I've heard a lot of people I've heard that from especially from women from women particularly yeah yeah well think you know hmm it's almost like you can't trust him around your kids like that's the that's the feeling that they get it's like he'll he's got he's not gonna show he's not a skater he's not at the movie theater with you yeah see the movies so you don't have to be worried yeah but there's kids people that just won't they won't support you after like what's is the guy's name that escaped to France oh yeah Roman Polanski one my favorite directors and in yeah and he was yeah he was convicted of that horrible crime yeah what did he do wasn't like because he fled right I'm it was he was he was dragged like drugged a teenage girl and had sex with or something like oh but then there's this whole there's this whole documentary about that case called I think it's called wanted and and it it shows the shades of grey in that case that case was really complex and there was like a there's a judge who was really high and mighty and kind of like got carried away about hit his or her own ego and how the judges herself I forget was was making headlines by saying certain things in the cord and then it became like a spectacular event where he might have gotten like a year in jail or something but then it got kind of blown out of proportion it was gonna be a big much bigger deal yeah it's a really good movie actually I think was on HBO it's called wanted wanted is like Roman Polanski want it or Sun yeah this case is really disturbing man and then this is after his wife have been murdered by the man so I know so you got to realize like this guy was a lot going on yeah I mean what he did was horrific for sure though but he's I mean what is what a fucked up state of mind he had to have been in yeah after his wife was murdered by the Manson Family while she was pregnant I I have to say like I you been some weird shit happens in California well it got we just talked about that like I feel like the Polanski said I'm just like when I watch it it feels so distant from my existence in New York I'm like yeah that's some California shit that I can't understand okay do you like living in New York I love it yeah I live in the city my wife and I lived in the city for a while and then we just moved to Brooklyn recently why'd you move to Brooklyn get some space yeah you know just like we were sick of living in this little cramped area oh so you have a bigger place yeah we have like yeah we have a few bedrooms and it's and we're able to and also just walk around and have some trees around mmm we lived on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and it was like getting to a point where our favorite like local restaurants were closing down H&H bagels closed down Nico's clothes a Greek restaurant closed down like a lot of places were closing down to the point where like they closed that this is a bad sign of like when times are bad we thought it was sad when they closed down Barnes and Noble like we were like oh that's too bad our local bookstore got shut down the Circuit City FL yeah yes we lost a 34d to super common man it's mean think about in our lifetime when has there ever been a period of time where more businesses closed down than two I don't know I can't write in my lifetime I don't remember anything like this prepare we're but it's like but but Brooklyn on the other hand is like really burgeoning like a real small restaurant small bakeries small like ice-cream shops like are able to open there because the real estate isn't that expensive to rent commercial real estate isn't as expensive so it's so you're getting like better food better like just baked goods ice cream grocery stores local grocery stores with local produce like it's it's bad I mean I don't want to sell it too hard but I I think it's better like we're happier there it seems like a little bit of a compromise a little bit better or compromise like you're inside you're in on a suburban area but it's a little sub city and it's slower will still be honest with you the people are a little slower you're kind of like you're at the ice cream stirring you're like huh come on come on what are we doing you just here's what you're walking over there like you get a little brisk step you know like to bring a little pep to it is it jazz music or so used to fucking being so so crazy in New York right now that hive is so nuts yeah situates so it mimics insects it's really crazy so when you get them all together in this big you know thing that they've created they're all swarming in its giant population center I mean it's really not that much different than a bee hive you know an anthill it's fucking crazy so many people there my wife and I went and this was even more the case my wife and I rented a house in western Massachusetts this summer for a month so that we could just write and relax and like to get away from like like Amherst way yeah exactly north north of Northampton beautiful out there gorgeous but so slow yeah oh my god everything is like you go in somewhere you order a cup of coffee or like we're gonna be here for a little bit like yeah there's no ha the country it is really nice though we um but it was funny cuz my wife has been saying since we've been together probably about eight years yeah marry four years ago and since we met she was like I think that I belong in the country I think that we should move to the country and I was I was like I can't like I gotta work this is where I work in the city because there's comedy clubs and and this is where the my one-man shows are and we finally took a month after being together for eight years and went to the country and we brought our cat Ivan and and uh who had never been anywhere but our apartment Wow rocked and there were mice in the house and they were this is a really strange phenomenon they're parasitic mice it parasites in them which means they're unafraid of people or cats oh that means they have Toxoplasma yeah that's exactly the hell and and and so usually if you have a cat you don't even see mice yeah because they smell rats and they don't even come out in this case we had mice like they were like zombies they were walking towards us we were like batting them away like a fucking video game yeah and that's sick and those are the dangerous ones those are the ones that can infect you is that right oh yeah they have a massive impact on human behavior if they bite you is that if it gets into your skin either through a cat fecal matter you get a if the cats infected you can get it from the cat and get it from livestock that uh it comes in contact with the shit so Ivan ate one of the mice oh no see we took him out and so we we instead of a month there we were there for two weeks drove home whoa after he ate the mouse and we took him to the vet and he got he took you know whatever medicine to make to knock that stuff out I don't think they can stop that stuff it's a brain parasite I thought I thought it is what it is I think whatever it was were we've cheats checked out I don't know they they gave him medicine and Dombey cat I know a guy zombie cat yeah that's not good is old though he's 16 years old I'm ago he's in his golden years get him out of there before he infects the house sounds crazy but Toxoplasma really is something that people have to have an issue with because it does have an effect on human behavior it makes people more aggressive it slows your reaction time down and a lot of the world has it huge probably really yeah yeah in France it's been hi in the I believes the 1950s or 1960s it got as high as 80% 80% of the country had it and now it's down to the 50s this is all estimations of course yeah like really testing the entire population they estimate that America it's somewhere around fifty to sixty million people are affected by for anyone for anyone getting their news from Joe Rogan's podcast yeah yeah you're in trouble by the way cuz I've backed up any I've done no research telling you what I read yeah but it's a the idea is that once you get it you got it that's it Wow yeah so it's okay it's brain parasites Jesus makes the de maiz sexually attracted to cat piss what a motherfucker yeah like what a crazy mean fucking disease twisted will we my wife was on sitting on the couch in the house and there was a mouse she looked next to her there was a mouse just sitting there staring at her mom usually see a mice mouse and it just runs away immediately and in this case it was just staring at her and she just ran away and then I had to chase the mouse out of the house fuck that there's something really creepy about rodents man I know well have you ever heard the Rat King concept no I just heard about this recently there's a apparently a book I have a comedian friend named John Hodgman who's a very knowledgeable man and he he's written a lot of very funny and great books and he he's in The Daily Show he's a correspond on the daily show sometimes he's on there but anyway he had was telling me there's this book and I think it's called rats it's all about the culture of rats and there's there's this phenomenon theoretically called the Rat King which is that certain rats are in such an enclosed space that after a while their tails are intertwined so their existing essentially as one large rat unit what I don't know if I can substantiate this but that people should look up Rat King that sounds like some comic book shit man look at my Rat King I need to look that up Rat King that doesn't seem like you if it seems like something you would know about was he just joking he wasn't okay really no apparently there's this book called bruh I think rats and uh and it sheds a lot of light on before we are yeah I'm instantly looking at myself in this Wow in this camera and just going oh man have I put on weight on the road it's so painful the roads brutal roads brutal it's hard to what is this a rat king in the scientific museum oh my god so it is real right oh my god Brian pull this up on Wikipedia cuz this is gonna freak you the fuck out I see that as lost Brian oh that's son of a bitch yeah yo Brian how dare he the loudness with which you shouted is so inappropriate to what you're gonna tell him yeah it's not Ryan no no get over here you need to see this he's a wikipedia Rat King you need to see this it's this is incredible man this is uh this really is a real phenomenon I thought your friend was just fuckin with you no no no we have a serious conversation rats whoa that seems like horrific yeah if you go to it folks if you go to the folks listening to us people probably tweet at you right now facts about the Rat King I bet some of your listeners and viewers know about the Rat King hey we need you to pull something up man we just uh something crazy it's called a Rat King so Mike Birbiglia said this to me I did not I thought he was just fucking around I thought his friend was just fucking around but apparently there are clumps of rats that get connected together by the tail and they grow together while joined at the tails so there's like a group of like in this photo there's a group of it looks like 30 or 40 of them just on top of each other connected by the tails Rat King just pull up Rat King on wiki it's the the photo there connects to it what a Rick you match if you ran into that somewhere no no it's so it's the stuff of nightmares oh it's what one would be one should fear most rodents are fucking scary Anna yeah they're so gross yeah gross little fuckers oh you got it Rat King you look the image at the top look at that that click on my god click on that that's real is this live streaming the video yeah oh my god do you look at that thing this is insane yeah I mean it's insane I just all these rats intertwine I just gathered I came here today to blow Joe Rogan's behind and I have oh you blew it you blew it wide open cuz I thought you I thought we were having fun I thought your friends telling us crazy - you're just high squadron would he could read your mind no really a rat Kings a real thing what's folklore I mean then well you know um I it doesn't necessarily mean that it's not true it means that it's probably been exaggerated and tossed down from superstitions but this is so it's a rat bit big fear well I mean it was it was there was a bunch of shit but but it's obviously a real thing it's a real phenomenon there's this isn't a scientific museum in in Germany I mean it really it really does happen but I think it's probably they don't they probably just are tied up in knots they're probably not like growing together through the tails I don't think their tails become one unit I think they're just gross and they just get tangled up our glass IRA glasses the mention earlier you don't know show this very life but he was saying the other day that sometimes he's struck with the when were you know we live in New York you live here in LA with the degree to which we are living like medieval lords like we have at our beck and call any food any type of food we want prepared any way we want within a twenty five minutes yeah all of strange giant human construct yes that doesn't resemble anything in nature yeah some nutty thing that they just goes up to the heavens yeah pops out of the ground everything else is missing and usually you'll see a tree defiantly looking for its friends it's my mind if I loved the movie Minority Report when it came out yeah cuz I was just like you watch that movie now you're like yeah but half of that stuff is true Wow yeah I think it's a futuristic but it was futuristic in a way that was like you can just about see it coming like you walk into the mall and they go hello Joe Rogan we'd like the Nike shoes that you bought last year would you like another fresh pair that certainly is gonna happen right for sure yeah it's gonna be you're gonna be able to already inches on your phone on the internet always are already yeah an Amazon you sure on they say well you you might like this yeah I bought a t-shirt from Cafe Press and I bought it through Amazon I went through Amazon yeah the whaler does you want to go through Amazon Mikey okay see how that works can't cut through Amazon yeah I love it it's amazing we live in a weird world very strange it's what we're talking about one-click shopping on Amazon but it's the easiest way to buy anything and it's when you start doing it becomes so goddamn addictive yeah it feels ridiculous I know feels like you just get you can get obscure billiard supply you can like weird shit like I need a joke or / tip tapper yeah and you can find that on Amazon alright hardest to return though I have so much shit that I just won't return because it's like yeah UPS you gotta - you gotta take the hit no but I saw I saw yeah I saw the movie gay for night recently a Truffaut film which is great have you ever seen that not a four-night did you get it from Amazon no but it's about making a film yeah no I actually did I got it I think from Amazon and in it I know is it at the end of it I was like I'd like to have the poster of this click on it okay it's on the way boom so crazy I get these uh obscure Mexican hot sauces Lu katika I can't find him in any like white people grocery store yeah you have to go to the Mexican hood to get Lu katika or you just go to Amazon com boom how do you resolve incidentally because I give you your very knowledgeable about pizza how do you fit that into the diet cuz you have such a good diet just gotta make sure you don't eat it all the time the most important thing is that your base like you you you never want to deprive you by nutrients but you can have cheat days totally yeah and wrong with that I think I think cheat meals cheat days just as long as you're being reasonable as long as like 80% of your food is really good food and healthy and every and then you have a burger or something like that you could do that so you get away with it yeah yeah yeah yeah I've tried vegetarian before I tried it when I was trying to lose weight when I was a kid when I was fighting in different weight classes and I didn't like it I felt I just felt shitty I thought I didn't fulfill I didn't feel like I was very vibrant you haven't tried it again as an adult but I know I crave meat I crave it like after a good workout I want a fucking steak yeah I feel like my body wants red meat yeah and people say let's you know that's unevolved and lustful killing those cows are not gonna live forever if you just let them walk around and if people aren't killing cows something's gonna kill cows either cars because you're gonna hit them with your cars because it's gonna be everywhere or you can have mountain lions running around taking cows out in front of you every day that's a possibility too yeah I think it's that inhumane aspect of keeping them in crate slightly larger than their body that I think frustrates people yeah I haven't had veal in a long time yeah yeah the veal was the first one I tapped out on I was just like I can't do that yeah that's just too creepy taking a baby and not feeding it and tying it in a knot so I can't move no no no thanks yeah yeah bits so fucked up I'm just like I got no time for that just so it's more tender really what the fuck man what's funny is I'm looking at your image you're behind the computer but I can see you here and you can see me what's funny is it if you if your body and if you have a really good physique if you ended up having my body you might go into a deep depression but you would be really upset and if I had your body my comedy career would go away because all I do is just make fun of my own body and self but you can make fun of anything yeah you know if you can if you make fun of your own body if you're self-deprecating you can make fun of something else yeah so you actually defy because you're you're great I was listening your albums this week you defy the Joe Piscopo rule which is that if you're if you get to fit you're no longer funny people are silly there's no rules to comedy nobody should know that but I think Piscopo was the where they was the line in the sand where people like oh okay that's how it works no with Piscopo the problem was he just you know he had a few good things that he did on Saturn live a few good sketches yeah overall there wasn't that much there said he didn't put enough effort into it he didn't it's no different than any other comic like Michael Richards that you know goes from being an actor to be in a comic and just can't really pull it off yeah there's not much difference it's a hard road and no one has to tell you that to become a stand-up comic is a long hard fucking road yeah and there's not a lot of us who stay on it if you stop and think about like the guys that you hung out with when you were an open-mic er totally different yeah and look at the guys that you know now how many of them made it me and Fitzsimmons you started out together so like we look literally like weeks apart from each other so like he's like one of the only guys like from my group of open-mike errs yeah that made it over the the salmon net no one from my open mikes is working yeah so then it will actually I shouldn't say that no one for my open mics is I still run into any nicked Apollo was always a really funny guy he was always in really good shape he was a football player you're right Nick is and will enjoy a much more handsome than me well George has to get a hair I discovered this I went to quantum obey Cuba in the USO tour with de pollo and Geraldo and Colin Quinn of gaffing a bunch of guys and Geraldo was in great shape too and so is de Pollux we cuz we went on the beach we went swimming yeah pulled over because we couldn't get through one of the gates we're like well let's just go swimming in that Beach right there and we all in swimming there's photo ID we still have photos of it and like ah fuck it's really embarrassing for me feel like a shame yeah de Paulo's always been good shape he was a one-one of the guys when I was an open-mic er he was a bit more established than he was ahead of me by at least maybe like two years yeah he was an established professional was the mayor bike that time yes yeah Louie was also about two years ahead of me those guys when I first started doing open mics they were just doing professional gigs and I got to see de pollo once on stage and I'm like look at this handsome motherfucker this football player and dude and he was hilarious and I and I that was a nice thing for me to see as a you know a young guy was involved in athletics myself was like okay so there is no rule yeah like anything can you know and then I but I remember when I first saw Kennison that's when I realized there was no rules that's when I first realized like Oh anything can be comedy yeah and it's just whether or not it's funny that's art that's comedy too this is a different thing he's doing that's right when Kinnison was going I love it oh look at this face I was married that dad fucking good because you get him remember remember when he yeah though he was one of my earliest influences yeah um when he did that bit about uh about getting married the devil is even try to scare you yeah oh you've been marrying though this is gonna be like fucking Club Med for you come on in is weary tortured souls blah blah blah you're married he'll be like Club Med oh he was yeah he was the first to me that like really cemented in my head that anything could be comedy cuz I always loved colony but I was always like way too loud and aggressive and stupid to connect myself to someone like Jerry Seinfeld you know that I was like that would I would have to be a totally different person to be that kind of connect I'm not not could never do that yeah I don't know thing I could do that yeah but then I saw Kenneth and I was like oh there's no rules yeah you don't have to be Jerry Seinfeld you just have to be whatever is funny from you whatever comes out of you this podcast must be great for you because you're when you tour now it's probably your audience's who get your sense of humor yeah as opposed to like right here factor fans who are like let's see him do the bugs in the mouth yeah the fearful fear factor is hard for all because I heard that bit on your album where you're like that's just a show I host it I'm not that's not me it wasn't my idea it's a lot of people though it's such a big thing because it's on television that it has to like define you friends and it has to be your thing but I was like why like this is just it's my gig but that's what no easy but the technology of these podcasts right now is that you can actually say yeah no no I'm this yes I'm gonna tell you what I am it yes yes well you you get an opportunity to express yourself in a way deeper way than would ever be possible in a million Tonight Show appearances yeah you'd never be able I know that across doubt that was always my goal starting out is because I would do these hell gigs I drove like I do in the movie it's like I drove I drove my mom station wagon all over the country i but incidentally it's like oh I only find out at this age sounds like people's parents gave them their car or like bum them a car was like I I bought my mom's station wagon for $2,200 so I had a hundred thousand miles on it like she marked it up why mom marked up their solution I drove it around the country and I and I would perform at those gigs who'd be like you know like every just so people have a point of reference like when I was starting out like whenever you're in the middle of nowhere you're in like you know Cherry Hill Pennsylvania Hill New Jersey and you drive by like a Best Western and it says comedy night Wednesday that was my life I was comedy night Wednesday I did a lot of those too a lot of those Barry Katz gigs yeah and so my goal when I was in that stage cuz I wouldn't do well you know the audiences wouldn't like me they came to see something different than what well I wasn't also that good so it was like it was the combination of what I would become was like a soft-spoken kind of storyteller and then what they wanted was like fast jokes Lenny Clarke yeah they wanted Lenny Clarke yeah whose great comic because if he could kill it anywhere and so what I was like I want people eventually to come to see my shows on purpose and that's why that's why I started started keeping a mailing list and you also got very successful with your blog's I remember you were the first guy we were somewhere I can't remember what city was but you were in a big place you were in like this this big theater and and I go damn I go my core biggley's playing here I go how the fuck is he doing that and then I forget who I was with it was either Joey Diaz or Ari Shaffir one of those guys was like he's got this blog really really popular he's got this blog and I was like damn man that's a big impact like this was years ago before we ever even did the podcast yeah and I remember thinking like that's a lot of impact from you know connecting with people on the Internet well part of it was like I I wrote my blog was called my secret public journal and I still do it and and then by the Bob and Tom show out of it you know out of Indianapolis and they're syndicated was like just read your secret public journal on our show so I would call in every week it was actually very similar like cable guy cable guy used to do stuff like that one radio do you know that cable guy used to do like he used to do Collins every week yeah like all over the place yeah he like he would be doing like 2025 phoners a week Wow yeah who's had about that if there's a really hard worker okay I mean I don't know what he does now but but he back then I've met him a long time ago in Montreal when he was just starting out nobody knew about him was like the early 90s and he was a nice fucking nice guy had a great time with my family I hung out with him one night and we partied at the Comedy Works in Montreal got hammer yeah there he's a great dude man yeah like we had some fun and he's got some great potato chips and sent us he listens to the rod cast he sent over his potato chips that's Ricky is cheeseburger potato chips yeah it tastes the pickles and course he has cheeseburger potatoes it's it is probably the worst thing on earth for you yeah like I don't know how the fuck they're giving you all these different flavors but it's like a joke I mean like you eat it you eat a chip and you're like I'd taste the burger there's the ketchup here's a pickle what the Fox over last night and my hotel cuz I had any I hadn't eaten dinner at that in-between stage like 6 p.m. and then it's midnight you're gonna I gotta eat something so I went to the minibar and I had Pirate's Booty I had Pirate's Booty in the flavor was a aged cheddar I was like what the fuck is aged cheddar in this like manufactured chip that's from some factory somewhere that really aged cheddar yeah there what what a typical creates the taste of aged cheddar like strawberry gum it doesn't taste anything like strawberries it's just what we we agree to strawberry like grape gum grape gum doesn't taste like fucking grapes the last thing that should taste like right right it tastes like grape gum right now and that's purple right like grape soda doesn't decently lick grapes we get it in our head that that's the grape flavor yeah yeah I mean I'm sorry grape soda even have grapes in it now No right it's just some fucking sugar water but we you know there's a fake grape taste that we accept and it's like the gum taste that grape gum taste it's fake it's a fake grape we just go yeah it's great that is entailing like great like what are you talking about that's like if I gave you a cheeseburger it tasted like feet you know it's best look what's on Amazon there whatever the Cable Guy cheeseburger tater chip and 20 bucks I got three hugga three damn God she has burger potato chips and that's another guy by the way doesn't need the money so he clearly believes in cheeseburger potato chips look they were very tasty delicious but I was feeling like with each chip I was rolling the crazy dice I was like what's this shit yeah who knows what kind of this is gonna grow breasts are you know what it's like it's like it's a game it's like Willy Wonka factories when they take the things and what does it taste like oh it tastes like you know whatever the thing was that's exactly what it's like dude I didn't even think of that I forgot about that that's exactly what it's like yeah dude it was it you remember do you guys remember I forget what it was it's like does it taste like this he's like yeah it does I don't remember but I do room it was like a piece of gum that basically tasted like food experience right well they're getting they're closing in on they're closing in on their could it's like Ghostly its ghostly it's not a distinct it's not like you know habanero pepper distinct flavor it's it's a ghostly like oh there's that yeah it's a mustard in that fucking thing but it's really good it's really good but I'm your your role in the the health dice would be good with that it would be good with those potato chips like some kind of cheese meaty cheese dip oh Jesus Christ I get my dick hard day so meaty case yeah when you talk to Europeans oh they said that what what's killing us is the preservatives oh yeah because your ribs are not very overweight and they eat cheese and wine and all this well they also have unpasteurized cheese they have a lot of unpasteurized cheese in Europe you can't even get it over here it's like I had a friend from France needs to have to smuggle it in real smuggling unpasteurized cheese in France yeah it's so crazy and by the way there's a reason why your body has a lactose intolerance it's because you're drinking milk that's been boiled down as dead there's no enzymes in it there's no like all the stuff that makes your body naturally digest it it doesn't exist yeah though so the idea is that like we have to protect people from bad milk yeah but you know what's a better idea fresh milk yeah we got to figure out how to not have milk sitting in a supermarket for three months so we gotta have people closer to their animals we had the growing up we had the I don't know if you remember this in Massachusetts the Lungren and Joe nightís like milk store it wouldn't it was it was milk in glass bottles they would deliver to your house boil the cops yeah seal them off yeah great amazing oh and you see I don't think that place existed yeah I don't know if that was pasteurizer homogenized but uh they used to have it at Whole Foods and now you gotta go to there's like a little specialty mark oh are now for new they have it in Whole Foods no no no not anymore Whole Foods is like they're so big that they there's certain shit they don't take a risk with like there's a kombucha that is more than one half of one percent alcohol and because of that they carry it area but it's just a it's it's nothing it's not like a level that can get you drunk but it is you know it ferments and it's really fucking good for you and the one that ferments the most is really the best for you and they don't carry it because it's it's got its gets a little risky with the alcohol right very risky so that's why they don't they don't have that they don't have raw milk there anymore it's like it's too risky but I don't know if that's a corporate decision and what but it's unfortunate because raw milk man doesn't give you any like weird stomach shit tastes way better once you get used to the fact what you drink it's like rich and creamy it's like it's really fucking good I was flying I was fine in California recently and I was on a plane and I was I had one of those morning's where you show up at the airport and you just you're so hungry that that you just grabbed anything I was like a cheapo or whatever that place is called a JFK yeah just like I'll have any just in case I know something I'll have a banana of a sandwich right you have this bag of stuff and I get on the plane and I'm just scarfing down this chicken salad sandwich and the flight attendant comes over to me and he goes um excuse me sir all right they're nuts in that sandwich I'm like scarfing down the sandwich I looked out on my um Finch so here's walnut in a sandwich and I know that this is gonna go badly and so I could as I'm talking I'm still eating the sandwich right now and he's like I'm the woman who's two seats down from you she has a nut allergy so you have to put that away and I was just like um I won't I won't like make her eat them you know like I won't hey you know rub them on her body I'm just gonna eat it right here and he was like it's actually I'm even if the nuts are in the air and I looked over at the woman and I go excuse me I go I go will you have a really urgent reaction if there are nuts in the hair and she goes yeah I have an allergy and it's I'll have a I'll have a suit if there's nuts in the air and and I was just thinking like I didn't say this I was like you shouldn't leave the house to make animals a lot of even real though that's a nuisance he can't go in the grocery store so this is what happened I go I don't know I was in that instant I was in that stage where I was having like like eating like I was about to have eating blue balls where you're halfway through a sandwich and you're like if I don't finish this sandwich I'm gonna flip out so I said the guy was like is there anywhere I can the sandwich and he said I'm not making this up he goes you can eat it in the bathroom Wow and so I so I went to the bathroom and I finished my sandwich Jesus Christ yeah but the nut allergy thing is strange it's like I really don't want people to die because they have a nut allergy but I'm also kind of like well then I guess oh this is real yet a allergy thing yeah the seal wow that's crazy yeah they should have breathing things that they have to wear yeah you're going in public I shouldn't go on 150 passengers right in the flight yeah that's where the person with the nut allergy why can't she just have one of those little Asian masks you know like the low white mass yeah four stars it can be wow this is really interesting hmm that's doesn't seem right and then I asked her I go is this do you fly a lot I mean is this something you do I mean and she said she's again when I'm on Southwest I call in advance when I can't advance they take all the nuts off the plane oh my god she said where no nuts on the plane when I fly and I was just like who is this girl what since what kind of power does she wield yeah it is possible here's the thing they're saying all those small amounts of peanut protein can set off a severe reaction it is rare that people get an allergic reaction from just breathing in small particles of nuts or peanuts that doesn't mean it's possible they said it's rare yeah it's as most foods with peanuts in them do not allow enough of the protein to escape into the air causing a reaction just because the smell of foods containing peanuts won't produce reaction because the scent does not contain the protein so what she was just freaking out the possibility but most likely since it was like a food yeah it wasn't just it's a dust from the crunching of the peanuts apparently oh that's enough apparently to freak some people out it's rare but that's enough for some people which is crazy yeah she should not she should Drive weird they know man to be allergic to of a food so badly yeah yeah now that's gonna kill people man they're fucking poison and we're like peanut M&Ms and fucking chomp-chomp imagine how weird it would be growing up where everybody's eating poison everywhere around you everybody's eating some shit that if you go to the supermarket there's tubs of poison have you going to get some peanut butter that shit will kill you I've always felt that way about cellphones though oh really from from moment one when cell phone started you be ubiquitous I was like this is gonna be the cigarettes of our time well that's ridiculous that's really as bad as peanuts two people allergic to peanuts people that allergic to peanuts it fucking kills you dead and it's everywhere in tubs of it and were you eating it in front of you chomp-chomp it's like a common food for kids take to school peanut butter and jelly but imagine if poison think about having this to your head all the time you get cancer from your cell phone you're a pussy and I say I'm gonna send some brain cancer patients your way it might be weird if like in like 30 years it might be weird though and like 30 years it's like a whole entire West ages cancer of the brain yeah we all died that's my feeling everybody's right thumb rots off right your texting thumb yeah I don't I don't think that it's that much of a concern there's a lot of radiation we just get from the Sun there's a lot of radiation we get from just the the environment every time you fly in a plane you get massive amounts of radiation is that right yeah every time you get flying a plane supposed to be worse than going through those x-ray machines oh Jesus yeah you're up in the fucking the high altitude you're flying at 35,000 feet yeah my wife won't do the new one the new x-ray oh really and she gets opted out she opts out she just is freaked out by it it's just a lot of radiation she's right yeah yeah I don't think they've adequately researched the long-term effects of putting fucking weird particles through people's bodies and it might work on you know there's a thing about any sort of exposure to things that you might be fine I might be fine but one person just like the person that's allergic to peanuts people's bodies are weird man one person could have a totally different reaction to that radiation and really get sick because of it everybody's built so different than you know there's just we have we have similar but varied bodies and we have to take that into consideration when you you know find out what's what's bad for people some people can't even have one drink cause I mean we should take drinks away that's ridiculous for most of us drinks are great yeah some people cannot have that one drink so imagine living in a world and I have friends that have done this where they look at everybody drinking like you're just this is everything you're doing if I did I would be dead in an alley in a week I just fucking go on a massive bender until I ran out of heartbeats you know and that's surround us everywhere yeah we vary too much we need to cook collectively there's is we got a big spectrum yeah physical psychological everything you ever think about running for office fuck that running for office is like it'd be like becoming a pro wrestler yeah it'd be like well just Zilla wait you could equate the two cuz you're selling like a script is here you're following a script in your ear you're entering into some artificial sort of a situation yeah this isn't this isn't real like Paul Ryan we don't know Paul Ryan yeah we don't know Mitt Romney Mitt Romney doesn't even know Mitt Romney I was very uninspired by the speeches last night sorry I'm in a movie I watched those speeches and I was real actually really open-minded till like hey what do you guys got yeah and then I was came away just being like oh okay nothing it was all rhetoric it was all get back the country you if you have a small business you did build it yeah and it was all just bad clunky shitty speeches yeah they played a Reagan speech from when Reagan was running against Jimmy Carter I was like god damn Reagan in the campaign trail could fuckin throw it down I am an actor he wasn't yeah being an actor in you know even though he was getting on in his days when he was running for president the effects of the presidency hadn't quite broken him down like I did during his term yeah but he he stomped Carter in this two-minute speech about what's the difference between a recession and a depression a recession is when a neighbor's out of a job a depression is when you're out of a job yeah and and the crowd was cheering and you know and he's like and to get rid of this depression we need to put Jimmy Carter out of a job and why they went fucking apeshit yeah I was like whoa imagine having that guy breathing down your heals yeah Ronald Reagan handsome ass actor now talking a lot of sense so wait till Clooney runs for office in like ten years he's got no no kids he's got no kids people are never gonna listen to a man who doesn't have Jill yeah they're not gonna listen to a man who doesn't have children trust me the people who have children will never listen to a man as now children because they know that there's a physiological change that happens in a person's body in your brain and your consciousness and your understanding of relationships when you wouldn't have your own children and he doesn't have his own children yeah but when it runs for president he's gonna have two two-year-olds twin set donors maybe we want to see your kids get to be about 15 before you what about Matt Damon he has kids yeah Matt Damon could run for office but the real problem is that the whole system is completely fucked sideways by corruption there's no way you can run for office to do what to be the bidding of the you're gonna be at the bidding of these giant corporations are gonna have bullets in your brain yeah well you know what the game is it's true what this is this thing's been bought and sold and if it wasn't proved to us by Obama I mean come on a guy who is the parent or his parent is a single mom right he's raised in an interracial relationship grows up poor he lives in Hawaii for a while I mean you you were talking about a guy who's a total outsider Yeah right and look what happens when he gets in he passes things like the National Defense Authorization Act that just blindly allows them to arrest people they have no recourse allows them to use the military to to block civil unrest and to stop civil unrest in this country all shit that's supposed to be prevented in the Constitution and he's just allowing this stuff to go through why is he allowing this stuff to go through is that what the the child of a single parent would really want now the fuck it is yeah he doesn't have a say he's at the bidding they're all at the bidding of money what is the best way to make money the best way to make money is let these motherfuckers loose let them do what they want to do in other countries let's lose make this happen is give them reasons what we got to make this happen and then money just keeps fucking flying and these guys are in a vampire orgy of blood money just dancing around and drinking it and they don't want it to stop and so oh by who says that he's going to stop wars all the sudden he has to he wins the Nobel Peace Prize and he has to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan yeah what is that is that what do you really think that's what he wants to do do you really think that's what his big change is his big change is that come on man it's all crazy no one this is a broken system you're watching these these candidates you like this is this is the last death throes of a dying situation a dying configuration the configuration of Democrat versus Republican you know and what we're going to do is give America back to the small businesses to the families it's like II it's like you're making those Close Encounters noises doo doo doo doo you don't even say anything you're just making the noises that the people want to hear yeah you're making the conservative noise yes is sort of underlying ly racist look little you know let's get it back away from this black guys kind of fucked everything up yeah look how white my wife is there's a little of that going on yeah it's nonsense and meanwhile the same companies will be controlling things no matter who's in control we get wrapped up and shit like gay marriage and immigration and all this different stuff that nobody really gives a fuck about at the top of the heap and they just keep sucking money out of the system the whole time we're dancing around worrying about whether dude should be a little label to write things down and say all of this now and you're that now and yeah and then it becomes legal that we're dicking around about that the same people are running shit that I've always been running shit yeah hilarious really it's a when it becomes more and more transparent you realize like what an incredible job they've done of just keeping everybody in the dark and just running things from the background yeah as far as like running the world it's really the the fucking banks have done a fantastic job I mean in in despite of all the competition or the access to information people have today the fact they still run it the way they run it is amazing I've done a great job they're bad motherfuckers yeah just depressing it is depressing it's you know who would want you know what person of our age group would want war at this stage of life what what person would think that that's the best option in any barrel train last night in the like McCain and his speech was saying we should raise defense spending and raise defense spending there so is that what you guys are trying to say we shouldn't spend so much money i I was very confused by what what they were saying what their message was the word defense is a funny word because it's not devious all are in another country yeah yeah so when you say raise defense spending I'm down for strengthening anything in America but I think I'm I don't see any reason to send someone's kids to some other fucking country to shoot some people they never met because some assholes say that that's the thing that needs to be done that don't make any sense to me now it's not that you know you don't support the troops and it's not that you don't think that it's good to have a strong army because I absolutely do and do Wow this is this is fucking okay craziness yeah this is chaos and no one wants to admit it is so you're just you're dealing with these two guys that are essentially gonna it's gonna very very little maybe there's gonna be like some social debate going on in here maybe you know the gay people have a harder time it'll be harder to get medical pot I mean maybe but other than that what the fuck is gonna change not that much not that much it's gonna change 2:46 sorry yeah we're good what you gotta get out of here so just it I think it three I gotta go over and be on Conan I think at three you think it through what time do you actually go onstage there I don't know well I heard they're gonna wait for you I'm in a haze of kind of interviews and stuff like that these days and coming here is just kind of like taking time off it's like I don't have to it's like we don't know if there's no hard interview questions it's just kind of hanging out it's hard when you're dealing with like you have to try to be entertaining all the time and you have to yeah we get answer the same question over and over and over again yeah the I did the I invited you to that WGA screening the other night yeah and it was um it was crazy cuz Tim Robbins was there and Tom Hanks were oh that's awfully crazy and that's crazy they were saying Tim prophets was saying to me that he was like what you're experiencing right now this kind of haze of like pressed John Cazale huh it's basically what they would do if they literally they wanted to make you insane its dick you in a room and ask you the same question over and over again all day right till you crack and that's what you're doing that's your life right now and yeah that's like if you were like a guilty person they would bring in a series of investigators they would ask you the exact same question yeah and see if you have the same answer yeah that's actually a great idea you could have like a hundred investigators they give you the same questions and you have to give detailed stories yeah you'd fuck that thing up yeah so it's been like a haze Wow what did you movie on sleepwalk with me sleepwalk with me night you the screen you did sin did you get it I don't know yet here you want to watch the trick let's watch the trailer Kevin throw it up in the trailer get here yeah it's true I always have to tell people that because inevitably someone will come up to me and they'll be like good true I'll be like yeah it'll be like was it I don't know how to respond to that like I guess I could say it louder you know yeah then did I it's probably true shit allowed yeah the big comedian Matt panda Pig leo hey y'all ready to lip-sync I can't hear you that's my lip-sync joke so here's what happened my girlfriend Abby and I moved in she's great and my sister Janet got engaged you're next coming your way better everyone started talking about marriage how long have you and having been together eight years Emma being so long that night hey I started walking in my sleep the jailer uh that's a bed how long is a sleepwalking been going on I think it's on Sarah as things with my girlfriend got more tense my sleepwalking got more did it matter first place thank you this is the first time I remember thinking maybe I should see a doctor and then I thought maybe I'll eat dinner along with dinner I've decided I'm not gonna get married until I'm sure that nothing else good can happen in my life you just say that on stage one day I was my girlfriend what do you fear most and she said I fear you'll meet someone else and you'll leave me and I'll be all alone and she said what do you fear most and I said bears as your girlfriend hear the jokes now you should probably mention you say you're gonna go see the doctor you don't you say you want to be a comedian you're a bartender I mean pick a damn plan and stick with it he's kidding but he's not as funny as you my parents have been together 40 years which ya know but it's too long if you're ever in a relationship that's moving toward marriage you're not ready to go with my sister Janet's way a shirt loser sorry no I like it though clutter great nice it looks great it was a couple really good lines and you gave mark minor part so that's a that's a big like altruistic move he had I had a on the first time I went on this podcast we really threw down he really hated me really he hated me for a long time dude he hated me for a long time didn't you really yeah he's crazy hates everybody hates himself but then then we tried to be nice guys oh no no he's been really nice to me in the last oh that's not a nice tactic that people do yeah they create conflict and then somehow know the kids resolved and then there's like this emotional connection can add something at stake he's a little bit addicted to conflict a little bit what did he not like about you oh we didn't know each other he just had this distorted perception of me you know yeah and he has this issue with people selling out in this issue right he doing fear fact I'm like shut your fucking punk rock nonsense please no but he's great in the movie and uh Lauren Ambrose and Carol Kane which I should marks a good guy he's just crazy yeah that's why he's good what he does get it what he does yeah very good at interviewing people yes he's not you know some people uh just can't quite get get the the spark going you know it's awkward interviews like when someone's act asking like half-hearted questions or doesn't have the passion for it yeah very uncomfortable to listen to yes that's most interviews yeah isn't it yeah like that's why those press junket has to be deafening at home for you yeah yeah especially for X stand up when you you know you you know so calm like always aware of people's attention span you and I were talking to the other day about they want me to do all these like morning local morning TV shows and and it's hard because they don't when you say on those local morning TV shows when you say a joke they'll say I don't know what you mean that's the worst that's the opposite of laughter the moment you have to start explaining a joke yeah I was saying that if you're if you're on one of those shows any comedian should do this if you're on one of those shows we should do is just immediately break into a Tracy Morgan it's almost getting pregnant well here after I rub your belly because that's like the funniest thing that's ever happened on one of those morning shows is Tracy Morgan rubbing his belly is my main cold she is my main cold someone getting pregnant and when he did that this poor fool and a silly show was just flabbergasted and is a Tracy aah he didn't know what to say was like stuck with a wild man on a show yeah someone getting pregnant he would slap his belly go this is my mating call so did you did you write a book first is that how this movie comes on man show it was one Mitchell Broadway in New York sleepwalk with me the one-man show and then and then I adapted into a film and then along the way actually did I wrote a book that was sleepwalk with me it was a chapter in the book sleepwalk with me other painfully true stories it was just comedic essays about sort of painful so the sleepwalking part is true yeah I jumped through a second-story window in my stuff oh my god yeah holy shit dude yeah so you wake up when when you hit the ground as I was running on the front lawn in my underwear bleeding oh my oh my god yeah second-story window that's like some night at La Quinta Inn in Walla Walla Washington holy shit was so you on the road the road yeah oh my god dude how crazy are you on a one to ten what's going on here what's going on is I I was diagnosed with what's called REM behavior disorder but on a scale of one to ten eight every how it's crazy why are we all so crazy I don't know Pam there's something up with comedians so do you have like a tool now that you travel with like a belt that's like so like hooked up to like a no joke I sleep in every night in a sleeping bag up to my neck and for a while I would wear mittens so I couldn't wear open the sleeping bag and I take medication I take a taken anti-anxiety that the doctor prescribed Wow that's so strange do you is there a trigger is there something that anxiety stress sleep deprivation like all the stuff that's really not good sleep hygiene Wow and it makes you just completely out know what my dreams it makes me angry and usually my dreams have to do with me running away from some kind of like demon or wild animal wow what the fuck man yeah holy shit that's got to be crazy I know I told a story about I've told this on stage before about being in San Francisco during a fire and there was a it was 4:30 in the morning we all got evacuated from the hotel room and a lot of people sleep with ambien and when they're when they're woken up like that they don't know what the fuck is going on yes and you could see it in their face and they would wake up in the middle of like walking down the stairs so this guy was like in front of us and he was in the middle and he's there's a fuckin whole line of people trying to get out of this hotel right hundreds of people on the stairs yeah and it's a it's a really narrow staircase and one person to those higher case as well well people were waking up where are we doing what are we doing that's why I like waking up in the middle of walking down the stairs and the wife was like yelling at the guy just keep walking the hotel top hotel what hotel where are we we're in San Francisco the hotel's on fire we're on fire like like literally didn't know what the fuck was going on just whacked out on ambien Kevin James made a turkey when he was on ambien really yeah he made a turkey okay Dan made a fucking target didn't know about it got up in the morning said what the fuck is all this like didn't know that yeah went he cooked some food everything crazy that's people all the time my sister growing up when she was like 11 or 12 my mom found her walking down the street of her neighborhood naked mama and I'm like thinking oh how what are the odds that maybe just some guy drove bombs of what a naked eleven-year-old hey walking on the street my lucky day there was a guy who was convicted of he murdered someone close to him like his his uh parents or his mother-in-law or something like that drove another house in his sleep do you know this case there's cases where it's been used as alibi this but this guy got all ya know that people have gotten on he killed her with like a crowbar starts sleepwalking Oh cry can't talk about it first on a podcast dude yeah that's that's a paper trail right there yeah how um how could you get away with that in a court of law what would we since you have it what would they say like what is if I killed somebody not anything you do like will you obviously without that window I think there's no question that you were dreaming yeah I had a dream that there was a guided missile headed towards my hotel rooms and that there were always that there were all these military personnel in the room with and they said the military personnel said to me the missile coordinates are set specifically on you so I jumped out my window so as to detonate outside the window for the sake of the platoon oh my god yeah yeah this guy beat his mother-in-law to death and choked his father-in-law into unconsciousness Jesus Christ yeah when was the last episode that you had that was even just a slight problem you know what's crazy is that making a film is actually not the healthiest thing for sleep sleep disorder so like oh how I was having anxiety and sleep-deprived and I was sleep-deprived not directing I was directing myself acting out things that I'd done in my life so I was I had an episode where I was sleepwalking my wife came in and I was adjusting lamps in the bedroom she's like what are you doing and I was like we're shooting and she was like no we're not shooting and I go I'm sorry but we are like I was actually patronizing her which is the worst thing you can do when you're sleepwalking is just insult people for not understanding your reality like oh you're so stupid you don't get it yeah don't get it oh my god that's got to be so weird as anybody ever videotaped you doing it no no but I haven't I would have been the great whacky reddits way a movie have this great yeah no no in the credits of the movie are the actual photographs of the window I jumped through and me at the hospital I took photos of all of it because when it happened I knew no one's gonna believe this this is too crazy and so that's the credits of the movie smash the window and everything like you did it like James Bond I go through the window like the Hulk oh my and I say that that's how you described it at the emergency room I was like you know the Hulk you know he just kind of jumped through windows and walls that's like me holy shit and ya know I've never videoed myself but I have this great new video technology called my wife who remembers everything i I see whatever I do or say so she's kind of explained to me what it looks she's your dictator she dictates I it's kind of a hacky mailmen men woman thing but my wife remembers everything everything that's funny you're right writes here by the way oh is it yeah is it well dude thank you very much this is um this is a story that we were talking about if anybody's interested in looking up there was a guy from Toronto in he had he lost his job due to embezzlement and he suffered from a gambling addiction so the guy was in some serious serious debt so because that he had a high level of slight uh of stress Aaron sleep-inducing saamiya and he drove he got up in his car rose from his bed he drove 14 miles to the home of his wife's parents yeah he removed a tire iron from the car God have entered the house and he beat the mother-in-law to death choke the father lot unconsciousness and then he used a knife from the kitchen to stab them I don't I don't buy that though yeah I don't buy that as an alibi seems like a cunt anyway you know yeah and then he turned turned himself into a police station I don't buy that because I mean only I I have this disorder and I could not imagine doing anything that like basically the the reason I wear a sleeping bag is that if you undo the sleeping bag the moment you start doing something that requires dexterity and focus and concentration that's what wakes you up yeah I would have been driving a car is a very specific judicial culture you should have caught you in the car where am I in that stone yeah because then I think I'm pretty sure this guy got off yeah I don't yeah I think he got acquitted man and then if the jury acquitted parks of murder and laid it later of attempted murder although the government appealed the 1992 Supreme Court of Canada see it's canon that's a problem they're too nice up there America yeah like what the fuck are you talking about you're sleepwalking when you beat some of the death with a tire iron yeah nothing wakes you up like metal to bone crack over and over again in your hands vibrating in your hands your mother-in-law's skull really that doesn't wake you up that fuck out of here you crazy asshole right Mike Birbiglia dude your movie looks fucking awesome Thanks so it really looks cool really fun it's in if people want to
