boom that's it alive we're on now fuck yeah Joe Rogan my man thanks so much for having me back thanks for coming back there's a lot of everywhere this is the fucking Tonight Show man where I go man heard you on Joe Rogan her John Joe Rogan it's been the last year in my life so I'm I can stop at stop fucking answering them when I'm gonna be back I'm back right now you are back right now yeah feels weird feels like it feels like I was here like two days ago that's a problem maybe you're drinking too much on the road I definitely was drinking too much I'm uh I went to my the last tour I ended up in I want to make it's not too bad end up in the emergency room in the last tour with the with the IVs with the fucking real isn't she yeah I went a little too I don't know I don't they said it was kind of just exhaustion and you know whatever and not you know the normal I think they wouldn't that people that the emergency room wouldn't believe me that I wasn't you know on hardcore drugs because because they come in and I'm just I'm fucking out of it and I am there like we are where you been been I've been out on tour then I go shit we know what's up and they torch it on my blood work and there was no shit in there and nothing at all no I think I think it was honestly kind of just I mean at what they still they did to find some kind of like vibe like a buck you know some kind of whatever just bug that I had been on that probably was more of it than I thought but I do think it was just kind of non-stop every night rocking out and you know pushing it a little too hard so you really did wound up in the emergency room yeah yeah it was that I mean the official diagnosis just exhaustion what were you worried about it what did you think you didn't think you just go to sleep like how does one go to the American what happened what happened was I am I was off the tour and I'm meeting with some managers and shit and in the meeting I fucking barf like I'm not in a nice building we're in a nice building talking about shit we're actually talking about the shit that Rick is over here doing it was like guys in suits and I fucking threw up on myself whoa and they go are you okay and I go I think I am and they hand me a banana to get some food in me and I couldn't peel the banana so then I just I drove myself to the emergency we couldn't peel them in have the strength to open a banana really yeah um but I do now and then I um I drove myself to the emergency room and they hooked me up to IVs like put me on fluids and everything just to give you example so they when they finally said I was good to go I went it back out I couldn't fucking find my car and I just I checked my parking ticket as like where's this lot and I called the guy in the lot he's like yeah your cars in here it's the windows are down and it's running I apparently I just drove myself to the emergency room and fucking closed the doors and walked in the emergency room and said help me Wow so yeah and I actually you know who was we talked about last time guy who was a big help to me then I was just like I reached out to search all just like you know do you ever get like just because at the time I just I didn't know I had a bug I thought was just you know pure exhaustion which again doesn't that sound like the old rock you know the rocks like heroin excuse like he's exhausted yes to cancel tour I reached out to Sturgill he's just like yeah man you gotta you know take care of yourself out there just you know it's mental physical everything fatigue you know I think I need to figure out a way it's funny I don't forget who you were talking to a few weeks ago talking about um you're talking severe shit about like suicide and stuff and about how exercise is such an important part of that and I've been on a pretty like vigorous I've been you can't tell but I've been running a ton which you've been running - yeah and I was talking to a doctor recently and he was like um he's talking about a study they did with them with like 200 to prep he told me it was like a couple made the two hundred depressed people and the the study was half of him they gave Prozac the other half they put on a strict like running regimen he said there was no difference between the two it's like they both they were both helped a ton and the running I don't want to give out you know medical information but that's you know yeah the woman I had on Kelly Brogan she's a psychiatrist she said that it's more effective that exercise is actually more effective than psych meds I'm wondering that just the fact that a doctor told me that makes me think that he was airing on you know he still wants to sell the drugs but I'm just wondering if like um because I started when I fucking run I feel fucking great I mean I can't do it in cowboy boots and shit but you know it's hard to do it's hard to wake when you aren't you do the tourist which is hard to wake up before a show and yes yeah it's very hard but you got to do it you got to do it like it's brushing your teeth like it's you know it's just something that it's if you give yourself the possibility that you won't do it then you won't do it exactly and I think in my back my head I'm like well this is a tour this is a little vacation a little break and that's just that's why I need it the most so I gotta start when you think about it as a tours all you think about I think about is work I think about is work I think about it as like that's my excuse for not oh okay oh yeah it's definitely it's definitely more work than anything yeah the human brain seeks comfort man we like to fuck ourselves up by trying to take those little naps that you don't really need and blow things off that you really should do it's a weird thing shit we just got back from New York City and I I fell asleep on the couch for what you know I just woke up from I just slept for 12 hours wow I feel I mean I feel great now but I bet it would help you with this Turin I bet if you like really got hardcore into shape and started eating right I bet it would definitely help out totally yeah well I'm not gonna we got a tour lined up for I think mid-july and I'm not I'm not going if I don't do like if I don't get up and if I don't make sure there's someone there making me do all that shit I'm hanging to do the tour because you know I've been looking at your tour online I've been looking at some of the photos and videos from your shows they're insane yeah it's been pretty crazy you know you're doing giant places I'm a giant but you know hoping it gets bigger but um it's been it's been fun it's a it's a it's been a fucking blast you know it went to me one thing I hate to change the subject but it's just like um I got the new record out here oh yeah and I'm still making records yeah this I think this one's better Jamie woody that's not I mean I mean like actual physical copy I know it's the only thing I could bring I can't like bring it out like it's linked to Spotify I don't know isn't that where you fucking paid yeah it's almost like these are kind of silly now yeah because I gave it to one guy he's like my you give it to somebody that the desktop I mean their laptop doesn't have a CD player realism like thanks for the CD I'll throw it in the back of the car yeah load would you listen to it in the car most cars still have a CD player yeah Wow I'll bet they'll stop pretty soon oh yeah for sure I used to have a Acura NSX and had a cassette player and still the cell phone holders that's where they're putting the thing to hold him now sort of put it in your air do your air filter thing or the AC comes out to clip on that there's like a little thing that spreads out and just fits in the CD slot ahh taking up space I don't know about you but what my new thing is everywhere I go you know irenic I rent a car I'll get to the airport I'll rent a car right and the first 20 minutes is Mason in the fucking car trying to figure out the Bluetooth and it every could find that it just like every fucking one they make it so fucking upon yeah I love Cadillacs but goddamn that Escalade infotainment system is a piece of shit it's so bad it's so hard to work apparently they switched it now they're going to do apple carplay which is infinitely better you my uber driver had that the other day I asked him fine I had something to talk about with my uber driver he was telling explaining to me looked like the whole interface was just on them yeah it's like a phone yeah it's not the whole interface because you know you can't get most your apps but you get things like messages podcasts things along those lines yeah I mean the good I mean what I was kind of getting to before is you know talk about the crowds and shit which was when I first put out these crazy records of mine um you know the the us the assumption was um you know there's no work there's nowhere to go right to her estriol radio won't play me right I do him found all that shit but I don't want kiss your ass too much you know you know that but it was kind of finding this kind of like this is all everything's fucking equal now it's like it was that was kind of big breakthrough for me was like and I did a few weeks ago did Joey Coco Diaz who's my new favorite fucking dude this is the best I'm now I'm now in the Rogen world I did that and Bert Kreischer it so uh this is it's like it's like doing the Tonight Show then like cold but it's and I'm telling you these things and I've got numbers to prove it it's there is no mainstream media it's like if you go to the back door and do all this shit it's bigger than that fucking shit well mainstream media if you know even though the actual numbers that they get is it's not even close like a good show on CNN you know might get a million million and a half views if we got a million and a half downloads we pretty bummed out it yeah it's crazy because the week I came in here I never even told you this so that week I came in here another someone told me I some has access to these numbers I don't have them but they said I sold more albums from being on here than the artist that week did on SNL so this is that makes sense like what is SNL get what kind of use this and I'll get on a good episode we'll get 10 million downloads it's fucking crazy I mean also too you know here it's you know it's me talking to you on this and now it's like do they make it to the music probably not they're just they're not some funny fucker well not only that they don't watch the whole thing because SNL I love SNL sometimes SNL is one of those things that they fuck you like 70% of time yeah I got really pissed about that point seven million views with the rock yeah that's a million oh the family okay so that's their big one of the year so their big one the big one is is smaller than yours yeah a normal one okay Melissa McCarthy was 10 million is it seems bigger here are the top two okay so our top one for the year was Alex Jones which let 15 million and then number 2 be Neil I think and then Alex Jones got put out of a country record you should probably should reptilians and black helicopters and he could do it to that shit I'm Texas that shit would sell yeah fuck it would valves Jones to just went into country music country new world order music I'll fuckin yell product what shut up I'll produce that shit you should go on a show you should go on a show and just start talking crazy shit about Sturgill again yeah by the way and this is not for lawyer reasons but uh Sturgill Simpson is not affiliated with the CIA nor is he a trained CIA assassin I want to get that on the record I met last time it's possible I may have mentioned that I think you did I think you said he worked for James Comey and he was uh yeah he is no affiliation with the CIA he's doing some weird fucking gigs in Europe this this year that look a little fishy to me and I don't get it but you think you might be over there doing some hits on the side all the lawyer part of me says no but the sensible part of me said he's doing some dates in Europe with John Prine I think John Prine kind of you know talks to him sells them down and then Sturgill fucking takes was that guy who's John pronto John Prine great fucking uh folk kind of country singer he's great he's I'm just getting into the country world he I'd almost call earlier more like folk he's more than that kind of is billster him and Sturgill sharing office in Nashville yeah is bells in a weird category right he's kind of country but he's also kind of folk yeah I mean this days we don't know nowadays what the fuck is country the phone I complain about all the time but you know chasing his Bell is a bad motherfucker though oh did I damage and isn't it I heard a few songs for his new record sounds killer yeah I think he's gonna ruffle some feathers to because it sounds like a little political which is a no-no in that world you know soon it's a kind of a crazy day did you watching this shit that I said this morning homie stuff you know I didn't watch it did you watch it I watched some of it but it was I felt like it was a waste it's just like shit we knew before it's just like politicians lie Comey is like I felt like we knew well I don't I didn't see anything fucking new it seems like it's way too easy to fire him like you just decide you don't like what he's doing at firearm it didn't seem to be any like real clear definitive reason why he was fired yeah I mean like the meet like the main news is like like I said politicians lie you know news flash and the other one was like you know they kept making the point that like Trump is a different is different than most presidents or like he used to host a reality show no shit we knew there you know it's like that was their big takeaway it's like two hours of fucking I just use the time to fucking tweet about my new record saying how that shit I kept tweeting that James Comey was it was all code for my new record that he want people to buy it I know I saw something Instagram post that how to call me endorsing your album yeah he's a big fan he he said he wanted to talk about during the hearing because that's a big audience but apparently they wouldn't let him yeah collusion between me and Comey would have fucked things up is that what it's called yeah uh well I actually it's funny because this guy up because there's they say there's a chance which looking less like there's this guy Luke Combs who's like my arch nemesis even though is a good it I just is up against me this week on the country charts because my arm comes up my new album came out this week and I'm trying to beat him and I said on Twitter that Russians have colluded with Sony records to like have him outsell me and he kind of played along so we'll see I think I think I think they are I mean Nationals definitely trying to keep me down are they really are they fucking with you like how how are they receiving you now now that you've become a mainstream success because I hear about you all the time Donald cowboy Cerrone and I think you know that he listens to your music before he goes out fight Oh cowboy Cerrone reached out to me thanks to you he called he called me up and he was on the set of a movie with Michael Madsen and uh they go I don't know how it seems like last second but they go hey cowboy you got a scene tomorrow where you sing karaoke with Michael Madsen any song you want to sing and he's like fucking eating pussy kicking ass the producers like fuck you talking about he's like I want to sing eatin pussy kicking ass he's like dear the rights to this songs like I'll have it in like five minutes he just fucking calls me I call my peoples like now I'm in a movie with cowboy Cerrone and Michael Madsen singing eatin pussy kicking ass he says in the trailer you know like you know rehearsing with Michael Matz and you know gets to the sucking dick Park I think he was just like what the fuck we sing in here man so yeah he's been he's been awesome and um yeah cat like I said to I'm now in like your world you know doing I just did I was telling you before I did Joey Coco Diaz Bert Kreischer like all these dudes it's like it's cool to have it's cool cuz I went to this second albums like I gotta make my fucking money back you know it wasn't about the money I'm just saying it's like what am I gonna give me the same shit again but like knowing I have these other places to go now is so fucking great yeah well that's the there's a transition happening and I think for the longest time they always felt like the whole idea of mainstream media like that was just going to be locked up that was going to be the case forever its CBS NBC the cable news networks they were going to be there forever that's not really the case anymore it's just like I said I've got the numbers to prove it but you know I came everyone was telling me you know you can't get on fucking Good Morning America you can't be on fucking terrestrial radio and I've just kind of lucked into finding this and you guys been being supportive and just like these things are it's it's all II III think I saw Marc Maron some guy was tweeting to him like how your podcast fucking it ain't The Tonight Show or something he he said something back to the guy you know it's just all media now and that's kind of how I look at it yeah it's all fucking even where I mean I mean you guys are probably bigger than me you know that what they quote unquote mainstream media but it's to me it's just all it's all part of the same fucking thing like yeah what's bigger and what's more popular is all kind of silly but one thing that's different is that if you go to mainstream media if you go to television shows for the most part you're not going to get a hundred percent dedicated audience yet people are just flipping through the channels so some people might fall upon him because they were looking for it but a whole lot of people are just going to be flipping channels like what's on exactly and the people who listen to you like that's why the first part you know I don't want this whole Paki has to be a review of the last one although I wouldn't mind because I had a blast but the whole when they tune into you there's like it's like it's your buddy if you say by the new wheeler Walker jr. record they fucking buy it by the new wheeler Walker jr. record there did I set it they're gonna buy it now can you um it's called all wheeler by the way I just think I found out something you guys n't either you guys know about this I became a hit yesterday on some I never heard of on black Twitter you became a hit on black Twitter you know black Twitter I know he's a big fan of black Twitter so they said he alerted me to black Twitter I wasn't even aware it's a layer you're right I know but the more black people I can bring to country music the happier I'm gonna fucking be Darius Rucker's not bringing in a ton no no it's all white people yeah is it most of our girls too right probably yeah but no no I'm the king I'm the king of black country and I'll say that loud really yeah so they took a clip from a fuck you bitch from the first record and some one the big black Twitter guys put it like a clip of it and just at the tops like I didn't know country music went this hard and so then it like got it got millions and millions of views and and all of a sudden life because now my the new album Oh wheeler but now is out and the first ones going back up the fucking charts too because of black Twitter so we got white white people buying the new one and black people find the old one interesting yeah who's this guy if you know Blackford you know Daquan Daquan you know Daquan yes a really big Instagram account I'll fill it up and who is this fella is he a fella it's a group of people like the fuck Gerry accounter oh I have no idea but and then oh they're like a business definitely and then Eric a bad new fucking tweeted about it and she's that she's a big she's a singer yes she's basic R&B singer yeah the biggest thing of the 1900 a big singer the nineties oh just like my room but I wrote the song Tong I feel like I'm calling in from another planet and no idea what this looks fucking black show today yeah the black Twitter is fascinating to me I thought it was like a hashtag but it's not even Daquan 99 followers Wow yeah go dad you'll see you'll see it down there somewhere in the postal areas right there is on the right yeah I never I never heard of a country district till now ah hero [Music] two million seven hundred thousand views now within a few hours after being on the road for a fucking year I should just talk to date corn yeah well there's so many those guys that have YouTube accounts now too that they'll put up a video just talking about something that just happened in the news and they'll get 7 million views you what's crazy you say that because I am one of the guys I work with call me up you go they go who's Jehovah I know I and they go so somebody in your video keeps talking about Jehovah and so I of course I look it up there's a guy playing Vicki just fucking plays video games in his parents basement and while he was playing the video and you millions of people watch while he's playing the fucking video games he was singing my songs just along to it and like the album started sell like went back up the charts it's like that's the world we live in now as a dinner in his mom's basement singing sorry if you don't live in your mom's basement Joe but he probably doesn't he's probably making millions of dollars playing video games yeah it's crazy and then he go it calls me and then he he tweet me he goes um I always thought about doing a podcast he goes you mind if I just Skype in just do one just try it out with you I'm like that's where other you know artists would just be like fuck that I go I'm home just yeah let's do it so I went on his he posted an interview with me on his YouTube page and it just I don't know that was huge but it was just like why's my not saying why say no just like yeah that's all it's like you said it's all fucking even now yeah it's it might not even be even guys like that PewDiePie guy I don't know how much he's dropped off since the Nazi controversy but that guy was he has millions and millions of downloads for every single thing he does like he might be above mainstream media like if he that I think that's one of the reasons why he felt like they were going after and like The Wall Street Journal went after him was at the Washington Post of Wall Street Journal Wall Street Journal because both of them eventually they went after him and they kind of made it seem like he was a Nazi sympathizer he was making a few inappropriate jokes what'd he say they say he just joked around and did like a Sieg Heil salute or something like that he was apparently making fun of people that were Nazis making fun of the idea being Nazis it's crazy and all Benji Gordon I wish did I agree with you I mean like I was the like this new record I feel like there's people out there during or after you that are coming after me and try to make sure I don't chart high which by the way I'm banned from all the chains are you really yeah that's bar Best Buy Walmart make fucking nice stuff exactly what the weird thing is country music fans do and that do they piss me off yeah there's this other site pledge pledge pledge music where you can pre-order albums there I was the first album they ever dropped so they're buying CDs still is that like one of the few like genres is still bars a few genres of buy CDs so I can't compete with you know on the charts as well because they're making sure I don't go and I think honestly it's not just the language that's bothering it's the fact that I'm doing it outside this oh yeah like you can't go on Rogan and Joey Diaz and you know like we have a way we do it we do it on the radio we'd go on fucking tonight's show like you're messing up like it's all these guys in suits walking down music around Nashville like you don't tell anyone that don't tell anyone that nobody needs us you're gonna fuck up our fucking jobs yeah well I think also they don't like that you're I mean you're opening up the door for people doing pretty much anything in country music now but the crazy fucking lyrics and the fact that it's been so successful and you got people you got a whole goddamn theater filled thousands of people singing along to eat and pussy and kicking ass my favorite my favorite one is when I go out and tour and I see a sea of just like like do you know bros backwards baseball hats and all singing along which one you queer is going to suck my dick and they're singing every fucking word and for all I know like I was gonna call him to make America Gate or just cuz I think they're all going home I think they I think they cuz they listen everything I think they're just going home and blown each other do you think that you have that kind of power with a really good song get a guy to go home oh I mean if anyone can it's me cuz my songs are that fucking good but I mean but there's but there's no way these dudes have ever in their life scream which one here is gonna suck my dick yeah I wouldn't I would imagine you know fucking open fucking area yeah but along with a bunch of other people doing it that's the thing gives them freedom yeah I think it's weird yeah it's probably weird for their wives when they go looking at my wife yeah what'd you do tonight we went out with 800 dude screamed about blowing each other should go hmm did you actually blow each other like girls will find a loophole well no we didn't actually do it okay yeah I know I think I'm kind of I'm hoping to get some of the women back with this with this do you think you lost a lot of them with fuck you bitch no the women that's the woman's favorite song because they could I think they could sing it too they can they they see it like from um vote Reapers both wait yeah that they had that much that they had that much like for example the woman who made me write fuck you bitch had that much power over me to make me write that does she know who she is um I think she does now unfortunately but um decision she laughs no I think she's honestly upset and I've and I've had it that's happened a couple times I've been I've been on some uh pop part you know this this is new this is podcast I fucking love called I think you talked about before two guys we fucked by yeah yeah which is basically women talking about women talking about dudes the way that guys talk about women right and I fucking love and and it's the way women talk about men when we're not around so it's like an eye opener for dudes but for some reason there's been no no one's really done that before and I was in New York to impress and they'd reached out before they wanted to use one of my songs I was like well I'm out that's I kind of stopped by of course I just start telling a bunch of fucking stories then my phone starts blowing up like don't fucking you know don't tell no dog that shit and I got in a lot of trouble for that one so you can't really go telling those kind of stories on because my thing was not I I didn't know that the pop podcast was that fucking popular yeah they're very popular too a lot they're a good example of what I use is like people who try to say that oh you can't start a new podcast and have it be successful today I'm like that's not true those girls started that podcast just a couple of years ago it's fucking gigantic yeah I mean I got a lot of fucking people talk I mean I gotten a lot I lost some pussy over but I got I got in a lot of trouble that's a well don't forget I got a podcast too but I do yeah you when did you start doing that like a month ago um it's act do it's weird as it's doing it was a number one on one music podcast for like a month and I and I and I'll even admit like the problem with doing a podcast now and you I kind of want your notes on this but the problem is someone like me who sells records is I didn't I don't get the months of testing and torino it's like they hear it from the everyone was to the first you know there's no way there's I can't experiment as much and I can't you know I see what you're saying yeah well your purchase with us to our first ones are terrible one saying without to him but but yeah but but it was probably four but it was at least before it got huge yeah yeah for sure but they're still available like if people who I'm gonna start from the beginning they might get to Episode three and go fuck this dude yeah I mean you were in the early days you were doing just like straight to video right with like video effects and surely yeah sometimes yeah we had snowflakes in the background and we do it right to a webcam I love it yeah I mean it's been fun it's it's a cool way to just talk directly you know to your people but um it's not my natural what happens is in and you had yet you talk to a good example about the other day which is you just have conversations like I've been doing them all over the phone because all the musicians on talked to on the road and when you do over the phone it becomes like an interview and I don't want to interview I just want my friends over the phone and over Skype they're both weird I mean it's better than nothing some people do well like Sam Harris does a good podcast over Skype but I think that it's uh it's just you lose something want to be in the room with somebody yeah I mean Burt was one who told me that and said like you know don't do it over the fucking phone and and then I did one in person with a singer I really like it was so much fucking but we were just hanging out that's well that's what I like to listen to I was in the podcast but he's hanging out you know so when you started touring from your last album and it was this just out of the gate surprise smash hit took the whole country music industry by storm what was that like did you feel surreal because it seemed surreal on the outside I felt what felt surreal was because of my that's why it's this one so much different is like and I kind of hate it there's expectations because what I I left the studio on the first album with the I just paid cash for I think I told you I didn't have a label I don't have any way to release it and I was just like this is a great fucking record but it's a bummer no one's going to hear it and I finally started getting it out there and so then I really thought it was going to just be like a cult record and like I was gonna run into some dude ten years from now and down the street go you know I did the record but then waste you know the guys who do the tours for me were calling up like you're not gonna fucking believe this man we sold out you know you know la like the whole west with we're for me is because it's so country to me he's like we did a West Coast where I'm like what the fuck we doing a west coast two or four it's like the whole West Coast sold out it's like well how the fuck did I sell tickets in Seattle and Portland there's no fucking sense to me like do they even know what country music is there I think I I think it's almost like they're looking at me like in a glass cage like look at the look at the redneck in his like natural habitat kind of I think so I think they're just having fun man well I think they're having fun I think is that to I think they're also if you there are a lot of people out there do love country music and if you love it there's not much of it left anyway not to mention not much the probably goes to Seattle or Portland isn't there seemingly some sort of a resurgence though in like really good country music seems like there is seems like there is a little bit you know you know the Sturgill is but you know the got the guys who still aren't Chris Stapleton Stapleton yeah um yeah I mean III definitely lit too but then again you know there's there was an award show on there's like a country music award show on like every fucking week now rather really well there's a lot there was one last night like for the CMT Awards like know how they even have alternately a show fuckin redneck reality shows what would the oldest it is CMT still country music television because I think they're like changing or something right on to changing like third I think yeah they reached out to me about some and I said I told him I want to host the top 20 countdown I got a hard pass on that I think they're like would you make fun of the artists I'm like if their shitty yeah I'm just like all right so you're fuckin later um yeah I feel like um real country's coming back but I also feel like the shitty stuff is getting bigger like they're going to say it like it's not that pop bro country shit which I talked a lot about last time in Florida Georgia line yeah well there's a new there's a new song by this guy Christian sand called fix a drink that just came out and I'm looking at everything it's coming out saying we cuz mind the Sun fix a drink was though it was the worst fucking thing I've ever fucking heard of my fucking life it's this white guy just kind of rapping about like Fox News and he sings about I can't fix the world but I can fix you a drink I'm like jesus fucking christ I mean it's doing well it see it's doing better than me there's a lot of mutants out there yeah I mean there's a lot of fun I mean who the fuck would I mean even if you're not an expert music fan who we want to listen to a song about fuck dude fix it a fucking drink a dude who wants a fix a drink that dude limited use of his brain exactly just like that's like his mane that's like its Mane um but to think about it there's a we know there's a lot of fucking idiots right think about how many people just dull minded folks and then think about how few people are talking directly to them then finally someone comes along does like finally finally yeah finally finally enough about you know life and you know enough Sturgill you know about life and like what it's about finally someone that I can relate to just you know how much how much whiskey how much sour you know that's what I want to fucking hear some people just want life simple down it isn't that sort of always been the knock on country music in the beginning is that country music what it does is sort of reinforces these stereotypes of this simple feel and now a lot doesn't really you know it's that they tried to get me on that shit before I was just saying okay so I think they're just like you know you're like doing like a German you're like mocking RedNet you're using a mocking right like red like redneck shit and all the crazy shit out you know like fucking your cat and like you know you know killing your dog and all that shit but I think they got that I was just kind of making fun of my buddies back you know like right what the cliche of being a redneck was you know and I still see it's weird because we're talking about the political shit like in SNL there was a there was a sketch on us to know near the end of the season arm you saw but it was Alec Baldwin doing Trump and he was in a small town called Union Kentucky is what they said which is actually not far from me and the whole idea of the sketch was that this that um which I've been hearing a lot with these were these southern people who were so dumb that they voted against Trump against their own interests which I'm so sick of that fucking narrative you know against their own interest how can they say that well they're just saying that like there's a lot of the ribbon in the press about how you know these all quote-unquote southerners and rednecks voted for Trump but it's like they're the ones who are get they're the ones who lose their health aren't you even hear that a lot I don't know maybe it's just from my point of view but I found it very condescending to uh to Kentuckians just you know I don't like the sketches it seems like you know Oh like v like the 40's you know like some character I mr. Trump I got a quote you know it that kind of shit you know I think that people are nervous because the same thing that you're saying when you're talking about oh there's no mainstream media anymore and there's just media when a guy like Donald Trump gets in office it's it's changed what being a politician is because now it seems like anybody could be a politician now we had a reality star that became the president United States what what you know what is this when there's no real president yeah there's just a guy we have no control like we can't there's nothing we can control and we can't stop non politicians from being president anymore and it seems like they would be able they were able to do that for a longest time obviously there's a lot of other factors he's very rich he's very famous he handled a bunch of politicians for many many years and paid them off and understood and understood from behind is that gonna be the next 20 presidents are they all gonna meet out like resident Kanye coming up mark Mark Cuban is the one they're talking about that he's a good one he's he's rich he's on he's nice guy smart yeah I mean why not he'd be superior it's entirely possible he might do it yeah I mean that's the one I keep hearing but yeah it could just be from now on you just buy the presidency well it could be I mean until we figure out that's a dumb idea that being a president is a dumb idea it's a dumb idea to have one person running shit that just the fact that Trump has the ability to fire that call me guys ridiculous did he just say yeah I mean I don't like what you're doing you're fired like doesn't he have to have some like rocks that like if you get fired from Walmart they have to have a reason like you can get fired from the fucking head of the FBI and you just he doesn't like the fact that you're not willing to drop an investigation that seems like that seems insane the whole yeah the whole thing is just fucking like I mean there's nothing more you can say other than that this guy will host reality show now he's present and I think that's other thing that fucking scares people about ol wheel Walker Junior's you know country stars aren't allowed to fucking talk about that shit you know you can't talk politics you got you got it fuckin right man when the Dixie Chicks talked about joystick Oh bill go back yeah they're done what happened with that they they were essentially blackballed from country music for years for saying that they were against the war which by the way which Trump basically elected sent you know he was he kept saying he was against that war - yeah so they like you know I think they said that he's an embarrassment that they're embarrassed that George Bush is their president I think I'm more to do they said it at a club in England so doing it out of the home it's like you can't lead the country and talk shit about American Lawyer but this if that was pop music that would be super standard like no big deal that's the weird thing I mean like you know that mean we grew up on like Dylan and you know Beatles and whatever hundred people all they did was talk about that shit right Neil Young it's like he has whole albums just you know fuck this politician fuck this guy and you just can't do it in country I don't know why that is well it's the same thing we're talking about that simplified narrative that these stereotypes of this world where you know you go to bed and you get up in the morning the birds chirpin and you work hard all day and you know and everybody loves God and it's it's just this simple version of the world that's boiled down to like there's there's things that are allowed inside the simple version of the world and there's things that are expected and there's things that are just not discussed you don't discuss suck a dick and kicking ass yeah I mean you're supposed to keep that to yourself a sucking dick and kicking ass that's supposed to in any way mock the president well that's that that's yeah I mean that's the other thing too is a you know my first single pussy king then the first song is I put that out and I got severe one got so pissed you know you can't beat I go and I send the interviews I'm like I heard worse talk about this on meet the fucking press you know they show right all that grab the pussy talk yeah I was like I'm not grabbing the pussy I'm just talking about how I'm gonna stick my dick in it if with with consent you know yeah I don't think I used to work and sent in the song but I think even grab them by the pussy was implied consent because he was saying they let you don't let you grabbed don't you think that that whole thing was so fucking weird because it's like I hate to still be talking about it but it's like I just found it funny I like it didn't change my opinion of the guy at all just well you know as a scumbag I mean you knew in whatever ways this is who he is I think part of it too is on about you guys but like I'd never heard that phrase before grab by the put you know it's like no yep that's something I heard so it was new here I have a question for you guys I have a question for you what do you think years of theory I have which okay do you think somewhere in the Trump Organization I've been wanting this for like a year now secretly after that happened because he's smart no doubt he's smart businessmen copyrighted that phrase because you know for spring break from now on there's going to be grabbed by the pussy shirts may I share a little while you could sell it but I think that's kind of died off those things have like a short shelf life like those fidgets spinners anybody making those fidget spinners salesmen as you can now because a year from now knows about any no yeah that part of black Twitter no no no it's kids they have these little things and they spin them and they hold them up on their finger and they spin around in circles and people really find that I'm like crazy yeah I was looking down the other day I was like how the fuck did this become a popular item but it won't be for very long you know it's now you say yeah I know I've seen those online online just these things spinner yeah there knows that have done we've become you said watching shit spin around yep well there's nothing to doing this anti-stress device that you hold on to and it's got like switches on it and buttons that don't do anything you just hit switches and press buttons and supposedly like if you hold on to this thing while you stressed out and start hitting switches and pressing buttons you feel better yeah I'm sure that works like a fucking charm yeah I think go back to let's just run instead oh by the way we haven't mentioned but I think Rick you're cut uh I'm so fucking big now they're doing a fucking TV special we have a guy here from Showtime Showtime special they're doing it they're recording my life and work and uh you can and I talk you know it's weird for me to gonna that they're making a TV special about me but they're let me do it on sensor not you know telling the real story and uh I was like fuck it just shoot it alright man but I'm they follow me around like that and I'll do an interview and have five minutes they'll just go get the fuck out Wow said if I said does he does he bring it up afterwards and go hey man the way you told me to fuck off now that dudes that guy's really cool because uh the guys doing it I'm not allowed to say his name was he's part of the Jackass crew so he's he's um literally jet the show jackass so like the fact that he there's no fucking goat cheese and shit I'm sure he's just happy yeah he's excited there's no explosions and also don't forget he's working so anytime someone says fuck off he's off the clock so ah there you go that's right so he gets to relax yeah so this Showtime thing is it uh there they do on a Showtime special like you're gonna play your music on yeah I don't know how much musics gonna even follow me around forever and they're gonna do like I don't know what the title because like I said this is literally the first time I ever mentioned on any sort of Jesus it's a scoop yeah it's you got that Rogen exclusive button you can press yeah wish we had one Tom Tom and they've been following me around for years and I'm not years but for a couple years now and we got Olaf ously I've been we got footage from the old days they're gonna tell my whole life story and we'll get some songs in there and you know I would just like to be able to hopefully fuckin tell it my way and not sick of all these fucking uh all these lies and rumors lies and rumors yeah I mean it was it was weird too because I was another thing too about combing today which is Comey admitted he's like they kept bringing up these New York Times articles he's like no that's not true you're almost like backing up Trump me always he say like you know these these stories if the head of FBI under oath saying that the story he said it's go how much of his trees like none had the FBI saying that New York Times article is completely untrue you I gotta believe you know yeah there's definitely people that are printing things they hope are true with limited amount of references that can verify it yeah it's like and there's also - there's the stories that will sell newspapers it's not just that it's also the bias of the people that are writing the stores were heavily left-wing you're really freaking me out with that bottle you keep opening it and closing yeah this is still from this from the airport are you tweaking yeah seems like you got something going on with that opening and closing that bottle it's like I'm gonna stop a fidgets thing I go one of them fidgets spinners that's what it is we're some we water bottles to keep the stress relievers wheeler Walker water bottles um what were we just talking about of stress you're talking about New York Times them oh the bias of the people who are writing it they want to get at Trump so if they have any sort of an article that even might be true they kind of think might be true it seems like it would be exciting if it was true they just run with it I thought that was interesting what Comey said actually which is like because it's highly classified information he's not allowed he's not allowed to go out there and say it's not true right because that would that would you know sure would put them in a weird place of that then you know what top secret information isn't true so he has to keep quiet about it so so when he's doing these interviews and they're there I rather when they're he's under investigation they've given these statements how do they justify them how does he say it's not true because isn't that still top secret because this is you know he's under oath and they're asking him I guess is the only reason but there's there were some questions where he said I'm not allowed you know I can't say that in an open hearing yeah that's what I figured was one of the reasons why Trump could fire him because he wouldn't be able to talk about the investigation until they hired a special prosecutor and all the stuff that you're seeing now hmm I would assume that you know people like call commis going to talk I'm like well he can't really talk that's one of the reasons why Trump can fire him because that guy's under oath and you know rather all the stuff that he's talking about what's he allowed to talk what's he allowed to talk about now that he's gone saying is it same rule now it's top secret everything's talked secret I bet he's not allowed to talk about job at all I bet they could fire him not not fire mother I bet they could arrest him if he does he admitted today that he lead admitted they leak some stuff yeah but he leaks stuff that was unclassified he just leaked his memos they weren't classified and people are freaking out about it like no he he did it because it was real simple he didn't want to be the one who was making the statement and the way he described that he had a funny description he said it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach they just follow him around and look for more and he was like I just wanted to get the information out there so I had someone put it out there but he was honest about it and you know it lets you to understand that that's how these people do business and this is this is one of the ways that information does get I think it's just I think a lot of it is guys like was it movie all the presidents man I think yeah it's a lot of guys who think that they're going to if they get the scoop they're going to have a hit book and they're like you know Brad Pitt's going to play them in a fucking movie right if they get this fucking scoop well there's also that but then there's just if you're an investigative journalist and you're covering the president knighted States this unprecedented event where a reality star has become the fucking president and he's a liar and he just keeps lying about shit and getting caught lying about shit and there's a bunch of people that don't care that he's a liar everybody loves and they just jump on in with it and you don't expect a higher standard or behavior from the number one most influential person in the free world you know he's still tweeting about like people that suck and in people who get terrible Radiesse this crazy shit I mean like I mean I'll never forget I remember watching the Republican one of those Republican debates and he talked about how fat Rosie O'Donnell was okay can we do all the debates like this I fucking love this you know like a roast debate like how the fuck even Rosie O'Donnell's gonna be sitting there like why are they talking about my weight well Rosie O'Donnell has decided to dedicate most of her Twitter feed to shitting on Trump now she's losing her marbles man what about a Kathy Griffin to that sink that was fucking what did you think about that when you saw her Kathy Griffin holding up that fake head of Donald Trump covered in blood what did you think well maybe my all I think is how fuck and how fucking badly do you need fuckin attention ya know was like I mean why did you think best-case scenario like right I think if if yeah if that's your if your viewpoint is that like you what you want the president's hit I mean just to twist it imagine Ted Nugent holding up Obama's head like right it's over dude like well Ted Nugent times say he want Obama to suck on his machine gun he did say that words are less powerful than that you know image I guess I heard a picture's worth a thousand words that's what that's what they're saying no that's what they're saying well shit well I didn't know is that I know he's gotten that big yeah maybe more than a thousand if it's a picture what was it for I never found out she's just doing it to get attention that's what she's digging around the house and just like I'm a well she had a photographer come over and the photographer the setup thing and you know they covered this mask with blood and she held it up like she was Isis I mean this is not you know talked about like guillotines yeah that's never friends that's I mean that's just a sign of a fucking idiot you know it's like not only if that's your viewpoint you got it be smart enough to know that that's only gonna hurt your your where you're coming well not only that she did this press conference and painting herself out to be a victim she's saying he's a bully and he's trying to ruin her career and then she's like celebrating iconic comedy she does she was like you know I've always pushed to push the boundaries and I'm a you know my comedy is you know it's not for everybody but it's at she was like like relishing the moment to express how she feels about her comedy or to to sort of describe me comedy and it's not a free speech thing I mean no one's saying she didn't have the right to do it we're just all saying she's it's fucking it's fucking lame it's an attention thing it's all it's purely an attention tank to the point where there's no there's no entertainment value to it like it's one thing if you have some ridiculous idea in your head that is funny or is entertaining at so I'm saying what was that but was the best-case scenario there's no there was nothing no thought it was just like let's do this people are going to see it well the only funny part for me was that you know you know you know that guy Mike who does all the photoshopping for Joey Diaz I don't know if you know him but he's been helping me with some photoshop and the second I saw the picture I go do me a favor put my head Kathy Griffin's head and change Trump to Sam hunt and he did fucking did in five minutes and looks pretty good and I cleared up so then I loved how some of the people thought I was like actually once I was like no no it's a comment on the fuckin Kathy Griffin I didn't hear about the Kathy Griffin thing until I saw her apology that's how I found out about I found out about it through her apology on Instagram and so I was clicking on this video and it was her apology and she looked like hell she looked like she hadn't slept and she's freaking out when she lived awesome as opposed to when she looks hot as fuck yeah that's good Photoshop right there it's perfect your head sits perfectly on her neck it's weird yelling I've hair's perfect my beard and her beard look exactly the same I don't think she has a beard dude okay but um I saw the apology and just I was like what did she do like she's like I went too far I went too far you know I'm sorry I've seen the comments I went too far I apologize comedian and sometimes we go too far those are what the fuck did she do and then I went and saw what she did and I was like oh like I wonder I'm trying to think like I have you have you heard anybody even in the comment if you heard anybody defending her yes who you have to say I don't remember their names but it was a it was a defense of the intent behind it which I agree with the intent behind it meaning what she was trying to do is be funny she was trying to get some attention she was trying to it's like a joke that you do that fall short like here's a perfect example Bill Maher's joke did you hear what he said yeah yeah yeah so if you people haven't heard the senator from Nebraska was it a senator mm-hmm god damned his fucking voice month the senator from Nebraska I believe said you should come visit we could have you work in the fields and Bill threw his hands up ago not me I'm a house nigger that's what he said and yeah everybody's like what the fuck like what makes you think you could say that and when he did HBO released a statement they were pissed off and there was a fire Bill Maher Twitter hashtag thing going on that one don't you think too a little more Alicia I understand the intent of his joke yeah he was trying to be naughty yeah he made a mistake look Pete here's the thing he's working on a show okay he's working on a very important show for HBO that is a very high-profile show this is extreme amount of pressure extreme amount of demands there's a lot going on behind the scenes he's probably working very hard he's probably tired and he's in the middle of interview and he's trying to make something entertainment the guy gives him an opportunity right the guy says you could work in the fields and he's thinking work in the fields for him work where the Veals uh know who works in the fields slaves work in the fields who's the guy that's in the house okay I'm gonna say this and he just goes with it to try to be shocking because he's you know he tries to be that naughty edgy guy and it just was it was lame and it wasn't funny yeah I get more pissed when I watch when I see it his shows seems like he's when he makes a joke and they don't he gets mad when they don't get a fucking laugh that's the part that bothers he's a silly boy yeah but when when he when he made a joke and it was lame he was just trying to be funny like he was trying to entertain people it's important to him his show is important to him it's a very good show he works hard at it and most of the jokes are really funny and there's a lot of edgy controversial jokes on Bill Maher show that are really funny and he that's the line he pushes in sometimes you cross that line and he crossed that line is he racist fuck no is he a bad guy no yeah what idiot no no he's a fucking mistake he's a human being it wasn't like the n-word slipped out talking derogatory well you know he was trying to make that point about slavery he was just trying to be silly he's trying to be funny who's like he's not like being remember when Dog the Bounty Hunter got caught dropping a bunch of n-bombs about people there's there's a way look there's no words that are forbidden and the idea that the that's that word exists in countless rap songs but you can't sing along to those rap songs and yet oh you're a racist Walmart it's ridiculous I think those rap songs are banned from Walmart too though you know I do and I found out recently which is those um there's Walmart versions of all those I didn't know that oh well they they take the cuss words yes I mean they know that I fucking ordered a iTunes once a copy of one of the dead not dead presidents um who the fuck was it it's one of those like hardcore rap bands and as I was listening to it it was all this like backwards shit you know like bleeped out or like like empty spots where there was the III I downloaded a mmm and all I heard all these backward sounds I thought like any others old sergeant pepper's shit I guess they took it all the bad words and just played him back even worse I listened to one from Gang Starr and they had alternative words alternative words I was like oh no you can't have alternate words my thing is gangster I don't the hip hop guys and while there's all those like jay-z or some big I go fuck this way ain't doing this anymore I think they're not doing anymore but the reason why they do it is for money there's so much money out there I mean if they can get their shit played on radio and get the more it's all about exposure I mean you know it's all about the the most amount of people you could reach with your stuff yeah why they asked me to do a clean version I said no good for you but my my um my morals definitely cost is gonna cost me a lot of fuckin cat nah I don't think so I think in the long run it'll save you money cuz it'll it'll elongate your career because if someone's a fan of yours and they're at a barbeque and someone pulls out the lame version like oh you got to hear this guy's fucking hilarious this guy's crazy and then it's like f you bitch fu b you broke my heart screw you girl or you never did well remember when Cee Lo Green had that forget you no no no no let's not forget you would fuck you and why the fuck's the song again why can't you say fuck you on the radio to me I mean I know why but yeah I said it's stupid because a long time ago people were dumb and they thought that the Sun was 17 miles away and they thought there was an old man living in the clouds that had friends that used harps and that you gotta be careful with the words you really are clinging on to I mean the same thing in like you know TV like radio they're like they're still like but like do it's like there's all there's YouTube like uh you know what we did we premiered another video from this record again we did the pornhub premiere you know uh-huh like fuck dis let's reach the people fuck up you know yeah you premiered on pornhub which is hilarious how did that come about um I reached I uh what happened was my people were just kind of like you know like let's find a place to premiere you know they always do this thing we're like you can premiere video on like I don't know will be an example like AV Club or some shit you know and we're rolling stone or some I go give me those numbers you know it's like so-and-so gets 50,000 when I go what about look up pornhub numbers it was like two hundred something million I think one of the I think we're Rolling Stone was something like the 8,000th or something biggest web site and I go check out what pornhub is and porn I was like number 19 in the world and I go well go go let's just reach out to them and see if they'll premiere I believe the first guy to premiere country music video on pornhub the problem is when people go to pornhub they're sweaty and nervous and they're just thinking about beating off well to get in the wrong mindset well I think I think after you beat off your you already fucking chill outs to listen to some good country yeah but you're also really ready to hide what website you were watching I don't know about a browser and erasing your history it fucking worked man I mean everyone I see I see a lot of people you know like I don't know how many people I could tell you came out to me like I first heard about you on because they don't want to admit it you know right but the numbers show that people fucking it was crazy because we premiered it on pornhub and they're like it was almost like you know if you guys do this for me I'll show that you know it works and it self you can sell things besides fucking boner pills you know right well it's also it's one of the things that if you did it just knowing that you did it people would go there to check it out like he's be premiere to shit on pornhub exactly I go there to check it out and it's funny cuz I we put it up but like you know noon or something I was like I thought it's like hundreds of millions I think the views aren't that high and someone there was like wait till five o'clock when people get off work yeah beaten off yeah I was like five o'clock the numbers fucking just shot through the roof it's like once I fucking work bell rang it's like they were fucking yeah people get in trouble for beating off at work right you can get fired yeah it's a bummer I wish there was like a sexual ease there's no country music section of pornhub you know do you think there would be due to just be the wheeler Walker section yeah right now is III got to figure out how to cuz I set up my own channel to UM printer that video and I got figure I turn it off I get alerts on my phone every fucking two minutes so-and-so clicked like on your pornhub video or so-and-so like from like left a comment on your pornhub videos like I gotta get that shit off it's all day it's like I work on the night to like a buzz yeah the phone's okay it's just it's it's like um you know Trump G is 44 digs Europe Europe your new year new song did you ever look at some of the comments on porn website videos when they start rating videos and describing I that's how I know what to fucking watch yeah yeah well the star system is pretty good yeah when you get to the actual words you start feeling real uncomfortable yeah what were you expecting yeah I didn't like how she winced when we went in her house huh Jesus yeah like sometimes you'll go on there and you'll see the first things just like don't watch this one fucking finish he finishes inside her you can't see shit but yeah thanks for the heads up you know Jesus Christ people get mad they think it's fake its fake coming like wow that's weird yeah I believe in fake news I don't believe if they come there's definitely fake um I've seen it seem fake dicks nice you have seen one he always has sex with his pants on because he's got a big fake rubber dick and it has a button and it worked jizz and he presses the button it comes out it looks like what's that Cetaphil that face lotion that people use what's that your self no no no that's for zits Cetaphil oh it's like that it's face soap it's kind of like yeah I just looking I saw one of those too and then right before he is it was like a hard cut like you'd sit like you tell that they filled up the fake dick machine they had to pump it up to get it to the to the top I wish I could sit here honestly said in jackoff to that one Wow now do you think you're going to have more songs that come out on pornhub or is that a one-time thing um what about you jizz you ever thought about going to one of the other comp competitors website somebody yell some company called perv City gave me a get free membership perv City yeah I never heard of them but they're looking to get through your webcam that's what they're looking to do I think they were looking for me to mention on your show I just fell for it you fuck I didn't mean to sorry god damn it um but they got their money's worth I guess but yeah I think if I could do only poor I mean CMT ain't gonna fucking play it so now they won't even play one of your clean songs how many clean songs do you have like word no swearing zero I just like I'm rounding off there but yeah would you know what's weird too is I'm so I got one of my new tunes it's definitely an American thing because I just this the CMT of Australia whatever it is my out my one of my new songs from the new record is like in heavy rotation there and that's thing about you know a stretched-out pussy and shit in it whoa and they play in regular rotation I guess they're just Australia they don't give a fuck they don't give a fuck in Australia they're savages those people they're descendants of prisoners and they're just free over there and that they got I'd even send the video I think they took it off YouTube and just put it on fucking TV no they're they're pretty badass in Australia legalized prostitution really oh yeah they want me to come over and do some shows and I'm like that's a long fucking tree knocks a long trip but you would sell out over there but here's the thing that weeds illegal there what's really so backwards you can sing about a stretched-out pussy on TV and weeds illegal crazy legalize prostitution no weed now how soon do you think because I keep looking at the I think weeds going to change big Kentucky you know my home state is the place where I think it'll be the most cuz I know a lot tobacco farmer for my friends of mine whose families are in the tobacco farm business which is like they he doesn't they need that shit right now yeah they would make they could get their business back and I don't know why it's not legal there it's renewable it's very easy it doesn't require much in terms of like resources less pervious and I and I've seen I'm seeing the tide change every time I go home you see more and more you know legalize you know from like more more businessmen and shit in town you know yeah because it would really help the economy well it's also people realize it's stupid it's stupid just like making whiskey illegal is stupid it was dumb they figured that out in the 1920s and the fact that here we are in 2017 and they haven't completely embraced it that's one of the things that pissed me off about this Jeff Sessions guy like what a giant step backwards that asshole is coming back with wanting to bring back just say no and yes a marijuana legs aren't good people it's basically what's like what's that crazy movie it was basically the AH cracy now what's the crazy weed movie from the like oh yeah reefer man reefer madness he was like acting like that it's like he's just a guy doesn't smoke pot and probably never has and doesn't even know what it does his idea of it is like people do in math or sniffing glue or something he doesn't know what he's talking about yeah it's fucking it's it pisses me off too it's just like um well it's also there's a lot of money involved I mean these guys are all whores you gotta you gotta pay attention to like who's butter in their bread and there's a lot of people that have very strict agenda if you go out there and start talking about look that's one of the things that pissed me off about Hillary Clinton more than anything she gave some sort of a speech and in that speech she said that she was absolutely in every sense of the word against marijuana legalization well fuck you old lady she also said she also said she was against should she wanted flag-burning to be illegal right she was also against gay marriage until 2007 or 2013 yeah they say we'll forget things about they just wanted a just think when you just say the word Democrat that you're like you believe in all these things their strategic their opinions aren't real their opinions are their strategic sort of conglomeration of ideas that they think are going to serve them well when they go out in public that's that's what their pain they forget that it's 2017 everything there's a record of fucking everything yeah me I was getting pissed because there were a couple weed companies who wanted to sponsor some my tour but it's too complicated right now cuz on different states like it would could be like I could get arrested in certain states just for just for advertising advertising you're just crazy like so I couldn't put on a tour bus or anything so there's no way to really do it right now and you also become a target in the states where it's very illegal we're yeah we're cops have been arresting people for a long time you've got them trained to arrest people then all sudden you tell them they can't like what let's in Italy it's legal now like what fuck that like there's guys that still want to arrest people out here out here I mean there's there's still arrests that are taking place in in other states but so fucking DC for for instance Washington DC marijuana is legal people are still getting arrested for it they don't they don't spread that around how exciting to know that black people it's not white people getting arrested for it it's black people black Twitter yeah well daint you know it's it's a reason that they can arrest you they could find a reason to arrest you and look there's a lot of gross shit that goes along with law enforcement but one of the grossest ones is these fucking people have requirements for how many people they're supposed to arrest they have quotas they're supposed to be making or how many people they pull off pull over how many tickets they write you know there's it's been a long time yeah yeah you're the wrong guy the wrong time or you know the cop just decides he's gonna arrest you for it because it's federally illegal and just makes a call no it's not good yeah me if it's fucked up that you could you know I could have a tour bus with like you know you know bourbon on the side and go across country and back and that's fine but which you can advertise on the fucking road work and kill people yeah my friend uh Ron white he runs around giant truck that has his uh number one tequila on it he's got a huge bus huge ass tour bus which says number one tequila on the side my big well pride nevertheless yeah they pay high paying good money and I was also like this is it's his company okay yeah I was fuckin excited about some fuckin marijuana money like let's help me I'll get a nice bus yeah people have asked me to partner up with them or to get involved in Mike's and at the time yet yeah it's your agree you beat you be target number one that's not does it's it's worth it financially but it's not worth in terms of like the mental mortgage that you have to pay to be involved something that's always illegal I've always wondered about that like I always wonder like you know like Snoop Dogg's on tour if you see see Snoop Dogg's bus why wouldn't the cup they do they do all the time oh he's been pulled over for he's been arrested before yeah makes it's weird to just be that adamant about it you know dude it went after Willie Nelson you don't have to fucking really know here's the thing though like if you're if you're a STONER an announced owner all you have to do is just know somebody in a town I'd you have to travel with it like traveling with is stupid like people that get busted with we like don't you know there's weed where you're going yeah but yeah I don't think I've gotten off stage once and there hasn't been a joint ready for me for some dude I've never even met yeah there's always something but the thing is do you smoke that weed um I usually do but I would say don't do every cup every once in a while yeah I'll smoke it up later that night I'm like something don't feel right in careful people our gig they're going hardcore people are going hardcore some dude was telling me about the spray that he invented that's an acid spray it's LSD in spray form and he goes just as many pumps as you take off of this spray is how deep you going to Alice's rabbit hole what Jesus Christ did you see that there's a new documentary of the section here just talking to him the documentary oh that's pretty good I don't actually like I'm not a big grateful at Fame but there's a documentary out now about him that was like it's pretty crazy watching them in the old fucking days I like the Grateful Dead gene I'm with you like I don't get it I watched this to try to get into it but it was the the acid test they were doing back then were fucking crazy they would they would dose the fucking record company dudes yeah but people just dosed people back then which is one of the things I think is we're seeing a dick move well I think it's one of the things worth it seeing with this Bill Cosby thing I think people had a different opinion about dosing people I think Bill Cosby was amongst a group of many people that were dosing people back then I think it was soon commenting I think it was super common because they joked around about it you know Bill Cosby had a whole routine about giving people spanish fly and he's joked around about about dosing people who's the TV show he did he did a routine on someone's late-night talk show I saw that was Larry King dude it's dark he talks about Spanish he talks about Spanish funny and Larry King's are laughing as I would've cuz I would have thought he was dicking around right you as I was joking around then when find out I just think all those old dudes used to go to the Playboy Mansion and hook up and you know meet all these young ladies were very happy to see them and all I think they were dosent I'll actually actually sixties actually say that to girls when I take them out and if I go to the bar and get a drink and I'll come back with two drinks is like how do you usually do this cuz I'm sit cool but like how do you know you know right how do you know oh yeah I'm not usual you know I shouldn't be drinking this yeah yeah I bought I won't take a drink if I don't know who it is and someone just hands it to my own nowhere yeah that you it that happens a lot too they'll put shots on the stage yeah and look and then they'll call me a pussy for not drinking like ain't drink I don't know you yeah I know people I know people personally that have been drugged I know I know several people that have been drugged it's not uncommon at all hunt for tattooed woman who drugged and robbed two wealthy men of $200,000 for the cache of watches after targeting them at exclusive Hollywood

see where she's coming from just like yeah fuck me that's all fucking dope well they might have been shitheads too they might have been like real gross to her and she's might have been like I'm finna get paid so Rob these dummies acting yeah I mean it's just since Ali was too tough for some about drugging people man like it's is a very dark dark thing to do though all jokes aside it's pretty fuckin evil you put something in their drink and watch it affect them like a lab rat like you know they don't even know what you don't know people that's happened to like I want to maybe not even high school or even junior high they still are still aren't over it you know oh yeah for sure fuck me up for life rape yeah you get raped but I'm saying even like if you're like in ninth grade and someone dosed you hmm and you had like the worst fucking day of your of your fuckin life when here's something crazy my um my uncle uh in Nashville was a med student back in the 50s and he um they came professor coming in the class one day and goes uh so here's the assignment for today there's this new thing that government says the alcohol lysergic acid we only know what does to go so here's your assignment he's where I'm gonna split you up into groups of two one of you takes this and the other one has to do a report on how he reacts to it you want some weed no I'm good I got show night man um you do your show sober I do my shit I drink a little bit but I can't do if I get stoned up forget all the lyrics really difficult in his waking you off you know it's a call specific you know it's very critical yeah it's like I need to know that Rita's blowing this dude and I get it's all the names you have to explain to me you've been there but yeah and they actually actually led to the lawsuit about um what how when you weren't allowed that you were allowed to uh you know test drugs on students oh yeah but you know they did that to UM the insta Unabomber the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD experiments no way I didn't know that yeah yeah I'm doing what - dosing him up they dose the shit out of this because then they originally think of some kind of truth serum maybe they didn't know what it was so they were trying to figure out well I will albert hofmann figured it out right he he accidentally discovered it I think he was coming up with a drug to induce labor I think that was the original premise behind creating LSD and he got some of it in his hands and then on his drive home through absorption through the skin he was tripping his fucking balls off riding his bike that's the whole story behind the understanding of LSD as a psychoactive substance and human beings so they started doing all sorts of studies there's some videos from the I believe it was the British Army they dosed there their soldiers up and they filmed them they're running around laughing and giggling and they can't do anything it's like a black-and-white footage from I want to see like the 50s yeah there was a lot of that crazy footage in it that you cuz I don't think I mean it's hard to sakes it's obviously influenced a lot of great fucking music but no yeah also they were like these guys were so taking so much acid there was a part in the movie where the drummer for the Grateful Dead was telling the record company guy he goes I always loved these like kind of drugged out hippie stories this guy goes he goes we want to take a microphone and we want to record the smog in LA we want to go out to the desert with clean air and record clean air and put the two sounds together that's our I'll be a rhythm track mmm that's a lot of acid man to take and they want that to be the drum track and some guy at Warner Brothers Records in two suits like what the fuck are you talking instead gene I don't have that gene I feel like if you could play the dead to like a young fan of rap music that like never never heard the dead like a young black dude just like sit him down like tell me what you think about this they'd be like what the fuck is this that's how I feel I just don't get it it sounds to me like again like a bunch of drugged out hippies just noodle around but I think when you're on acid at the show it's amazing I've heard people say that I was never a fan of the Grateful Dead until I saw them when I was on acid I'm more than willing to agree to that because there's some songs that I've heard when I was tripping that like you go oh now I understand I remember the first time I got stoned heard Black Sabbath I remember saying to my friend like other people who listen to this without being stoned like what does it sound like if you like what's the point that what's the point of the fucking Black Sabbath if you're not stoned doesn't even make sense to me we have a Black Sabbath to me I could still listen to even not stoned they've got some great jams but just that there's something about the sort of hippie nature of the Grateful Dead people too I was always like well you're just running away from life go get a job he fucks fucking dirty here but then my own cousin became a dead head for a while she's cool she traveled with the dead for years and she was like one of those people that lived out of the back of a VW band they would they would go to a store and buy bacon and eggs and cooked them up for the people that were in the in the concert and then they would sell them and shit and that's how they got by they'd sell bracelets and shit like she lived like that for man I want to say it was more than a year she traveled around with the dead yeah it was kind of because they had a big kind of country influence to what they did according to this documentary I'm like well I don't fuck in here you know it's like I love the idea that they were making kind of trippy kind of country but it's like that's not what I'm hearing in my ear yeah I get it I get it if you're into that music but I feel like it's like food you know there's certain people that I just know like my friend Tom I have a friend not Segura Tommy Hirsch go hey Tommy shout out child to Tommy he's a buddy of mine that I've always been a fan of spicy food I can eat some fucking spicy food I go deep but not nearly as deep as this motherfucker there's some dudes that I think they their taste buds are just wired different they can just take in a different level of spice than I can like it must be affecting their body differently and I know for me like I have friends that don't like anything spicy I don't always see shit at all yeah they do this doesn't get them to me I love it man I eat jalapenos pretty much every day of the week I'm always I put hot sauce on everything I'm putting a habanero sauce on everything but some people it just doesn't work with only thing I can touch I tried these shots of like super suppose it was like there's some little shot you can take I thought was coming down with something on the road once they gave me this super this is something with like filled with vitamins and had some kind of pepper and that's supposed to help me okay I am yeah yeah it hurt it hurt but it fucking helped definitely oh yeah I wonder what the real science is behind cayenne pepper but they always like to add it to those wellness shots to make you feel like it's doing something gives you a little wound opens up your snot studies I think it's the way they market it - yeah I mean you're you feel great right after you get the shot done because you just you just kind of like can't believe you got it down there was this place that we went to that doesn't exist anymore that was in Encino it's called chili my soul and it was at place that had levels of chilli like from mild all the way up to like I think I forget what their system was it was the X system or a number system I think was a number system I think the top was like ten and one day I tried an eight and they would give you a sample and it was that like the size of those you know those little paper cups that you get like at a hamburger joint these will fill up with ketchup like it was that small a tiny little thimble full of I was like this is so little then let's just try it just try for a sample and I put that fucking tiny spoon in like an ice cream spoon like a sample spoon I put it on my tongue and I just started sneezing and hiccuping out of control snot was pouring down my nose I couldn't believe how fucking hot it was and that was just an eighth I remember thinking I had one of those nuts not probably not that hop I've everything in like I'm never gonna recover like my mouth is burning and I remember sitting on the toilet just like I was like it's like I was apologizing to my asshole alright I done do it it's like you know it was like it was just a fucking attack man that's why I worry about especially on the road like you know I can see how like you know like a big bang go get eat the wrong thing get up there and fucking shit your pants oh for sure there's also something about really spicy food that makes your shit just want to get out of your body immediately oh no yeah I was too it was like if if someone I've been in that stall at that restaurant about in this particular case I'm talking about yeah I would have I would have fucking toured through my fucking pit you know I would I wish I was gonna shit no matter what message it in the sink or the the garbage can would which way would you go honestly I think at that point I would have just probably just shit your pants no I would have taken I didn't well I wouldn't want to ruin my pants I probably would have just pulled them down just shit like on the fucking bathroom floor I'll bet you think it's hard to know I mean what's the move though if you want to be like see I bet there'd be a lot of arguments I would have gone to the urinal really shit in the urinal that's rough well thanks guys gotta clean that yeah won't you offer to clean it fuck no but I wouldn't I wouldn't know I don't think I would have umm you know it would've been too nice to do on the fucking floor it's one of the rare things about going to a public place like a restaurant or something like that you're not you shit all over the place you they don't go hey man you got to clean that you like not home it's funny before I ever hit the road I was talking to some other Oh weird yeah some some unlearnt some other musicians they were just like the main thing about the road is and you maybe know is like find a good place to it's all about find a good place to shit and like I put my heart and soul into these records like it's there's got to be more to it than that you know what support people they've already given up yeah but they're just giving up on their dreams so lighter to play drums on the road yeah exactly they're just talking about how like you know take if you're in this town there's this one restaurant that doesn't let that doesn't check you make sure eating they're like you this is like a there's like it was like it you know they give me the fucking toilet tour of America I'm like you know if that's my biggest problem it'll be fine there's something about shitting in a bath the bathroom in the gas station it's actually kind of satisfying it's like yeah it's disgusting but you're not gonna ruin it you take a terrible dump in that bathroom you just like this one I'm here for Oh or a park when you go to a park and they have those stainless steel toilets don't even have a lid and you just sit down on it whoof you got to wipe all the piss off at first before you sit down yeah those rest those rest up bathrooms are pretty nice that's sometimes I've met some of those up myself yeah you can mess him up it's a weird thing that that's where dudes chose to go to get together when they were gay and in hiding like throughout the 50s and the 60s and 70s that was like the thing you know they go together rest stops that was like was a hacky joke in the early days of stand-up comedy Sunday and I got a new song yeah meet guys meeting it really I should sell my element restaurants you'd probably sell some for sure truckers would want a few people that definitely still have CD players oh yeah um they're probably a VHS still I got a lot I definitely a lot of trucker Fame you know I definitely like meet people after the shows like you know I drove fucking 36 hours or whatever you know just see yeah we do too shout out to the truckers yeah there's a lot of people out there just I mean if you're stuck in a truck for fucking 12 hours need some goddamn content totally I mean I don't know how you do without like I think some of those guys don't know technology that well but without to have an access to podcasts or fucking Spotify that shit how'd you throw the guys you'd be amazed I think truck drivers are more in tune with that kind of technology like entertainment technology that they can take in while they're driving than any what is that Jam it's the luxury sleeper cab for a long-haul truck oh wow - goddamn apartment yeah that's what I read see that's what I need to get that's that big yeah looks like a camper holy shit well that's cool for him man so he just goes back there when he's done oh there's the thing bed he goes that guy's got a coffee machine there and shit I can live now yeah well my buddy's got the ones with a shower in it - you got magazine thing but you know still the rule you can't shit in it no matter what yeah you're not supposed to shit in those things however nice it is well people do it though they wrecked those things yeah yeah there's um there's I mean it still it's a sucky job for those poor bastards and they get all they all get fucked up backs you're sitting in that chair all day they need to get these ergonomic chairs for driving a car that's what they need right and hemorrhoids I get that out Hey ergo depo I got a fucking task for you how about you guys figure out replacement car seats does that make sense yeah it does you could sit in this sitting this in driving cars would keep you straight I'll bet there's tons of like cushions and weird shit you can buy yeah there are they say the lumbar things the big one because it makes you it forces your body say straight instead of that like hump thing yeah I was gonna say this one comfortable shit that's probably good for you that makes your back yeah yeah you're supposed to sit like this supposed to sit straight up that's why they say like those balance balls are really good like sitting on balance balls are good because you kind of have to sit up straight a lot of guitars have a lot of back problems because you know you put it on it and it's and it's not really that heavy but just a little bit of weight every night of your fucking life Rio after 30 years we'll start to get to you a little bit that makes sense that make sense on the exact same place yeah I feel like people that wear backpacks probably the same thing right pulling on you - slowly but surely of women with purses they say women with big tits you wouldn't think that tits would fuck your back up oh yeah happens I know people have had breast reductions because it's helped their bed oh I knew a girl had one and that's other thing too like a funeral what's up there a funeral for her old tits did you know I was Dubai was definitely bummed but um but for her she's like probably god damn it it was always a it was always you know there's always like a pain in the ass like I guess fucking giant things giant jugs yeah yeah it's probably annoying as hell I get it imagine if your dick was so heavy door curtain Lainey I met what do you mean imagine I mean imagine you dick that have no fucking way no I was gonna try like the surgical thing I was get like the old one I'm gonna try to start a rumor here that my dicks too heavy I can I gotta we rolled around in a wheelchair to my shows the well who's the guy that they said the giant hog Milton Berle they would say Milton Berle just whip his hog out just to settle everybody the fuck down people be talking about your shit Milton Berle go let me show you something here shut the fuck object yeah he's got the biggest fucking polders hager out like how big how big we mean what are we talking 10-inch limp Jesus Christ monster hog fat can even get erect if you're ten inch yes he could know broke good it's like elephant yeah Milton Berle on the rumors of his endowment let's hear this Don by word of mouth you never know how much truth there is to any of them so just once the combing or the record Milton is it true are you talking about my endowment the endowments is it true all I can say is that I'm still working on it what is it no that's been thrown at me so many times that question I don't know what's so thrilling about is it true I really don't know I you know I'm not the only man in the world there are better men than me of course you'd have to show them to me now I've had a little success with it even recently at 88 so it seems quite true all I know that when I get an erection i black out that's what I really do hope that he was getting laid at 88 hmm they say that I had a friend and one of her friends worked at a nursing home and she was saying that they just fucked like cats and dogs in that place I believe it yeah well dudes get a hold of Viagra they don't give a fuck and there it's like a dormitory so I didn't have any responsibilities because look by surprise shake change the fuck oh yeah change the game but here's the thing we think about people in nursing homes right essentially no one can take in right you have to be in a nursing home because your family can't handle you anymore or it's just you need assistance so as soon as you start getting assistance right you get assisted living it's not good but it's also you have less responsibility less things to think about less things to worry about you're in this assisted living place and you with a bunch of other chicks that are just like you the same boat come on girls it's not like you get to a certain age just get tired of dick right they probably still wants a dick and they probably remember and what only thirty years ago when they were young and hot and the guys can kind of remember it too and they're like let's just just do this what else they're gonna do play bingo but all together their nephews come by with fucking look chocolates you must really have a dick then yeah probably someone's coming by try and change the we'll get on the science of shit it's probably gross imagine talking relatives you know they're trying to weasel you out of money just wait yeah we got an aunt like that in Nashville right now where it just feels like everyone's stopping by just to hope to get into you know can I have your fucking apartment when you're going oh dude it happens I know a family where the son tried to get the mom to change the will and the other son found out about it and they start suing each other and fucking Christ over your mom's money like really that's but it's real common yeah it's clear everybody thinks they're right you know so roof oh I helped her I've the right to this and everybody gets real weird I think Mike said that I was like when they had those wills with a guy you know it was really rich guys Nelson will be like a mystery like five million to some girl who like they never knew you know there's some secretary who yeah worked for like twenty years ago that he stuck it in there yeah he's throwing dick at her for years nobody knew that would be the best relationship field like a secretary keep her mouth shut yeah just both smashed it yeah and you could say I'll leave you some in the will you ain't got him here then yeah yeah was that what it is paying her maybe she liked the deck as a gift yeah saying like be a nice thing that I'm gonna start telling women that he leaves them some money in the will and yet you get head my last album broke even you can have half but with your reckless lifestyle don't you think that they would be worried that you would die penniless because you're so impulsive and I probably want I'm gonna be penniless soon if these uh if these things don't turn around but yeah did your record really just break even as many as you sold yeah well I say that as a joke but not really a joke because what I did was I took all the money and put into the new Rick Ross out in a weird way I've seen no money from it but I have touring money though but I have but I have prot you know like I'm putting everything I have into the new band into the new record and you mind saying how many albums you sold forget what it was I mean it's it was a crazy number for physical it was like over 50,000 physical copies which is that's very rare which seems rare which I to me didn't seem like very much but did someone brought me in a CD just a few days ago and I was like look at this thing who was it oh it's Everlast he brought me in war porn but you could hear it's another thing can you read that you think you read that bottom the white part was that say infestation exactly what is war porn yeah man you gotta fix the phone on that shit yeah that's what I'm saying it is like no it's art man it's art I was like okay well art that people you know what it's not here with us yeah I've been having a lot of issues to I'm fucking pissed at Spotify right now why what are they doing here's my issue with Spotify is which is I don't know if you guys use Spotify but I almost everybody does and people don't know this I'm gonna get the truth out which is those big giant numbers you see on the thing that people do people not like me and you but these playlists that are fucking hugely some people just go on Spotify to listen to like country hits you know right our country wild country I don't know why the fuck they refused to fucking playlist me so everyone else's has these inflated numbers but they when I did your fuck when I did your show the first time eatin pussy kicking ass became the number one if you knew that pricing to tell you that info became that they had the viral charts of what's going to actual with the actual listens the viral charts eatin pussy kicking ass was a number-one most viral song in the on the planet after I did your show I said well now can you put me on some of your like country play listen shit and the guy who's the guy who runs the country playlist it's back to the meet the new boss same as the old boss shit yeah there's a guy from country guy they hired a guy from from terrestrial country radio who designs his playlist and he won't put me on the fucking playlist because I say fucking dirty words I'm losing tons of listeners and I can't get on the you know like when you see Florida Georgia line with 100 million listens a lot of those are just from automatic listens just from those fucking playlists and people don't know that shit we had an offer to do one of those with a Spotify or the other one Pandora or Spotify yeah they do podcast and but but I was like well what do you what you guys have an app you have money like what's going on with this like what is this the guys are just distributing content so you must be making some money they want to pay you it's very very very very very little it just doesn't make any sense you would one of them you guys actually I actually make when they when it gets played actually make decent money from the combines because I don't do didn't want to say how much online but I would but um because I own my own label mode those artists have to the label takes all the Spotify money what's confusing to me is like what's the benefit other than like being introduced to stuff that you never would have heard of before like the benefit of Spotify the same benefit you would get from radio except it's streaming except it's in real time right yeah me then better that swipes to the benefit to me is to listen to what oh I'm on the road I haven't listened to this Zeppelin album in a long time then you have it but so like you can make a Spotify playlist and people can listen to your playlist is that the is that the case correct but you could make and everyone could listen to like the updated one you sherek Diplo is a popular producer and he has an updated hip-hop list he makes the updates in every few days but there's like there's no official Spotify ones there's that that's separate from the wah Spotify official playlist it's just when you search for him and follow a influencer you like so if I start a playlist I could put your song on my playlist and I know you yawn and then it would be on yeah but the for some reason they go it's day on the interface so they make it so their official ones are the big ones on the page right so you just you want to hear the country hits like this this album's going to be in the top 10 they won't fucking play huh so I'm and I'm not saying I'm banned but you know if they're gonna put me on the playlist and I'm I'm at a disadvantage áyou when it goes on you actually make like get checks when I get when that when my when people listen I get I get paid yeah see this um oh I just don't think when I there's a band of like a year that you can't do this now but they gamed the system and they made it an album that was silenced and told their fans to stream it all night long and so they made a bunch of money just off of the streams being played of silence for like eight hours how could you do that but there was no way they didn't have any writing to stop someone from doing that from solo they stopped it now you can't do that now yeah that's a limit there is someone up I saw the other day you can someone up look like eight hours of rain so well that's legally yeah but someone's gonna get paid for that that rain track someone owns that recording screen you got to make sure actually didn't steal it from YouTube or so most also someone had to actually be up for eight hours recording you should deserve a little bit of money there's a lot of people yeah I do that to tell their fans you know listen to this song just put on repeater but that seems ridiculous that's a silly request and you you it's it's unfair you like like a make me some money these two do it better than they call your radio station and request my song on the radio makes very different though requesting a song and you want to hear it that's saying you want to hear it saying stream my reign 24 hours a day but the of these playlists you know it's almost back it's paola again it's like there's one guy who's controlling basically all the radio yeah it's like this one dude is just doing it just like if you're his buddy you know one of those things it's like whether it's Pandora or whether it's Spotify and what you're doing is you're selling or distributing other people's work so you're basically just a distribution center I mean that's all it is other than like the unique features of the distribution oh but you can make playlists or oh you can do this and people can recommend things - oh there's algorithms and if they could find out what you like and then you go seek out those things but at the end of the day if there's no things to seek out you don't really sell anything like like the YouTube you know people suing them like YouTube isn't anything people right it's just a player but YouTube has bandwidth and the bandwidth is extremely expensive it's a different animal because you're talking about they they're not just streaming something they're streaming video video is you know me God what what kind of fucking and they have to be able to store it when they upload it I mean what kind of storage is fucking YouTube you know where is it all fucking stored sure mom's house fucking my upper-upper fuckin con what is it different than like a museum like a maybe like YouTube where a museum is a building and they store a bunch of stuff that people come to look at and they have to make some sort of money to keep it running to keep people there I tried to make this argument the other day I was talking to someone about it is it the same or is it completely different um this is an argument that it's in the ballpark well the argument with like when YouTube originally sold for like billions right right at the time it was mainly just clips of other people's shows back in the old now they have original content now they have you're like right people they pay people that but back when it was sold people made people made their due to made hundreds of millions of dollars basically off thesis stealing selling off you know clips of fucking colleges content out of music videos yeah that is an issue it was a giant issue with YouTube but they seem to have ironed out a lot of that like if we put up someone's content like if someone has a like it happens a lot with me with animal attack videos like any time an animals attacking another animal or some nature video if you try to put that up on YouTube you will get flagged and pulled off an illegally remember last time we got hope because putting on my song and I was like I told the people distributor like I give you permission you kept getting tagged or something right yeah when we had Everlast on when we're playing his war porn songs we had to make sure that we had permission they released the flags on all these things for us before we ever did it we had to like coordinate well my I get flagged uploading my own fucking videos which is weird you know really I just they say do you own this portal owns it I own it you own all your style I'm not yeah I own your videos everything I own my masters yeah even eating pussy and kicking ass the one that was on Comedy Central I own the song I don't own that video okay so when that video gets uploaded though like say if you took that video and you uploaded it onto your channel would they flag it with Comedy Central flag it uh maybe but they they would they would that one other than that they would that one they would have a right to I think right but everything else like you know like like when that other guys we fucked podcast people call they wanted to play a song from the new record on my on the podcast it's like that's like an intro music I'm alright I give you permission I own it right even if they come at you there's no suit lawsuit because so you don't have something like that where someone's looking for people that are uploading your stuff to YouTube or things along those lines I've actually like I was talking about those like like I have had like YouTube gamers who like want to like up cap load your video to my channel always be like yeah sure right but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about like somebody just creates a channel just starts uploading your content which happens all the time oh yeah I've seen it around a lot but you know but you don't have anybody that Flags that for you I think it's a good question I think that it there's a there's a algorithm on YouTube that catches it that because you know it might my mark my distribution goes through at this distribution company right and I think they have someone on their team who does like who flat you know like I don't know how they know it but there's up definitely there's some kind of algorithm you know like you said when you put it in it hears that ever last song yeah you know I think there's someone that does flag it for me but again I don't know I think we're finding out - I don't know where the fuck my money's going you know you should do some sort of online video series like where you're giving people like access to you get on a tour bus travel and going different places because you know you're doing this podcast now I think that that would sort of complement that really well that'd be good too well hopefully the you know the the the thing Rick was shooting that will if that's around enough will show enough behind this you know that'd be a a bigger version of something like that yeah no definitely and yeah if you start doing it from Showtime and then take it to YouTube or wherever and start streaming it on the road I think that's a great idea for you yeah it's it's been cool though it's weird too because you get back into the whole like you know that you know giving I'm giving my music you know the thing that the TV thing is going to be for myself so how much do I sell myself the music you know it's like do I do I do I try to you know rip him off on the fucking price of the music no because I want the thing to it's this isn't we're very weird areas were people like how to try to talk you out of just like I'll just give me the fucking music right you know yeah like if you do a stand-up special I'm sure there's they've had negotiations I'm not speaking for you but this part time for they just like listen this specials going to help you so take fucking less money here do do that it's like it's almost like they're doing you a favor kind of which I don't you know they can do stuff like that they can say Ben you know if they're right they're right if they're not they're not you know I mean if you're Chris Rock they're not right they have to pay Chris Rock like it's good for them more than it's good for him I'm saying like if you ever had any issues with like um telling well guess what you're less Cup in Netflix right my last one was Netflix my one before that was Comedy Central and like you want them to like market it more of your head issues and they're just let you know now fortunately no Comedy Central is great I was going to say the other thing too is you've got a bigger marketing outlet than any of them so so now I do yeah and Netflix doesn't really market they put up a few billboards and just leave it alone they like let people word-of-mouth but that's the thing like if someone puts out a comedy special you know like Ari Shaffir is comedy specials coming out July it's 18th he was just on here right yes yesterday if he put something out comedy fans are just gonna get the word out word-of-mouth you got to go check it out I gotta listen to it I mean I found out about a lot of people's specials because that was the main thing with my records which was it it was a lot of which I really loved was that it was it was old school it was literally word of mouth it wasn't like I mean there wasn't names until recently it wasn't memes or fucking YouTube ads and all that shit was just you got to hear this shit it was that's how I found out about it I found out about it from people send him sending it to me yeah I knew you were doing something but then people started just started sending me shit just randomly that didn't even know I knew you well I think that it was yeah I think what happened is just you know it's like they never heard country music used with this lights like do you got to hear this motherfucker he's talking you know like like hip-hop guys in fucking country and it's fucking great you know and they get up you got to mix nowadays you just got to be so loud I guess is maybe what it is well it's hard to believe that you were the first guy that figured out sort of the Andrew Dice Clay approach to stand-up comedy you know I mean but you did I said comedy I'm sorry to country music a comedy sort of shock comedy like yeah he's in the car I would just like I say that whenever people tell me that I'm just like all I did was not censor myself and having fun and I the new album I think you can hear us having even more fun the last one the last one I felt now lets it feels a little stiff almost like I was trying to figure out this one you can hear us having a fucking blast it was like because country music is so serious and the people are so serious it's just like you know just fucking let loose and have some fucking fun yeah it's gotta be so bizarre to see a roomful of guys singing along to some of your lines then I sucked his dick and I kicked his ass it's like day yeah well the new song called Puss in Boots and what the line is a line about you know her tongue her tongue knows where my buttholes at is in the chorus you know um and I'm seeing watching people scream that out you know like I was dicking around man you know like don't do that now I want a girl on the cowboy hat her tongue knows where my buttholes at that's a weird thing to hear back at you just as yeah well it's where when you think like should I even put this in the song was there just like this is a crazy thought what if I just go with instead of trying to write hold myself back which is all the best shit you know but obviously the impact has been fucking tremendous I mean the results are amazing I mean just the idea that we're playing the troubadour tonight and it sold out a month ago it's fucking crazy yeah you're selling out way in advance it's a big place well the troubadour is like a famous you know yeah you know a lot of horrible fucking music that's to get their start there you know and just for me to go up there and singing about puss-in-boots you know is like to conquest yeah like Concord yeah put fuck you you know I'll go to the flag I'll put up I'll do this shit the way I fucking want to do it fuck you guys well it's another error it's or another rather representation of our era that this world is not what it used to be we're in a different place only wait well that's why I kept bringing it back to this which is just like you can make whatever you fucking want you have to censor yourself find the people who you know find the Rogen's whoever in your world that you know you can get the word out bigger you know there's ways to make it ways to distribute it and ways to promote it without fucking sucking some network's dick you know and on that note ladies and gentlemen this shit's available right now go get you some Oh wheeler wheeler
