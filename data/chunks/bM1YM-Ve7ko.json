the gyro can experience yeah well you know it's a fucking sitcom man you know I get it but a same time you like I liked family ties like I liked family ties but that's about D like two and a Half Men I'll say this for two and a Half Men I've seen it on mute on the plane and it looks like they're having a good time that may be the best answer anyone is ever good and then the Cajun I'll hear like a dick joke I'm always like that's a pretty strong dick joke for the first to come at that time slot I only watched it once recently and I thought it was the most unbearable thing I've ever seen on television I thought it was incredible that it's so popular we were talking about it yesterday I was baffled by it I couldn't believe how bad the jokes were this is just this is just an alien language right I'm watching it with my mouth open I'm here in the laugh track and I'm like this isn't even my language like what the fuck yeah if you don't want to share with a laugh track for a while and then you do you're like yeah I would like to watch it and have it all the laughs extracted like someone do it through Pro Tools go in there extract all the laughs and just have them say that the jokes and have no response and see how fucking bizarre that I wanted to do that where every punt you take the laughs out and then every punchline I just go BAM but I mean if you'd see like you know the Curb Your Enthusiasm has no laugh track you know and it's hilarious but if you did that with like a show like two and a Half Men take out all the laughs yeah and only have them act out the scene it's fuckin proposed yeah but having said that Cheers had a laugh track Seinfeld a laugh track friends had a laugh track hey there's nothing wrong with a laugh track what I'm saying is when something's really horrible yeah and then you're faking it yeah and when if you could just listen to it without the laughter it would be so service like that movie that looks that like the movie with them I always forget the guys name the guy from who hosted the Oscars and he's handsome he was writing oh yeah please steal steal robot boxers that looks good I wasn't I what is it missing man it's like a boxing to be brought to you makes a trance more real steel yeah real silly at first like that was an ahkam Sock'em moody it is and that's pretty much what it is yeah I thought it looked good just cuz I like what Hugh Jackman's shirtless in the real steel is really a damn I wanna see that bastard I'm a nerd then fucking ruin the Wolverine character man I don't care Wolverine supposed to be like 5 foot 3 and and built like I find those movies pitiful I find the odd the fact that they can only do superhero movies now just pitiful like it's there it's I told someone it's like it's there for dumb people to be able to explain to other dumb people like there's dude and he got bit by a spider man and he wears a uniform so you're never confused about who's who and he's got a logo on the Superman has a logo on the front and the back in case you get them you're telling me you don't like comic book movies man I like I'm such an old man I like the Chris Reeve Superman whoa and which other ones have I liked I didn't like x-men I didn't like like spider-man obviously so I'm watching the trailer for this this Rock'em Sock'em robots movie oh I like the Batman movies I like the new Batman I like Tim Burton ones and I like the the what's his name's this by the way this premise of this film where there's robots and the people like where this robot outfit and get in fights it's a fucking great idea man that's actually real robots oh these are robots and they're controlling and remotely that's what it is no they're just they're just training robots it's a good idea to have a avatar robot yes robot fights to me is no different than racing cars you know what you're racing cars you know you're not supposed to be moving that fast you're using a machine move that fast you know and you're bumping into each other and cut now you cutting each other I met in one of those that was in it was in the end x-men are at the end of Ironman wasn't that wasn't Jeff Daniels in like a or didn't didn't I like that movie too Ironman yeah it was fun right yeah he's a new Conan looks fun a lot of people are shitting on it online it looks pretty fucking bad-ass to me and they're like saying the do that guy can't be Kona and he's not built enough he's not this no nobody really looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger fucking 1500 BC right that shit's unrealistic no carbs yeah who's just all red meat back then he was in a strict diet in the Paleolithic times Paleo diet paleo Act that's what a lot of people are doing right now so that's all the rage and you know that yeah that's a good book Paleo diet is all like vegetables no grains no rice oh yeah that's good it's all things that are is meat and vegetables you know things that people in the Paleolithic would have eaten right before agriculture before hot dogs and shit yeah those those uh you think that that's a I guess I'm yeah III just a big fan of robots in good cgi you're a big fan of frogs no it doesn't look like good CGI in a financial way of looking at this movie I think it's the most genius thing ever you're mixing like fighting like UFC it's mixing like like it was generated by a computer like robot and fighting like the pain was a guy who guys down on his luck and then the you know yeah I see that too I mean but I don't know I think it's a good idea for kid for a kid movie I'm guessing that's what this is kind of like a teenager movie yeah it's good it's you mean a movie cuz that's they're all for fight all for these goddamn teens teen no I said I told somebody that if the Godfather was released today Michael Corleone wear spandex suit and that she on it and drive a fucking by like a bat will be able to be like that no leo meal no be a cannoli movie and all we yeah anyway sue the G on it oh how funny would that be if somebody pitched that in a meeting I just think he's the best i stuff everybody loves him he's number one right different he separates him yeah puts it on it goes out it fucks you know there you know who it is everybody's got a costume uh just a costume that retarded people can understand that's Superman you just go oh yeah he's fucking I'm retarded that's definitely Superman what did you take on this fucking spider-man thing that they're doing in Broadway you know that you know the whole story behind this the spider-man play it's the biggest most expensive play they've ever produced by far on Broadway and apparently it's a fucking financial disaster fucking backs and yet I was if there was another accident I was gonna do a Twitter a tweet where spider-man himself came out and condemned the musical the thing where the guy's a hero he wants to save people and it's fucking more people been injured then yeah they've killed more people in the Green Goblin and they they're flying around during this broadcast right they're doing this this performance they fly around like they're unaware they've reopened it they're trying to just read they brought the original director back it's just it's like hey you just want to say I'm like hey you guys know you don't have to do this it's hard though once you commit to something it's pretty much over you know yeah it's very difficult to quit something once you're yelling you gotta admit that it's some you know there's the term is motivated reasoning where you just go oh yeah the whole reason you're saying is cuz you want it to be good you'd also tell about people's pitch oh yeah
