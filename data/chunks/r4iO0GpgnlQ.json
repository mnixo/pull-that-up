Oh demons be gone be gone demons be gone leave this studio leave this planet leave our universe leave this is legit sage from a Native American woman Wow so we're purifying is wrong wonderful oh you money but may owe money but may you please God bless this room and Odin to you just in case they were wrong that's her eyes abandon Odin he was around first you know you got to think of all the gods that everybody believed in and they're like I'm not so sure about Thor yeah and then they let him go what if Thor was legit right and he's still out there just like somebody who just pissed a lot of Fame as a god yeah he's like don't you fuckers see the lightning yeah that's me throwing bolts he's like one of those guys and you go to Vegas and you see one of those billboards for a strange casino and you're like oh that guy yeah Tony Orlando and Dawn I remember them Thor is it the Mirage I was doing a residency you motherfuckers check out the Thunder that's actually caused by atmospheric conditions so no you fucks doors on cameo make that imagine who had a someone had a really good point about that some some atheists was arguing against religions it might have been Sam Harris probably with Sam Harris but might even Richard Dawkins but he basically said there's 99 different gods that people who believe in the Christian God don't believe it and he goes atheist just take it one step further hey just guys we just one got away that's what he was saying that's cool yeah there I get confused with being an atheist all the time I I do not believe I'm an atheist I I believe I am I'm open to everything person I don't believe stories about people coming back from the dead and I don't because they're written by people right yeah man I mean that's right and also they're supposed to function on more than the surface level they're supposed to be a kind of fractal that has inside of it a lot of like symbols related to just human existence yes not they're not meant to be so much like taken literally that's when you embarrass yourself on either side exactly on either side of you that's a really good point it's in the translations apparently are so difficult to do yeah apparently the trail especially Old Testament when they translated the Old Testament they had to translate it didn't think of all the different languages it had to go through it was Latin and Greek and German and English and all these different languages that are so different like if you ever used the the translate button like I follow a lot of Russian fighters and they you know and their Instagram feed they write in Russian always like oh translate it's a really cool feature you could but you could tell it's not exactly what they meant because it's all fucked up because their language is different right like the way they structure sentences is different so English doesn't just plug and play right you know it's like sticking a USB 3 into a USB a hey this doesn't really fit all right now add time add thousands of years and scrolls and my hangs wanted things changed yeah the King James Version it's the best that's my favorite one to read on acid that's one King James book a John baby hit that on acid it's so wonderful it's so trippy because it's like that's when I really like Christianity clicked for me regardless of its whether it's real or not but that's when I was like okay I get this because the book of John when you read it you're like well someone wrote it I don't know who wrote it and you ever fucking wrote this their mind was blown man like this wasn't written by someone who was just like a normal person this is the person who was freaking out in the most intense way and so to me that's what I love about it is it's like something about the how old it is and the distortions the historical distortions the warping of it produce this kind of awesome glitched out mosaic of if nothing else human consciousness 5,000 years ago where our minds were that's trippy by itself regardless of whether or not a person who could like raise the dead and walk on water was walking about just holy shit here's how people thought bad yes yes yeah I mean all the stuff that you can't prove you don't know that's interesting it's weird it's weird that where those stories came from and why they're so universal like someone has to everyone has like a creator everyone has like a main dude that did the thing and you know then there's some other people that have like large groups of gods like the Greeks had gods for everything the Indonesia lot of Native Americans had gods for everything or yeah yeah animism it's it's like I've talked to people who make who produce electronic music and some of them say that the computers have a life in them a sentience is spirit inside their computer so there's a collaboration happening it isn't one-sided when they're making stuff it's like working with like the spirit within the machine which is pretty trippy man like why do they but this is based on input or the way they reacted that when they're putting in the input to the thing they think the things responding to them yeah it's yeah they think that there's a it's alive they're like standard keyboards or there's just electronic stuff I know someone who makes visual art on their computer their laptop that you end it like or you know do you have an Alexa apart don't you know echo like sometimes I'll realize the way I'm talking to that thing is like really impolite it's kind of fun yeah it's fun to yell at robots yeah you know it's really funny I made fun of this but there is a point to this PETA had a statement that they put out a while back because these dudes from Boston Dynamics were kicking the fuck out of these robots they're trying to figure out they're trying to figure out how to get these robots to fall over and they're trying to make they're making these insanely durable robots like this if you take scientists and engineers and you say hey I want you guys here's a shit ton of money I want you guys to make the dopest robots you can make like they're gonna make robots you can kick and it's not a living thing so but PETA released some statement saying they didn't see it's cool to kick robots no it's real it's real it's real what yes they would think I think the statement I'm paraphrasing was something to the effect of there's other things that are more important but it's still not cool to kick robots it just shows you what will happen when robots become alive because those fucking traitors those people this is people to think that robots are alive and they're us yeah those emotionless things that have no place in our world with power they're supposed to be things that we control as soon as you let them control themselves you try to pretend they're a person this is gonna wipe it out yeah man can you imagine I'm not gonna try to kick one of those fucking DARPA BOTS they're terrified they would have a record of it they would always remember that this one kicks robots it's in the cloud yeah and then they'll show it to you one day and some super sophisticated genius god robot sits you down on the couch and shows you you kicking these unbeknownst to you sentient robots yeah they were just trying to fucking figure out what am i what am i I'm like a bait they were like little babies and you're kicking them robots the robots are very very upset at you in the future they might just reanimate your ass and just show you over and over that clip of you kicking the fuck yes do you see what Trump tweeted now he tweeted and deleted it's fucking hilarious he said checks are coming to everyone in America except the people who used hashtag not my president I wouldn't want to offend you with a check from someone that's not your president to do that effect see if you can find that oh and then it would hatch tag maggot afterwards I mean he just dunked on them the president dunks on people yeah tweet the leader is someone whose Department was probably like mr. Trump that's not a good idea they have a siren that goes off got it with that yeah I know the president can delete tweets how much is he gonna send I think I think they wanted to give like a thousand dollars a month or something like that to Americans is that the idea Jeremy it's hurt lots of things I don't know up to 2000 and a Bernie Sanders should give 2,000 a month gotta be 2000 everybody but if you give everybody $2,000 a month it's a good thing but everyone's gonna go hey you could have done this the whole time that's right what do you wait a minute if you just raise taxes can you just give people money can just give people more money and if I'm not saying we should do this but imagine that was a solution to all this if you just give people more money over they just sort of levels out and relaxes and Rob's drug abuse drops well I mean they've got to know that when people don't have work they don't have money with no money they can't support their family that's when the riots start yes that you just catch on fire they know that to the it's like a bribe to try to keep people from rioting until whatever the fuck wars past you can look at it that way or it's giving people a different environment to exist in one that doesn't leave them hostile so instead of looking at it like a bribe look at it like you don't want I see what a lot of your problem is we're not you're not asking for affluence you could barely get by but if it was easy to get by if you could just get by and then you could pursue other things would that be better for society and that was like what Andrew yang was suggesting if this whole automation revolution took place and everything started getting automated and no one had a job anymore there might be something to that there might be something that now even you know the question is like what are what are you happy your your taxes get used for you know it's almost like you should be able to vote on that like the one thing that we don't get real direction on right like in terms of like what the country actually wants but if we could all just individually vote on things like that like where's where's my taxes go all right my taxes to go 100 percent to education right I want to make that cut and you know you guys get a figure out what to do with the rest of the money maybe he did that money I wanted to go towards education but then nobody there the people who would be paying for war and prisons and shit would just be like BDSM people how about the salaries how about the salaries of politicians how about the money then we go tours private jets yeah it's fucking crazy also like the loose connection between the state and corporations the way it's just all kind of merging together right now and also you know it appears to be kind of the apocalypse at the moment like well it's it's if it's not the apocalypse I don't think it's the apocalypse I think it's just a dangerous dangerous illness but it's definitely a dress rehearsal it's a dress rehearsal for fucking people gonna become Preppers it is gonna be amazing for the toilet paper industry they're gonna they're gonna experience a banner year they say you got toilet paper stock you're riding high right now do you remember the I don't know if you if you had this experience but like I can remember sitting at my computer and pressing the button on Amazon where I wanted to buy something and it's like this isn't available right now it's my button that brings me things it didn't like suddenly just realized oh my fucking god how completely weak have I become that I got accustomed to pressing this button and people would bring groceries to my house yeah and now they don't now it's like stopped not only that I'm so accustomed to like well you know I'll just go to the grocery store and pick up some food it's always been there it's not there dude I had an insta cart delivery today you know cuz we wanted to get stock up on food Oh two hundred dollars worth of food guess what I got strawberries hummus and I think we got like I don't know some like eggs that's it out of the whole order everything else was sold out all the beef gone all the chicken gone nothing's there it's like the the shelves are empty so it's like okay send everybody to thousand dollars a month but what are they gonna buy if there's like no food on the shelves like well I think that was a temporary freakout where people stockpiled stuff and I think as long as food keeps getting delivered on a normal schedule I think that'll normal out I hope I did I do I think that'll normal out but it just shows you there's so many things in our society that are amazing like grocery stores like cell phones like we can call each other all this too but those things are so fragile yeah they like they're they're so vulnerable like if an emergency happens and everyone wants to call it once the cell phone system can't handle it yeah like it's not like you have a phone and you can call any time you want and I have a phone I call any time I want and everyone in the world is a phone they can call any time they want know if everybody does that the system is not set up to handle that's right if everybody does it like ah like that's why if there's an earthquake or tsunami everyone's fucked it's so hard to make phone calls yeah it's not gonna get through yeah well dude I just heard on NPR that so many people were requesting unemployment that it's crashed systems in several states that's because this is a real problem one of my friends was saying he's like you know a lot of people are running out of money tomorrow they're bartenders anyone in the service injure all the people who work at the Comedy Store yeah it's not like I mean how many of them had a lot of money like stored up none of them so what what happens now when there's no food on the shelves we gotta help them where I've been a text message thread with Whitney Cummings and Nick Swardson and Chris D'Elia and we're talking about that very thing right now I kind of do it and how to set up a fund it needs to be done for sure you know people that can help should help this is not a normal time this is not a time where people are lazy this is a time where the whole world got fucked real quick yeah and weren't ready for it and we're gonna have to come together but this is a good time for people to recognize the importance of community it's a terrible time for Humanity it's a terrible time for us and terrible time for the people that are sick but it's a really good time for us to understand why community is important we live in this illusionary world that's provided to us by the culture that we've created where you can just buy things anytime you want you don't need people you come home you watch Netflix you don't engage with anyone you get in your car you barely say hi to anybody at work we're detached from each other and this is the only time ever in life we've been detached from each other and we're being detached by these goddamn electronics yeah they're sneaking up on us yeah electronics and cars which is also you know it's a it's also a creation a mechanical creation and now more than ever they're driving computers yeah man it's true what I'm trying to say is Ted Kaczynski was right oh my god we all know that he was right do you ever read his manifesto no I'm scared it's catchy that's I went through a period of like doing ketamine and like trying to watch the worst thing I like it Charles Manson Kaczynski and yeah it is you know it is a little bit like kind of interestingly not that off but then the tone is so Imperial or something when you're eating it there's like this it's a manifesto that's I have to write it you know but the one thing my wife is part of like it's not like it's called a mommy group so it's like a connection of online of all these mommies and like all over LA and what they do is they post people will post shit they need so like one of the moms just had a kid they don't have any wet wipes and so then all the other moms would like oh we've got wet wipes and then right now they're just leaving them on the door so people come and get them so it's like I think the community thing is exactly right also people have to maybe transcend money for a second and figure out ways to set up in their community like what do you need what do I have and then start some form of like trade or just giving people you know there was someone who set up a toilet paper exchange I don't know in LA where he was just like if you have extra toilet paper bring it and then he had toilet paper and you're just giving it out to people who are you know that's I think that's the sort of thing we're gonna have to start doing if we can you know is like right now there's old people who they they're the key to shit I can't do anything they're terrified they can't even get online if you know them you got to help them and this is you know this is a weird time for us but it's a time for us to reset you know it's not it's not good I'm not saying it's good but I'm saying there's a we can get a positive out of this yeah people that make through the people that make it through we can get a positive out of this and the positive is community is important it's really important and it seemed like it wasn't important because it seemed like we had everything set up so you didn't have to engage with people it's not the right way to do it it's not good for anybody now that kind of life is not good and the detachment that we have I mean that's why why do you think people have road rage on the highway you know when they're locked in their little box separated from people in a way that they but they wouldn't have it in person yeah it was just I mean it's only a thin piece of metal and glass separating you from these people yeah there's not with that there's the other added factor of the heightened senses because you're driving fast you realize you might have to make quick movements so dumb things people do are elevated and they're even no more dumb yeah but it's also that you're detached you're you're in these boxes right it's like a weird dream we've done weird shit to each other yeah because of that we're all gummed up in that way it's like something it's like it's like a fungus that grew on the circuitry of society and starting or it's like you know when they talk about the dolphins and the whales being fucked up by the high-tech sonar they're using and washing up on the beach because the sonar is messing up their ability to communicate with each other it's like there's this kind of technological sonar that is completely made us disconnected from the earth essentially like our earth connection has been replaced by a technological connection now the technology comes from the earth but we're talking about a secondary thing can compare it to you know your feet touching the ground you know being around another human and like recognizing them as having exactly the same thing you have which is they want to be happy you know feeling the connection between people when you're with someone I mean I don't know if you've ever done that but just like the next time you're around anybody that you're like buying shit from or that you don't normally just kind of go by feel like that connect you can feel it there's an energetic connection that you can feel there that's easy to overlook yeah we we've lost the biggest one which is through light pollution I think every night people were humbled and reminded of the majesty of the universe when they looked up and saw the infinite skies on a clear night yeah the infinite star is just the whole Milky Way you could see the whole thing yeah you know and there's parts of the country where there's plenty of darkness and you could literally see the whole Milky Way and it makes you think like Oh our ancestors saw this fucking freaky shit all the time we decided to shut off the greatest art the world has ever known because we want to be able to see better at night yeah the greatest art and art that literally not not just as inspired Science and Wonder - and fueled it right but also as kind of always put people in place always just just understand this is not a backdrop it's not a tapestry that up there is madness it's forever and you're not protected there's just a thin layer of gas between you and the universe which is infinite you're this tiny little speck of nothingness in this impossible to understand spans of planets stars it just goes on forever literally forever and we're one little tiny piece of it and we're being held here with a spin and some air and there's a giant fucking fireball in the sky that keeps us alive it's a million times bigger than the earth yeah and it's right there and this is this is the reality that we live in it is almost too crazy to put in your consciousness on a daily basis so we forget about it all the time it's the one of the most important things about our existence here is it we're a part of the universe yeah it's not just that we're in you know fucking Sherman Oaks or we're hanging out in Montana no we're right there connected in the universe and it doesn't get brought up and one of the reasons because we don't see it we don't fucking freak out you if you order the country you're camping you fucking freak out you're like wow you see the stars like this is fucking nuts man you can see them all it's it's a reset button it changes how you feel about life yeah yeah well also seems like a lot of us have forgotten that we're gonna die on top all that I mean yeah not only are you like looking up at this void filled with stars but the thing you are is temporary and that to me is you know the other day I'm like just washing dishes during this fucking pandemic and I'm thinking to myself man I feel so lucky to be washing dishes right now I'm alive I'm healthy fucking it was a different kind of washing dishes than a week ago when I was able to or two weeks or before that shit started when I could order anything I fucking wanted off the internet it suddenly I'm in a different world like this is a world where well we got to wash these dishes because man if I get like if bugs come I don't know if I want to call an exterminator right now I don't know how many people I want in my house right now I don't know what this shit is so it's like suddenly these are what you're experiencing is this kind of like well what does it say in the Bible that we both love so much fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and I think you could easily translate that to understanding your place in the universe should produce a kind of positive fear and trembling not like you're anxious or terrified right but just a kind of like whoa this doesn't last nothing about this last and right now everyone around the planet is getting a first-hand glimpse of that very truth right yeah all at once one big dose one big dose of it all at once one big dose are people to recognize how much of what they concentrate on a daily basis how much what fills their consciousness is shit it's utter nonsense yeah when we got tricked we got tricked into thinking it would go on forever and now we know it's not going to and now we know hey look this is a this is a terrible thing but relatively speaking compared to supervolcano asteroid impact compared to something Solar Flare something really crazy that can happen and blow out all the power yeah which is a hundred percent of possibility solar flares are 100% a possibility and for people did not recognize that and just go through their life it's just because we we we look at life as if what we've experienced while we're alive is the norm but it's not it's not the norm it's just hard for you to recognize that your life is so short your life is so short that when they're measuring all the different catastrophes that have happened over the earth whether it's proven sites of asteroid impacts or proven sites of volcano eruptions or all these different things that have happened for sure and wiped out millions of people all over the world they happen over a timespan that's too big our head doesn't get in there a head doesn't go what what is thirty thirteen thousand years is just some scratches on some paper in my head my stupid head I don't know what thirteen thousand years means I can't I can't do it but thirteen thousand years ago they think and there's more and more evidence every day that there was some big impact on earth yeah and who who fucking knows how many of those humans have gone through who knows for the the what I think scientists believe what is it it's like three hundred thousand plus years we've been this right is it the idea Homo Sapien something like that right brother Nate shit that's so short that's so short just in the time that the the earth has been here in the four point whatever billion years the earth has been here and that's so short in terms of the almost fourteen billion years the known universe has been here all of its madness every single step along the way is madness but we get stuck in these little time periods where nothing changes and so we think that this is life so we've built all these houses that only can work on electricity how many fucking people have a real fireplace in their house that live in cold places banning those now so if they're banning fireplaces because they don't want to start fires that's great as long as you can ensure the gas and the power is gonna stay on and I don't think you could do that yeah I think you can because you've done it for a hundred years that's right that's the thing hundred years this shit's a hundred years the Industrial Revolution the roaring 20s from from then to today Oh let's go 150 let's get crazy that ain't shit yeah that ain't shit to say this is how things are every day is so dumb it's especially to say within terms of the earth natural disasters space anomalies like not even anomalies things that happen like solar flares they have an all the time man yeah man well I mean and we don't even know that's other thing we don't know all this um all the data in the universe we don't know that there isn't something called like a quadtree Xion ripple it happens every you know 16 million years this whole Sean Carroll right now I need information you know do you know that poem Ozymandias Ozymandias yeah no I Shelley I think it's like I don't know I memorize but the basically it's like diploma is about someone who sees the broken legs of a statue in the desert and written on a plaque is my name is Ozymandias ruler of rulers king of kings behold my works ye mighty and despair fuckers you think you have power who think you have all this control it's like we don't like I guarantee of course like in ancient Egypt there was probably I'm not talking about the Pharaoh but there's at least like a thousand dudes who are like I'm like the hot shit and Egypt and they're gonna remember me for a long time it's like we don't know you are it's all gone eradicated wiped out and this to me is like one of the really side effects of this thing this technology thing is we've all become completely self-obsessed self-absorbed putting our images out there making sure that our profiles are updated making you know what I mean like we have this insane idea of like we're so deeply rooted in our ident instead of in the connections between our identities they were all the only way that we can finally see how connected we are is some motherfucker eats a bat you know it's really crazy man think of this if technology really did have an effect on the programming of human beings and the human beings interacting with technology think we're internet innocently interacting with a non-sentient thing but all the while this technology and and you could call we get confused we think the technology is like a digital clock or a television or a computer it is but it's also like a fish hook right like so the Sony it's innovation so yeah someone had to figure that out and imagine creating an ape that is aware of its environment like this is like really the perfect storm aware of its environment but obsessed with itself knows in the back of its head that it's it's temporary that it's a it's it's got a finite lifespan but lives like it's gonna live forever and lives in the moment lives in the moment and wants to acquire things it seems the number one goal for the you know the uber wealthy or the uber successful the Jeff Bezos types characters right or on the top of the food chain financially they want to acquire things yeah they're always acquiring things which means people have to make things which means that they're like they're a big consumer as well as someone who's is making a shit ton of money right and this also fuels innovation because you got to keep up with these people kind of keep giving them bigger and better things every year so it all this all these resources go into innovation of technology it's the thing that progresses quicker than anything right look at cell phones every year I need a hundred and fifty megapixel camera or you're a loser yeah you're a loser yeah you know these fucking Samsung phones that are like seven inch screens now everyone's going crazy right but what is the goal though the goal is to make better shit and the goal along the way of like this goal is it's working but you know be even better if we've made it so they don't touch each other anymore if we maybe if we could come up with a disease where they can't shake hands they don't they don't come close alright and yeah just keep them a little further apart from each other it'll make them more interested in the things more interested in the technology more more separate from each other and encourage technology that connects them with each other so through technology they'll they'll find this human longing for contact that they were missing in their life they're gonna get an emulated version of it but that emulated version of it just gonna keep getting better and it's gonna keep getting better and it's gonna get to a point where it's better than real life way better than real life because you like Jumanji you get to be the rock you know you get to be the like a superhero like in you could you could live a magical life with no boundaries of physics and that they're gonna do that people are gonna do that they're gonna give in if I was a life-form that was trying to haunt another life-form and trick it into giving birth to me that's I would create a person I'd create people people we put like some fucking ant we're like some and that's manufacturing our successors yes we are yeah and we don't even know what we're doing just showing up every day look at my fucking watches I got all these diamond chain chain chain yeah like bling but just my house is bigger than the rocks people are doing this we're doing we're just buying more shit and one good thing of something like this anytime a tragedy happens people bond together afterwards it's a terrible thing that it happened yeah but it for the victims and the family members of the victims we all know this but it it can be a good reset for us economically people gonna have to get through it that's gonna be the most difficult part yeah but I think there's there's gonna be an opportunity for us to just assume a nicer stance towards our neighbors and towards our friends and towards our community and instead of embracing this idea like better get guns because they're coming maybe we can all come together I think people need to find if there that's gonna happen then we've got to find a better metric for whether things are right or wrong yeah in the news yes we need something to retune ourselves like we're right now we're tuning the guitar of our identities to these two like the most terrifying shit which is the news or like what people are saying and so if that's if and I think many people become so accustomed to getting their idea of what's happening in reality from the TV instead of from like how they feel inside what's going on with their friends and their family that puts people at incredible disadvantage yes their pond is being rippled by shit you know I was thinking it's like um what are those little not prairie dogs those they stand and look around at the Hawks you know I'm talking about what are those things called they're like there are social little marmots or something like oh no there is a show like lemur palace I don't remember what they're called something but they're like they're like they're really cute I see them at the zoo most one of the most durable animals ever they stand and live somehow they ignore all the humans around them and just look in the sky for a hawk it's kind of sad but that's their life though but imagine if that one looking for the hawk had like the internet and could see Hawks thousands of miles away how anxious all of them would be because he would always be like get on the ground get on the ground get so you know I think this this is what has happened is that we're all constantly being told I mean I remember when I was growing up in the old days when the news had an alert that was serious some serious shit with you you'll be what the fuck Fox News or any of the news stations to have an alert like every four minutes now don't Adam alert alert and it's all telling us just what you're saying get underground go inside go inside danger out here danger out here and so we're all like even before this shit we were huddled up a little bit now we can rationalize the huddling you know and that's what we're doing were just huddling inside right now that's an incredibly vulnerable place to be I mean I'm not gonna get Conspirator if I was the artificial intelligence and I was about to hit the switch and become sentient I would want to I would want to remove the threat of human beings as much as possible before I hit the switch wait a minute and this is the best way you make them sick I'm gonna have to give birth make them they can get sick confuse them keep them poor and then boom it comes out of nowhere and then what then they just start eating us those were fuel they're not gonna eat you know who came up with do you know that was a that was a DARPA project what EA T are robots there were robots that survived on Biological air quotes biological material so like maybe they could eat plants or babies whatever's around I need a friend at DARPA robots that eat tissue this this is do robots eat people not and it's a corpse eating robot yes bro what yes well II hate it playground call it literally will so true look at it the colors it's ridiculous it's like a kid's toy it should look like a vulture it should be like red and black like a vulture yeah it should definitely be black red lightning bolts on the side nice patina like a ward out patina like it's just going through the battlefield eating bodies if you're not quite dead and it starts chewing you feet first how does it determine whether or not you're dead what if you can make it what if he just out cold what if you got knocked out and it's like a movie you wake up in the battlefield and there's a bunch of movies where that happens right guys aren't really dead they just badly injured these motherfuckers there's a video right down below of us talking about it fucking terrified of those things just the idea that someone made something that can eat people that will listen folks the technology that existed in like early cell phones right like if someone made an early Motorola phone with a camera all that stuff got into everything now you're there's so many things that could take pictures now in so many phones that can take pictures one robot and one like proof-of-concept where something could be fueled on dead bodies you don't think other people are gonna make those two and you don't think they're gonna get better they're gonna get better and then when we do go to war with the robots and this big giant bulletproof metal ones just eating us and using us as fuel we're gonna be like what have we done what have we done we've created a thing that eats people and yeah even if it's just the baby right now that thing could evolve to become something that literally is the thing of nightmares as Stephen King movies who are we're just running around looking for people eating people it's a black mirror episode gone wrong man alright I to me I just like to think about the meeting where the guy was like last night I woke up in the middle and I like this idea I got it y'all what if we make a robot that devours corpses and somebody was like you know what I kind of like that Jake let's uh let's put 50 million into that project see what we could do Jesus yeah just imagine like this is the other thing man is like we we somehow imagined that that thing that made Genghis Khan Genghis Khan is like now out of people like there isn't somebody on the planet right now that has the same ambition as a warlord you know we somehow forget that see I just think people don't understand that like there's this idea that the world leaders are just you know humanists and there have are you know the interest of humanity is the first thing they're thinking about when they wake up every day we don't know that they're some of them aren't interested in the same thing every conquering warlord has been interested which is like maybe we could take over the planet I wonder if there's a way and you know imagine if you ended up President of the United States or like President of Russia or president of any powerful wherever you know maybe when you're a high one night I don't know if they get high but I would you know or maybe when you're like just like stinking wouldn't it flicker through your mind kind of like I wonder if there would be a way to take over the world I wonder if there's a way that I could become the king of earth cuz you know when you look up there in the sky I'm sure there's many earths out there that have one king one ruler someone who conquered the entire planet someone who figured out a way to do it to like just why couldn't you that's the other thing I mean what's stopping that from happening one day there being one primary Authority some Imperial Majesty we are all one Duncan I know yeah if we were all one but we just have to get rid of some of our laws other people are not going to accept our laws okay we just got to tighten that up a little bit and we could have one ruler of the whole plan yeah and we're gonna fix everything by working together we're gonna evenly distribute resources it's gonna be better this way the resources gonna have to give up all of your privacy that's all but but through that everyone's gonna be happier yeah are you in or are you an outsider are you gonna act like you're not in and if you act like you're not in then we'll find another way to hypnotize you because we'll just pretend to be people who aren't in you know and they'll trick you will infiltrate yes yeah that's what yeah that's what you do man that's like that's the problem is like no matter what revolutionary idea gets out there that anybody has the contagion of the revolutionary idea is easily warped and twisted by people who have like other ideas that run counter to that you know like it's so easy to confuse people who believe that Twitter Instagram CNN Fox News Drudge Report Wall Street Journal New York Times is an accurate metric of what's happening on the planet yeah that's not very many information streams man right like how hard would it be to infiltrate all the information streams in some small way and gradually start warping them so that people become more open to the idea of being constantly surveilled constantly monitored and not speaking up about it because if you speak up about it then you're a conspiracy theorist I got another way of looking at it that I've been thinking if it's just this is how life goes what if instead of this being like some grand conspiracy by the robots or by the the elites what if this is just how systems go when one thing gets too big isn't in is in too much power there's no it's no longer a struggle to survive its reached some stagnant point biologically in some sort of weird way and also maybe even without for lack of a better word spiritually stagnant right I mean some people are breaking through and realizing who you know who they are and their connection other people but globally god there's a lot of people that are sleep sleepwalking out there sleepwalking hypnotized by technology in society and this is this is their big wake-up call right now what if this all this even materialism right even our obsession with technology maybe look if you look at all the systems that exist in the universe and particularly all the biological systems that exist on earth some of them are so spectacular you're like what what happened here how did they do this like have you ever seen like leaf cutter ants when they take their their buildings and they pour cement in them and they realize these fermentation chambers and the they ferment the leaves in there there's air holes out to the earth and there's all these fucking tunnels and this is crazy elaborate city structure that's created by these ants well there's all these systems that that take place all over the earth for if there's too much plants than these insects involved there's too many insects the plants evolved all these things happen to sort of keep some sort of a balance ideas that infect people the dumb ones that are so intoxicated think about what's the some of the most intoxicating shit I mean intoxicating meaning that you're not even really getting pleasure out of it but you can't look away it's like some of the dumbest reality television right right and the fear factor you're sitting there with your mouth I'll be like hmm and you get sucked in to this thing that the earth is created to make you it's not people what if the what if the grand conspiracy is it's not robots it's not people its life is trying to get rid of you life is making it easier to survive which makes you soft as fuck which makes you compliant to anything that keeps you in that sort of soft comfortable state I don't want to ruffle any feathers if they need to look you my emails you let them yeah and all the while it's just the world it's the universe plotting against us because there's too many of us and we fucked up we have too much power and we're obviously doing shit to the earth that we shouldn't be doing like what we're doing to the ocean we're sucking every fish out we're dumping in all our fucking straws yeah look at what we're doing a fracking where people have to move because they can't use their water and like well it's an acceptable outcome basically we don't need to rely on Saudi Arabia anymore but you you poison these people's air they have to move out of their fucking house their waters on fire literally their waters on fire and maybe life is like okay what do we got here let's get a virus let's get them addicted to technology let's get a virus let's get them obsessed with themselves let's make the predominant thing that people spend their time on not reading books not fucking walking alone with their thoughts but staring at these pictures of other people's photos yeah selfies and butt pictures and look at how this guy does chest you ever do trust like that sucked sucked into looking at these fucking videos and and then when it's when it's decided you're weak it starts sending in some more problems boom here's a little bit of this boom here's a little bit of that yeah boom here's a new disease yeah boom here's a tsunami boom here's a nuclear reactor you can't shut down yeah and then you try to figure out whether or not we're gonna be able to use our amazing intellect to bypass our own biological switches that have us connected to this bullshit life we have a lot of weird dumb biological switches that were put in place back when we had to survive against incoming hordes of soldiers and we're in the Information Age now what we need to do is be sustainable in case of emergency which we're clearly not and we need to realize that this is temporary and we when a bad thing happens it makes you realize that it makes you realize like hey I thought everything was gonna be fine forever it's not this is real just like a movie or a book we're just not prepared for it because we haven't experienced it we're like this is a once-in-a-lifetime event no it's a once in our lifetime event our lifetime is too small for us to really get a grip yeah like it's a blink it's a blink and this is just you know like you said dress or so if anything it's a dress rehearsal for death I mean you're gonna that's up the thing is is like that blink if you're an atheist which you know I get that and I think there must be some like deep do you know any atheists that have done like a real blow out psychedelic session now I know a couple and those those are the most puzzling to me because the guy people have done like real blow out mushroom sessions or blow out DMT sessions I always think that they would leave the door open to the impossible because it is impossible and you experienced it it's not like even if you're imagining it I couldn't imagine that so how am i imagining that how am i imagining something in such incredible vivid color and and detail and and knowledge and love and all these different things the experience in that state that state is otherworldly the fact that that is accessible at all I don't care if it's through a molecule or through a yoga session I don't care how it's accessible if the fact that that's accessible at all leaves open to me the I don't know because I didn't know that that was a thing so once I've experienced that I'm like oh well all this flat plane of existence that we take for granted that we think this is this is everything around us this is the whole environment you have to worry out for this might be just one fucking stage on the radio dial of experience right and of dimensions that are interacting with us we just don't have the senses to to tune in to them and when you can for me at least it leaves open the door for who the fuck knows who knows man I just the fact that that's a thing there's a okay so this is a trip this this is very trippy so I got this book called the Tibetan yoga of dream and sleep well I feel like it's fucking cool but basically it's like it's form of Tibetan Buddhism that invites you to explore the difference between when you think you're awake and when you're dreaming and so basically the idea is there isn't much of a difference there like right now you're dreaming this thing you call your human incarnation it's like it is a dream and you know like when people are dying they get all delirious and shit they slide through time you know like I don't know if you ever been around a dying person but they they like suddenly they're back in Vietnam they're in the 50s they're in the 30s where however whatever their lifetime which means that when you're dying you're gonna like spin through time - meaning that this could be you dying right now spinning back with you but like in a dream so that when you you know this is the main thing about it is that when we die according to this we we sort of spend like 39 days I think it is in a place called the Bardo which is essentially like what it's like to have no body but still have this like I this basically like your karma your identity sort of propelling you through and that that that's how you like you get your next incarnation so essentially like that's the what we're dealing with here is so bizarre and surreal that it easily could just be a dream state that one of these vast a eyes that already exists is having we're just processors we're just being run it's like running a simulation of a pandemic or maybe this is a way that like an AI gets polished like maybe we're an AI that's being like polished and taught through this process of having a limited incarnation you've got to have that so that there's a reason for us to actually invest ourselves and stuff like if we your gods if we live for a million years eventually we wouldn't have such a passionate relationship I think with the world anyone who's gonna it so you need that to train the thing up so it takes it seriously you have to put the setting on mortal then you know then maybe you just run a series of tests on the thing you know you start run what is this what have we made what does it do in a pandemic and by it I mean the sum total of all humans which is right now disconnected it's like a malfunctioning brain the Sonata you know what I mean we're not connecting but if we were being like sort of I don't know how you put it groomed evolved intentionally then every single moment in an individual's life and in a planet the planets the life of history could be looked at as a training or an upgrade this could be an operating system upgrade this could be what an operating system upgrade looks like in the bio-computer that we exist in it looks like a fucking pandemic and that's what's happening right now is we're being like upgraded for some reason even though it's terrifying and obviously horrific you know we're being upgraded and when you anyway the whole point is man this thing that we're in right now whether or not there's a god we just I think an atheist gets to lean into the idea that when they close their eyes and breathe their last breath it stops and I just think that's a big gamble man that's and I don't mean because you're go to hell I mean how nice would that be yeah if it just stopped when more than likely it's you know the at least in this Tibetan yoga of dreaming and sleep more than likely what happens is way before you actually die when you get really sick you already start waking up into your next life you just wait you just like go through a weird dreamlike stay called the Bardo where you freak the fuck out and then you're suddenly alive and another being completely oblivious to whatever your past incarnations were and not to or in right now so you know I don't know this is a great time for people to start you know looking at that in one in preparing for that we didn't prepare for the fucking pandemic we didn't prepare some of y'all did I'm sure but there's a few Preppers out there listening oh yeah who's ready I know you guys did it man you were right congratulations I've got fucking hummus and strawberries and some like and but but I think that like also preparing for like the authentic apocalypse which is when you kick the fucking bucket yeah because the idea is you know and this feel feel free to like the goddamn sage again but the idea is begone thank you the idea is that you can actually like navigate through that Bardo State you can have a little bit of lucidity instead of sort of dying and like freaking out because it's a hallucinatory state you could actually have a kind of like I don't know focus through it and control your next incarnation yeah we just have to figure it out that's the thing and when you're young particularly if you're young you don't have a lot of guidance which was me when I was younger it takes a while to figure it out because you're just running on your own right there's no you're not getting like a lot of direction to how to live your life and I moved around a lot too which really didn't help but as you get older you start getting a better sense of what makes sense and what doesn't make sense and what's important what's not important what fucks up your life and what enhances your life but you don't live long enough to really get it down see if these these people like David Sinclair or Aubrey de Grey all these anti-aging geniuses that are out there that are working on all these solutions to extend human life favor really nail it they really nail it you know if David Sinclair comes up with something and you can live a hundred and fifty two hundred fifty years by the time you're 150 years old you're gonna have so much less bullshit in your life you could have realized like when you're thirty you'll date crazy people you'll have more on friends that you have to bail out of jail you'll have these prompt but when you get older you start going look I see what's good for me and I see what's not good for me you know and I see this some people that are not willing to change and they try they're not trying to do better right they're just consistently making the same mistakes over and over again and dragging everyone down around them you just got to move on from people like that in your life when you're 150 man could it be tolerating anything you're just gonna just get it only have cool people that you hang out with and and will attract each other and then we'll be able to work together on things right knowing that each other are sane and rational and are looking at these things honestly they're not talking from a position of trying to convince you of their virtue or trying to talk you in a position of doing something that'll benefit them financially they're doing it just because they're they're just being in the moment and honest and being a human being yeah man I mean you basically just described like the secret societies I mean you don't need to come up with our own which we call it the Illuminati no that's too much well you know that if we came up with our own right now what do we call it whatever it is don't do initials man I hate that just not good that can use those against you yeah I don't know what do we call it Jamie children of Jamie you know you know but the thing is like these immortal beings that you're talking about they do already exist but they exist as like communities that have lineages attached to them so it's like because our physical bodies die we don't get to do the thing you're talking about we roll when you're older you do do that naturally and plus when you have kids it's like you're just on time for bullshit anymore there's no time to fuck around with somebody who's like constantly fucking up their life you used to get drinks where they're like you have a child and you have to but we regardless there already is set in place in on the planet these like lineages there's essentially chains of transmission in martial arts right look when you look at a martial art you're seeing a living being you know that as it has its roots I don't know how far it goes back when you look at yoga that's a living thing that's transferred from person to person so I think these things already immortality already does exist it just doesn't exist in as a human and also sometimes when I hear about these technologists trying to live forever I get a little scared thinking that's kind of like you know if you could theoretically do it you might be locking yourself in a dream it's worse yeah maybe can't die you can't die you've you engineers some polymer skin that's made of that spider silk blend that they were trying to come up with it's stronger than steel yeah remember they were doing that there they were there was an article about them trying to create some sort of bulletproof skin by engineering it with spider silk yeah I remember that well if that becomes what if that's real what if they figure out a way to make people completely invulnerable and we live forever and then we hate it and we didn't realize that if we just shut the lights out we'd go to the next stage and the next stage is amazing maybe that's like the big trick the big trick is like how do you how do you use this life and how does it take you into the next stage imagine if that's really what's happening that's why every single look I'm not saying that this means anything but every single religion has someplace you go when it's over yeah don't they I mean almost all of them yeah I mean that's an overlying theme now you could say well that's just engineered to provide comfort to people because you know they want to feel like this life means something but the reality is the lights just shut off and to that I say mainly I say mainly maybe but have you have you ever been whacked out of your mind on psychedelics cuz if you are you would you would go who the fuck knows because that's a who the fuck knows moment so maybe death is a who the fuck knows mom maybe that's why every single religion has these stories not every single one but like look I mean there's a lot of religions that people clearly just made up right and we know the people that made them they count too they don't even have to pay taxes yeah so let's not get holier-than-thou with the concept of religions right so there's a lot of really dumb religions that probably don't have an afterlife but it's just some shit that people made up all of it but how many people have made up this idea that there's a place you go that's better than this yeah I mean it's not just to make you incentivize you to be good and to be a good person or is it like an inherent understanding of how the universe works it might be both things it might might be also be manipulative because you can get people to comply with social norms and society's rules if you tell them that if they don't that God is watching them and he will mic them down and burn them forever that is a way that is part of a way but it's not gonna stop people from doing most shit it's just not it never has you know some of the most horrific things ever done by human beings were done in the name of Christianity right or and many other religions but that but there is something to the the possibility that it's both things that it's an understanding that when you do good in this life you will you will go forth into the next stage in a better place right you'll feel better you'll be it would be less less burdened by the past you'll be less hampered by the failures of your your ability to adjust the ability to live a harmonious life with people here on earth this there might be something that's real and also the other ideas you're it's not like this place that they're talking about in religions is existing after you die the idea is like you're there right now you just can't you're wearing a blindfold that looks like your body mmm and you in your life you're wearing a blindfold that looks like your existence you're behind and that's why the there's always these stories of like Jesus healing a blind man or like there's Paul on the road to Damascus being like blinded there's all these stories of being like already existing in what Buddhism some forms supposed to call fundamental goodness that's already where we're at that's the main channel but we've sort of grown like little bits of grass into the time-space continuum and right now we're like waving in the wind of our karma and not not realising there's a beneath us or through us or moving through us is a much grander more beautiful incredible thing so like I think when people say yeah they invented it so people be afraid it sort of imagines that these people are having one-way conversations with it you know that when they pick up the phone it's just themselves they're talking to you it's not imagining that when people connect to this divine source it immediately says oh ha yeah this is the part of your program where you were supposed to start remembering what's really going on here and reconnecting with me don't worry don't feel bad it's okay everyone goes through that in fact you requested a disconnect for the last 15 years when you're getting hammered and imagining your Charles Bukowski or whatever like if this was all part of the plan that was actually teaching you what happens when you don't take care of your body now I'm we're like connecting sending a download to you letting you know hi it's us we're here we're not mad at you how could we be we're infinite we've been here since before the stars you wanted this to happen my apologies for cutting off your ball killing your mom and your dad Jesus you know what I mean but whatever this is all part of a bigger thing and I think that's to me what God is it's this constantly rejuvenating synchronistic perfection that becomes increasingly perfect and it exists simultaneous to this seemingly imperfect universe and it's always there for you to connect to at any moment and when people smoke DMT certainly that's one of the avenues and that's a beautiful thing so I think the reason for it is not to scare people it's more so that people who come like fountains for that and in some small way become little droplets or like divine bits of perspiration bubbling up and into this place so that folks who are really freaking out right now are worried or scared or disconnected could have at least the chance to reconnect because listen man if I was God wanting to get blasted if I was some Divine Being wanting to get high and Alan Watts has a beautiful lecture on this I really do think at some point I would want to cut off all connection to the realization of my divinity and experience infinite lifetimes and it's on a planet and a tumultuous planet and experience every incarnation and all of it to get an understanding of what it is like to be extremely limited and what would this do just add to my data banks it would just help me increasingly become more and more beautiful and perfect which seems to be what we're in right now it's like we have a limited data set based on our neural neurology we can't see certain colors we can't hear certain sounds we don't know what happened 20,000 years ago we don't know what happens five seconds from now and so this is a perfect place to be in what's becoming to know what it is to become and to be limited and this is who knows man is just something sniffing data you know it's something just like you know it's like snorting our lives like the universe is snorting our lives on on time and in the mirror of time well it's the big thing right that keeps us from seeing that the one thing that all psychedelics have in common is the dissolving of the ego they all dissolve the ego what's that word dissolution yeah dissolution dissolution of the ego that what's happening with all of them is it removes all this nonsense narrative in your head everyone's ego has this nonsense view of the world that's based on them being the most important thing and that you know all the shit that they're thinking about right now is of the utmost importance to be done right now that's why people run red lights you can't even wait you can't even wait you fuck it's one thing if it's a medical emergency kids being born so he's got a broken leg and you just you got to get to the hospital right away I get it a hundred percent get it but there's some people that just want to be they just want to make that left turn they don't give a fuck of the light change they want to cut in front of you make that turn even block traffic because they think more about themselves and they do about other people and that's that's a side effect of this life that's been set up but it's almost like maybe that's how it works maybe the life creates challenges when there are no challenges and the challenges are it just starts to diminish you tries to see if you're paying attention tries to weaken you and make you stupid and turns you into a fucking zombie if you walked into any restaurant any restaurant during lunchtime and you see people on their phones it's like this is bonkers this is if this was anything else that where half the room was using us an electronic and staring into it for long moments at a time not interacting with the person across from them like that becomes almost the norm they're like at least 50% of the people and everyone's interrupting everybody like you know they're all just barely paying attention to each other well they haven't developed a muscle I mean yeah it's a muscle you you it's people just assume that the ability to have a conversation is a natural part of being an adult but it's like you I think that's a true thing and a lot of people to the point now where I just try to be you know is I guess is like I just have lowered my expectations yeah to the point of like I don't know how many people can pay attention that much and I know I'm certainly distracted but doesn't it feel fucking weird even if you're just watching TV with somebody and they pull their phone out and start looking at it it's so weird it's like it's like the energy immediately down shit yeah the moment it's like if you're watching a movie with someone and they're over there on their phone like come on yeah watch the goddamn movie with me yeah even though we're not talking designating we're not connecting it's weird it's weird even fights he watch fights with your friends they're on their phone all dumb it's like are you not even watching these fights you can feel it yeah that's what you know the Denver Comedy Works they've got the days you don't know you know so like I was listening do you ever listen to an audience that doesn't have access to their phones before a show there's so mad do what no this no it's they talk to each other yeah it's like it's like the sound is better it's a better sound out there it's a different murmur than a phone murmur from you're out so yeah I don't know man I think that I think life presents all sorts of adversity and some adversity doesn't feel like adversity it's sneaky and that's what cellphones are that's what technology is that's certainly what so some social media is you only realized what social media truly can do when it comes at you you know you get cancelled or there's a bunch of people or tweet and mean stuff to you then you realize like all these horrible feelings this feeling of being attacked by this thing that's been grooming me oh yeah it's like what is that like well if if the earth was trying to get rid of us if the earth had decided that there's an infection that doesn't think it's an infection it thinks it's so important that should be allowed to pollute everything around it should be allowed to scab up the earth with giant concrete bandages I mean that's what we're doing we're putting these things everywhere that cover up all the ground displace all the life and then we shut off the light so we can't recognize that we're in space I mean the whole recipe is perfect yeah it's perfect for charming us to sleep the every every aspect of it the ego part the the you know the fact that it exists the fact that we have this biological imperative to stay alive and breed and then keep our DNA alive and there's all these things that are set into you to make sure that that happens all the while where you recognize you definitely are a finite life-form right but yet you do something you hate every day yeah you just keep doing it yeah I mean you do something you don't enjoy and you know when you get into reincarnation which I love that thing you're doing that you don't enjoy you've been doing that for infinite lifetimes it's that's called your clashes it's you're sort of it's like underneath your identity it's basically your code it's it's your tendencies I guess is the way you put it so like you know if you have the tendency to lose your temper then that's something that you've been dealing with for infinite lifetimes in it never ever goes away until you start waking up because the idea is to just go from being this set of conditioned responses reactions to your environment to being something that's like lucid living you know if you wanted to lucid dreaming try lucid living you know which is the practice I would say of like first under what are your habituation you know what like the other day I was sitting on the couch I took my sock off and I spun it like a lasso and threw it across the room and my wife looks at me she's like what what was that I'm like oh my god holy shit that's how I've been taking my socks off for years and I didn't even know it I pull them off lasso him and sling and like you like that just that little thing I didn't even know is doing something so probably doing that since I was a kid like I probably saw some cool kid lasso it sucks and throw it I'm gonna start fucking lasso on my socks but like how many other things are you doing that are just like that they're just pure habituation pure reactivity and this is where you run into some scary shit man which is what jaron lanier god i wish you could get him on you know that guy is what say his name jaron lanier I feel like I've heard that name he is what does he do he's a thirty like developed all this VR technology he's was in Silicon Valley and it's when it was just starting working on VR before the technology was even there to have VR goggles he was like building I think he liked and helped his group helped build I think it might be the oculus rift I'm sorry fans of his out there you're upset I don't know but some VR system yeah he's and he's like his he's written a lot of great books one of them twelve reasons to get out or ten reasons to get off your social media now really yeah I wrote a book called uh yep Jaron Lanier Jerry Aaron linear freaking brilliant human man but um you know it's called a ten or twelve kara twelve reasons to get off your social media now or delete your account something like that there's a book of his I like better than that called the dawn of the new everything but and that's just him sort of like talking about what it was like working in Silicon Valley back then and his sort of opinions on on this stuff is a white guy with dreadlocks yeah yeah no I think me body but um is me body well his physical appearance there was a large fellow fucking brilliant I believe it I said man there's a lot of brilliant people with wacky hair yeah yeah finding him because I'm like a I'm nerdy doing I love him we do as those bagpipes what's happening with this guy he's playing pipes who cares he's a genius I don't care okay this is quite a few photos of him with pipes goddamn it I didn't see the pipe photos you cares we should say like the kind you blow on like flutes and pipes and white guys with dreadlocks with their eyes closed playing the flute it's a very few things in life that make me feel like people media - yeah my that's my guy here's a new flute is amazing at it nothing wrong with what he's doing I think it's amazing I wish I could play a flute [Laughter] flute sound cool and I'm not being disingenuous I'm not being sarcastic flute sound cool I wish I got what is that thing though that needs to go away he's in the movie The Hobbit he's in the fucking pub and he's playing that thing in the back because they haven't figured out real music yet I'm only joking I appreciate your contributions I'm just joking I'm sure you were brilliant Duncan's one of my favorite people if he's brilliant just joking look you if you want to listen you play the flute the kind of people that are like super intelligent and what whacked out on you know technology I think something like the flute would be an amazing way to decompress right on the organa mean you're literally using your body to make a sound with air and tubes he plays it's amazing he said he plays like a hundred instruments or something she was some kind of genius but he here's the scary thing he said which is if like BF Skinner is right and you know pretty much if you can control the things environment you can control it this is the reason to be terrified of AI because you know the more advanced an AI gets like you know where our assumption is the things gonna eat us or kill us or whatever it might just gradually hypnotize us and buy and hypnotize us by creating more and more enticing things that grab our attention hacks our neurology and begins to like just do things that are completely impossible to not look at and that you know when you're saying an AI you know advise the pandemic what if that you know that how do you look away from a pandemic mm-hmm all of our nervous systems right now are completely fixated on every tremor every ripple every little data point that flies across our screens we are so absorbed in it right now we are locked in like cats chasing laser pointers and that is what he said we should be most afraid of is that this these things eventually could get to the point of completely grabbing us and what you were saying earlier is kind of maybe that's what already happened maybe there's a that is a process yeah maybe it's a process that's not even put in place by anything other than life itself the life itself has these system setups no one thing ever totally dominates and when it does they find ways into it and then it's this constant state of chaos that produces better and better life forms right that's what it is I mean if you want to admit or you want a state that we are better than our ancient ancestors the you know the pre Homo Sapien hominids I I think we're better I think we're better they might have been stronger than us but we've created more overall as a species I think it's better to be a person that it is to be a pre person right I think as it goes on and on we're gonna think the same way I think the next stage of existence is gonna be so happy it's not a person running around letting their dick think for them and fucking getting drunk all the time and crashing their motorcycle and you know all the dumb shit that people do all of the dumb shit from alcohol and drug abuse it's fucked up relationships to everything we do to lying and stealing and being selfish all that shit we'd be so happy if that all went away oh my god those dude the pre humans used to eat each other's babies they were always fucking stealing and robbing they couldn't talk things she couldn't express love who the fuck would want to be that right and then the humans the humans were so full of shit they were all addicted to their phones I didn't even see it coming the phone snuck in their life they welcomed them with new versions every year paying for their own demise yeah happily and they were all angry and bitter and mean and jealous and fucking thoughtless and polluting and then the next stage came along and they eliminated all that and we all live in harmony now we're all gravel great to be a gravel rebel space yeah or just we're all we're all part of the next yeah and we already are I mean I think probably we already are that but I mean I to me I think that whatever is happening you just have to make it a good thing like whether or not it is a good thing or not that's if there is something great about humans is that we're capable of alka maizing phenomena in a way that it doesn't completely drive us nuts or paralyzes that's any anything that's happening to you can be converted into something either that's going to make you scared self-destructive rationalize your anger rationalize your shitty decisions or it can be used as a thing that completely quote converts you completely shifts your method or a way of living and that's what's beautiful about a human is there any given moment you can do that like at any given moment you can shed your operating system theoretically you could drop all of the hang-ups all the weird shit are you jerking off three times a day you could maybe take it down to two times the den are you drinking every single night you can't you can stop that and to me that's like yeah I the future beings whatever they are I hope one of the qualities or one of the things they look back at is like holy shit those poor things had no idea how powerful they were they were sleepwalking when they could have at any moment connected to the great truth that divine the the the glory of all things and could have theoretically any one of them just one of them could have converted the entire planet and up and do an up leveled up resonance up consciousness utopia but they all were sleepwalking and then finally somebody woke up for real and I don't know maybe it's a I don't know what that looks like well maybe that what what looks like is what this is what this is happening what what is happening right now with this virus where everybody's being forced indoors and forced us to stop work it's a it's a terrible thing for people financially but it is in a sense a reset button it's a real reset button to know that this shitty job that you hate going to could go away at any moment because all jobs could go away in any moment it's a real wake-up call because even the good jobs are going away right if you're in San Francisco you have the best job in the world guess what you can't even go there right you might have the best job you're so fucking pumped to go to work every day you can't go you can't go so that can be taken away from you too so if you're living a bullshit life like recognize that all of this for everybody could go away right if Yellowstone blows half the people die right easily easily maybe more maybe more that motherfucker could easily go sure we we need these little catastrophes sometimes just to let us understand that the window of time that we've been existing in that's been relatively free of disaster is unique and that's not normal normal is madness normal is we're in the middle of a fucking shooting gallery spending a thousand miles an hour fireball that's normal and every now and then ship flies into our atmosphere and wrecks havoc this is why I love Hollow Earth theory man you ever get into that shit is that for people to get kicked out of the Flat Earth Society yeah hollow flatters people look down on Hollow Earth but hollow earth hollow hollow earth is like to me my favorite of them all because to like its idea is like yeah humans have been on the planet for a long time and if we want to go into like the cool idea of the Atlanteans and advanced civilizations at some point if you can't create a way to protect from the meteor impacts and you're looking to create a sustaining civilization you're gonna want to go in there man and so to me it's such a fucking cool idea that in the core of the earth is another Sun that has an advanced civilization that hasn't been disrupted by the shit that happens on the surface of the planet it turns the earth into a spaceship inside the spaceship for these advanced beings and outside the spaceship it's like a celestial fungus it's like growing out to the cyst or it's like another way to put it would be outside the spaceship as Mad Max like covering outside the spaceship is just a bunch of like you know us that are inside the thing who have basically been completely disrupted over and over and over again so they're they have no idea what history is they have no idea where the planet came from they don't know anything and now we've sort of grown out of control all around the ship and so this kind of shit that's happening is like turning on the windshield wipers it's like hey man you got humans on you you know that right man you're like crawling with them oh fuck wipe them out get rid of them let's just scrub the fucking surface do some earthquakes Yellowstone is just a windshield wiper for the people who live inside the planet well you know what humans are man really a vector for ideas yeah it's ideas that change everything the humans just do the work of the ideas but what we are we're the first thing that can manipulate our environment that has ideas we're the first thing with all these other animals they had instincts they had ideas in terms of like trying to figure out the best patterns to acquire food how to sneak up on birds yeah but if you think cats have ideas well guess what they all have the same fucking idea cats aren't inventing shit you know they're not inventing things there's a specific kind of idea that's unique to a human being regardless of the sentient of other animals ours is unique in that it allows us to make stuff not just little things we can make gigantic machines that travel in the space and all the the wild creations of human beings all came out of ideas we think it's all humans but true we we're the ones that put four but if you're a thing that wants to get born you need a host you get that curious ape to just been trying to figure out better ways to stab its neighbor with a spear get that thing and slowly infect it with ideas ideas of new stuff to make and then it goes out and does the work for you and then you take over the earth the ideas have taken over the earth the people are just the toys the ideas now if instead of ideas you set demons I mean that's that's literally what people used to think was happening to folks when they did terrible things they had bad ideas they acted on those bad ideas and ancient religions thought of those ideas like there were demons like these people were possessed that was a common thought that someone's possessed by a demon though hey we are all possessed by ideas and some possessed by them more than others like Elon Musk is particularly haunted he's possessed by ideas and what does he do well you look at what he's done he's one guy that's probably had more of an impact on our perception of what the future holds in terms of technology than any other one individual human being that is widely known of like he is a famous human like he is I mean he's doing Tesla which is the most advanced electric cars in the world they're insane yeah then he's doing this fucking loop thing right the hyper or the the boring project where he's boring who's doing the Hyperloop he's doing the boring project is making tunnels under LA and Vegas and you're gonna be shoot through those tunnels going 120 miles an hour then he's making rockets that shoot up into space oh and solar power - yeah like what how was one guys doing all this what's going on there well that guy's infected by ideas that guy probably has a huge receptor and ideas have clung on to him just like some girls have big tits some people have crazy parts of their brain that soaks in ideas there's no rhyme or reason to why but what what they are is an antenna for ideas those ideas come up you're like wow I'm glad I thought of that and then you go to work on fracking you gotta work on all kinds of different crazy things they've changed the world forever whoever invented Fukushima right he's like I'm figuring out how to shut it off when that time comes we'll figure it out no one ever does but that person talked people or that group of people whose ideas all coincided talk to people into building a gigantic nuclear furnace that you can never shut off yeah how crazy is that that's crazy it's crazy we scan the skies from meteor impacts but we have no way to scan human consciousness for some incoming yes yeah because some ideas coming in are gonna be great but there's gonna be a few there are really bad ideas like you know Hitler he had an idea yeah it was a bad fucking idea and the implement that idea was just floating an astral plane gradually just shooting towards Hitler's but I did that ideas fueled by an ecosystem and let just like you're fueled by nutrients right human beings are fueled by plants and fish and animals and vitamins and all these different things well you're these ideas are fueled they're fueled by insecurity and ego and lust and greed and jealousy and anger and virtue and love and prosperity and comfort and and community and all those different components of human consciousness all interact with this idea so the idea becomes like it just hitches a ride and hitches a ride with all these ideas that that already exists in your brain and then with these pre-existing structures like businesses and warehouses all these different things that we use to make stuff and then ship it out then the idea becomes a thing and then the idea winds up in the belly of a seagull because it looks like a fish whoops sorry you're dead you're dead seagull you couldn't figure out that that's a bottle cap not a fish and that this is this is how things change they don't just change because of people we're blaming ourselves and it is definitely us that's doing the work but it's all coming out of ideas if we thought of ideas as a life force instead of thinking ideas is like something you own yeah something you hold but even though you do deserve credit for your ideas because your discipline to sit down and try to cultivate these ideas accelerates the production of those ideas and exercises the muscle through which those ideas come through focus and energy so you deserve credit for it I'm not is not socialist way of looking at it but everybody that has an idea that's really good will tell you it's like it came out of nowhere like every great bit that you've ever had it's like pop a light bulb goes off and you have this thought and it comes out of nowhere right that's like most things did you write that are really cool they kind of come out of nowhere yeah you sit there and then also you think of things and you write them out they're like they're an idea that you're wrestling you just catch them and just catch them weld it man this is this is why I love collaborating with people because the more people you collaborate with you instead of just using your own brain as the net to catch these ideas when you have a group of people sharing whatever the intention may be whether it's to make like flesh-eating robots or to cure cancer or whatever then that becomes this like amazing a solar panel for like big ideas you know so I mean this is to me the weirdest thing about when you're working with a group of people are collaborating with people if you know someone's off you will sink to that level but if you're you know when you're around funny people you get funnier yes you know when you're around like people who can draw you can draw a little better it's like something about being in a group sure sure you know what I'm talking about yeah that works that way with martial arts really works it yep it works that way with pool when you watch people play pulled it a really good you could play better if you're a player like you see someone play really good you realize like things that they do and you see them and you emulate them and then you could do it we feed off of each other in that respect I think that's a big argument for the Comedy Store so good because there's so many comics there and we all feed off each other that's right if you're going on after Jeselnik you're like fuck that guy's so good that's so funny and they like it elevates everybody that's right if you're there with D'Elia or Joey or you or you know Sebastian like fuck man how am I so lucky Ali Wong and Whitney yeah and Eliza like you're working with some of the best people in the country the people that are killing it all over the country one of them hurt and Tom and me I keep going on and on and on and then they're helping you punch up jokes yeah I got stage what is my favorite memories they're in Jeff Garlin and Whitney Cummings are helping me punch up a joke and I'm sitting I'm just thinking like what the fuck this is like Hogwarts how am I getting how are these two people who are brilliantly funny and you know nothing you refine some like ridiculous just dumb joke do you ever still have imposter syndrome yeah yeah me too everybody does I think that's powerful yeah I don't get it as much anymore but it still do it stick you'll early used to get it with famous people yeah no yeah I get it I was around famous people I always felt weird like oh my god I'm not supposed to be around these people they're too famous the real famous I'm just fake famous right you know I did it's a weird insecurity that pops up but I think for you it's like you know when we first became friends you were the guy who answered the phone at the store yeah and that's really do those crazy conversations that you and I had without calling to give my avails we would talk to the phone for a fucking hour sometimes I know about wacky shit but that those sort of those kind of interactions that you have with people that they shape like they shape they shape what you are that's right you know and the more people that you have in your life that are like that that are interesting that you like you feed off and you you can have good ideas we could we could engineer a society that's way better that doesn't have all the pitfalls but we off to pull our own weight it's like there's there's a problem in this society where there's there's siphoning off of money right there's massive moving and exchanging of money and some weird way with like banks and mutual funds all that stuff's like what are you guys doing like what is how how are you so rich it's moving money around like there that's sort of that system since they run the financial system that sort of idea of how everything gets distributed its kind of hijacked because they kind of run the system we all are in the system and we all clearly benefit from the system it's the best system we know of but still there's some people that are doing some wacky things with the system and they have giant yachts yeah they don't fifty buildings but if that wasn't the case if it was a more fair distribution meaning not not meaning that you shouldn't be rewarded for your work but that you can't just kind of hijack money the way bankers can right you can't just kind of do this there's so so so much weirdness about using money to make money and that's all you do you're moving money around what are you doing you don't even have a real job right I mean you have a real job like you're not making a thing right you're not writing a thing you know you're not teaching a thing you know you're just moving monies around you deciding this company sucks I'm gonna fucking bet on this one like whoa and you're those the people oftentimes that have the most exorbitant amounts of money that it's not saying that they shouldn't have a lot of money they figured something out I'm saying that the system as it exists that it would allow someone to make that much fucking money from things is a little crazy crazy it's a little crazy it's not saying you shouldn't be able to get ahead I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to kick ass not saying you shouldn't be able to acquire an extraordinary amount of wealth are you saying I don't know if that makes sense to keep that sort of banking system to keep in place the way it is to keep the stock market in place let's what is it well it's based on confidence like what are they doing they're moving numbers around they're buying and selling and things are getting oh it's not worth as much anymore because this happened oh my god sell sell sell a lot of people are shorting it what you gonna do I'm gonna buy these fucking idiots they're wrong apples coming back yeah he's moving money around like wow what a wacky way to run an economy yeah man bunch of fucking pill heads yeah so I quit why I used to know these fucking kids from high school that uh one on one guy that I delivered newspapers with then went on to become a stockbroker that guy was always doing coke really so he was a madman he was a madman yeah I just love the pictures on the stock exchange whenever it's crashing war those fucking dudes like it always cuts to like the guy whose tires kind of pulled down he's like who are they what are they what is that I don't know but until my friend who was a wild man became a stockbroker I didn't think of stockbrokers like that I thought stockbrokers were like super nerd genius guys that are figuring things out and counting and selling the pensions all the markets and moving I didn't know there were animals like stop what stock market guys are fucking savages right and then the wolf of Wall Street came along people like what well yeah that's like my friend piece of the type of people that are like they have a big impact on the stock market yeah people like that fucking that crazy asshole that went to jail what the fuck's his name Madoff Bernie Madoff yeah people like that guy yeah like what the fuck man you just lying to people yeah you already you weren't even investing anything now oh my god like those type of crazy assholes there's so many of those in finance it's a mean there's great people in finance don't get me wrong there's people that follow the rules there's people that are wonderful human beings that also exists in that chaotic world but it also attracts a lot of fuckin sociopaths yeah well that's nice isn't that the idea is that that but like there's the sociopath personality type is gonna do better in certain industries yeah because you gotta be cutthroat yeah you've got to be yeah you just have to look at other people as being things you manipulate yeah dude um man I feel like a dick can I show you this thing for my show okay cool you know it was part of the thing I know you play you know that kind of like we spark up one more time before we see it yeah yeah not gonna touch that no all the people are like he's handle this mask wrong he's already I know it doesn't work I've got a beard that doesn't work anyway man yeah there's a lot of people out there that will critique your technique and lighting joints really all right critique everything I think I have one of the best joint lighting techniques and I think my problem is listening to them the problems nothing I'm saying it the problem is if you like tune into all the stuff that Chappell's got it right he doesn't do anything he's got no no social media at all man's a genius you don't want to get contaminated he's just got it locked in to what he's doing just constantly doing shows he was doing shows pretty late up until the the cancellation I did I forget the last day I did a show man I think it was uh I think it was mmm I don't remember but by Friday everything was canceled by Friday we were like we can't do this yeah I remember talking to you about that man I was fucking weird was weird Comedy Store shut down and that's like yeah we but it had to it had to and for everybody that's skeptical it's really about old folks and folks that are immune compromised I mean if you look at a dress elbow on his Twitter page that guy first of all that guy's a stud I mean that guy had a lot respect for that guy it's not only is a badass actor but he also had a real muy Thai fight he had a real amateur Muay Thai fighters training boy tiny got anyway as a fucking huge movie star and it's a real fight if you watch it they're really fighting really yes yeah it's fun movie is this not a movie I don't know what he trained he trained it probably for he was in James Bond right wasn't he it's pretty son shit ton of movies he's definitely done movies where he had to fuck people up so he probably trained martial arts for that or maybe he just enjoyed doing it but he could really got into muy Thai and he actually had a fight and he looked good he looked good he looked like a really good amateur and he he fought hard it was a real battle between this other guy but he has it and he's been doing these videos updating and talking to people on his Twitter and he seems fine he seems fun but he's really healthy he's a robust or a healthy well-kept man he takes care of himself yeah same same as a lot of these NBA players that I would supposedly habbit a lot of them are asymptomatic it's not we're not worried about them we're old people we're worried about people that are overweight people that smoke cigarettes that's but this is a wake-up call to a way worse disease like if this was the avian flu if this was if this was something that kill 60% of the people like you know there's an article in the Atlantic about this I think it's this is where I found that the avian flu killed like it was like 60% the one that they killed all the chickens in the early 2000s it was 60% fatality rate so if you got it see it was more likely to kill you than not kill you all right yeah and they got rid of that one pretty quick but that kind of one is what we got to be really worried about this one we have to be worried about for our older folks and our folks that aren't doing well but it's a good wake-up call it's good look no one responded perfectly no one in terms of no cities no countries no one did but everybody got caught off guard you have to realize everybody got caught off guard we didn't know the only way they really know that something like this is gonna happen is that that it happens and then there has to be a response so now we're gonna get better at figuring out what to do so my hope is that we get through this and then it makes us a little nicer to each other and then we also realize okay we have to have a plan in place in case a really bad one happens and we have to figure out what steps can be done to make sure that it doesn't happen again right yeah man I mean this is that is definitely what I mean if we needed something like this I wish it wasn't something that is gonna kill a lot of people's grandparents and I wish it was something something a little less but damn you're totally right man because it's been a long time since we've had to as a planet deal with a problem at this level and it's it's teaching us that there is a global civilization is teaching us that we are in our connected and it's definitely inviting us to reprioritize our lives man because holy shit and there's consequences to living in a way that you don't feel are healthy or ethical right like one of the reasons why they have those ag-gag laws we're not allowed to film factory farms it's because people would find it horrific right and that would be bad for business well that's not how we're supposed to look at it see that is that's that's a symptom of terrible thinking it's supposed to be the opposite way we're supposed to make it so that it's not horrific to look at right we're supposed to make it so that it's not this terrible thing now that's the difference between doing things that are that feel natural and doing things that are horrific and the horrific ones are the ones where all the diseases are coming from if you think about these farming operations like so just like let's just think about these wet markets when you got all these animals in the open air piled on top of each other dead animals laying on a plate dead animals laying on a table some late stretched out on the floor and you have them all over the place you're going to have problems there's going to be air and heat and bacterias gonna mix with each other and then it creates things that's what happened with the avian flu that happened in in animal agriculture swine flu same thing these fucking flus these horrible bugs a lot of them come from animals you don't think it was a bioweapon no I don't think so I don't think so I think the real fear if you talk to all the experts the real fear is an actual known thing jumping from animal to human we talk insist yeah when we were at the CDC forget it I'll never forget it Jarius fucking interview ever oh not just that show just devote all time sitting with that I wish I could remember his name the guy who ran this is the head of the place didn't we have some crazy flight - we flew in and we didn't have any sleep something we missed a flight because we got stoned and we talked at the airport and we talked for like a fucking hour and a half and then suddenly were like oh fuck our flight that's right we didn't just miss it by like five minutes either we missed it by like 20-30 minutes and we're at the airport and it was empty at the airport and we're like Oh we there's we have to tape this show tomorrow you remember yeah so we had a fly a different flight and we like barely got an hour sleep right I think there I think one of us might have had some magoffin all oh that's right we took that stuff yeah that stuff if you've never liked new Vigil if you've never had or provigil or new vigil I think they're real similar I don't remember which one are you used and provigil is what I used no new vigil that's what I used definitely you know the new one and it uh it doesn't it's not speed now but it definitely gives you energy and it keeps you awake in the weirdest way it's like but you're making it in a great agreement like okay here's my agreement I want to stay up but I promise get sleep from now on I'll get sleep the next day I'm not gonna keep using this there's not something I'm gonna keep using and stay up all the time no no that's what you go crazy but that's you can use it for that like if you're a real crazy product I know some people that use that shit for writing they're right on that chair and they feel like without it they don't feel like they have any energy yeah man I mean that's the trap of all those things any kind anything that's any kind of nootropics gonna do that man it's like but also I think some people from the sleep deprivation that's where they become antennas for the good ideas you know they like oh yeah it's like fevered state of not sleeping for days at a time and go literally insane and somewhere in there they write really good stuff that's what the you know news radio the staff at Newsradio they used to do that on purpose possums Paul Sims brilliant guy the guy who created news radio and he thought it would be a good idea to have a writing staff filled with a bunch of psychos who were willing to play video games and stay up to 4 o'clock in the morning every night it was like this mad vagabond crew of writers that he had assembled and they would play video games and just talk shit and then they would start writing at like 2:00 a.m. sometimes but they would come up with these amazing scripts cuz and the scripts were so ridiculous some of them were so ridiculous and it's because they were delirious when they were writing them they were just instead of doing drugs they were doing the drug of just staying awake dude this is for me I've just I started doing about six months ago a little longer waking up at 4 a.m. regardless of when I went to sleep I was having some insomnia and so I started I realized like shit I'll just like wake up when I wake up and then waking up 4 a.m. if you have insomnia that is going to cure your fucking insomnia because when night time rolls around you're exhausted but not only that 4 a.m. is like the great time for writing weird shit oh yes you're still half asleep and the stuff you write is it's like really feels like you're tripping you know especially waking up before him and then like eating weed I was doing that so you do eat weed first and then start writing yeah well no what my system before the fucking apocalypse was and again I wasn't doing this every day but I did do it for a stretch because I got into David Goggins but 4 a.m. eat we'd go to the gym and because I was at the gym because I was at the gym that's where I would write you were there that early well no because it would open it I got there once before the gym opened must have photo Salvage no I didn't do because what happened was I got to the gym and then I did I felt pretty fucking cool but then I went into the car and I'd like 30 minutes to blow and I'm fuckin stoned man and I'm sitting there baked and I'm like a bucket I'll just like sit sit in the car and try to meditate this is in the parking garage of the goddamn Hollywood equinox now let me tell you something man that area of Hollywood is already fucking weird but I'm sitting there with my eyes closed I'm kind of tripping I feel like I'm half asleep half awake I look over there are two dudes creeping up to my car window creeping up there and I'm like what the fuck I was sitting in the passenger side I jumped to the driver's side started the car I'm driving through the parking garage stoned these two weirdos were definitely walking up to my car I'm like tripping like what the fuck fuck I'm fuck I'm not gonna work out and so I I'm like what the fuck I'm gonna let these two like four am weird vampires stop me from working out so I Drive back in one of them's like leaning up against a pillar like just staring at me creepy dude these people look like The Lost Boys or something you're probably preying on the cars of people that go to work out probably looking for a car to break into right and that's what like 4 a.m. people that are out on meth and they know that this assholes like to go to the gym and leave their shit in their car right there you go there you go it was terrifying but you know it those that's what you get at 4 or 5 4 to 5 a.m. is you get math heads and you get people who are trying to improve their lives it's the funniest mix of people you get people who are like I'm not gonna waste fuckin second I'm gonna get up early I'm gonna exercise I'm gonna write because that's when like I mean this is a woooow idea feel free to light that shit again but like there's there's an idea of prana which is like energy and and there's more energy in the morning than there is at night so if you get up at 4 you're getting like the the purest most amount of this shit so that's why a lot of people meditate it really early while I like a lot of monks get up really early is because like it's a oh no it's just a very it's the most psychedelic time way more psychedelic than like midnight yeah it has you're having your certain some form of control over your life that especially right that you're exerting discipline like my friend Jocko he says discipline equals freedom he gets up every morning at 4:30 there you go and he puts a photo of his watch on Instagram and usually it says go time or something like those lines get after it every fucking day I go it's the best driving I mean before the pandemic when there was still traffic driving around at 4:00 a.m. you're awake mmm you're half asleep also I think it's easier to work out that early cuz you're but whatever part of you resist that shit is just like weak got to be careful lifting weights in the morning you really want to warm up because you can injure yourself a little easier sometimes you know that yeah cuz you just sleep it all night you're kind of stay if you want to warm everything up get everything going they say that people lifting weights it's not the best idea to lift like your personal record deadlifts and shit like that first thing in the morning it's just yeah you gotta eat your body up it makes sense your body's more heated up by the end of the day by the end of the day you lose you've been walking around doing stuff looking for it you workout getting pumped and then you can go in there and workout I used to love jiu-jitsu class at 8:30 p.m. for me that was perfect because jiu-jitsu it was like 8:00 at 8:30 it's like man I got plenty energy I'm eating all day you know it's like I'm not tired yet like going to bed tired but you know cuz back then I was going to bed it like 2 o'clock in the morning every every night anyway but it was like 8:30 was perfect done by 10:00 I'd hit the comedy store be on stage at 11:00 that's crazy I don't like working out at night I loved it loved it it's great because you're you have energy but you but it's easy to do because you wake up at noon you know and just fucking stumble out of bed do whatever bullshit you have to do that day if I my day off from you know doing stand-up at night yeah it's easy you just eat and hang out and then eventually work out but if you get up in the morning get a little bit of a victory yeah a little bit of a victor just having accomplished that thing you've gotten up and then next thing you know you doing chin-ups wrong maybe you're doing chin-ups you know doing champs well I could do like to do look done due to what I was what more what it would be is like me sitting on those nice couches at Equinox writing because like I said workout yeah I would procrastinate and that's what I realized it's like I do my best writing at the gym that's hilarious so do you bring a little notebook yeah I just started bringing my spirit there too right and then I would just sit and write and we're hold spend so much time writing cuz if that part of you that doesn't want to work out we'd rather write it's like when you have to write and you find yourself cleaning mm-hmm it's that you know you can like sort of convert your procrastination into something positive yeah yeah that's interesting then I would go work out you know but I would like I was so when I was doing that man I was getting the best ideas I was just running on the treadmill stoned if you know 5:30 or whenever the fucking gym open and you're always listening to this like I started listening to that was when I was listening in Goggins so I'll be blasted listening to Goggins running on the fucking treadmill ik yeah fuck yeah I'm gonna do an ultra fucking marathon how about that I'm never gonna go ultra marathon you listen to him too and he's aware that people like me are gonna be hypnotized by him because he's like don't do what I'm doing you can kill yourself just exploding no to it how many people do you think have collapsed at the gym cuz a david Goggins about like what 30,000 people yeah for sure this is probably a lot of blown out knees out there whoa now fuck the backs goin biceps that guy will run with his foot falling off the step book is really good what's that it's called can't hurt me yeah Jesus like it's amazing he like soze's calf muscle back on swig that guy could like I get like if that guy wanted to like burrow into an elephant he could he's a good dude - I like hanging out with him he might be I've hung out with him a few times got a dinner a few times yeah yeah yeah he went to the fights a couple times he's a good dude he's a fun guy meme I enjoy him yeah my friend think he's enlightened he's something he's something special there's there's a switch that that guy has that we all wish we had where he can he can power through but also he's a beacon of inspiration like for other people when David Goggins does the shit that he does and and when he has those speeches while he's running you know he's like someone's talking it was like 104 degrees outside and he goes why you running because I'll tell you why I'm running because you're not motherfucker that's why I'm running and you know he's out there just I mean he's he's constantly doing it like he's constantly pushing himself that's what I love me that's this he's like a servant in that way he's a servant he's a servant to the world he's not just like he's really giving people because like he's put he post pictures of himself when he was like sort of fat all the time and I'm like yeah I'm showing people like look this is the possibility at any moment you can do this at any moment and I love that because I do I know when I see him like he's like running through glass he's running like you know he's like running through like swarms of mosquitoes and malarial swamps just to show people look it doesn't the part of you that's telling you that you can't do this because of X in your environment is probably wrong not all the time but for sure man a lot of the time wrong a lot of time and that for a lot of us that's like so powerful like I've net of all the self-help books I've listened to I listened to my audible that's the best one by far hands down that's the best one man but cuz it's real it's not from a guy who really hasn't done anything that's trying to get you motivated to go out there and conquer in life it's from a guy who's actually done some really fucking crazy shit and it's telling you that you can do it too and that he used to be weak yeah he's doing something right now because Cameron Haynes son Truitt is trying to break Goggins 24-hour chin-up record so Goggins was at he was like what I think it's like Cameron Haynes Instagram page see if he let put the video on his Instagram page but he was at some ungodly number of chin-ups what when they were making the video he's right that break that yeah he's like I've been doing chin-ups for nine hours straight like 1500 chin-ups or something stupid crazy yeah and he still had all those hours to go so I think it might even be like a two-day thing I don't know how many days are supposed to be doing this but it's um does he have it in there with Goggins is there a video of Goggins doing chin-ups I mean the stories I hope I'm not releasing any information that shouldn't get out is this live again dope out there yeah I can't find it yeah whatever anyway you want to see the show he's doing loves your show so anyway shout out to try it out shout to true it good luck true a shout-out to Goggins I hope I hope they dig battle um all right this thing Netflix I told him I said call min it's called the midnight gospel the midnight gospel with Duncan Trussell in Pendleton ward the guy made adventure run this guy it comes out 4:20 Netflix this has never been seen they its exclusive for your show they gave us permission this this is Joey Diaz is in this and this is a podcast I did taking off my glasses yeah this is a podcast I did with Damien Echols do you know that is he was like in the group of kids who got accused of murdering someone in the woods there's a whole no oh yeah there was like a whole documentary about him on I think HBO it's like basically he would this dude the I had him on my podcast he wrote a book on magic he practices magic but Jesus talking he was on he was on death row and they did a DNA test that exonerated but he was like about to be executed he's on death row studying Zen Buddhism like Zen priest was working with him to like basically like it you know prepare him for his death you know soon as he was badly beaten on death row he was almost executed then he was exonerated because of DNA but we did this interview before the show obviously and this is just a way that we figured out to take podcasts and put him in ok once he gets exonerated does it before we start those does he get do they have to pay him I don't know it's a great question I think maybe part of it that they may I'm not I don't want to say because I've no idea I've no idea I think they guys on death row yeah I mean it seems like you owe him something well yeah I would literally innocent yeah I was an actual innocent person that you almost killed and the tree made their life hell yeah I mean eyes are the torture of knowing you didn't do something but being accused of that thing well I know man knowing it's gonna cost your life didn't really didn't do it yeah but let's play you know how in certain Buddhist traditions yeah like say Tibetan Buddhism they talk about what sword they use empowerment yeah you know it's like a current of energy yeah it's passed along from master to student ceremonial magic is the exact same thing the Knights Templar started receiving this current whenever they were over there that's how it makes its way back to Europe eventually if it makes its way to the United States through the Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn which was the order that Crowley was a member of before he you know went off to the OTO you had MacGregor Mathers Dion fortune the poet WB Yeats all of these people were members of the Golden Dawn that's how this current makes its way to the u.s. one second hey Steve what the fuck you need to shine that light my fucking eyes that's how you're gonna talk to customers I'll just take my ship full of cats and find another junk on ship for cats ah shit my apologies look at all these wonderful gifts and gadgets here we got a fresh print the time slappa elected some cans and you want that a vintage Enlil that ain't cheap pal it's gonna be five cats he's bluffing I can get it for three watch this three five fine Steve four and that's my last offer alright you take him flakes out of my Minos mouth but fine for it is send them over yeah yeah Wow yeah man it was like it was the craziest thing working on that show with Pendleton cuz he's like a like you know we throw the word genius around but the guy's an actual genius it was like really really really cool to get to do just so I'm sorry to interrupt you but it's it's oh it's a combination of your podcast and then some interstitial stuff they like you that you is like scripted it's yeah it's like basically my character is this guy Clancy who lives in a place called the chromatic ribbon where people use multiverse simulators to simulate universes so that they go inside and harvest the technology and sell it and so my character has a malfunctioning used multiverse simulator that isn't really working to produce technology and because it's malfunctioning every single world in it is going through some kind of apocalypse and so my character goes into his simulator and interviews people and though in the dying world so that's basically the idea of the show so he took podcasts dialogue it's basically what happens with you know during the apocalypse what's gonna happen people are gonna do podcast people are going to still have conversations so these conversations we just set them in these surreal universes where shit's melting down and you know we're like Clancy meets these various people and kind of learns from them what's crazy is you started this a long time ago and it's coming to fruition right when the apocalypse hits I know dude that's the thing it's like a little on the nose I mean yeah I mean it's like it's almost like it's it's almost like you knew it's almost like you had a type and then the universe is like this is a perfect time for duncan shit to come out and let's let's coincide it I mean look just look at how bizarre your show is yeah strange and then the fact that it's a hybrid of podcast conversations and then written stuff so strange yeah perfect time for it yeah you know I think it is a perfect time for it and I hope like because some of the like every guest we it was we chose for this they all had this like really like amazing thing to say like Eccles in this episode one of the things he says you know I asked him like do you feel like you kind of like were blessed that you ended up in solitary confinement cuz that's where he woke up memory started meditating that's where he started studying magic that's where he started working on himself because there was nothing else to do right any in this when he says like I feel luckier than some I was out there right now you are like completely disconnected because that's the coolest thing about him is you would expect a person who'd been on death row to be bitter he's the sweetest most genuine wonderful person ever and it's like whatever went on in the situation of being on the brink of the abyss where he's about to get murdered by the state for something he didn't do something about that didn't turn him into someone who was like shell-shocked or angry but like really turned him into like someone very compassionate and and I guess grateful for his life you know and that to me like it's like he's like the Goggins of death row I mean if you can be not bitter after being on death row for something you didn't do and like getting physically assaulted you know just wandering everyday if you were gonna die if like you can still maintain an attitude of service or contribution to society in some way or another then any of us can any of us can you know like any of us can and to me that's like I think that's I hope some of that stuff trickles out from the show into the world right now especially man right now especially when you say he studies magic what do you mean by that so well he wrote a great book called high magic which is I think that's what's called it's a fantastic book on magic is really the wrong word for there's a entire like mythos or religion that got sort of wiped out by Terence Mckenna talks about it a lot I got kind of wiped out by I get you know superstition so witchcraft is we understand it now because of Hollywood is like you know ladies riding around on brooms and shit but it just used to be midwifery it used to be like healing women who would like to live her babies and stuff really and but these these were all connected to they're all had pagan roots and and so essentially you you can follow back this branch of data that some people say started in Sumeria or Egypt ways of meditating ways of connecting with the universe that are ritualistic in nature but seem mysterious to us because even though like if you want to see what it looks like just look at a Catholic Mass you're looking at a ceremony it's fear gee I guess you'd call it that is a magical ceremony where bread gets converted into the flesh of a God that you eat so that's a your watch they're all wearing robes they're burning incense so that is magic that's what ceremonial magic looks like it's nondifferent from ceremonial magic someone in the Catholic Church might tell you this isn't magic this is me praying to the infinite and asking for forgiveness that's magic you're connecting with a divine intelligence you're hoping from your connection with the divine intelligence to produce some change in your own psychology in your own life and maybe create good fortune or whatever it is you're praying for healing whatever it may be that's magic so magic is that and that it's I'm not saying the catholic catholicism wouldn't necessarily be considered a branch of magic i mean one of the things he said in this interview is like if the bible is one of the most powerful magical grimoires there is I mean you read that shit if you really look in it there's all kinds of bizarre stuff that doesn't seem to make it onto a Christian radio look what well like when in the book of Genesis it's why are they saying why do they refer to themselves as a plurality when God's talking it's not like if when they're saying like why do we throw Adam and Eve out of the garden it's we if we don't do something about this they will become like us we there's a plurality that's being mentioned there hmm and so what is that plurality so throughout the Bible there's mentions of angels the Book of Ezekiel the famous one that ufo-ologists go to is there's all these contacts with angels a hyperdimensional beings that have some data set they want to bring to the world quite often depending on what book you're in at some terrifying prophecy about the end of the world that's kind but sometimes it's you know some message of hope or some message of healing so you could say magic is a non-christian oriented method for connecting with those various entities using ritual that's one branch of it now I'm not saying by the way these beings exist or don't exist but you could say if you wanted to get like psychologically you could say yeah we have buried inside of us bit archetypes bits of the collective that are buried deep inside of us and that there are ways to connect to these little fragments of the collective mind and you know many people know have their own method for doing that one of the methods to do that might be doing a ritual and and for a moment allowing yourself to imagine that you're trying to talk to an extra dimensional beam Aleister Crowley famously did one of these rituals and contacted a god what was I can't really that being was called but it looks like a gray alien this is before people were talking about gray aliens we've looked at it raw he draws a drawing of it yeah and it looks like a gray alien it's like your was ooze it's like the 1800s Aleister Crowley was in the 1800s yeah 1890 pulling at your ghillie suit you remind me of a drunk overweight girl with large breasts it keeps adjusting her halter top like you're in Florida outside drinking it's a motel I'm gonna leave you Clarence I'm tired of your bullshit I told them with a cigarette in hand Wow look at that drawing by Aleister Crowley yeah that doesn't your grey alien yeah man and he likes what we're gonna look like man let's cut the shit right that's we're gonna look like right when you when you see people that are hairy and and and brutish you we think of them as being like closer to prehistoric man right yeah I see a guy covered in hair he looks more like a beast yeah and when we see people that are thinner and more slender they become more more a gentle version of people and we associate that oftentimes of intelligence we associate directly associated intelligence with frailty right we all do that when you see some some super genius guy usually they're frail occasionally they're badasses but there's a lot of those super genius guys that couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag right well Hawking's the ultimate example because his body literally failed him while he was coming up with his greatest discoveries yeah so this is this our future never big heads we're gonna fucking CRISPR your way into a head that lets you live in any dimension you want at any time you transport yourself from one planet to the other we imagine what we've done with our stupid monkey brains now imagine it was a hundred and fifty percent larger one hundred and fifty percent more brain and then incorporated all sorts of fucking electronics so lets you interface with space-time around you and all kinds of other wacky ways of communicating we couldn't even possibly imagine now just like people from the eighteen hundreds couldn't have ever possibly imagined cellphones right and this is the idea is like okay we're gonna go there and then when we get there the way we understand space-time is going to be different than the way we understand it now yeah so what that means is theoretically you could connect or communicate with a being that is outside of space-time which is a future version of us right now using like various methods DMT being one of the big ones on the planet right now but all so using other methods that they're a little bit more precise because with DMT it's kind of like you're not really putting in GPS coordinates necessarily some people do it with intention like a shaman will do it like with intention and can like you know my excuse me can you give me another Bloody Mary I told you Clarence I'll fucking leave you cigarette in your hand flip-flops on I will fucking leave you yeah I'm out of here Clarence is over there with Miller Lite you ain't going nowhere just stop just fucking stop you always do this gets drunk says she's leaving imma fuckin fucking leave you son of a bitch I'm putting on my ghillie suit and going down to Tampa you son of a bitch I'm gonna visit my family in Clearwater I'm out of here Clarence it's over anyway yeah maybe you can connect through time and space to these things that are already here like our understanding of time and space we're locked in man but like so magick is like ridiculous on one level as it absolutely sounds and is on one level on another level is at the very least a creative technique so that you can sort of summon a dream state while you're awake with the intent of causing some change in the world around you using for a lot of people what would be considered a non-standard way well just in terms of your perception of how you view the world you can alter that pretty radically I mean from someone who has an amazingly positive perception versus someone has an amazingly negative perception you look at the results right over overwhelming benefit of being a positive person overwhelming there's something to thoughts and ideas that propel you in a good way and for having a good architecture forget having a good philosophy having a good operating manual for how you view the world and how you act and behave part of that so you getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning that's what that is you're like enforcing your ability to sort of dictate the positive aspects of your future you're you're deciding to take action you're strengthening your bond with with the way you interface with current reality and I was doing it rich I mean not rigid stop what the fuck out Christmas hmm God listen man if you want to meet me here I'll meet you here we could do some 580 sessions I love that man I mean yeah I would love let's do it I'm 100% down yeah come down here we'll get pump will put Slayer on and fucking walk I'm gone what else do we have to do but else we have to do is be a great thing look I'll tell you one thing though I am enjoying not going out I'm enjoying it I'm enjoying being home most of the day other than the type of days I do podcast but not doing shows at night gives you so much more energy yeah oh my god it's crazy you like can you feel like rested feel good I fucking love it man it's I get to be with my son more it's like really nice the place we just moved into who ever lived there before us had a flourishing garden so I've just been going out back pulling spinach out of the ground and like I know man left you food they left this food that's pretty dope yeah that's such a such a smart thing if you have a yard I get mad at myself for not having a garden looking on the garden right now I've had one in the past but I love a garden right now yeah I think it's a like especially now we should realize like man you should have food in a freezer somewhere and you should have a garden that's right and a gun but I got some milk for you do you really oh yeah yeah that would be very grateful you know I have I bought a box of these insulated freezer bags for people to thank you yeah it's such a that's a nice aspect of being a hunter because you have you get hundreds of pounds of meat from one animal so you can share that with a lot of people it's really it's a feel it makes me feel real good that I'm giving some to people then they send me pictures of cooked food like Tom Popeye just sent me this picture really Stros that he cooked yeah he's an elk fiend now Tom probably eats a shitload of elk well I don't think I've ever had help you'd love it it's delicious I'm gonna give you a bunch of different kinds but the sausage is the easiest to make cool so easy you just pan fry it you can do it in butter I prefer to do it in beef tallow I just see her two beef towel my favorite way to do it is I get to get it to like a medium medium temperature and then I put tomato sauce in with Ellis simmer the tomato sauce man you're the best that's gonna be so cool for my kid to have apocalyptic rogen health it's gonna be the best to bring back ELQ during a pandemic to your family well that's an L I mean that's an L that died from a shot from a bow and arrow you know I mean that's a there's something about that to me that there's there's more power to the the meat it's like I not more power in that it's like a powerful thing more power in that like I know what that animal was that animals a wild beast evading predators and me a stupid doughy human being managed to sneak into range where I could hit it and kill it in one shot with a bow and arrow I even have a video of it that my friend cam Haynes took so I have this animal that dropped and then we took it apart and butchered it and now I eat it when I eat it I think of what that animal was I animal lived a majestic life and if I didn't take it out it would have gotten taken out by mountain lions or bears or it would have froze to death in the winter sometimes that happens their teeth get ground down and there was an older male - which is what you want to get because those are the ones that have passed their DNA down so there's a story to that meat and there's a connection to that meat and there's no risk from that meat but when you're when you're thinking about the risk to society of like these kind of diseases that happen through agriculture I think one of the reasons why that is is because it's not natural ever for animals to be stuffed together like that so when it is nature's just like fuck you for breaking the rules and then these viruses start spreading it's almost like that's what it is for being unnatural because that those kind of diseases don't exist that much in animals in nature they do sometimes like brucellosis like some Buffalo have brucellosis it's a bad disease that cattle can get and then it can infect the cattle and sometimes elk have it - if there's a few diseases like animals always have diseases but it seems like those ones that jump to people the vast majority of them have come from us treating animals in a very unnatural way that's true but dude I don't mean to get organs territorial here but isn't it a little weird that Wuhan is where that virology Laboratory was it is yeah I mean like I don't know to me there gets weird but it's also weird that there's bats laying on the floor there good point that's weird too and we know for a fact that diseases jump from date they're tracing these things this is what's fucked up Michel osterholm who was on who was the expert in infectious diseases viruses and stuff like that he was explaining to us how they know certain diseases are morphing and they're changing they become more and more human-like and they were talking about this actually this one that deer get that's called CWD and it's called chronic wasting disease and it's first discovered that my friend Doug Durand sent me a synopsis of when they first discovered it but I believe it existed in like the 1980s cuz when they first started seeing it in animals but it was like a mule deer here an animal there but now it's infected like a giant population of deer in the Midwest and they don't really have a cure for it it's fatal a hundred percent of the time and it hasn't made the jump to people but it could well and they're scared and my colostrum was saying is basically these things are morphing all the time they're becoming more and more human-like they're becoming more and more like something that can invade a human host see that that's terrible terrifying terrifying and I think there's a battle constantly going on between these things that hog up too much resources and take up too much of a population slice like humans we're on every goddamn Rock everywhere and nature tries to throw curve balls out yeah I mean that's what nature does nature's like what are you doing you living in your own shit oh great here's the plague you know like that's what's happened throughout history with whether it was with poor sanitation or whether it was you know animal agriculture whatever the fuck it is people have caught weird diseases throughout time whether it's different animals could bite you and give you a bola you know that kind of shit these I mean these weird diseases have existed forever and they're basically the same as like viral Panthers right what's a panther a Panthers dad to make sure it's not too many deer yeah the Panther is the fucking cleanup crew because if it wasn't for that there would be fucking deer everywhere you're from North Carolina yeah you know what it's like in a country it's crazy sometimes because North Carolina doesn't have any mountain lions North Carolina has no any wolves so I maybe they have a little bit of wolves but not not a lot right they got some bears and they got a lot of deer yeah looking everywhere yeah New York State they have a terrible situation with deer in like Long Island there's parts of Long Island they were infested with deer and like what are we doing we can't just shoot him just gonna go out and shoot they're trying to give him birth control the thinking about giving deers birth control yes yes because there's no animals out there to eat them so they just keep fucking just keep fucking and overpopulating did you read the stand yes remember that see that was one of the things he talks about is how is there going down the highway they would hit like herds of deer so thick it would like block the highway because they were like starting to overpopulate there because there is no one there to call the hurt dude I had a gig once when I was living in New York and it was in western Massachusetts so Western Massachusetts if you are in New York where I was in New Rochelle you could get there in a few hours so it was like two and a half three hours or something like that you get to where this area's and where the fucking gig was was so infested with deer I've never seen anything like it in my life you're driving down the street and it's probably it was hot out it was probably the summer so I was driving down the street and these things are just jumping in front of the car left and right I was like this is nuts coming home on the highway was terrifying I got to go 30 miles an hour on the highway just with my foot hovering you ready to stomp on the brakes because these motherfuckers were just running in front of the highway I saw a hundred of them I saw him all over the place I might have seen 200 of them driving home everywhere you looked there was fucking deer yeah why cuz there's no predators it's an imbalance and eventually something's gonna happen and one of the things that has happened is Lyme disease these fucking deer have spread this terrible disease to so many people out there through the ticks the ticks have jumped from the D the D cuz there's so many of them there's fuckin ticks everywhere because they're well fed and like some ungodly percentage these ticks have fucking Lyme disease right and they jump on people they give it to people and people get sick you know and then the people have to have a reaction to these deer so they want to go out and slaughter the deer there's two it's almost like nature is trying to balance itself out right or is bad I mean like you know for us the goddamn kovat 19 is the worst thing that's happened to people in their lifetime in the sense like this shit we're experiencing right now is completely unique for kovat 19 I guess it's the equivalent of humans like colonizing another planet like that broken virus just like what it did is for it's amazing like it finally made its way out of one biome into another yeah it pulled it off whoever was down there mutating somebody had the great idea to like do whatever they did I guess it's like to create a way to connect to those two receptors what's it called there's like it's like a it connects to these two anyway I don't know wouldn't know what the fuck I'm talking about it that's okay it's like but it like what it did is so spectacular for the virus what's a you know catastrophe for humans its glory for the kovat 19 like super organism that's now sweeping through the human biome you know yeah and you know what else it did that's really interesting it made it so that it doesn't give you any symptoms and you're still contagious for days the worst case scenario so you can just keep spreading it yeah yeah there was I was reading a friend sent me an email from Aspen where apparently there's one Australian tourist a bunch of Australian tours had it but one guy refused to quarantine and he went skiing and went to restaurants rode the bus and like a it's like a movie it's but it's a movie right like that's what happens in a movie there's this new thing going around and this guy's like fuck that I'm here to ski yeah he's like I'm here to ski I'm going to eat I'm going to restaurant I'm riding the bus fucking wow what a dick but that's in the movie that's what happens right there's a guy who's in the lab and then like you have to be quarantined in lab and the guy's like fuck this I'm going outside and he has a cigarette and then something bites him and runs off and then that thing carries it in its teeth and bite some a person and the next thing it spreads to people and hugs and next thing you know it's a fucking epidemic and it goes through this and then turns everybody into zombies yeah right that's 28 days later right was it a monkey they were working on some sort of a disease the monkey got out PETA rage it was like some pee it was an animal rights group trying to free monkeys that had an experimental should have been pumped into them and the monkeys like attack the people trying to save them those people instant instantly turn into zombies and spread through the planet well I was reading about this mountain line that tried to attack this but I think it was a police officer well someone I forget who that but the cops had to wind up shooting the mountain lion but the the mountain lion had rabies and know how crazy is rabies it rabies tricks you into biting people to give him rabies raccoons raccoons are usually terrified of people they just run up on you and they got rabies squirrels rats all sorts of things they're not scared of you at all they'll just fucking jack you if they have rabies they come after you and you're like what the fuck is going on well that thing is trying to give you it's disease it's a zombie movie and if you don't go to a doctor if you go to a doctor they can fix it but if you don't go to a doctor rabies is fatal it's just straight up fatal there's like one person ever that survived from rabies and he probably wishes he didn't why was he probably her if ik probably I mean I don't know I mean it's permanent like no but there's very few cases of people surviving it's more than 99 percent fatal rabies is a terrible disease to die from apparently - oh it looks fucking awful man but there's a lot of animals that have it and they want to bite you that's so crazy it makes normally animals that are afraid of people it makes them aggressive to people well I mean dude did you read that thing about that guy who like knew he had AIDS and was infecting people on purpose he was like getting off on like giving people a like you wonder how much of that was his decision and how much of it was some dark mutation where it started yes because think of like okay I was trying to spread I know you do this I do it I've try not to do it as much but the spreading of bad news like you hear some bad thing that just had this person died this catastrophe happened you get on the phone and call somewhere like hey did you hear and there's this weird rush and like he's spreading the bad news you're kind of getting off on it so in the same way your idea swarm concept it's the same thing with bad news you you become a carrier for the darkness and so you call it now I'm not saying don't tell people and powerful shit's going on but sometimes I notice I'll go through periods where all I'm doing is telling people about shit they should be afraid of yeah you know spreading and usually the way you do it is through some story about what's happening in the world that's really a form of contagion you know and then that spreads and spreads and spreads and spreads and then everyone's freaked the fuck out and who knows man maybe that creates the condition of sleepiness or sleepwalking that we need for these viruses to appear you know wonder what it is that's so attractive to us about breaking the news I don't know did you hear who died I used to hear what happened in India when Michael Jackson died and I've made a point every single one who called me your Intel I know and they're like jeer like know what just to get them off to let them have the moment like holy shit really that's a lair Wow no you've got to be fucking kidding me you're joking right because it's like that you know for them I don't know what that feeling is that's hilarious do it the next time some awful thing happens like give me friends the satisfaction oh now they're gonna hear this podcast true oh man what is the rush of telling people I don't know it's probably built into it's right because it's like a survival thing like if you were if you were in a community and you knew a fire is coming you want to tell people so there's probably some reward mechanism worst is when someone told you but they've you forgot they told you so you try to tell them and they're like I told you to you my wife does that to me all the time she's like I told you dummy Mike no that's the worst when you get caught not listening I knew I was just saying it again yeah pathetic escape from your lack of failure to myself no I remember I know I know I know I'm just talking out loud that is the that's the worst I don't that had my wife has done that actually I was like wait well what did I just say and you're like oh you were talking about in the baby oh yeah yeah when people are around each other all the time they learn another filter each other out they have to you need your alone space and sometimes you get it while you're still there you get it but why you still there by zoning out yeah it's got to be present more than you are doing that that's right that's that seems to be the key you got a zone man it's okay to zone like don't get into some ridiculous definitely don't beat yourself up for zoning no well specially as a creative person I think zoning spacing out sometimes and just being bored sometimes where the best ideas come from yeah because you can sit around and think about things like today we're never bored I mean this is a this is a common complaint about people when they're talking about one of the consequences unintended consequences of social media addiction is that you're never bored and that being bored is actually probably not a bad thing because it fills your head up with ideas you start thinking about things and occasionally you thinking about things that are good that you might not have thought of if you just staring at people's butts on Instagram that's right yeah boredom well that's like the guy I work with you like with meditations got David Nick turned what he taught he teaches me about bored and we it's a Buddhist concept hot boredom and cool boredom there's two types of boredom one of them is where you're like man that's like the addictive boredom where you're like I'm gonna get out I gotta get you know I'm bored but there's a sense of like the other type of boredom cool boredom that's more like what you're talking about which is like just being okay where you're at in the moment but admitting to yourself this is boring like that's one of the things it's boring like I'm bored right now did you tube videos are more fun I'm gonna go see something crazy on YouTube car chase yeah it's a fucking do you do you do you ever like go to your phone when you wake up at night do you do that is that your go-to like when I wake up at night you ever wake up at night I do and I try to go back to sleep I never just stay up I just go back to sleep see that's what man I gotta stop doing it because I'll wake up and the first thing I do reach over for the phone start looking at it waiting to get sleepy again that doesn't make you sleepy it wakes you up wakes you up that's not good it stimulates that area of your brain that gets lit up by electronics BP EEP EEP EEP EEP it's so exciting and stimulating next thing you know you're awake I do that the smoke pot thing too and then right but sometimes I do the smoke pot and workout thing and then it becomes the smoke pot and right thing just because the the rush right after you get high is like those are where the best ideas come from and like I feel like you got to grab those fuckers while you have them and if it means postponing your workout for an hour like that's actually the smart thing to do it's the the the dumb thing to do to go through the workout first because especially if you got high because those ideas they're coming hard and fast for like the first part of the high and you probably won't get them like that for the rest of the high so while you go from being straight sober to the big rush that you get in the beginning that's when all my best ideas come from is the big rush which is like an hour from getting high to an hour later that's the big rush that's when I feel like I get the most like where the fuck did that come from ideas yeah and the best writing like when I write things it's like them the cleanest it's the filled with the most gems there's more stuff in it and then the other stuff is like editing it and putting it apart and taking apart but if you don't capitalize on that rush I feel like you only get one of those a day one big especially like if you if you're sober and then you get high that one first high rush of the day that's not doesn't last that long and if you keep staying high I don't think it's the same and then staying high you sort of settle in right yeah yeah but the rush of just getting highs like wow yeah so many ideas if you wasted that by doing chin-ups you're an asshole just agree go right right and then lift afterwards yeah for sure man I mean this is yeah you've got a harvest when yeah when it when when the wheat is blowing you've got a harvest you can't miss but it's easy to trick yourself into thinking oh no I've got to stick to my fucking workout or whatever the thing is it's not just working out it's like whatever I think it's important to prioritize those moments I mean especially if you're going with your like with what a lot of people say which is this the antenna idea you're a receiver your signals you're like steady but not for aliens for ideas and these are search for extraterrestrial ideas that's what you are you're a satellite for that and if you start getting I mean imagine SETI imagine someone at SETI doing chin-ups and suddenly they get like a some signal from afar star system and he's like I'm gonna finish my workout before I check out whether or not we're getting contacted by aliens that's an asshole if you're because the real question is where do your ideas come from exactly and if you're picking up whatever these creatures are and you've been blessed enough to get them yeah you should write them down the rhythm though it's kind of like I mean not that I don't like you got to honor them honor them right yeah gonna act on them I mean that's why people that think of the muse like the concept of the muse that's one of the more it's a productive way to think of it like Pressfield writes about it and press field in the war of art and he's you know he's a very down-to-earth he's not a it's not a silly man it's a very down-to-earth person but his perspective on the concept of the muse it is it's very beneficial if you follow it because his perspective is essentially that you pay honor to this thing you show up and you do the work like a professional and then it responds in turn it comes to you yeah and then these are what it's like the we think of an idea even though it's one of the most important factors in the entire construction of civilization but somehow or another we don't think of it as that we think of people being that and we are because but we're being used by ideas I know that sounds crazy I really do I know it sounds dumb too but you are you're coming up with these thoughts and we're thinking of them it's like random connections that you're making in your brain which might be it might be that but it also might be that ideas are like a life form from another dimension that's trying to manifest itself in our current realm and they do so through getting into people's heads and the more you call for them the more they're there for you and the more you show up and you can call that the muse you can call that whatever you want Jules Tesla believed Tesla believes some he was getting signals from some other some other some other planet or some other life-forms he had some weird shit that he wrote it's hard to decipher about what he CV can find that cuz that's a very interesting thing Jamie's heaving about what did Tesla like Tesla had a take on receiving information from other galaxies he had this take on where I some some of his inventions were coming from it's like why it's so some of the transmissions that he would receive I mean goddamn it wouldn't have been amazing to talk to that guy yes imagine have a Nikola Tesla on the podcast oh oh who knows man maybe you still can one day yeah bring him back or like you create an AI Tesla I think a lot of people have that feeling and some of them just don't come out of a closet so to speak with it because they're afraid they're gonna get judged you're ostracize I think a lot of people feel like they have a direct contact with some kind of sentience that isn't embodied inside of them and it's giving them ideas and they're just terrified to put it out to the world because it sounds like you're fucking nuts his claims of receiving signals from outer space were proven right a century later woo hoo during the summer of 1899 Tesla set up a field laboratory in Colorado Springs Colorado to pause to the possibilities of using high-altitude stations to transmit information and electric power over long distances 1 July this is not what nothing about this is about this signal is not like him getting I went too quickly on ok where is the signals this is like like radio signals oh that he was getting radio signals from other planets after the ruling out I think this is about sending after ruling out solar and terrestrial causes he concluded the signals must be from another planet yeah sure and had a vision which is what like that's it yeah well here it says a 1 July Day why tracting lightning storms oh so as his actually equipment his equipment picked up a series of beeps after ruling out solar and terrestrial causes he concluded the signals must be from another planet the following Christmas in response to the American Red Cross his request for a prediction of the greatest scientific achievement of the coming century Tesla wrote brethren we have a message from another world unknown and remote it real it reads one two three in 1996 scientists published published a study replicating Tesla's experiment and showing that the signal was in fact caused by the moon low passing through Jupiter's magnetic field holy fuck he was picking up a moon passing through Jupiter's magnetic field yeah but he had woo ideas - yeah he was in love with the pigeon he's in love with a pigeon not just that though he like I think he did they use in contact with like some kind of sentient intelligent Eve for sure why not why wouldn't you think of you that smart imagine how smart he wasn't compared to sending like a regular dope hey mister you want to buy a paper you know people from back then some fucking dude selling papers in the corner and then but the greatest genius the world's ever known up to that point yeah wandering around trying to figure out how to send electricity through the sky maybe that's all intelligence is though man is like having the willingness to let yourself go crazy enough to believe you're not the creator of your ideas to believe that you're an antenna maybe that's what makes a person intelligent maybe that's all it takes it that and discipline well yeah the discipline to learn all the things that you need to know to be able to study and actually implement that technology psyche Tesla was both things he was a genius and he was probably some sort of a visionary in that way like yeah he had like Elon has he had an extra large magnet for ideas yeah yeah dude I think anyone can do that strong as this weed fucking strong man I'm so glad anytime you give me weed I'm always forget how strong it is and every time I gotta be careful we go high-grade up in this bitch son it's important to go high-grade I think so yeah absolutely what do you think is what do you think is gonna happen to us do you think we're gonna get through this in relatively short order or do you think this is gonna take five six months call anything is gonna take the lockdowns are crazy I can haunt you like San Francisco the lockdown is crazy three weeks 24 hours stay off the streets don't go to work yeah man I think we're probably gonna look like listen if you go if you want to hear my like just instinct which is definitely gonna be wrong I think it's gonna go it's gonna get better much faster than we expect I don't know why I think that I have no reason to think that if you go by what they're saying we're looking at like months and months and months I guess like if I have to choose between listening to my own stoned intuition regarding stuff which fits into my desires which is I want it to blow over because I don't want people to get sick I don't want to live in the apocalypse I have a son I don't want to run out of food I don't want things to get back to normal I want to go around people but if you look at like unless we're living unless it's some vast ridiculous conspiracy I think we're looking at at least a couple of months man I mean this is and I'm going by it not a conspiracy because I think that in because I have a son now and if I listen to my own instincts when it comes to shit for my kid I'm gonna be afraid to vaccinate him I'm gonna be afraid they do things that like millions and scientific papers have shown as safe that's good for his health because I'm gonna get superstitious so I lean into science it saves my life you know science kept cancer for spreading through my body and killing me I'm gonna trust the scientists right now in self isolate and try as much as possible to not spread this shit and um I think that that's even if it turns out to be a panic hysteria whatever at least you were part of the people who aren't fucking going out and skiing during this fucking thing so I think it's gonna go on longer and I think while it goes on longer if you have the ability to limit human contact and to avoid the superstitious part of yourself that I've got to that's looking at this and thinking like come on really I don't know what you want to be sick I don't know I don't know it's also a rejection from change a rejection of change that you don't have any control over denial and deny that it's happening because that's the easiest thing to do if you deny that it's happening you don't have to face the fear and if you don't face the fear well then you put yourself in danger but really probably I don't know how old you are out there but you really who you're putting in danger is somebody's grandad yes that's the main thing is like ten people with diseases people people that are compromised there's a lot of us that are not that strong we in you know maybe some people are recovering from something you know like talking to Jonathan ward yesterday and his wife's recovering from cancer she's going through chemo so like they want to make sure she doesn't have to deal with any of this shit like it's not exposed to any of it those are the type of people we have to be really scared of people that are compromised right but this is you know this is a fucked up moment for us but a learning moment I really hope that this prepares us in case something really horrible comes down the pipe and I think I hope it prepares us for understanding that this is a possibility it lets us understand like hey we need to accept this this is this is how it goes and if there's some new shit that comes on let's act quicker and let's take care of this quicker and like if everybody just had a two week off thing like you know and this was something that Dana White and Frank Fertitta were talking about before anyone did it Frank Fertitta told Dana White he's like why don't we just have everything shut down for two weeks just no one go to work no one do anything two weeks stop the planes and the way he explained it to me was like he said pull the band-aid off of it I'm like that is actually probably a really good idea well guess what now that's being forced mandatory forced in certain cities where they've got bad outbreaks if they've just done that the moment it cut the moment it cut loose just no one goes anywhere for two weeks let's nip this fucking thing in the bud yeah if that was really done there right it really would I mean if you could really get that to be implemented at a scale of 350 million people amazing but you you could you definitely would have radically slowed down the pace we weren't ready we weren't ready well now we know yeah hope I hope I hope we learned and I hope it doesn't morph and I hope it doesn't get more deadly and I hope you know they can figure out a way to allocate funds to get more respirators and you know all that shit has to be done you can make your own hand sanitizer yeah I heard that you just wash your hands with soap - yeah you know soap apparently kills it what do you think are like the three things you should have it you're a food you should have water or something that purifies water whether they're water for water purification tablets they you could buy iodine tablets there's like that for you think the city water it's gonna get turned out anything can happen anything can happen you might need to drink water that you don't want to drink alright you know that's possible you might drink puddle water I mean look the reality is if things go real bad you might have drink from a lake right okay and that's what water is you know water we take water from various sources and they purify it and you know rain water and all kinds of shit that's what we're drinking on a daily basis we're drinking this weird processed water yeah the water you really supposed to be drinking is the stuff that comes right out of the ground that's what you're supposed to be drinking but if you get stuff that's biologically infected you get stuff that you no animals have been in it's animal waste feces and stuff or bacteria or diseases or anything you can purify that you can you could take these water tablets and you drop them in there and it kills everything it torches the water so in cases of emergency like backpackers they'll find out like an elk wallow and they can drink that water out of a fucking alcohol oh really yeah there's a thing called SteriPEN is another thing that you yeah this SteriPEN actually uses ultraviolet light let's say you have a water bottle you fill it up with like elk piss and you like wave your thing because you're trying to stay alive you're out there if there's no water like if you're on like a high country desert mule deer hunt and you can't find any water you gotta take water wherever you can get it cuz you don't you're not bringing all your water up there if you're staying there for 12 days you're hoping you could find creeks and you might not find a creek and if you do it might be fucked up there might be a dead like shit like something might have gone there to die and polluted the water or beavers might have shit in it like you have to have something that kills all that stuff so that's something that people should have they should have I think you should have some sort of a first-aid kit bandages things like that disinfectants antibiotics stuff like that you should probably have something like that in case something goes wrong and someone gets hurt and there's no hospital available or there's no doctor or you have to wait in the morning before you can take someone to a doctor whatever the fuck the problem is you should have that you should have batteries that you've charged right like cell phone get some backup batteries charged those bitch right you know if you have a generator fantastic but some people can't afford one of them don't have the room for one they can't have one it's not feasible if you live in an apartment yeah but having charged batteries for phones is very important food and water food and water are number one right you want to have dried foods things like rice and pasta you could store a lot of it you could eat it's high in calories you can eat it you know you and doesn't doesn't take up too much room there's you know canned things you can keep forever that's what you want you want food that you could have like that you could keep you alive you know well let me ask you this man because this is like something I've been talking to people and myself I've experienced a little bit I don't know if you have but what about those of us who are like kind of secretly freaking out right now not so secretly yeah how do we but to me that's like I think one of the big questions is you know I was talking to a friend of mine and he was like man I totally was losing my shit yesterday man and like I told I'm like dude me too everybody yeah but what like how the fuck are we gonna deal it's just such a weird form of anxiety I've never had this kind of anxiety before it's there's an invisible monster yeah invisible monster that wants to kill your grandma yeah you know yeah an invisible monster that kills upwards the the high levels like somewhere around 3% of the people you know and and with old people it's even worse with people over over 80 I think it's you know it's really deadly it's fucking scary man and what's scary is this is only one of many that could be coming our way right and that this happens every you know X amount of years or something last one was you know h1n1 and SARS and this and that and there's always a new one and just a fuckin flu man I didn't you know I didn't until we were looking into this I didn't know how many people the flu killed yeah the flu can kill ninety thousand people in America every year yeah I didn't know that did you know that I knew that so when they say this is ten times more deadly than the flu York holy fuck maybe 15 times more yeah holy fuck that's a million people that's a million plus yeah that's scary that's scary that's scary and then you know other really horrible diseases that of devastated populations those are possible - and new ones are possible Joe I was asking how do we deal with the fucking anxiety now I'm feeling you got to look at it you got to look at it for what it is this is reality the way to deal with anxiety is to be prepared as best you can except where you are and what you are and who you are and just live it reprioritize Azure values you know that's that's what's gonna be good out of this nothing nothing good ever comes from having it too easy right like for us I think are as a culture having it too easy was probably a little bit toxic to us like always eating junk food we're always eating sugar that's all we're eating it's okay to eat cake every now and then we can't just live off cake well as a culture there's a lot of what we were dealing with living off cake you know if you ever seen that Werner Herzog documentary happy people life in the taiga it's a great documentary about these really nomadic people that live in Siberia and they're super happy and they live in these log houses that they build themselves and show them building these houses they don't have enough mosquito repellent they have to make their own mosquito repellent with like tar and they grind it up and add stuff to and then rub it all over their face and everything and they're super happy they live up in Siberia dude it's so fucking cold it's only it's only summer for like three or four months it's only like nice out and then the rest is just bitter brutal cold where the winter breezes the river solid we can ride a snowmobile over the river so they use the river like the highway and they all have dogs and they run around trapping and killing animals and living off the land and catching fish and living off the fish dude they're so happy what's fucked up is these people are encountering life-threatening adversity every day if you stay outside you will die you will die just from exposure to the cold it will kill you it's 50 below zero outside it will fucking kill you and because of that they're all like happy and smiling and laughing and the documentary just shows like it's weird we're not we're never happy like this in a collective group unless we're all living in this constant state of like alertness and consequences for inaction like there's no lazy people there man everybody does their part you have to yeah and they're all working and laughing and they're all making their own canoes out of boat out of boards that they're chopping out of logs they're hollering out these canoes and stretching them out it's amazing man they're just always working and they're always happy it's so weird that's it that to me I think a lot of people don't realize that you can work together with people not for money just to do Store community and how fun that is when you find yourself even you know my wife and I fucking moving and like I'm packing boxes it's been like non-stop for the last like four days like and we've had to like you know it's there's something in it even though it's terrifying that really is joyful and there's is so like feels more alive than I've thought in a long time I think that's the thing we've got to tune into is that if nothing else were alive right now that's beautiful and yeah maybe there's just extent maybe we can become like those people up there I mean I think that's one of the anytime of thought that thing happens to you personally it's a chance to become a bitter piece of shit or a little more angry or a little more tired or a little more depressed or to become a hero anything whatever it may be any bit of phenomena that comes your way as a person you know anytime I fight like anytime something's really got to get done that I've been procrastinating or any time some shitty unexpected thing comes my way I have a moment to decide am I gonna react to this like I always react the shitty things and like become negative or dark or get pissed or can I like react to it in a completely new way and I think every time you do a new way is my woogle concept you pop in to a different part of the multiverse it's a little better than the one you were in before and it's like a trajectory you can go on when I was getting stoned at the gym it for him I was imagining on the treadmill that I was running through the multiverse towards a healthier version of me that I wasn't getting in shape I was actually being inhaled into a more on shape version of me that already existed that's the kind of shit I have to do to get myself to work out yeah man it's a fun it's fun to do that you know every single decision is like a binary do you want to continue doing the shit you've been doing over and over again whatever it may be or do you want to try a mildly new way and every time you do that sure is shit it's not just you that starts changing you'll notice like other stuff starts changing too around you you know things just tend to generally get better yeah I think there's there's thoughts that I've had that are real similar to that where I've wondered like if if multiverses are real and they're supposed to be different versions of you infinite versions all over the universe why are we assuming that this is the same every day you wake up in the same version why are we assuming that to think about sleep is you just go away then you come back with a memory of what life was like before you went away and you wouldn't notice if it just slid you one notch to the right or one knot to the left into the multiverse there's an infinite number of Duncan's out there with ghillie suits and gas masks on yeah and you just slid over to the right by letting a little old lady in front of you and not even complaining when she was driving 30 miles an hour okay yeah like it's all right it's just a nice lady let me just get around her nice and slow and safe yeah that's it wave to her hi and the more you do that yeah the more you do that the more you start running into other people who are doing the same thing hmm you start ending up in that part of the multiverse where many other people are doing the same thing yes and eventually you know theoretically I think eventually through those series of decisions maybe that's where you can like that's where all of a sudden you start realizing like oh shit oh shit I'm in a temple I'm not even in a in a reality that I thought I was in I was just like in a deep state of contemplative meditation yeah and you know I don't know I mean there's all kinds of interesting experiments you can do if you ever heard the term pro neue pro noia it's the opposite of paranoia where you think the universe is conspiring to help you instead of hurt you that's brilliant yeah maybe that's what we'll call a group pronoia pronoia yeah yes yeah that's perfect yeah yeah we needed a name that it just came to us pro neue sounds like a dope band yeah gonna go see Pro Noi at the stable Center it's fun if you do that if you really do imagine that every single thing that's happening in your life is a grand conspiracy to help you to advance you to bring you or another way to put it do you ever listen I love listen to Christian radio this guy was talking about a thing called convection which is being inhaled into the Christ so when you start like like a black hole well I think like the white hole I guess it would be a black hole gobbling up planets but you're being like strong into this into the super intelligence and you're becoming in like you're being sort of lifted up into it the thing that makes the fucking Big Green Egg work like the thing that sucks smoke up that's happening to you into the divine intelligence and as it happens you imagine you're the one doing this stuff to get you closer to it but really it's just your mind playing tricks on you you have no choice you're gonna be you're gonna wake up you're gonna gain realization and and so as that's happening you kind of you know like you can quit something you can quit drinking you can quit smoking but you kind of long for it but then sometimes you notice you just stop doing shit that was bad for you because you found a better way to live and it naturally falls away right that's convection you're being drawn into the divine mind as that happens the shit that looks like austerity when you're like further away begins to actually just be a natural way that you act you just become naturally more graceful naturally less inclined to do shitty things naturally more tuned in with like 150 year old version of you you know that that you sort of naturally and that just happens on its own because you were being convicted into the Christ sucked into the Omega Point the divine yeah mmm we should probably leave on that so we end up huh yeah that's perfect wit in right thanks man thank you four o'clock what how the fuck does that happen what right this was a total time-warp episode you and I always have the strangest episodes man I really do then cool you missed four it's almost 4:00 it's 346 normally I would have had to piss like three times dung didn't Russell tell everybody when you show us out thank you Joe April 20th on Netflix the midnight gospel you can follow the midnight gospel on Twitter and Instagram and thanks Pendleton for making the show with me thanks y'all for
