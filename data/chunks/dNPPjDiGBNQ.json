the Joe Rogan experience that's a that's an incredible test that's the first time Joe saw Ahri's butthole yeah there's no way I can remember that far back I think I think Ari's did so many times these and process of getting his butthole folks is he gonna get surgery yeah at the sir he's been bleeding since I've known him yeah it's bizarre that he lives life like that that would show that's a problem that would shut me off from going out to the world but what what causes those things hemorrhoids what causes hemorrhoids I got hemorrhoids working out because I wasn't breathing when I was lifting weights and I was just just clenching my butt hole made blisters inside your butthole and it's season together for a while well this actually will have we got introduced to our EES butthole was I was complaining about me having hemorrhoids and I'm Legion of skanks we opened up my butthole to show that I showed all the guys Lois did it step aside little ladies let me show you a hemorrhoid and it was like it was like the you know and stranger things the fucking monster the way the face opens up that's what all his asshole does it looks like a hammer Simpsons mouth yeah member like the blade remember the blade vampire mouths it opens a lot like he keeps tissues in his asshole at all times and if you're with Ari at one point he might just throw a bloody tissue at you if it got to I get I get staying away from the doctors I get it but if you're actively bleeding out of your ass so like I'd be on an operating table face down Oh quick quick I think it's a real pain in the ass to get the surgery dealing with it as is yeah yeah but I mean it's I'm glad he's gonna get it fixed though it's troublesome when your friends how many times that guy send you a picture of bloody toilet paper I've seen way too much way too much the thing to me is that re historically has just crushed ass like hot chicks walking around with confidence I he's confident walking around with napkins weirdly handsome like you don't think you see me like her that's a fucking goofy camel face fucking asshole yeah but then you look at him again he kind of dreamy eyes he's in good shape I don't know man when you look at any top fighter and you look at all the sacrifices they made just to be where they at and you you have people taking shots at them and stuff and they'd be like man you don't know what I didn't put my body do to be here today or you didn't know what I went to went through and it's just like total disrespect for somebody that haven't even stepped foot in the ring you'd be trying to critique you my name they never stepped foot to get punched in the face before that you can never really understand though right no one could ever really understand what it takes to be an elite boxer when you're hold the future of your family the future of yourself your financial success and all the people around you is dependent on you navigating the most shark-filled waters in professional sports a bunch of trained killers with their hands everybody's real good at knocking other people out with their hands and you're successfully navigating those waters like you know no one really understands that other than you you and all the other people like you like the real me people on the outside that are close to you kind of get it a little bit you are the only one who's ever gonna be able to understand that so how these people talking shit like they might as well be speaking a language they don't even know what the meaning is fact it's nonsense they say nonsense and it's just like you got a bull's-eye on your head in your back mm-hm because you you you reverse first you had your eye on somebody he was like man I gotta beat this door after this dude I gotta beat this dude so he was eyeing that person that was in your shoes you know that was once champion of the world like I was iron Ricki burns when I was coming up you know and not there I'll be him now everybody's on me because I'm chef now so it's no more Ricky burns it's Terence Crawford we got to get Terence Crawford he's the chimp mmm so now it's like damn everybody wants y'all here so now you've got trainee we're harder to keep the title hmm so we crafted I think the the right statement which was listen like it's offensive doesn't mean I'm offended and you don't have to be if you don't have to choose to be offended here and as just a general rule we should try hard not to offend people and try our not to be offended okay there that's it and I'm gonna demand some apology and and gonna stand on my high horse and play this play this aggrieved victim role which is which is the expected role to play these days we don't want to do that well good for you good for you for not doing refreshing yeah but the joke was kind of funny I mean I have to admit he said he's look you look like a bad guy in a porno film that was not the offensive part what was offensive part yeah that part was funny that would drew a lot of questions he called me a hit man in a porno right and so the obvious question is what kind of porno is right that's the very out that's the next thing because the girl has a hitman right right and like what's the role of that I mean there's just your mind goes it's all sorts of directions that that part wasn't the part was she lost his eye in the war or whatever that's what set her off that's what people know so yeah yeah and you know after having gone on the show and seeing how they do things and how carefully scripted it actually is it's it's it's it's unclear to me and it always will be and nobody will ever come out with the actual truth on this on on how that mistake got made I think I think probably Pete Dave if I'm just giving him total benefit of the doubt and also have after having met him and just you know having a general rule that we should try to give some people some space and assume that they're not the evil people that we might assume they are he probably just kind of looked at the line and didn't feel like finishing it and just set out whatever and it just in it in that but that caught and that and that created this you know what actually was a pretty offensive comment but you know did he mean it well we'll never really know now I'll back up and say the whole premise of that joke was ill-intentioned I mean they said as much right they said look at these gross people we don't like them and just to appear somewhat fair we'll make fun of one Democrat mm-hmm I mean they did they did say that so there you know there was this was the thrust of the entire skit was obviously not well-intentioned but I'm not sure he meant to be as deeply insulting is it yeah you gotta said the same thing that you're an American Hero but you look like a hit man in a porno film yeah I've been funny yeah and it would have been okay yeah it's the whatever it's that part but he's no Joe Rogan he was just trying to be funny man that's all it was you know people look so deeply into why comics do things but the majority the reason why they say offensive shit is because they think it's gonna work that's why ya they find a thing it's not like they harbor some deep resentment or anger towards any protected class or anything like that this is like what people who are non comics look into it guarantee 100% like this is gonna work that's all it is this is gonna get a laugh that's all it is alright percent and there's other things you talk about that are important to you that you're trying to figure out how to make funny but for the most part especially in something like Saturday Night Live well they're all kind of competing to be funny together I mean that's a very weird show is it's and it's it was cool being behind the scenes of watching how it all takes place like I would get married I think once if I do it'll be once if you do hang out wanted me one I got one in me I was proposed to a girl I can Oh three L's among the biggest mistakes almost almost look at me how do you get out of it it's funny she was cheating whoo that's nice it's a relief yeah it was back in the day when you share cell phone plants and she kept pushing us over our minutes for the month I'm like what the fuck are you talking to so the next month I requested the full itemized call all be like back in the day sprint would send you your entire call log for the month and I just went through it and then I could see the patterns and when I was sleep or when I was on stage you could just see that but it's all in front of you it's easy to just see that oh yeah when I go to work at 6:00 a.m. then you call this guy man yeah it was really easy to track now did you confront her yeah I was I was a little extra about it [Laughter] I called sprint and the the I basically turned my phone into her phone oh shit and then I started texting the dudes oh how many times to get and so I tell both guys to come over at the same time two thousand of those to get it which is so oh my god caddy at me and of course they show up she calls me curses me out and boom BAM relationship done oh so you told them to come over while she was at home correct but you weren't there correct oh I like it no that's devious but in like in the bigger scheme of things if Lars is it came over and hit her Oh or done anything stupid yeah I'm liable and yeah yeah no you know for someone at least will charge you were murder for somebody they shot there's there are laws not that that's not that's i deceived two minutes showing up to the fucking house you gotta remember my brain is going don't go back to jail ever again so okay in my brain I'm going there's something that could have that could have gone south somehow I don't think you would have got in trouble for that either way I wouldn't I see what you're saying by some jealous or whatever I do yeah and I have my little $700 engagement ring from Zales missus what I learned that if you return an engagement ring the salesperson loses the commission they take the commission back out of there next check cuz it is no mom he got upset he wasn't upset but he spent like an hour trying to talk me out of return yeah yeah just go think about it man go think about it did you tell him just walking around the mall she's fucking two other dude that's ultimately when I didn't once I told him that he processed it with no fucking I just took that all no push back yeah unless you want to fuck the cops have a quick good one on that level first time I went to Japan with house paint what happened we were on you know who's one of them tangs when we were touring from tour to torch where I would go home and literally take one set of clothes out of a bag throw it in another bag and leave so we got to Japan and on this particular trip I brought my girlfriend at the time and I think Danny did and lethal brought his own homee or whatever but I'll be brought a bunch of guests and everybody gets through customs and as I'm getting through customs the guy reaches into this one jacket I have and he pulls his hand out and there's this little nugget of bud and he's like what is that and I was like whoa can you speak English because he said it in Japanese so I said okay okay what is that I was like my brain just was like well fuck man just it looks like wheat I said it looks like we you know I just fucking owned it they went and got this little tester put some shit in sort of returned his blue it's weed I was like it's wait let's just fucking save a little trouble is we I mean while everybody else had gotten through they brought everybody else back in right fucking gave him the fucking finger like I have like my my lady everything at the time everybody got the strip-searched they never strip-searched me they searched everything I had all my bags everything right they tested one nugge weed whatever I end up after several hours the record label paid off whatever they had to pay off we got into the country and we were able to do our tour now the point of the story is everybody fucking hating my guts the whole fucking bunch when we get to the hotel I'm unpacking my bag trying to figure out how the whole fucking thing happened I'm looking at the jacket and I reach into the pocket that was there's nothing in there I was like fuck that's crazy I reach into the other pocket of the jacket I pulled out a fucking ounce of fucking weed they never looked in the other pocket of the jacket Oh fucking ounce of weed I should show you know what you were without even knowing you were doing it you were like sending a small meal to get busted so that the big ones can sneak around side I must have been rolling a joint somewhat at the last tour and I had an ugly over and just throwing it in the pocket not thinking about it on one side cartel does that but if they would have found that other one first I'd be in jail in motherfucking in Japan for a long time never but I got it I called the hole I called everybody that smoked in the crew down to the room after that and I was like yo check it out man I really didn't mean this to happen but I probably had more good ass fucking weed in Japan than anybody at the time you know it's incredible because all they had was hash and shit like that stop and think of that moment that moment if they didn't go in that one pocket and they went in the other pocket first and they found that giant bag of weed we wouldn't be having this conversation no we probably would no I don't think so that's a lot of weed who knows though in Japan it would have been there we took a lot of money to get me out of that regardless a lot instead of I think it cost him like a thousand bucks and they're like you know which was like ten thousand or something yen or a hundred salary or post put your lights on no this was in house paint okay this was like when the only story like it was like Paul McCartney is banned for life because he got caught with some wheat that's that was like that I don't know if it still exists but there was a point where he was banned for life because he got caught with weed over there [Applause]
