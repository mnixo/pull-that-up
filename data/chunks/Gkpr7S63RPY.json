the Joe Rogan experience what I'm hoping the book will do in the long run is that it will lead to more attention being focused on the Americas this is a very neglected area of the world as far as deep and ancient archaeology goes I'm it's the recent history of the Americas has been relatively well studied but the deep and ancient history has not been has not been well studied and I think America is going to contain revelations for us about our story and about our past and I'm serious when I when I suggest that America is the most plausible and the most likely home base for a lost civilization if you're going to propose a lost civilization you need there are certain preconditions you need a you can't have it on a small island there's got to be a large landmass with enormous resources and the ability for population to grow and for those resources to be to be mobilized and what I suddenly realize you asked earlier why I why I started to write this book at all is what the new evidence is pointing to is that the Americas have been wrongly neglected but here we have a giant Continental landmass with extraordinary resources that has just been ruled out of the story of human civilization but once we take account of the fact that there was a giant Cataclysm over North America twelve thousand eight hundred years ago once we start looking as I do in America before at the incredible deep in-depth similarities between for example the religious system of ancient Egypt and the religious system of the Mississippi Valley then you realize that you're into a into a global mystery here and that the answer to that mystery may not at all be in the old world and may very much be in the in the Americas see it's odd I mentioned Marvel earlier on it's kind of odd that we should find what is essentially the ancient Egyptian religion manifesting in the symbolism of Moundville the ascent to Orion that transit to the Milky Way the journey along the Milky Way very these are very specific and idiosyncratic ideas and what makes it doubly odd is Marvel isn't that old marvel as is about a thousand years old ancient Egypt had already been gone completely from the world for at least 600 years before Marvel was created the end of ancient Egypt there's there's Marvel and what we're looking at in the foreground is mound B and we're looking at mound a in the in the distance and a complete circle of mounds what what is odd about it is we find this system of ancient Egyptian ideas in Marvel 500 years after ancient Egypt has gone from the world that the Romans the the Romans were the end of ancient Egypt by 400 AD ancient Egypt is gone Marvel doesn't even exist them but 600 years later it is created and it manifests the entire set of ancient Egyptian ideas clearly it did not get that as a result of direct transmission from ancient Egypt unless they were time travelers the only way I think it could have got it is as a result of a legacy passed down from a much earlier civilization that had influenced and affected many different parts of the world and the characteristics of that civilization there's the shamanistic heart of it the use of altered states of consciousness the focus on those are amongst the reasons that I would suggest that America is the place that we should be looking and the big mysteries are in the areas that were so devastated at the end of the last ice age up in the north of North America the channeled scablands in particular and then the Mississippi Valley the whole story of the Mississippi Valley yes Moundville is a thousand years old but then you can go back to Poverty Point in Louisiana which is 2700 years old you can go to Watson break in Louisiana which is 5500 years old you can go to sites like Conley which are 8,000 years old the system keeps on going back and disappearing back into time and I think the most fruitful new work on exploring the origins of civilization is going to occur counter-intuitively in the Americas the very last place on earth that archeologists have ever thought to look then it's a funny thing because you know in think in 1987 you know I was 17 and I was gangbang and I got shot and you know that I got hit by a 22 and in it as hollow-points do it it it broke into three three pieces the hollow-point and one of them pump punctured my lung on my left side and you know they were telling me well you know do you smoke now I don't really smoke because I didn't smoke cigarettes I smoked weed but I wasn't gonna divulge that at the time I was 17 and you know and they said well you know well that's good cuz you'll never smoke again like you they punctured your lung and blah blah blah they thought I wasn't enough to work off one lung but in the three days you know they were able to get the blood out of the lung and I was able to get it back you know through the exercises they told me you know to get it back to its regular size and I've never had a problem since then knock on take the piece of metal out no I still got the three pieces that's like when I go do my physicals and they do that you know the MRI the MRIs in the x-rays and all that the doctors you know sometimes they forget because they see so many patients Mr Freeze um these appear to be bullet fragments look what is that well you just said a doctor bullet Frank you've seen him a dozen times you know and yeah I was very lucky I was very lucky because you know punctured my lung and then two of the pieces one was by the heart one was by my spine but I was at Martin Luther King Hospital in Linwood and we call that place killer King because you go in there for something small and end up dying or come out you know gimped out or something so you know I wasn't gonna allow them to try and get to those bullets or those fragments so open you up yeah no no no you know they didn't have a great success rate what kind of lung exercise they give you pumpkin ones but they give you this breathing apparatus that has like a ball in it right and it has two lines and you know that it's that the first line you're trying to they're telling you every day for five minutes to ten minutes to blow that you know not all in one shot like to keep practicing getting the ball up there and that will in help inflate the lung and get it back so I had to do that for probably like three weeks and you know in the puncture wound it healed itself pretty much and the pieces are still in your lung not in lucknow it's it went past the lung it did shot past the lung so you know it's uh I got a piece up here and one off to the side in the back well when it's really cold due to the the nerve damage I'll get like stinging like you know like when you're when your hand falls asleep the little needles though yeah I'll get that here and then and then back here where it entered they had that they had to cut right in between a rib here to stick the tube in to put the the hose into the lung to get the blood out of the lung damn yeah I was you know I was living crazy before I got into the music the music saved my life pretty much so after high school I started touring and that's when like I started getting my heaviest we were eating fast food every single day three times a day never drink water soda only smoking like a pack and a half of cigarettes a day and just on the road traveling and then by nineteen I got up to three hundred and five pounds nineteen years old and I remember one night laying down to go to bed and I just felt my heart pumping ridiculously and I was just like no way this is like I think I'm gonna die and like I woke up in a panic and weird thing is I got up and I went outside for maybe like ten minutes I smoked another cigarette and I was just like this is the problem like I'm coughing up stuff my heart is gonna give out and I'm only 19 years old you know so around that same week is when I discovered MMA with my brother just like watching Ultimate Fighter on TV and so uh I went on my last tour and I told the guys like hey I'm gonna go training MMA they're like oh you're gonna be a fighter like you think you know and I was just like I don't know what I'm gonna be but I'm gonna go train and get healthy and they're like okay cool like we'll see you in a couple months you know I hit like no one really believed that I was going to go actually trained in flight I told you I've always been this big quiet non-confrontational guy so yeah I went and took my first class Muay Thai and March 1st 2010 took my first Muay Thai class and then after like a month of doing Muay Thai I started to see progression I started to see like my face was slimming down all this stuff so it gave me motivation to keep going and then I remember going to a MMA event amateur and I saw really big heavyweight guys going at it so I was like I think I want to do it I want to give it a try and some of my coaches like okay if you lose a hundred pounds I'll like I'll find you a fight I was like a hundred pounds he's like yeah I'll find you a fight if you lose 100 pounds so I just kept training within 11 months lost a hundred pounds and then took my first fight and then there's been like every fight has been until now because like now I have like more of a drive and a passion for it but all the way up until then everything kind of happened by coincidence they're just like I just I didn't really want to fight but I had a lot of people like oh you're so good like keep doing it and I was the first time my life ever had people supporting me to like really do something that was big and I was a new guy and I was in shape and I can you know girls are noticing me now like all the way that my whole life changed within a year of training MMA like wow from going to this guy that nobody even paid attention to to just like oh hey how's it going or you know like oh you're so in shape and I was just like oh this is weird it's still weird it's only been nine years eight years you know so everything's still very new to me I've only my first day stepping on the mat was like you know nine years ago I got to beat him to be the best right so I need to work hard what's your take on him you can't take away what he does in the sport was his outside his personal life that's all he said she said I had my words after the the California stuff we went to 226 or whatever the fight was in Vegas and got moved here because his lifestyle and drug test a lot extra stuff however you wanna coded up his past you know I'm doing but I had my words there the fact he kept using God and Jesus and this is Miss and I'm a guy friend gotta read my Bible every morning I don't like the fact that you can that he would do that I'm liking something I wanted now but time my worries was the fact that he did that and then the same time on interviewing so I want to thank God and this is that kind of rubbed me wrong and then we flew on the plane together like I said I saw the way he was acting when he came on the plane like we're not doing this because of him like all at a time bother me and I was a pent up energy and I was something else going into that fight that was something on my shoulders could I posted something because when a UFC called me right before I got in flight is like I don't come one way to Vegas now I got my wife she's eight months pregnant like she's 30 weeks whatever she can't travel after this she's struggling we call them bags and y'all call me now say don't come this is this go back home we're gonna fly you out again like I'm not doing this again and then when I get to the wall we can get you here but we get you to Cali but we can't take your wife like what like well you we pay your ticket coach take like no okay all because John's almost this that's what got me mad that's what they were trying to save money I'm not flying people because it was thought we was literally walking down the runway to the plane when they called me Jesus can I turn around then we got like okay you come here but we can get you to Cal but we can't get saggy wife to kind of like my wife is 30 weeks pregnant she's here what she's coming like well we don't know what to do because you bought her ticket isn't it like what do you mean you don't know what to do get her nose ticking like I paved my family what about the people is on the way right now I got I gotta find the own way Network week fight the week of the fight the thing of the things that you have to think about you know fuckin with that that's the last thing I worry about and then I get there they said when you get make sure you got your work out if you don't have your workout schedule to pee I set already soon as you get there go do it I did mine like a month and a half ahead of time I'm all I'm like I said I'm puncture like I like having stuff doing yeah come get ready to go here to pee yeah I'm packing my bags and I get a call oh you can't come to the P I what John just came in and said he want to work out so we closing the gym down you know a lot y'all called me two months ago told me to set my schedule to come ahead of time I'm literally get ready to walk to my uber that's outside you say I can't come to like I'm sorry no we can do it John why can't you work out at the same place with John's work you know I'm not fighting the same thing with Connors it and I'm there in the summer kind of show up they're coming to there but you got Lee the throat really you all got condom on the sidewalk come on yeah they have security guard block the stairs off and everything I don't want no special treatment from her or from anybody I was a champ Shane yeah some people are different I guess I don't know if it's John or his camp dog doing that well UFC is doing criteria what but it rubbed me wrong that we aren't equal anymore [Applause]
