the girag and experience I know my memory is unreliable that's what the point I meant that's hilarious right I know everybody's memories unreliable people the morph their memories to make them more convenient for their knowledge of the past whether it's as them as a victim or as them as the winner or as them as the you know I didn't get my fair shake you know there was some behind-the-scenes shenanigans you know if you fucking idiot yeah reliable terrible but they're gonna use this machine yeah exactly they're not ready yet but one day they will one day we'll be able to access each other's brains just like you we send each other photos like if you were somewhere cool you sent me a photo I get it on my phone we're gonna you gonna be able to see my I'm gonna be able to you know put public so I want to make my on my eyesight public because I'm at Yellowstone you know and you go public with your vision you show everybody else and you can put it up on a database where people draw from that'll be like the first step people will share their experiences a few people sneaking porn or them jerking off before I impart experiences and then it'll just go to hey I'm Carl I'm always on this motherfuckers always on 24/7 you can watch some shit you can watch some jerk-off you can watching my sex and people just start they'd only live their life can't wait to get home with me Carl okay wait the girls out there just do an ecstasy in fact bitches driving the fastest animal if Carl's channel became public everybody would want to just be inside frogs I yeah you'd be the hottest-selling yeah and people would start complaining they would say look man nobody is living a real life anymore everybody's living other people's lives here's a game came up with a great concept yeah yeah because your life is boring as fuck but you could just be a Carm Karl is out there ball win an apology if Karl gets shot boom you used to go back to regular life that's the risk because then you'd have to find a new channel to subscribe to all right you know Carl's dead favorite TV shows that yeah exactly follow Eddie calls best friend that would be a new art form the new art form will be living your life in a spectacular manner to which some people would want to actually give up being a real person so they could be you and experience it directly and you will become a million people they see through you we're not exactly sure they're not the influence Carl we think that Carl is acting independently but it is possible if you think about it that all those Minds linked up together could form one unique and universal direction in which Carl might want to go well that's kind of like Instagram right now that's bananas but you're talking about I'm taking the next level son because if Carl realizes he gets a lot of views what he's doing he's gonna threesomes yeah then he's gonna do more threesome of course and if he gets a lot of views when he realizes that he's on a plane or a jacuzzi oh just up he's gonna like that look when a guy gets recognized for being a big fat guy and like gets famous for being a fat guy if you ever seen one of those guys talk to their agents and the agents will tell you I've seen it happen with my own eyes don't lose weight man if you lose weigh you're gonna lose rolls right why is that because because they've locked on to the idea of you as the fat guy right they just decide they decide let's just kill just keep this going don't fuck this up if you will in a literal way we train people yeah they just keep eating so they'll stay fat and funny if you told the fat guy like they do people love eating and if you just I just need you to just go fucking crazy if you just eat a lot bro all day people gonna just be you it's a lot of fat people there's skinny in real life but they could live like a fat guy through you and we can make money I'm Skechers it's in on this he wants this fashion show your eating show let me get some guy who just all day he does he drinks fucking vodka and he eats subs just meatball subs chicken parm all day so people subscribe just so they can experience what it's like to be fucked up drunk with a chicken's agility of chicken parmesan sambal is greasy meatballs and sausage and pepper shit they're not allowed to eat anymore and I will draw it life follows drunk life follow that and every now and then Carl go to a massage parlor and get jerked off and like yeah but you can't tell your wife about that like Carl is doing some crazy shit what's he doing here like three sandwiches yeah you beat Carl you don't even tell her about car getting jerked off he's eating a sub while he's getting jerked off the kids a maniac that's the next level shit man that's what's gonna happen people are saying the kids
