the girag and experience are you get 16 hours to read my audiobook I was like oh my god you know I cannot read out loud to save my life 16 hours how many hours is the actual audio book 3 whoa that's crazy I am the worst outloud reader and for like the first day today getting mad if you fuck it up yeah the guy who asked me like on the first first chapter he's like hey man do you need glasses just I was like no I just know I'm not that good but and I was like I'll do it drunk everyone wants to hear me do a drunk you can't fucking read drunk so then I described that - that day's all useless way to go back and redo it and then and then I was also like like I'd read a passage and then I go on and be like like and then I'd expound on what I just read and kind of a second I was like a podcast and that was fucking horrible that took like forever and so that finally the guys like just fucking read it so I just read it towards the end but it gets better I would I would think it would be better if you just read it and if you fucked up just comment on the fact that you fucked that word up and just keep going on like that way people would they get they get the book the whole book but they'd also get the experience of you reading the book like you separating yourself from the book while you read it oh yeah I mean oh they III don't know what it's gonna sound like but because I did acknowledge it I did when I did fuck out cuz I'm a comic so I would work the piece as I was like if I was on stage okay so did they keep that in or do they edit that stuff they kept I think they kept some of it in but they couldn't kept all of it in that's so weird though they decide what gets left in and what comes out this whole through this whole book writing process has been vulnerable as fuck because you you really let go of it because it's an entirely different industry yeah I didn't I passed I had a book deal I was writing the book and they were still giving these wacky fucking notes just advice on like how I should talk about things what I should describe how it I was like we're not this is not happening you know you're not involved in the creative process yeah no I gave them their money back I was like this is crazy like they wanted me to essentially write my act down on paper and sell it as a book they're like well George Carlin did it and Jerry Seinfeld did it I was like that's nice I don't give a f--- I'm not doing that oh yeah that's right different than I do stand up it's two different things like you can write when you're writing like just writing there's a way that you can express yourself that's unavailable if you're talking right you know it's it's y-you Dragon Dictate didn't work for me because you talked it into this Dragon Dictate and it will put it right into the computer yeah like print it but it didn't work for me because it sounded spoken like it sounded like and a couple like and one of the hard things for me was I did that same thing where they wanted all the stories I had told on stage or on podcast I was like I can't do that I can't just fill it up with that yeah they want the stuff that they think they're gonna sell it's not a artistic thing it's like guess what dummy the same person that told those funny stories I can tell you other funny stories like we're not running out of funny stories here it's really fascinating and like their stories I had to put in the book I had to put the machine in I can't not write that in there and there's a lot of there's a click the Will Smith story I had to put it in then I wanted to do the several poles one I wanted to do one where I met Ralph Sampson and when I was a kid I was Ralph Sampson um he was a basketball player and I was I went to school it I went to I was like in eighth grade I decided I really want to be a basketball player and so I went to Villanova basketball camp and Ralph Sampson came to speak and like the first night I got a concussion and the two best basketball players got pulled out for drinking so the next day I had to sit out with to that spot ball players and everyone thought we drank together so now all of a sudden I'm 15 14 and everyone thinks I'm cool I'm parting with the 18 year olds so Ralph Sampson comes I thought this defined me Ralph Sampson comes up to give a speech he's like I'm here to talk to you about two things there's 5,000 kids on the gym floor he said we're talking about basketball and we're talking about discipline first let's talk about discipline who in here parties and I was on the impression we were all gonna put our hands up but I was the only fucking person I just went chunk and he was like oh one person 5,000 kids no one raised her fucking hand he's like how do you party I was fucking 13 I know how to I didn't I've never partied in my life so all I said was Hardy and he fucking lost it and 5,000 kids are slapping the gym floor like oh shit we're gonna make an example out of you party animal he's lost the room so he brings me up front to the in front of all the kids and he makes me stand up and he puts a basketball behind my legs like this and then one on my arms like this and he's like we party hearty we're gonna party hearty today so I'm standing like this for his whole fucking hour speech with a basketball here and there and he's like he keeps coming back to me and by the way I'm so in my head that I have social anxiety disorder but I'm in front of everyone and I'm like being made fun I'm being mocked that I wasn't listening to his questions to me is like you think you'll ever party again I just said yeah and the fucking place went bananas they're like oh and he's like how do you party Harty I was like and I didn't know the answer I just was like with two hands fucking people are losing you think you do marijuana and now I'm killing I'm like I'll get two in college and these kids I left that gym and everyone wanted to talk to me everyone's like party animal what are you doing and that you're still holding the basketball between your legs yeah the whole fucking time so why you're cracking jokes while I'm cracking jokes come on did you hold the basketball an hour that's a long time my cousin Ava almost brought him here today I should have I didn't even think about it my cousin Abe was there at the camp he because he's from Philly I didn't know anyone because names like I think I didn't know you party like oh I don't I don't I just thought we don't put our fucking hands ha ha he's like you know why would you put your hands up if you don't party I was like I wanted to be cool ah so yeah so like so now and then everyone would come up and they'd be like party animal you partying Hardy tonight I'd be like yeah but then I became cool at that camp and then I have friends and so I wrote that story's a little longer and I gave it to them I go this is the best story this defines me I don't like uh I'm not really that's hilarious so it's all partying stories but it's like that's a hilarious story no thanks that's so nutty that this could have possibly sent you on a path when you were that young yeah you know 13 years old I just I and it's all just wanting to be accepted did you ever have one of those moments where you'd go somewhere and you didn't know anybody sure you felt like everyone fucking grew up together yeah that's a weird feeling I felt like that a lot as a kid yeah but I thought that that defined me cuz then I became the part I became the party animal that kind of lived up to whatever I by the way I went to high school the very next year didn't know anyone so I'm sure that kind of I was like well it worked in Villanova so yeah there's definitely different personality that develops when kids have to move to write if they move from one spot to another spot they moved more than once that yeah developed it's like it's just weird newcomer personality you know in every romantic kids movie the rebel that moved into town the new kid that you don't know if anything he smokes cigarettes and fucking Twilight style movie or even like Karate Kid didn't he like move into some new town dude cry kid I fucking the day Karate Kid came out was my first day at tennis camp and so so I go I gotta fucking can't believe I didn't write about this this fuck I didn't mean know anyone I know anyone so then the these all the libary on the camp I started meeting the cool kids and they're like hey man what are you doing today I was like nothing and they like you wanna go see Karate Kid and I didn't know anything about it I was like oh yeah I'll be cool so like cool meet us at Mission Bell that's where this place was my mom's late picking me up we're late doing everything she drops me off to the movie late and I go in and the movies already started I can't find any of the kids but I already bought the ticket and I already have popcorn in a drink and I'm like fuck so I just go down and I sit down I've never seen a movie by myself at that time and I just sit down and I keep looking for him but I can't fucking find him but then the movie starts and it's a great fucking movie and it's a movie about a loner kid like myself that doesn't know anyone and he's trying to break into the new group just like I was doing a tennis camp and I really get involved in it I get so involved in the movie that when he does the fucking crane kick and kicks the guy I start bawling fucking crying thinking I'm Daniel son I'm Dan in my head I'm like I feel like Daniel son the house lights come up and the fucking kids that were had wanted me to meet were sitting directly like two rows in front of me and I heard you weeping they heard me crying and I'm sorry weeping like lobbing like a fucking ten-year-old cry like if you were ten how'd that work out uh they turned around and they saw me crying and they were about to make fun of me and they're like oh you got us you got we thought you were crying you fucking with us you were sitting on us the whole time and I was like yeah yeah that's it that's it I fucking walked out that movie I still of this day so you you had a fake that you weren't quite a fake that I wasn't crying and then we all hung out there like you just do that make yourself cry I was like
