hello freak bitches good deal we a lot of shit happen on that fuckin that last wild boys trip man there is that we always we had this practice of like good for the sensors you know it's called standards and practices they'll be like you know they'll give back no it's like you can't you know show this and so we would film what we call red herrings like just blatantly ridiculous you're never like never gonna be allowed on TV but then we'll be like okay well we'll cut this out and so then we'll be able to keep some other shit right so we would always go out of our way to film this fucked up stuff and in Russia we me and one of the guys from that from the crew trip would like put on these animal suits uh what was it at the time it wasn't panda bears polar bears with a big fuckin like mascot head and we fuckin hired two hookers and had full-on fucking hookers came in like full porno we sold four full fucking porno I would included we included that in the episode you know and the note came back from standards and fractions I can't really please like a that you have to take out the you know the cocksuckers that we had the polar bear getting his dick sucked like that the whole thing and yeah and there were there was a little bit of fucking hooker action in that one you know and I'm not really that stoked about it but um there was a we went to went to like a whorehouse brought this um hook her back to the hotel right is it like a whole thing and then in in the and and I don't think I ever could even have sex with it with a hooker without like snuggling after I want to like snog snuggle and sending it out oh my god never stay with me I want to like you know cuddle and stuff and in the morning this this hooker um she tells me like how much how much I over right and I'm like that's fucking outrageous there's no fucking away I was like sighs like basically I don't care if you're fuckin pimp wants to kick my ass and fuckin kill me I'm not paying that fuck but how much is why I forget it was so long ago but uh but yeah I was outraged I was associated before him it just it just wasn't in that case exactly I remember clearly I was like you want that much and I said I said I'll give you this much and that's how much you'd get wear it and we came out right like uh you know I got a go film and walking through the lobby Knoxville's down there having breakfast this hooker comes walking by Knoxville and she says that's not Stevo that's cheap oh yeah when you're faced with a bunch of different alternative theories that are coming in and it's not they take physics I mean every physicist like Jesus had Lawrence Krauss he gets these letters daily of people saying I think I figured out why Einstein was wrong and he can't address them all and and they're smart people they're thoughtful people they really believe it what do you do with that that's my point I feel that's not my problem and if there are alternatives the other alternative theories that's not my problem either it's the problem for the mainstream be sorted out and figured we have a attention to English all right well I'm suspicious of this the whole idea of the mainstream because even looking in the mainstream you find so many divergent points in you that I you know I think that's basically a fiction that there is this mainstream that has arrived at this consensus and that there are no alternative ulterior motives there and that there are no dogmas that are being perpetuated there you know I mean I look at the lot of the geological stuff and realize that there are many different points of view when we get talked about the these floods at the end of the last ice age there are many divergent points of view there is what could be considered the mainstream yet even that has multiple interpretations and the same with this the Komet idea you know I mean I don't know what constitutes the mainstream there because there have been a group that has opposed it at every turn but at the same time the group that accepts the comet hypothesis has continued to grow in fact there's even a number of individuals involved that set out specifically to disprove it or discredit it who are now basically on board and it has grown from being a small handful of scientists to they're now 63 scientists from 55 different institutions that are on board with the idea that something remarkable happened at the end of the last ice age it was probably exogenic meaning something from outside something from space there's no consensus as to exactly what that was which would be normal because if these discoveries are in their infancy at this point but there's been an attempt to discredit the idea simply because that as the evidence has come in over the last decade it has evolved in new mysteries have been opened up as the evidence comes in and the claim is being made well there's no consistent interpretation of this evidence and therefore we've debunked it yeah that's a really important lesson for Parenthood like you can't just tell kids what to do you know like you just do it because I told you to do it they're like fuck you I'm gonna be a hooker protection yeah and that applies not only to kids think you're on a percent applies to kids but it applies to adults as well and that is people need to understand why they're doing what they're doing it and you know if I want you to go take down some building and capture some bad guy I don't go hey hey Joe I want you to take down this building once you pack capsules bad guys these the guys I want you to take with you here's the route I want you to take in here's the methodology I want you to use for the clearance because then when I send you to go do that mission it's not your mission it's my mission I came up with a plan you didn't so you might be you might have thought there was a better way to do it or you might had a different idea of how to get it done and now when you go out there and you meet some kind of resistance whether it's an obstacle you didn't expect or whether it's some scenario that you didn't foresee instead of you trying to overcome it you just blame me you just let that jock who came up with a stupid plan and here we are it's failing forget it we're going back we're not going to carry out the mission whereas if I said hey Joe here's what I want you to do go figure out the best way to do it and now you come up with a plan and now you make up all the methodology of how you're going to get it done and you decide who you're going to take with you now it's your plan you own that plan and when you go out in the field and you meet a little resistance guess what you do you say I'm gonna find a way around it I'm going to overcome this I'm going to overcome that obstacle and make it happen and that's another piece of leadership and it's the exact same thing with kids if you tell your kid you know you will get good grades in school that means nothing to them but if you explain to them hey I would love for you to get good grades and here's why it's going to opportunities for you in the future it's going to allow you to be able to outsmart people because you have more knowledge than them and then you're going to be able to end up making more money which is actually give you more freedom in the long run instead of doing a job that you don't want to do you explain all those things to a kid it's going to be a lot more successful than just do what I told you get good grades because I said so now when you do these conferences were when you you speak at businesses and they bring you in to sort of have these leadership media what would you call them yeah their leadership seminars seminars yeah now when you have these seminars are these some of the principles that you discuss when you talk about absolutely yeah absolutely because that's another another big piece of this is that all this ideas about interacting with human beings they just don't change like there's little variance but whether you're dealing with kids or whether you're dealing with adults and whether you're dealing with business people whether you're dealing with soldiers on the battlefield the leadership principles they don't change and therefore you can whether you're trying to get people to go out and capture and kill a bad guy or whether you're trying to get them to build some product and sell it the principles of leadership don't change you're still trying to get a bunch of totally independent people right and that's one of the myths we have to overcome a lot because everyone thinks oh in the military ones just like a robot and that's just not true everybody in the military is free Center people they're people they're free thinking people they're going to come up with our own ideas they're going out with their own agendas and they're going to think of ways to do things that they think are better than yours so you can have all these independent free thinkers and you've got to get them on board with the same plan to you to go out and execute and so it doesn't matter if you're on the battlefield on business that's what that's what you're trying to get done and the leadership principles don't change [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
