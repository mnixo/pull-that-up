I was listening to some old-timey music the other day and it was making me think of how depressing it would be if that was the only music that you could hear the David Lynch movie the David Lynch in his movies he always has those songs like there's a woman dead in a hotel and days were that tuba with a needle at the bottom of my grandfather had one of those in my home in Pelham and his pollen pail in New York they had an old cronograph Vanessa's called write a cronograph and it would play you know classical my grandparents never listened to they were Sicilian they never listened to music did your parents or your grandparents have the TV and a cabinet uh-huh and they certainly did and then if the TV would die a lot of times folks would put the new TV on top of the cabinet they would keep the Technic cabinet with the blown out TV yeah yeah well I had a family that never threw anything away no mine I never ever I'm talking about Road cones you go to my attic you find crazy shit but they also had a chronograph well watch oh right yeah yes I'm a chronology goddammit yeah those things are crazy like that was how they used to listen to music a tuba attached to a needle interact to sound like dog shit my dad used to have a dust cover for his turntable and he would yeah there's a ritual too how you clean your LP oh there's a ritual yeah you got to dust it off you have a special cloth and all that thing yep that's what peek at that fucker look at that that's nuts people at home it looks like it doesn't really traffic cone right it does right like a big old brass traffic on little needles I read I read the Ted Williams oh the great this might have been a myth but the great baseball player Ted Williams he could hit a fastball hit any kind of ball and he apparently could read the label of a record as it was going around his eyes could slow shit holy shit yeah I wonder if that's true I wonder well yeah you know it's these things she's here right yeah like Joe Frazier was in a hotel room there were four flies in the room there the way you started with the Flies he like caught them all and goes here you fly Bruce Lee story once it was one of those yeah heard guilty Bruce Lee was in a fight with thirty men and he stood in the center Volvo like wait wait wait wait where'd you hear this I never I heard he never wasn't a ring party who's never he never sparred once yeah I don't think Bruce I'll rephrase it here did he ever fight competitor was rumored no he did one thing once where he sparred at like this karate festival one sparring session cool all right well good luck that you can see good luck against to be able to meet a label on a No good luck to everybody against a guy like Darren tell yeah good luck I mean yeah Vinny for Vinny Sherman who is he does colour commentary for a lot of big Muay Thai events yeah and super knowledgeable like as a striker he's also a hypnotist I got hypnotized by them a couple times I kept my pants on yeah yeah he hypnotized me fascinating hypnotism is feats you get hypnotized cuz you're a hundred percent really yeah I gave into it yeah I just let it let let yourself achieve the state but you realize what it is it's like oh you've got this idea where like someone can like turn you into Manchurian Candidate if they hypnotize you and you wouldn't have control your brain anymore yeah no no no you're relaxing yeah you're relaxing and you're open to suggestion in an interesting state of mind that you can achieve right see like I I think just think there's a larger spectrum of the way the mind works then we give it credit for and I think what I've been thinking about this a lot that's one of the things that happens with stand-up I think if you're on stage and you're killing and stand-up if I'm in the audience it's like you've got me hypnotized I'm locked up into your line of thinking and like your act is very silly so like when I'm watching you like I start thinking in silly ways and then you'll keep getting sillier and sillier and then like I'm locked into your head it's like before it's a form of hypnosis 100% and I think that's so like being in a good place Thank You young Jaime so is being a good place mentally so is being in a bad place I think there's like there's a large spectrum in the mind of all these different chairs where you going fucker you can't they're kind of wonders Stanley was fantastically misused it's alright it's a solid it's a good juice guys gentlemen I like them who that it's a good juice it's a good juice those guys are gross hey you guys who say it's a good juice you talking about wine it's a sexy juice top policy it's a sexy just kind of feels like that talk to you it's like taking a big bite out of what hey it's like having a wet dog it's a great juice shake itself that you have have you ever gone to like a real wine tasting with a bunch of nerds sure have nerves nerves am I ever gonna wine test tasting were you graded a wine and y'all stood up and said it has woody after tones and there's a I was invited by a guy a long time ago 20 years ago and he said I'm gonna invite you to a wine tasting where we all bring our own wines he said he's a good guy goes I said well what do I bring he said I don't want to insult you but you can't afford the kind of wines that were great so I'm gonna bring you a bottle from my cellar so it doesn't make you look that's how that's how big these wines were and I was there with the guy from like Zaki's or whatever the different Sotheby's they did the guys that set the standard and write the thing and I was watching him tasted and write down notes it was really wild nutmeg God leather mushrooms Earth you know all kinds of weird tasting notes it's Joseph Jack my buddy Matt is a huge wine head like he's got his own cellar in his house it's all temperature controlled and if I'm at a restaurant I'll call Matt mm-hmm powerful Matt Lichtenberg I'll call him up you know hey okay let me tell you what I got yeah tell me what to get yeah and he'll just like oh the reason why this is this one sucks and stay away from this one and this is this is what you want that's your groove right there grab that one okay he's always right yeah LeBron's been a known as a new wine guy is a ridiculously good one I've had that and I said Ron is a wine head powerful yeah he has some quite a few bottles of Opus one apparently which is Opus one is not that's that's the guy is way better than Opus one look at what he wrote here last night was mad real fresh out of advil Jesus grabbed the wheel sheesh Magican fucked up with LeBron James I brought that wine - you're the one with the yellow I think you did I think you did yeah looks very familiar yeah that's some good-ass fucking wine shot Psalm won't push a good-ass wine mr. super-athlete there you go that's a real one wash it there's some real super athletes we got listen he's an amateur fuck what kind of steroids you take like there's there's human beings that have just the most unfathomable physical advantages yeah it's ridiculous like LeBron James would have like an unfathomable physical advantage over someone who would have an unfathomable physical advantage over you yeah well I did a thing I asked the guy who follows this Jimmy Burke about LeBron James I called him up and I just I left I left him one message I go I said Jim and I want you to be honest and don't insult me at what age did LeBron James surpass me as an athlete and be careful with your fucking answer because I'm a proud man man and I'll kick your fucking ass I hung up the phone I got a very thoughtful very thoughtful this station and I just got this twelve years old and there's no question about that twelve by the time he's 14 and six 4235 best player in the country you were not that you're not even close to that he was 14 he was six four yeah I think he's six for living yeah he's a freak he's six nine 265 and I sat next to Carlos Boozer who played with him and they're the same size and he goes he's just a step faster than everybody as well and just ridiculously strong well see a guy like that if he was fighting everybody would be fuck of course they were they're lucky they are goddamn lucky there's that much money in basket but right he's incredible and the people go well you know one man some things that make great-looking a basketball player wouldn't necessarily make you a great fighter oh listen listen to me save it that guy's gonna beat your fucking ass yeah this he's a winner there yes there's just a certain level of winners there like he'd do whatever the fuck you want everyone bow Jackson could have done whatever I worked with bo Jackson for a week did you yes I did and he was and I said Oh what are you what are you waves in a white t-shirt and I was looking at the thickness of his fingers you know me I obsess because I'm basically a gay man so I was I was looking at his hands I grabbed his hands it was just this giant me and I said what do you weigh he goes um um he said I marinara he was so weird he's so specific he said I'm 6 1 and a half 240 pounds 245 pounds and he was the same size when he played and he never has lifted weights in his life ever and he didn't lift weights when he played he would just as in his words I just strap it on and I'd hear the other team go imposing the game bows in the game but you have to also understand it Bo Jackson not only did whatever you wanted to you on a football field faster than everybody at 2:45 and stronger he was also a was it was he not an MVP in baseball thoroughly that's on her Deion Sanders played both ways but there's no one like bo Jackson free that's crazy throwing B B's throwing fuckin ropes from centerfield I mean he'd a whole different a whole different kind of one tackle one hip injury that's ranged all that shit well it was his hip started to die of some kind of 'no krytus in this pond or something was from getting hit there was a very famous hit that he got tackled you could see like the impact of the house on his hips when he goes down at least have room am i remember in that way yeah yeah you see the injury it's just a ridiculous happen still came back and was smashing home runs with a fake hip came back and played baseball just couldn't really run anymore you know just a different kind just a different kind I wonder if they could fix that hip now you know think about what his hip was then what his hip is now well I think you have to generate a tissue so I don't know if we're there yet but we're getting close what I mean is like the artificial hips I wonder if those are better now I don't know do you read a book called sapiens I sent you probably not but you Val Harare everybody should read it it's an amazing book and and it's a brief history of mankind but it brings us to present day and he also wrote another book called homo Deus I think once you send this to me I sent you a screenshot said you got this book okay but he talks about where we're headed technologically he's really done the research I mean really looking honestly at what medical research what to expect in the next thirty years what did you say well I mean you know not only are we gonna live much longer or if you have the money but the real question hands the book with in a way is we have to decide as human beings for the first time in our history we can control our own evolution so we have to ask ourselves what we want to become that's a really big responsibility what do you want to become what do we want to become because that question can be answered we will have the technology to answer that question and and it can get silly where you can say we could splice our genes with a lion or with a gorilla but but more importantly we'll be able to splice our genes with synthetic biology and become what would but it's a very heavy question what do you if so if you want to live forever if you become what he called I think was a moral or it's different work for we're gonna get mad at you for fucking 50-year olds like they don't know anything yet god how could you fuck a 50 year old you'd be like a thousand years old I know you'll be so smart and so so wise people you know how gross you are you're fucking someone is fifty years old like as a human we figured look we only think of ourselves as like oh you should have your shit together by 50 because we know we only live to be a hundred but the reality is most people don't get their shit together period yeah like that it's a race that nobody's winning yes but we all know that if we just if we had an infinite amount of time we would keep getting better at getting our shit together you would not be who you were yesterday and hopefully you'd be much better than you were a year ago but I think about something different like that's the case though but all if you get to nine hundred years old are you still allowed to bang fifty year olds like she's a fucking kid bro I mean when is it okay I mean if she's super hot vampires vampires fuck like thirty year olds but we're talking about people bro while talking about like apparently not if they figure out medical science and this is not outside the realm of possibility they can regenerate tissue and you stem cells to rejuvenate your body you live nine hundred fucking years old are you allowed to bang fifty year olds or as you are you gross well it takes actually I think the answer is it takes time and it and it flips it on its head I mean the time longer has a consequence because there's not you have very you don't really have limitations what the biggest thing about human beings right is that we have limitation we know we're going to die that's the fundamental difference between sort of the idea of a robot being just like a human that we are defined by our limitations right but you know why they bring the draft around and try to get young people to get draft I didn't want to go answer 40 year olds and 50 year olds you think this won't work like I wonder if it gets to a certain age I wonder if you live to a certain age and like cults just don't work anymore I wonder if it only works up until you like 50 or 60 or 70 but if people live forever it would be just like telling Santa Claus to like a little kid maybe tell Santa Claus to your five-year-old like woah Santa Claus is real yeah you tell Santa Claus to a 15 year old they're like what the fuck are you talking about the same kid would be like dad you're retarded like stop this it depends on how how whether you or not you've broaden your understanding there but if you're a cult leader and you 900 years old and you just bang all these 50 year old ladies you're an asshole they're like a little kid still maybe maybe well 50 year olds are not gonna look like 50 rows I got really hot but my point is like there's still good to me naive yeah they still put fucked in holy water on themselves and still do you know there's this kid awake weird shit but they'll be attracted to that 900 euros love wisdom plus you'd be like a sorcerer yeah what kind of power you to have you're nine years old as you get older the mystery of life breaks down you know you're younger and you see somebody who's really good at something like god they're a genius and then you kind of get you start you know you get to a certain age where you get good at something or you just start to do it enough and you go there's a certain formula to success like sometimes like to be really good at something there's a there's a there's a there's a mindset for competition but to be really good at something also just requires a shitload of repetition and good tutelage there's a lot of coaching a lot of focus and one of the things that you recognize in people when you you see another enough people that are like really truly awesome at something you see enough of them you start to recognize this like thing like I especially concede in musicians be I have zero Talent because I have zero musical talent zero have you ever tried to actually hold the tune you're trying to just try this try to sing all serious don't laugh try to sing just look at me it's embarrassing but do it try to sing I want to sing silent night holy night try to hit it then do it right and then I'm gonna try it it's so hard I'm asking two verses but isn't it funny that likes making noises with your mouth it's vulnerable ah holy nah it's not bad oh there's calm that was freaking can you get up our [Music] virgin mother and child what's the rest I don't know something in heavenly isn't Holy Infant so tender and mild Holt and [Applause] dish bag singer voice the whispery I know you did but you this but you know what you had you were on tuned oh I think you were he was tuned wasn't he's Jamie they're going here don't you tell anybody who talks to you like that listen to me ladies that's my joke about that's my joke where I talk about that oh you can say nice dress just don't whisper it that's right it's creepy I was like there's certain things you can't whisper in life like you guys your daughter is so cute if you're like your daughter is so cute it's creepy the creepy voice is recognized but you know you know what it's a fucking confusing ass voice is the scary voice mmm you know the scary voice like next on Twilight Zone yeah like anybody talked like any scary monster like and then they went down the dark dark road yeah like those people who have that kind of a scary voice this summer and here's another one it doesn't work he'll just get about hottest girls all the hottest dancing like that kind of like hot and sexy those old commercials remember and but just like a weird rhythm to the way they're talking it's like they're establishing very clear parameters for vocabulary no the hottest girls there's not gonna be some soliloquies on your interpretation of consciousness as you know it versus this objective view of the universe no now it's all the hot girls oh the hot it's dancing it's like you have these like really short sentences well so we're in tune we're in tune with those rights those girls are saying look to cut the bullshit we're down to fuck we got fake tits and we're drunk that's what they're saying with that voice like that's what that voice is did you did you ever hear the experiment they did where they played doctors but so they took they took different doctors and and some had been sued a lot and then they just took the doctors at bedside they recorded them speaking and they took out the words so you could only hear the tone of their voice and people said I don't like that guy and they didn't know what they're saying they said I don't like that guy and without almost like most of them chose the doctors that had been sued and it turned out that they had a dominant tone so that their tone and the sound of their voice was what people objected to and because their bedside manner was Malcolm Gladwell's book their bedside manner was was dominant they weren't they weren't sort of understanding and listening they were rather telling the patient something those were the doctors regardless of their their errors or what they did that had nothing to do with their degrees didn't even have to do with that what they did those were the ones that got sued that's from blink right yes at least blinks are great book yeah it is it's great and it's a great audio book - I got that one on audiobook I listened to it on audio whose variant on audio I listened to sapiens on audio it's very like Drive yeah it's very good way to you know I like podcasts but I like to mix it up it's like I don't want to only watch documentaries I like watching fiction - I woke watching like I like to mix things up with with I would I take in what I view but I think that like audiobooks in particular it's a great way to utilize like wasted time yeah a hundred percent a hundred percent instead of listening music I always listen to that's no whole course on Nietzsche how crazy was that story in blink about the art work where they found this God statue and this art expert looked at it for a second and went it's fake how much do you know what came to his mind back remember the word kit that came to us he knew it was fake because new nope close when so so whose it was supposed to be up statute was buried for three thousand years of kudos like a fully-formed ocurro's his young boy in greek so it's a fully formed like statute which is near thessaloniki or something and they tested the rock the the marble came from a query near there they even tested the mold which actually turned out to be something they put on potatoes but they but the mold seemed legit and all that stuff and but he the minute he saw it he said can you get your money back yes if they can even know why but the first word that came to mind was fresh fresh kind of crazy right yeah you're supposed to hear but didn't it crazy and he was right yeah they could just see like for you and I would be like wow crazy statue we wouldn't have but there's certain things I'm sure you could see you know like there's certain things like here's one that I see all the time I see when people are about to spin from all my years of Taekwondo always like a little simple dip the people go I was would you call that a lot all the time cuz you see once you learn it when you're a little kid cuz you've been kicked in the head a few times yeah like it becomes a part of your life how does that kick me see this little thing all he's kind of spin he's trying to been you know and you see it whereas a regular person oh fuck are you saying that well I've seen it because people have hit me yes don't get hit by that yeah how can you see that moot like oh yeah well one of the wealthiest guys my friend who made a billion dollars more his buddy is worth some crazy amount of money and so what's your secret and he said mirrors and windows so what'd he mean he said I can tell if somebody's gonna pay me back I can tell if somebody's a good investment or not and he said well holla niggas you either got windows you got mirrors for eyes and if you got mirrors for eyes you can go fuck yourself you got windows I'm gonna lend you money and that's an instinct he would just pick up on he got a lot sincerity and he could pick up on whether or not you were a phony you know that's a real problem with communicating with people in nonverbal ways and in non person non face-to-face ways yeah it's a real problem with like texting and stuff like that I'm not looking into the person like I think it changes the way we talk to each other it changes interactions and I think most of the problem that people have most of the time with each other is not talking like today especially not talking enough looking at each other in the eyes that's exactly the figuring out like if maybe someone's someone's right maybe you're wrong about something you got to talk to them and you go okay well what did you think I was supposed to do and I did that okay okay what time were you supposed to be there what time did we say I thought we said this and you can try to figure it out while you're looking at each other you know when someone could say look man I was really bummed out you know it was this really important thing you were supposed to pick me up and then you could work it out you had look at each other and work that but when you go through these series of text messages I've had text message discussions of people like hey man I can't do this like let's just talk can we just talk cuz this is crazy because I don't know what your face is making when you're making this statement you're saying something and it's not entirely accurate and I'm trying to figure out what the fuck your face looks like were you laughing is this lol right we look at each other because I bet we could work this shit out you know that's that is the problem with reading sometimes about something and thinking you're getting the whole picture what I like about Thaddeus Russell is that he his book a renegade history the United States I think is called he actually takes a look at things that I've never heard I was a history major and historians tend to be pretty conservative stodgy people right they're not you know your average college professor is a pretty conservative guy even though he might be very left-wing therefore they're conservative people they're they're not the madding I'm not gonna find him at an orgy or you know usually are various things and especially with historians and when they write history they always write it from this really stodgy kind of you hear about the events you actually don't hear about what it was like in the brothels you don't hear about what it smelled like in the bars you don't hear about the noise you don't hear about things that actually have an effect on people who were the criminals how safe for the streets where were the prostitutes who was actually getting laid was there a lot of black and white sex that went on in during the Revolutionary War which apparently there was what about dancing dirty white ladies who got some dark dick I only I can only hope I can it's the ultimate fuck you to your dad yes yes how many chicks just fucking couldn't wait I know as soon as it was veil was lifted yeah as they say my dad is fighting to keep you a slave sounds like a hot dirty white girl with freckles there's a lot of they would do is the Irish who come in they were indentured servants then you had this black slaves and they danced they would go that there'd be like these they speakeasies and everybody would mingle it'd be late at night black but beautiful black women and you know the black and the white dudes be like to these girls are hot you know and there was mixing and everything else and there was all kinds of shit like that remember slavery was being talked about as I'm great moral evil really back when this country was founded what really kind of one of the things they say that kept slavery going another hundred years was the cotton gin was the fact that Eli wouldn't he invented a machine that made it fucking really really easy to separate the seed from the cotton and as a result this guy comes up with a great invention and his route they were like whoa we got all this free labor down here I'm not freeing slaves this shit is white gold I can send it oh I can send it to Europe and there's an insatiable demand for my cotton fuck that I'm not gonna have my whole economies built on the fact that I got all this free labor and I'm making a fortune so you know a lot of historians kind of talk about how Eli Whitney invented a machine that was really efficient but might have been responsible for keeping an entire group of people in slavery for that is so crazy to think about like where he came up with a cotton gin most of the clothes that were made out of hemp mm-hmm using hemp fiber for everything and apparently it's way better than cotton it's just longer for sure that's stronger Todd McCormick do you member my friend Todd mcCormick he had this stalk of hemp in his house and it was like from a hemp tree and it's like it's from another planet it doesn't seem like it's a real thing so so what really hard but it's really light like it's light like like balsa wood but it's hard like oak like it's weird that's cool and he was explaining to me and he knows way more about weed than I do but it was like dude it's an alien planet ever it's an air in the alien plant rather it's very hard a weed it's an alien plant it is like no other plant it has all the essential no acids you you get essential oils from it it has protein in a very high protein content like you can eat hemp seeds are great for you huh they're really healthy and you can make clothing out of it you can make fuel out of it hemp fuel Henry Ford made the first fenders on the first Model T out of hand fibers really there's an there's a video of him hitting them with a hammer and the hammer bounces off these hemp fenders they're far more durable than steel that's crazy it's insane fiber man it doesn't make any sense literally is like no other fiber on the planet it's a really complex fiber and it's illegal you just can't grow the female plant and the government is doing their best to make CBDs being regulated by the FDA they're all trying to stop CB there's people that are trying to stop CBD it doesn't even have a psychoactive effect on you well the guy who invented that yeah I don't know the dark web but the Silk Road guy ohlbrecht yeah I got a point this out this is really important though before I forget the CBD oil folks there's a I'm reading a lot of reports online of people testing CBD and a test positive for THC Greg Fitzsimmons talked about this he said that he tried CBD oil and he got him high I don't know what he used which company he used but the the studies that I've read where people have actually got them tested there's me there's THC in some of them so you got to be careful especially if you have some ups job or somewhere there yeah I don't know if you ps2 math let it come potentially where they test your piss if you if you take CBD oil for pain and inflammation you got to really make sure you trust the sources because I guess apparently can it can F THC in it we need didn't you point that out I don't know if I did but I've seen that same thing yeah that's like for two weeks I think you're the one who told me about it first yeah and it's not just because we were talking about Greg like Greg gets high off CBD oil micros like maybe it's just like a super lightweight but I don't think so maybe I think there's some we did some of them Greg might just be super sensitive loves the weed yeah I think if you just give him a regular CBD oil Betty before it might not even just be the CBD oil I've noticed some like head shops and states that it's not recreationally available they're selling it in the same like dabs and concentrates and you smoke the CBD the same way you would smoke that heavy concentrated shit whoa and that crazy like dab rig with a hot torch so you smoke CBD oil that doesn't too high in the dab rig yeah and that I don't know you ought to sleep better it didn't work didn't I'll tell you what works smoking weed you have a hard time sleeping yeah what uh I don't anymore so much but you know I always worry mmm yeah yeah I worry that I it's interesting sometimes I just I feel guilty about being so lucky I get into my really soft bed and I do what I love and I'm like when is the other foot gonna drop here if you really stop and think about how lucky you are in comparison to the vast majority of human disease it's ridiculous what you know what I mean you know it's I have zero tolerance for people that talk about how hard things are today like they're complicated today yeah they're not hard it's complicated you ain't more complicated of course there are hard moments nice no one's denying your pain in your hard moment if you get a cut on your hand you're not gonna get gangrene yeah you don't worry about the pox yeah there's so much more today it's this is a fucking crazy time and there's it's still the thing about this time is the good thing about it is yeah we're overpopulated yeah we're crazy yeah the system we were operating on doesn't make a whole lot of sense but you could still go into the woods at any moment like there's a place where you can go right now we can go in the woods like here we go you can go to Big Bear and you just go for a hike yeah I'll Senor in the forest like all this shit's still real there's still this is still here too right you know yeah yeah life is crazy and life's bizarre but we haven't completely turned the whole world into a city that's striking guess what bitch that's coming how much of it is covered in concrete and streets and then the streets go off everywhere like veins and by the way 200 years ago no streets all right there but aren't wildernesses expanding in this country is that wrong I do not think that wilderness is our expand there's more grazing land and I don't know I mean we're definitely suffering from urban sprawl that I was surprised to see how little like the percentage of the continental United States has actually inhabited that actually has houses and on it was really small it surprised me she had me yeah that's pretty small super it's percenters - yeah in these little areas but yeah like these people that live in these small towns like all across the country that is a big reason also why Trump won they just felt totally unrepresented by all the people that live on the sides I also think it's because they had I think 50% of Americans have what five hundred dollars in their bank account something crazy yeah she might be less than that right well that's four hundred dollars will you think about that said that's why I get mad when people character I don't like Trump but I never liked when people characterized all Trump supporters his racist etc I thought it was unfair because I think the majority of people want to live in some dignity and they had Obama eight years of Obama say but you will but their lives didn't change for a lot of reasons I don't think Obama's to blame there's a lot of reasons then along comes Hillary's speaking the same exact language so if you're gonna blame people for saying wait under eight years I still only have four hundred dollars in my pocket here comes a woman who's speaking the same language oh and by the way there's a lot of rumors about being her being corrupt I have nothing to lose I'm gonna try that other guy did you see what Donna Brazile rope mmm-hmm one of the reasons why she came out with her book was after Seth Rich got murdered and she called him a patriot wow I didn't know Seth rich got oh that was that's right that was that guy worked for the DNC there was a Bernie Sanders supporter the WikiLeaks has alluded to the fact that he leads them information he got shot in front of his house and it became his big conspiracy theory where people would mock you for saying it was a conspiracy and then Hannity ran with it and so it became clearly that was for a lot of people the Seth rich conspiracy theory it was nonsense nobody knows what happened to that guy though he was murdered he was watch on yet his phone with him he had his wallet on him nobody took anything from they shot him at four o'clock in the morning who knows what happened but when WikiLeaks starts saying that you gave them the information and that there's consequences to you giving them information one of two things has happening either WikiLeaks has decided all of a sudden to start lying right and making things up about people or two they were misinformed and someone was pretending to be this guy and sending them information so it's possible to meet face to face or three they're telling you something you didn't know that this guy who was just shot and murdered was leaking information about the DNC another DNC was corrupted by the Hillary Clinton group which is what Donna Brazile is saying in her book and that this guy released that and showed how the the primaries were rigged against Bernie Sanders and that Hillary ari was sending me excerpts from it the other day he's like dude she was Donna Brazile was saying that Hillary was in control at DNC before the primaries so so is the implication that Hillary might have had something to do with his murder that's the implication proposition the information was already out brought was like maybe he had more and maybe they were punishing him to stop other people from doing the same thing maybe other people had more information you know I don't know if it's true but there was another guy that disappeared recently it was a guy who had dirt on the Clintons some some guy vanished this is like really really recent like see if you can find that one some guy just right just type in Google Clinton dirt and this is like from Newsweek so there's people have vanished and I don't know how many of them been murdered the people suicide themselves I don't know how many of them actually suicide themselves right but it could let's just say one out of ten just one out of ten was an actual murder right this guy academic at the heart of Clinton dirt campaign vanishes white leaving trail of questions this really recently see they figured out when you kill people it's my piece of Westroads to maybe you know usually kill people it's like god damn how does body get here but when people just vanish damn that's crazy just disappeared where is that he when I need him where's mr. Bravo and I made him crazy he'd be going crazy about that one yes conspiracies turn in on themselves cuz he'd be like he's disappeared but he's not really what if he's not really dead why Eddie he loves himself a conspiracy he gets so excited yeah it's like watching a community towards like a do to super into sports yeah if I kill it he fucking I'm saying I'm saying is it's a little weird well you know what I tried this almost like well why does he enjoy conspiracies I said well first of all he enjoys them like enjoy what you like but also Eddie's always been really good at like shutting down people not believing in his ideas with jiu-jitsu but he has like revolutionaries you Jitsu yeah my kids you just didn't really create his rubber guards setups and all the different things the paths that he he fixed a lot of paths in traditional jujitsu he changed a lot of things and did some things his way and when he would describe it to me I was like oh this is a guy who like has an idea how to do things and when people are opposing he was like no no no no I'm gonna shut that down and move over here so that's interesting so his brain works that way right so when someone comes at him with an idea he has an idea and he's gonna try to get that idea through and when you come at him with some weak attacks on that idea and just expect that he's gonna relinquish his hold on the ideas like that bitch this don't make no sense now you don't you have any information it's gonna take someone giving him real honest-to-goodness impossible to deny information that he's gonna believe in any of the conspiracies that he believes are being false or it's gonna take somebody to explain him that his feelings control his thinking that is true but there have been conspiracies that have successfully been executed which makes this whole thing way more confusing sure it's like which one of these were real to say that all conspiracies are bullshit you are a victim of like some reverse racism no no I'm usually skeptical of conspiracies especially government conspiracies because government is notoriously so completely out of sync and not efficient enough and certainly there are so many different competing interests within government just within an administration you know everybody's trying to undermine each other and that's the history and it was set up that way and even if you talk about faking the moon land you'd have to have about a thousand maybe two thousand people to keep a secret that's not necessarily the case if you just had people thinking on a need-to-know basis with everything compartmentalized like this guy's responsible for making the o-rings this guy's responsible I don't know how it works I don't know how it works either but I do know that you're talking about if you were trying to fake the moon landing one of the things that would be much easier is you're during the Nixon administration they're getting used to faking things Watergate was going on you know I found out you know because somebody's drugs you're just starting to develop the kind of special effects abilities we can sort of recreate space scenes like 2001 that was though the big conspiracy theorists dream was that somehow or another like there would be like some irrefutable proof that Stanley Kubrick was the one who worked on the moon landing that was like if I had found that I'd be like coming in my pants like Eddie never acknowledges that the same impulse that drives him which is really to find the truth right and to be skeptical yes of people's claims and even evidence that's been written down yeah human beings have always always for the most part unless there's something wrong with you want it to be in the know right well I don't know anyone who doesn't want to know the truth I don't know anybody who doesn't want to know who likes being deceived and so so it that's why it's almost impossible to keep a secret long term in government well just somebody who's talking on the other side of it here's one of the reasons why the whole conspiracy thing is so attractive to people because there's a reward chain built into the human psyche of solving a problem that's presented in front of you that could potentially be dangerous is a reward chain in this war chain gets acted upon even if you're talking about nonsense even if this is like some area 51 you know UFO body fucking you know whatever it is Roswell New Mexico the guy who was there the god General talked to my grandma and told me about the coffins four-foot-tall coffin they're little alien babies had took them the back of the hearse they had embalmed and mike ma'at saw and they killed her in the forest stop stop I know I can't but when you have an explanation you don't feel as unsafe yeah see if you if I tell you that there are random things happen for example the shooter in Las Vegas he was 64 and there are no signs he was very controlling if you look at he's a bit of a sociopath he had we had this obsession with control but if I just tell you that sometimes people wig the fuck out and they just want to shoot a bunch of people that's not appropriate because there's medication sure but I'm sure but there's also like when you say that stuff it's like now what you're saying is I have no real way to protect myself yeah even if I carry a gun take all my vitamins wear my seatbelt there's always some crazy shit I didn't think about it's called faith the people I've talked to that that understand psych medicines they've talked to some psychiatrists I've had on the podcast listen to Kelly broken talk Kelly Brogan talked about it quite extensively one of the things that she went her and many other psychiatrist associative properties of a lot of these psych medicines that someone might have a horrible idea in their head but the repercussions of it are real like acting on it feels real but as soon as you have some sort of heavy disassociative psych medicine it's not even real like you don't care anymore you like you're like watching yourself in a movie or something you're you're you're on something that dulls all the highs and the lows it puts you in this weird state where it's okay it's okay it's okay to just kill these people like I don't know whether or not you could make the leap from being a person who could never kill somebody to being a person who doesn't have a problem with killing somebody I don't know if that's true I mean maybe that's that's a chasm too far to cross but I guarantee you if you're the type of person that is having some horrible thoughts about like being aggressive to people and then someone puts you on something that makes you like I don't give a fuck like it's gonna it's gonna if you have it who knows what the right chemical is - right like if they give you the wrong one maybe it'll switch you one way or the right one will turn to you the other way or maybe we should add some abilify into the mix it just throw some of this in there this is an anti-psychotic to help you all even out do you know you can have a lesion on your brain the size at the head of a pin you can have a lesion if it's in the right there's a cific area of the brain where it can be a tiny lesion that you can't see really barely with the naked eye and it can render you a homicidal maniac I got lesions in my brain is that true yeah what does it call what's the lien I don't know I could look it up for you but it's by eye but you can you wear I heard it was in a lecture by Daniel Robinson - who is a professor at Oxford and Georgetown and the smartest man on the planet well that's why you have to really be careful when you punch people in the head right yeah yes sir that's why it causes well so the guy who that makes sense no the guy who captured the 13 year-old girl not Elizabeth Smart but the other one he had two children with her kept her for 18 years and she escaped finally yes that was the guy that was weird that he and his wife it was somewhere in like I think Seattle had him in the backyard in a shed for in a shed and then they lived in the backyard with the daughters until I mean literally she was 18 they would go out once in a while it was real Stockholm Syndrome shit oh my god so crazy yeah and and she but she got he got her pregnant at 13 I was just a terrible story I was gonna tell you about earlier did you did you see the footage where they have they're selling slaves in Libya is it Libya or is in Iraq it's Libya yeah there was maybe it's in Iraq - yeah but it was Libya and they were you know there was a I forget who the title it was USA Today that had an editorial that said thanks Hillary Clinton because Hillary Clinton apparently they're blaming her decisions on the reason why we went into Libya and dethrone Muammar Qaddafi oh who knows yeah you would know maybe more than most but video of migrants sold in a parent slave auction in Libya provokes outrage worldwide it's disturbing that when you watch it they got guns these dudes headstall these photos i retweeted it if you want to go to my Instagram you can see some of the pictures of it so they have like Libya is a failed state now yes and it's goddamn terrifying in 2017 look at that in in 1970 my father just told the story at at Thanksgiving and he was talking about how Dubai and Abu Dhabi have become these incredible countries yeah when he was first there in 1970 1971 I don't know what it was somebody said you see that woman over there and she was a black woman she was from Africa somewhere and my supplier said yes he goes that's a slave oh and that was in Dubai I believe I'm sorry to anybody from Dubai I I know you guys have come a very long way but slavery was that was order of the day for in a lot of countries I'm not just picking on you in a lot of countries a lot of countries it was it was the order of the day I mean the idea that slavery would no longer be a case the idea that this would be outrageous to the world in 1940 would be certainly in 1910 or something would have been like what now I don't always go on slavery is that is is an order is the way of life I mean I think though today with the ability to film slave auctions on your cell phone and then stream that shit the more you learn about people and how similar we all are and how you know Sam Harris had a really interesting TED talk about this about the idea that you you have to be able to have a conversation about what is the most optimal way to live for a human being what is the most optimal is it is it true that women are at their best when having to wear a full burqa in a 120 degree heat that's a good question is is and by the way are all opinions welcome at the table are you interested I'm quoting Sam here but are you interested in the taliban's point of view on physics no and and as there's someone who does does for that matter and he talks about himself is his point of view on string theory which he knows nothing about as valid as somebody who studies string theory no but we get it there's a tendency to kind of go well you know that's your culture and I'm not gonna get involved in it even though it might seem brutal by my standards you hear this a lot with like like the Aztecs and human sacrifice it's very taboo to talk about how it was barbaric because you know that was them slime golf you and me and Steve Rinella had a conversation about that Rennell literally didn't believe me when I told him and they sacrificed 80,000 was it is that the number was the number when they sacrificed the the the people who are not a few sign of QT account FTO Khan as I said Toa Khan but apparently they sacrifice some fucking insane number of slaves so if it's so crazy that if you tell a rational person like Steve Rinella it's like I can't be true until you go and read about it and you go how how horrible were people then yeah they could sacrifice I really but want to say was 80,000 people then that was the nice year numbers I don't know I mean that's a crazy it's like in a couple of days yeah all the people that worked on the temple apparently after it was over they just sacrificed them Wow Wow just a movie one of the things they say is Cortez is able to conquer the Aztecs much easily a lot more easily because the Aztecs had neighbors that fucking hated them because the Aztecs would go in and and basically if you weren't a you know an Aztec which means you a person of the Sun you'd get sacrificed so so their neighbors were like Spanish guys 500 guys really will help you a Haunter percent those fucking we hate them you know so have you been to Chichen Itza now dude there's a fucking platform at each need so with the Mayans used to behead people they have the sacrifice there was this there's this like thing it's like a demon that's lying on its back and they would sacrifice the people and stomach area where they sacrifice people it's kind of grooved out from all the bodies have been slicing on it damn well that's why that's why you know oh my god I'm wrong it's way more as high as the number of persons sacrificed for central Mexico in the 15th century was as high as 250,000 per year but go to the construction of temple - I know this is a very contentious number by the way of course it is some people people are like bullshit and there's a historians that had to publish my book from jacket historian yeah 40 million people died on the shores although the whole male population was trying to be warriors it was it you know what is the sea just Google 80,000 Aztecs sacrificed temple of T I don't know how Buick on to a con I forget out how do you say it but I believe what they did was they built this fucking spectacular strip spectacular structure and then killed everybody worked on it they just killed the union kind of like I'll chop up when you'd build a tunnel for me is like can't know where it is sorry Kapoor apparently they have a party for them and then yeah hey guys thanks for working on the tunnel now the party toasts champagne and here's some lead poisoning as well super super hammered young women hookers and then shoot him in the head while asleep you can't have people no they said that the Soviets would do that like when when you would build a tunnel did you ever hear that story about how we figured out that empal Mir what is this this is it yeah I say that make that larger please Tino Tino cheat toots lon hmm I don't think that's the same one that's why 80,000 came up with it that's the number of people yeah okay maybe I've seen it say well I think also when one of things you have to deal with when you're dealing with an English deciphering of really ancient Aztec and Mayan code is that it's phonetic so like there's sounds that they made that they're trying to replicate with English words but they weren't really designed for English lettering you know I mean they're designed their hieroglyphs they have they the way they wrote and spoke is very very different than the way we do yeah you know they had a like some of the Mayan writing in particular what does it say there jammie traveler thousands Oh some of the the some of the Mayan languages we're like images that like like the Terence Mckenna described it this way he was like you have like an eyeball in a picture and then you'd have a saw and you have a the bug the aunt and aunt and then you have the flower the rose and that's how you would say I saw aunt rose yeah yeah yeah because we we just assumed that everyone should what is like what is writing writing is some symbols that you make that correspond to certain sounds that we've all agreed in our own personal definitions that we have and in societies we'll all agree that this sound means a certain thing we argue the parameters of what that means right and that's why people get super offended when someone says like like words are violence okay in the face you haven't seen somebody like gets old well I always say it's so important for young people to understand the difference between things and and there's a real tendency to equate equate for example to exaggerate you wrote a memo at Google and it made it an unsafe work environment for women and you tell her now you're Hitler now you're Hitler and by the way you know crab boats coal mines and Navy SEALs they have a pretty dangerous work environment as well so let's let's let's talk about the fucking difference because it's very it's it's it gets very weird and dangerous and meaningless and in fact in my opinion when you equate everything when you basically say you know you you shouted at me that's assault versus breaking my nose and we have lots of different examples of that it does a disservice to people that have suffered real you know vile you know what I think is going on man and I could sum it up in one word tribalism mm-hmm there's a natural inclination that we have to form like-minded groups and defend our position to the deaf okay and this is what people are doing and it's not that you're wrong and he's right he's right it's that all of us are acting like people trying to protect our team that's right and that is it's an incorrect way of behaving so if you say the like words or violence like guess what no they're not now they're not go fuck yourself - is that violent this is what I say I'm talking about this in my stand-up I did and and you know it's much easier to be full against something it's really easy to be against if we join a team what happens is you have to do thinking let the let the leader do all the thinking you have two bullet points now what your job is a soldier is to put down the other team it's much more difficult and think about this for young people listening it's way harder to define what you're for defining what you're actually for like so if you're a revolutionary you want to burn down the whole the whole you know the whole house what are you going to replace it with man that's really important yeah did with Libya revolution to get that shit all the time that's right when you know they came they saw he died right you got really bad guy cool now what no what are you replacing it with yes welcome to the power vacuum you hope you're gonna be dead before these fucking becomes a disaster in a failed state well you're not yeah that's my problem when when people and we have a lot of people our government that look at a problem and go oh it's Isis what we need to do is get authorization to kill more of them in other places so we're you're talking about as groups that identify as Isis and that's gonna solve the problem my problem with that typically is that it goes back to that one of my favorite sayings it's not what you think what you think is way less important than how you think because a lot of times if you pay attention you're thinking exactly the way your enemy's thinking I'm not so sure that that's how you do it I'm not so sure that bombing and shooting your way out of that problem is the way to go it might be in some cases I think you need SEAL Team six etc for certain shitheads but we defense everyone has to know that they're real yeah that's like one of the most important things about the elite forces of the government or of our military is that people need to know they're real that's right you need to know that's real yeah it's like there's a hundred thousand whatever the fuck there are people right now that are just ready to go all you have to do is press a button launch thank god they need to know thank God for Tim Kennedy etc okay exactly because remember this you need walls you need strong walls and guards you've seen enough bad people that's right you don't because there are the Mongols are out there they're out there yeah look at Libya they're out there that's right these people by the way that are in the military that the only ones that are experiencing it you're you're back here you're passing judgment on they're saying hey there's zombies yes like hey yes the fucking world's gone crazy hey they're selling slaves in the streets like we need to all know that there are people that are in some really horrible parts of the world right now that give you valuable information does mean we should kill those people doesn't mean we should fuckin nation-build so but we need to be aware of the landscape mmm and keep this in mind though too is it's not that would be hard strength you need men like you know Tim Kennedy etc those guys who are our protectors who we can push button go hey those fucking guys want and there are people out there they want to kill sure but I always think that it's also important to remember that those guys are doing that to protect the softer strengths in our community the people that are creative people that are inventing you can't have a doctor working on a cure for cancer and have the mongols come over and smash all his fucking beakers exactly that's why you need those so you need the problem as you need you do need both and the people on one side don't want to recognize the people on the other side cuz they wish they didn't have to exist exactly but they do have to exist course they do there's a balance to this fucking thing you know and here's the thing people in Libya if Kevin Spacey had a TV show in Libya we fucked all the grips right in the mouth for every episode they fuckin IEDs and every fuckin dead dog on the side of the road kick them over you lose your leg yeah okay yeah fuck your mouth he's Kevin Spacey his Kevin's the guy's the president you fuck your mom come on you want to work or not start what you want to do what you want to do you want to live what do you want that is an offensive accent reasonable I don't even know why you do it because it doesn't sound like anyone that's ever lived it's so offensive no one it's not a bad accent it's exactly what someone who doesn't know how to speak English would sound I would wish that I could speak Arabic so I could realize how fucking shitty my bad Arabic would be if I learn Arabic Arabic and try to talk to those people right now the rolling of the are make fun of me go ahead I give you full permission to make fun of animator song pretending to be or trying to speak Arabic Arabic is a very difficult language to learn too hard for me to hi my friend Dodd my friend it's so hard it's such a rich language compared to like Frenchman's Bay see a raise comes in Libya if you had a show in Libya Netflix Libya would give them a raise although this is method act this is a president would do fuck them out of everyone he can fuck this is what I like how you are behaving as a president all the time go Frank Underwood here's a fucking race just pull out a machine should do the fucking ceiling just in the room kiss him on the mouth and leaves not a bad fucking that's that's that's a good you play a good Arab despot who's that pervert listen this is what you do you fuck everyone say just get drunk it's fucking on booze made out of camel piss they take camel piss and they mix wheat you hear about how the president of the longtime dictator of Yemen got power he was a major in the army oh the air he just showed up that I liked he was there he was just gonna be one of the majors and the president was having a cabinet meeting and apparently you can look this up Jimmy apparently he basically put a briefcase down or a suitcase down and just pulled out two guns and went well see you later couscous couscous and what kills the entire decapitated the government goes I'm in charge now huh 70 you ever see what a pistol grip who is he looks like see you later yeah and then he ruled the nation with what's called an iron fist for about 30 years I'm sure you watched narcos right I certainly have how about that fucking show how about Pablo Escobar amazing you know what's crazy is apparently Colombia's bounced back tremendously and Colombia is like a really cool place to visit I've heard I've gotta keep your friends have been there I want to go badly there most they say the most beautiful people we serve a most beautiful women on the planet well had their famed it's just amazing that they bounced back so quickly from being under control of a drug lord yeah you know that the Pablo Escobar story is so goddamn crazy it is crazy ladies and gentlemen you do not live forever listen to me make coke legal it'll solve 80% of our problems just make coke legal hungry just make coke legal I agree are we really pretending that whiskey is any better than coke we're really pretending that I don't know coke I don't do coke I would say cookies even better cuz it's devastating quickly so you do a lot of coke you can drink for forty years then before you realize you're like holy fuck I don't have a house or anything else yeah you fuckin do below DUPLO every day for three years and come talk to me and see how your life works I think that less people would be inclined to do it if you made it legal and then let everybody see the consequences of its use in a realistic way I think part of the problem with things being illegal is that people can't choose for themselves agree and if people can't choose themselves it's forbidden and forbidden things just like that blank deck back during the Revolutionary yeah become more tasty well they become more tasty the darker the berry the sweeter the juice whoa I mean that's all forbidden stuff but you can't human being should not be able to tell this is the bottom line yeah human being should not be able to tell other human beings what they can or can't do with their own bodies where it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense if you have some things that are legal like cigarettes and some things that are legal like whiskey that I don't have a problem with cigarettes being legal and I don't have a problem to whisky be legal you should be able do whatever you want but I think it should be with all of the things like why how come these things right why can't you know you tell me that whiskey's legal but mushrooms aren't yeah like that's what year is this what are we doing are we pretending we pretending there's no science are we in witchcraft days or no let me know when the witchcraft days are over because I would say witchcraft should be over now yeah so if it's over now we have to look at science right right yeah okay well you can't let me buy oxytocin from or oxycontin from the pharmacy you can't doses or control because I stubbed my fucking toe yeah what do you think would happen if we made cocaine legal wouldn't consumption go up yes for a little bit yeah a lot of girls would show they're in a row then let it out a lot of dude it would become warden biddies get it they'll never fucking complete that's that joke cause I need you cocaine you want to start a business together great joke it's so true so true well need to open a donut shop at the ball doing dudes talk to you about their passion yeah passion it's a weird drug to be around I was in Jamaica and I'm not a big drug guy but I did I did a bag of coke hold a guy sold it's me I'm smoking weed and this guy was we were hanging because you ever do blow I was like I'm not a big car not a drug guy I mean smoke weed much he goes try this and I did one line of cocaine Jamaican cocaine and I was like this must have fallen off a boat because this shit's got a yellow thing to it and I was I first of all I'm the coolest motherfucker on the planet second law we're gonna play ping-pong for good three hours

gonna change my career because I'm gonna write a three are a bit on how God is a Rastafarian how funny is that and I wrote stand-up if God is Rastafari kept waking my girlfriend I'm going I'm writing the funniest shit you're not gonna leave she was a hub you way to listen and I looked at it I that I passed out before my heart could give out and I looked at the shit I wrote about eight hours later and it was it was basically God's a Rasta and he speaks like a Jamaican and that was the joke and I thought it was brilliant when I was fucking doing the bluff in the right state of mind if you captured that idea like if you gave that bit to Dave Chappelle sure he maybe he could make something not me not Bryan Callen he's my cocaine in Jamaica it's like you needed to figure out what the fuck you were trying to say like I've written things down on marijuana and I figure I'll figure it out when I'm sober but then you try to read it when you're sober and you're like tell the fuck was my point yeah what is the point here yeah but they did Studies on people on drugs I think cocaine and had them play music musicians and stuff and they were like I thought I was amazing then they listen to what their family like what the fuck well that the argument was made when did what killed the music after 1968 it was you know the Monterey music I mean rock and roll festival with genrich's and the Mamas and Papas so what what what gave birth that Renaissance was marijuana and psychedelics that that was it that enhanced the music for cocaine and heroin came in you got this fucking killed yet killed it people died man that's just some of that shit's good yeah there's a lot of good stuff but it's the idea behind that music mm-hmm like how about showgirls showgirls the movie would not exist

to be funny about the Libyan yeah don't let Kevin Spacey grab your dick I get it I get it I'm not saying that that's not what I'm saying no what I'm saying is we just need to be super cognizant of the fact that there is a real highly likelihood that we have achieved the highest level of civilization the world has ever known it's right now and we need to be aware that we've made progress in other words in any massive in any seemingly important thing that you want to go off on you're taking energy away from recognizing the fact that we need to protect the crucial elements of this amazing thing that we have right now and one of the things that we have to do is we got to avoid this weird tribalism that I keep talking about try by thinking because it's not just sexual it's political its socio-economic it's a fucking blue color guard and I'm no you're a fucking person yeah we're all just people you're in a trap human beings are were genetically predisposed to be tribal versus them we gotta get past that if we're a tribe okay we should be tribe planet Earth yeah you know there's famous Ronald Reagan speech you know that Ronald Reagan speech he gave a speech I'd want to say it's in front of Congress but he gave a speech where he was talking about how quickly we would set aside our differences if we were attacked by an alien force from another world right and all of us would realize yeah I'm just heated the Cold War I mean this is like very scary times do you remember growing up with the same age very much worried about nuclear Wessels was a real threat the nucular nuclear annihilation was actually something we all thought about every day yes and the the further were away from that the more we forgot and but if you just pay attention to Libya just pay attention to Afghanistan pay attention to Iraq pay attention to all sorts of parts of the world where North Korea things are not fucking stable at all we are assuming the things gonna stay stable because they're stable right here but we're all on the same goddamn planet yeah and that's a real problem it's a real problem and I think we're better at figuring this out than we have ever been before but there's a lot of hiccups and bumps along the way but one of the things that's gonna eliminate a good percentage of them is if we can isolate tribalism and see it when it's happening and call it for what it is and avoid it it's very it's very tough now and I'll tell you why because there used to be one of the great people always talk about religion was responsible for so much of violence but they always forget religion was also responsible for a great deal of unification so there was a national narrative in this country we were a Christian nation for a long time in this country and there was a national narrative there were just certain things that people collectively agreed upon and usually it started in the church or at least it had its values in the church I would argue that you know even our Constitution has been greatly influenced by the judeo-christian ethic all men are created equal for example is a Christian idea there's no way to prove it biologically or mathematically but it's something we all kind of it's a nice starting point it's literally what our justice system is predicated on all men are created equal even though LeBron James and I have totally different genomes and he's an avatar and we're not equal if you kill me you kill LeBron you do the same amount of time in jail t erratically that would be the idea behind her thing he should be worth more he should be worth a little bit more than that I would I would I would agree I would agree and and what's really interesting is how different we are how we like all strive not to be equal right I want to be better than everybody else but we believe in it's a really nice starting point you know something I read that's like really important and I always bring it up to people that free will or the ability to do whatever you want the like a freedom of expression of freedom of pursuits breeds inequality because if you give people true total freedom some people are gonna try harder than others yeah some people are gonna be it's not a bad thing some people want to be Tyler Perry and have a fucking Island yeah there's a little difference right what Simmons between being an American and a communist an American believes an equality of opportunity I'm not saying we have that but that would be the goal then there's equality of outcome the only way to have equality of outcome is to keep down the people that work harder they're smarter and more talented you got to make everybody equal that's to me a fundamental evil that is that's my problem with Marxism the fuck you the only way to do that is with force it's the promise that's never worked no it's never worked and it almost always leads to like mass murder right exactly but nobody wants to think that because the idea behind is beautiful okay so we don't need to compete we should just share money and share look up Pol Pot Mao Zedong Hitler Stalin dictatorship there was more of a fascist but yeah and people also don't realize that the Nazis were the National Socialists that's that's right it's a real problem with the idea in execution but the idea in the most romantic view possible is that we don't need to compete with each other we don't need to be greedy and then we could all share resources and wealth and we all get along good luck and have income equality but I see this I think it's important to recognize the thought behind the best version of that right the thought behind the best version of that is someone that just really wants to be an amazing person yeah right and they really want other people to be amazing people as well I want everybody to be fine they strive for everybody to get along so let's just like combine our wealth we don't have to get rich let's just like provide for the poor it's super important let's like give health care to everybody before anything Hey we don't need the military let's just relay okay you're gonna get invaded right as a matter of time for the Russians borders yes and they're gonna fuck your mouth yes but on that let me piggyback been doing that forever remember that the idea of Adam Smith's idea and the idea behind making money was also that when you are rich and when you were an aristocrat you have a responsibility to give back to your community that's variant that was that was very much ingrained in the British Sensibility and even in the American aristocracy like the Kennedys in this country when rich young responsibilities correct Bill Gates one of the boys Hill kids has engendered himself you have a lot of us is that if he does an amazing amount charity amazing amounts of me very creative with it too and by the way still lives like a fucking gangster it's not even like it's putting a dent his lifestyle I mean he's helping so many people out of the Bill Gates does the same thing Warren Buffett gave his kids that now it's up to 7 billion dollars he was like go make the world a better place and and and he's got all kinds of charities but that Dainese by all accounts a super sweet guy yes they're really humble but back to what you were talking about about how we're breaking into tribes III think that we have lost any kind of national narrative and what I mean by that is that people don't even trust their own institutions with the crumbling of any kind of like a religious institution it seems that now people are looking for they don't trust main sources of information so they don't trust most of the mainstream media's earned their shitty reputation cuz now it's about clickbait now it's about kind of creating so this you want to be first not true yeah being true is not as important as being the first one with the story and blah blah blah I think that there certainly are agendas with liberal media conservative media they both have a sneaky shit that people do exactly so what happens is people I think media's favor abilities and the single fucking digits or something like among most Americans let me give you an example how this works sometimes someone wrote a good article about the debate that Eddie Bravo and I had about the world being flat but the art that the title of the article was Joe Rogan argues with someone about the world being flat so it seems like you so you immediately click it but right away the first sentence is god bless Joe Rogan and then he was in a conversation with his friend who was arguing with the possibility that like but like okay I see what you did yeah I kind of let you help you he hooked you you got it you did it you did it's okay but because of that it even though it's very insignificant a bunch of people have said to me bro you used to believe the fucking earth was flat I saw that like oh yeah I bet you didn't see CNN and Huffington Post both do that I can't stand I think CNN and Huffington Post are terrible but both of them do that they think they'll hit you with this like Donald Trump just said one word to change the entire presidency you fuck yeah dude Keith Olbermann has signed off this is one of my favorite things to watch I like him he's uh he's a spicy character Superman I like to be super liberal but I think you have to have that look I'm Oh at least Who I am right now I'm an open-minded friendly person that allows for all ideas yes Keith Olbermann is as far left as you're gonna get and I like the fact that he was out there yeah I think having a wacky dude out there standing in front of a cable-access show background with red on one side and blue on the other and he's got his notes in front of them and he's wearing a tie and he delivers these super eloquent yeah like dissertations yeah but he's decided he's gonna step away and he said he's retiring for politics cuz he thinks that Donald Trump's done he doesn't think Donald Trump me he lists a series of things Keith Olbermann says he's retiring from political commentary yeah and he lists a series of things oh you know he's a fucking formative he knows he shit I would not want to debate that guy he knows he did one dude he did one thing though that was pretty fucking stupid you know where that Tommy Lauren girl she she's like a conservative hot chick hot white girl with blond hair now she put a flag on like she was like holding up a flag in a photo and he wrote something about not you shouldn't use the flag that way and then Donald Trump jr. tweeted a photo of the two of them together with her with the flag and keep Overland wrapped in a flag boy and said you know something about him being stupid some some funny thing that's also caddy to say that you know stop being catty yes fucking delicious and I understand you don't like her because she's a hot girl that's a conservative and she says ridiculous shit sometimes and she does but like you got to save your attacks you can't throw rocks at every target you can't stop for every dog that barks on the way home or you never get home this is why George Washington talked about the importance of civility you need civility if you start attacking each other if I start you know I heard a rumor that Donald Trump in meetings when he was negotiating somebody go oh Jesus your breath holy fuck you get the worst breath and they just get you on your heels you do that yeah apparently that was some of the tactics he would just insult you and get you off your pins your emotional and your insecure about your breath now you can't talk as much you know the little techniques I think Donald Trump would be super fun if he was like your uncle that you were gonna take your girlfriend to when you first started dating like say if you dated a girl and it's like three months in and you're in love and you're parked outside your uncle's house like listen we're gonna spark we're gonna spark this joint and we're gonna go meet my fucking crazy uncle he's flawed but he's crazy and don't look at his hair and then like what he talks about himself just seemed fascinated and you past it you guys are lucky I'm here and you go in there so high that you're barely alive so you got like a hundred and eighty beats per minute your hearts going what are we doing dude i i golfed with his caddy Obama's caddy George w's caddy okay Cameron I know you golf three times yes thank you very much three times no the same way that's the same time seeing on same guy Oh caddy for all the ones number one he said no no no I wish no and he said he said best golfer in the group hands-down by far Donald Trump yeah said and they didn't doesn't like Trump but but basically said he's very nice very funny and cracking like he looked at me this other thing I'm doing and Cameron was like I think you've got a lot on your plate and then apparently he drove by here at his club and Key Largo or whatever Maur lager and these people were there and he just walked as they were driving by in the cart he goes do you guys have any idea how lucky you are you're in the best club in the world and I just kept trying he's he's a very entertaining dude I'm a little bummed out of myself that I didn't do Celebrity Apprentice really yeah because the Celebrity Apprentice was available when we're doing the second run of Fear Factor right and they asked me to do it and I was one oh we're on NBC I was like god I want to move my family to New York for a few months and like maybe and you know mrs. Rogan was down for it but I was like I don't know if that's a smart move it seems like a lot of work for something that it's not really my thing I don't I don't really want to do it I kind of wish I did it too yes no Trump yeah I don't know how well you get to know them get to know if you let me hang on oh yeah I'm sure he's letting me be close to smell you I'm sure he'd be a blast I'm sure he'd be a lot of fun cuz one of those guys maybe I could talk to him I could fix things maybe we could have something to just take it to her and not it would be okay he's not interested the problem with him is that he's not interested in what he doesn't know is how I feel I've maybe I never seen I feel like we could ever sit in with homeboy yeah just to just him you get his podcast I found swear him out slip relax relax he never drinks doesn't close that's the problem it's part of the problem like you need a separation from your normal states of consciousness otherwise you're acting on momentum your entire life well they like a child they did it they did a psychological profile I thought was interesting on him which was that he's always been on the outside so his dad wasn't allowed to be part of the developers in New York he had to go elsewhere and he was always kind of like kept out and he's now in the media so his way of and I think Roy Cohen the infamous lawyer was his mentor and said attack always attack to mean any threat with an attack hey listen the reason why he's president is because Obama mocked him at the press corps conference remember that remember that press corps dinner meeting thing huh and Obama mocked him and said I'm one thing that you're never gonna be and that's the president and I go for real yeah I'm fucking older than you okay I'm ridiculous look at my hair and I'm still gonna read the president how about you go fuck yourself how about you don't know what you're dealing with here how about he was amazing he was so amazing in the debates he was so entertaining he's fine and even towards Jeff Bush said you can't insult your way to the White House my friend you definitely can when you're fighting look it's like what's um what's really ironic is one of the things that's come out do overturning those things about politics I don't but what I do know about is talking shit I'm good at talking shit and I understand the strategies behind talking shit and one of the strategies behind talking shit was that Hillary felt very confident that if she could get Donald into a position of being the primary candidate against her she would have an easy path to the White House because she felt like Donald was so ridiculous that they're the other candidates by even being associated with him on the same party that would be revolt it would be chaos and if he wanted be an easy target and there's all this like written banter back and forth where she was trying to connect him with the most ridiculous people like of course you know there was a there's just all this like strategy with Ted Cruz where they had this idea of how you know they would make them all look marginalized easy path the White House and he just threw a monkey wrench clean right into that theory it's like stupid I'm the worst person for you to argue I'm gonna say I'm gonna say you should be in jail Walker yeah lock her up just let me hold it and I'll make shit up too I'll make up my own facts if I have to I'll do it about what and I'll get caught on tape talking about how girls just let you grab him in the pussy yeah just a few weeks out yeah no problem locker room talk it was locker room talk are the problems talk about uranium dude I thought he was done when I heard that I thought always definitely done no president by the way what's really shocking what was it 44% of the white women voted for him cuz they want that dick well they weren't offended they weren't that offended by it I guess right this is a lot of women right now that just shut off this podcast you fucking asshole right when I was starting to think you weren't an asshole it's just comedy I don't really think that 44 person I think people didn't like Hillary they didn't trust her I think if you looked at what it is in terms of like a good versus evil it's known evil is unknown you know I think Nonis known evil or known corruption versus a sideshow like sort of a guy who's gonna be entertaining for the next four years but probably won't bring the Republic down but what if he decides to really look out for the American people what if he decides to make America great again what if he decides to bring back engineering and bring back production of goods and fucking what if he decides that what if you really decides that then is it better let's take a chance and I think a lot of people did that I agree and then I also think we were realizing and we should this is something we need to all come to grips with it is irrational illogical nonsensical and antiquated to have one person have that much power in the United States of America it is nonsense it's not something we need it is a it's a it's a value system and a ruler leadership system that's designed for small groups of people and it works very well or is very well for groups of 150 people it leaves over there dicks but as soon as you get to 320 million people all trapped together on a landmass you cannot have one dipshit that's good at insulting people and standing in front of a camera I don't care if it's him or the next guy or the nets on an assault on Donald Trump it's like one person who figures out a way to fucking manipulate and dance and do his best America's Got Talent fucking Preppers a presentation presentation representation one of those things to get to the point where people go ah the other ladies boring and she keeps fainting boom and they hit the switch for Trump I mean one thing money and one of the things that president always talks about and governors talk about is how little power they have you say that but there's real problems right now with the Environmental Protection Agency being defunded there's real problems right now with them deciding to start drilling in places in Alaska that people have been fighting for them drilling for decades because they're worried that in extracting minerals from the ground they're gonna ruin these salmon waterways well he can appoint judges and he can appoint he can appoint judges you do a lot of things and obviously that causes a big stir in political discourse and people being act and it's you're seeing like some trans woman got a got elected somewhere and gay people are getting elected places and so you're seeing a rebound which is what house that's right that's right he's created a lot of civic unrest and a lot of civic organizations on the other side on the other side yeah David Fromm was talking about that he is yeah he just sent me his book we just have to be really careful like really careful of getting tribal with this again I can't hate to reiterate this but I think that in looking at the group of humans as a whole there's a real problem that on the left and on the right people have with getting attached to their particular ideologies they've adopted and fighting against anything that's any different and not coming to some sort of a common understanding of what we really need to get by on this point well it's called it's called a couple of things one is there are different psychological profiles and I've heard Jordan Peterson talk about sort of like the left is rooted in compassion the right is rooted in respect for the strong and then what what happens is the way things move forward is you have an idea I have an idea and remember something is very important human beings usually are weighing to values in their head at one time let me give you an example I don't believe in illegal immigration but I have a lot of compassion for people who are dying to get over the border if I was a border control agent I would probably be the guy who's like come on in cuz I have no I'm emotional doesn't mean that's right what it means that I can sometimes you way to values in your head right mercy and and compassion versus justice and fair play okay let me propose something to you now this is gonna sound crazy for a lot of people who you a fool could call me at one point in time I believe in the future we will not have boundaries in terms of places you're allowed to travel and not to travel right one point in time people would truly be thought of as equal and when that point in time happens you allow people to freely travel all over the world why can't we do that now first of all you won't even have to travel I think what's gonna happen is when you can interface with another brain and that's that's possible you're gonna have an experience about what it's exactly what it's like to be a woman yeah exactly what it's like by the way to be a woman I'm gonna take it I want to be a woman so I can see what it's like to have sex with LeBron James but here's the thing what if she would you complain or would you put your hands on her hips I will I'm only gonna I'm gonna be able to experience it so then if I can interface from another brain now we got a real problem because what the fuck does that mean about my identity what if they can't like you can't pick which brain you interface with like you're gonna be a girl out sex with a little brown James but you're a 100-pound Irish girl like shit oh boy I'm gonna get your uterus blown out you know yeah like you want like a hundred and seventy eight pound chick from Ecuador that who can really take it I don't think any that's gonna I think what's gonna happen is you can have guys like LeBron James who had these fantastic lives who have sex and dunk basketballs and they're gonna sell their experience you want to interface my brain it's gonna cost you this much money and now it's gonna be the new drug oh my god the new drug is going to be I want to see what it's like to be what either you know whoever it is the bloodstream will rise again Dennis Robb will rise from the flames like a fucking Phoenix be the number one super star again in the world and when you watch porn you're gonna be able to tap into the guy's brain and you're gonna be all have sex with anybody who wants that's how I'm thinking about dick just like he is uh-huh imagine that why he's doing over to dick okay he's thinking about dick this is a confusing why am i coming I'm thinking about tag but shit damn it he'll get mad at you yo gang honey dick by that Bryan Callen video mother fucker homeboys got a giant dick but he's thinking about dudes but all the time no way but he folks all the hottest girls doesn't matter man while he's fuckin all the hottest girls thinking about dudes butts hold Ondo bro did you come or not came immediately immediately I came like a terrorist wearing a wig in my mind I came like a dude strapped with dynamite getting his dick sucked for the last time thank again I take the headphones off like fuck you Bryan Callen damn it who's fucking the hottest girls if he's thinking about dudes butts your friends be like man I don't even know if he's telling the truth I've been holding out for the Bryan Callen virtual reality sex video but now God he's so medium and white I want to think about her age I know oh I told you I had a dream I was gay right a couple times I've got on a podcast before or after you had gay sex this is during so I don't know that I was gay I can't believe I'm gay this is so not what I'm into and then I knew I was gonna have to have sex with my boyfriend who may or may not have been Brendan sharp I can't remember that gate you can't really bounce back and forth from I don't know man I've actually never really had a gay you talk to fattiest Russell cuz he'll tell you you're a liar and then all men have some sort of gay fantasy somewhere deep in their head or 35 daddy has had a conversation about truth and personally like plural truths versus one fixed truth that's a huge debate you know I mean by that yeah so like Nietzsche would be a guy to talk about plural truth so if you look up at a painting that painting is there are different truths right one is that painting is beautiful that's all I know it's a beautiful it affects me emotionally that's the truth right then that chemist would look at that painting and say well you're not really seeing yellow what you're seeing is you know your eyes are looking at light and then reflect there's a chemical in there and okay down a chemical as a different layer to truth you're saying different kinds of true love all right so true love I don't know what that's still a really interesting mystery to me because I wonder if that's a relationship with yourself so sometimes you're obsessed with somebody right you love them you might be obsessed with the idea of being the one that can break them that can be the one that that tames them the one that owns them the one that you know gets them to forget about all of the dick and just yours that's that's what a lot of relationships are predicated on this Tara does an ocean of territoriality right but is that true love is that we're talking about does it matter but what does what really is the moments where you are together where you truly care about each other where the intensity is almost overwhelming and the love and the happiness to be with each other is almost over yes that is really true love all the others is that a state though state and how long has it last that's a good question and whether or not you're committed to that person as love not just a love interest but like as a an inhabitant in your your realm of truly loved ones like how what is your your village of try a cynical answer for you on that so so I know the Greek says so why do you love your children why what is it about your children that you love and and this what Socrates said this is kind of an interesting way of looking at it so he said love difficult to define you have to define it as love of something right and what is the one thing man loves more than anything else think about it possi not close pussy's part of her pussy's maybe a manifestation of what you're trying to gain from it what is it come on attention why would you breed you wanna get rid of jizz goddamnit going you got a big deeper bro I need to think the next level why what is it the man loves more than anything else what does he want more than anything else I don't know what does he want you tell me immortality exactly and your kids are your genetic expression anybody worth a fuck do you do you want to live forever with no pussy forever or live for a hundred years and just live like jay-z on a yacht and gold underwear yes you want to live dangerously not safely fuck fuck up thousand years all about hundred years I'm excited so what you're saying about the immortality is horseshit because the immortality without pussy is nonsense immortality is represented in different things watch your legacy listen to me sweetie yeah if someone is in my circle of friends and somebody offers you immortality with no pussy or a hundred years and pussy if you don't take choice number two lose my number but hold on hold on sir top Tex I can't work with you sir I would argue that your love of pussy might be genetically like you've evolved to that your love pussy is is your love a pussy because you altima to spread and further your DNA well first of all I think we're being very disrespectful use particularly of cocaine you see I meant vagina I'm talking about sexual relations all right sir what about the gay folk ok the gay folk would want to be true actually instead of sex yeah instead of calling a pussy because the gay folk could be like hey man I'm with you but you're excluding me I'm one tenth of the population allegedly not one 38% cornets alias Russell no there that is Terry said of dudes get hard when they see dudes get sure he didn't say that I like that yeah me too um but I think that the idea of not being in a sexually pleasurable relationship with someone for all of eternity that sounds stupid first of all they said study they did with men and women in long-term relationships you know what the secret was a long turn away and they were see they fucked they had a deep sexual connection talk out of here the top give me I'm just friends with you we have a deep friendship you wanna you should want to fuck the person yeah you should want to fuck I've heard that successful marriages are like that yeah why make it those noises what you fuck that's what I do I said I do that's what she does on in all honesty if you had a choice between living like a hermit like all bullshit aside no jokes living like a hermit living like someone who occasionally interacts with people but doesn't have any real deep connection with them or living like you're in like a wonderful community of people that you care about and drinking and carrying on and hugging each other laughing and joking around and waking up hungover and getting breakfast together and you live for a hundred years you get a hell x1 you know you're talking about that right now you know the question you know you know you know you're you know what the distinction you're drawing my friend can I get philosophical on you the distinction between Socrates and Nietzsche he said a man should have quiet contempt for his body and ultimately learn to be a competitive human being just be a brain and your body's nothing and well as he was dying he drank the hemlock he said why are you guys crying I'm living in the shitty shell and it's all gross and I'm going on to a better I'm gonna be in the sky with all the great philosophers and Nietzsche goes yeah Socrates you said that because you're ugly you never got laid so of course you want to negate and you turn reason into a tyrant and he said all those seven deadly sins that the Christians talk about like like pride there's another word for pride it's called self esteem self esteem is a good thing and lust yeah sex is a lot of fun even though he never had sex but literally never has basically never got laid they even think yeah he might they think yeah they got syphilis and that's why he died and went crazy or he was gay either way he never got laid he had a giant moustache bring up Nietzsche and take a look at his mustache he used to talk about masks he had a crazy mustache record I'll dismiss you Nietzsche was good brilliant motherfucker buddy Toby make your life a circus and a work of art enjoy everything and live dangerously don't be fucking in a mountain when you're in a mountain meditating it's awesome but guess what you're not really engaged in the world I wish he was gay look at that no stash because there's so many standards there's so many dudes they're like like real aggro sort of Wall Street cut type guys that are Pro Nietzsche yeah it would be awesome if Nietzsche was just like the whole time was talking yeah you're ugly I'm thinking about good-looking guys cops hopefully that's not the only noise this is the noise I want you think about him making behind the spectacles with that beautiful mustache with that with a suit on he's doing this as soon as they stopped the camera thinking about dicks don't get you're being stereotypical I'm not licking his lips slurping you don't know look at him look at that face that would be a dick slurping typeface things whistle through his moustache when he says walk maybe that's why he has that mustache in the first place so dudes can just really grab it and get all four feet you like this bro manipulate his lips discussion those are lip handles he could grab ahold of them and wrap the handle fingers and then use it to just like push down on the shaft later I want to apologize I want to apologize if you need check though oh you Nietzsche fans why else would you grow a mustache in your face you know he was you know he was basically sick his whole life he was sick like that many dicks mal you suck a lot of dicks you lose weight I don't know if that's true sir coffee lot sir I don't know if that's true dick handle on his upper lip why else would you grow a dick handle on your upper lip because he's hiding behind his moustache be sensitive what about a full beard like fucking animal it's interesting some dude in Special Forces it's got a much neck handkerchief on those neckerchiefs that was part of his that was a service that was part of his Special Forces his mask why do so many of those like real badass as much as guys have those crazy like things around their neck oh you mean ropes like bandana type do you want to know Derrick scarves I got it I have the answer why okay ready good I know this from my buddy Rudy Reyes who is a recon guy saw a lot of action they did Generation Kill so why do you wear those things why do you wear it why do you wear a scarf here's why ready dude ready for this and hey all you operators out there please forgive me I've never done to me let's just live but just indulge me and all due respect as I'm if I'm here and I'm shooting okay poop up up up and you're next to me yeah where are my shells going they're fucking hot they're spitting out and when that shell lands in your neck and gets under your shirt it burns like a motherfucker maybe you pussy know so you cover your neck now you're talking now your turn a governor mark saw loved your body all over I'm like a little fucking rain teardrops going down your chest how about me and Afghanistan when I went to Afghanistan when I went to do stand-up at gana Stan I wore one of those and there and the Special Forces guy we were in the truck he goes take that off I know why because if we a with an IAD your face is gonna catch fire motherfucker we are code two I used to wear one of those that was like it's working where we're dancin

donkey dicks a bunch of dudes get fucked by mules and like I know they were like oh my god you're ruining your life and I was like I'm not gonna fight you and I remember that yeah I'm like they have to figure out who's the best I have to fight I remember meeting or looking at Bustamante and you said that's what's his first name alone Marella Bustamante and he's just he's six four and he was at a food there was I got food laid out and I'm and and you just you were like that guy's one of the best jujitsu guys in the world and I looked at him he had that jaw and I was just like God remember go

show rounded off as a ghetto to catch a sharp nose a skinny fucking neck yeah that's weird like I'm a thick guy when we first met we were both skinny uh-huh we're both like 27 maybe I had breakfast with Brendan Schaub this morning and I'd came fresh fresh for my Olympic lifting class you know I Olympic lifts now and my testosterone is white look at you look at you can't see if you get me and Bryan Callen together when Bryan was a pool boy dude you know what's really sad about that picture I thought I was kind of tough back then you're always a sweet guy no but I mean in my mind I was like I'm a blogger no I wrestle in high school sad sir I member when we first met man we sit immediately had so much in common we started talking about martial arts like what you can Taekwondo what your Radian what yep what happened that check what was her name well when you said you do box and you do jujitsu and you have to cuz you'd be in jail otherwise I went oh that guy speaks my life we're both retards both pit bulls there you go Bryan look at the dancing look at you look at that laughs I was doing push-ups - where's her she was inviting Mary oh my god I can't she's so she's the most talented woman I've all fucking funny I'll tell you that well she's incredible fucks her name man I cannot believe I'm forgetting Mary's name that's me look at you look at you go where does that do that that this takes someone captured time I just actually really happened with us I know we were actually there Gus 94 find out what her name is Mehta field disrespect Mary I'm sorry I'm so sorry I'm gonna find it I'm 50 and I'm senile oh my god he's smoked weed that's what it is oh that's what it is you bastard I'm embarrassing myself we're doing a wonderful job of entertaining people she's incredible she's one of the she was I was always in awe of her talent she's a funny Mary Masterson no but that's patriarchy son master woman we have to smash this here back a last name master woman how can we get have Masterson could even have Masterman yeah Masterman yeah oh god damn it Harry Shearer I'm sorry Mary she was very funny she's incredible that was a great character she had to she was one of those people that was so talented like I could she write shit and and she would figure out what was wrong with the sketch and I would be sewing all I didn't know but then she was a groundling forever I didn't know I was like oh you've been doing this forever like I did never done skirt specific type of comedy yes you know it's very different doing sketches very is a very different animal than doing stand-up she was ridiculously funny yes it's um it's a weird form of comedy you know those sketch little short things writing them every week you know that was the craziest thing about Senate life takes so much work but yeah like the Chappelle show and a lot of these other shows they had time to develop these sketches they weren't doing them all in front of a live audience like Senate Live does I have friends who have been on Saturn arrived and that is a grueling schedule they're up all night man yeah it seems like well at least coming from Phil Hartman's explanation of it he said it was very like competitive oh yeah the point where people got real hostile with each other just it was never like a relaxed no fun environment like in fact when he first came from Saturn live and came over to News Radio one of the things he was like a little standoffish at first and then eventually he like realized like oh these people aren't competing with me we're not competing it took a while though really yeah yeah yeah there was like an environment of SNL that was like super like hyper competitive Michaels wants it to be that way you have to compete to get your sketch on and if you don't you you go way and so it's a very competitive atmosphere you could see it in felt like Phil just relaxed after a while he relaxed and like no no no we're not competing like you're Phil Hartman I'm some fucking dude that nobody even knows yeah okay and we're both on the show together yeah hey what's up yeah there's a go okay okay and then he like I got deeper and deeper to know him you know this is back in mine on weed smoking days unfortunately I wish I smoked weed cuz he used to love to smoke weed really yeah yeah yeah he would he would smoke weed after shows wine down and play music and go to strip clubs and chef he wasn't possibly funny he was a really interesting guy but not like any guy I've ever met like legitimately not like any guy I've ever met like he had an incredibly unique way of viewing opportunities and things one of the things that happen is he didn't really make it until he was quite old you know it's a growling right or is the Second City I think from I think he was second city he might have been groundling to I think you might be right but I know he was also an artist and he did pee-wee's Playhouse he did something with pee-wee's play you know pee-wee Herman are now artists like a painter ya know he used to make album covers and stuff yeah he's like a like a legit graphic artist Wow yeah he's a fascinating guy like when we first did a Newsradio together he just decided he want to get his pilot's license so every time I talked to him homeboy he'd have his pilot's book out he'd be going over his fucking pilots book and going like keeps constantly have it on the set in between scenes he would do his scene and they would open up his pilot's book I'm just obsessed with learning how to fly a plane my dad was always loved yeah my father my father was obsessed with that he got his past I never got it I was like I don't know why he'd care that much well you know what it is man it's freedom it's like especially a guy obviously I can say this now since his wife killed him he had a bad relationship yeah when you have a bad relationship you just want to fly oh how his kids too and I want how do you know mmm horrible story that was a worst and I remember talking to you right after it again this is another thing where it was a disassociative it was a psych psych medicine was Zoloft mixed with cocaine not saying that she wouldn't have done that without anything not saying that the drugs are responsible but I'm saying it's it's eerie how many different violent episodes are connected to psych medication yeah we're fuckin with the very way that your brain interfaces with reality to think that that doesn't have consequences is absurd it's absurd it's absurd yeah and to think that you can sort of poopoo those consequences like correlation is not causation okay you're right you're right but have you done a study to find out what's what have you really dug into it have you looked into these people if you find out what they're like is there a way to even back engineer their personality before you start adding drugs is there a way mmm like do you know what the difference between depression and psychotic madness is I don't know right I'm not and I think obviously the people like the guy the Vegas shooter nobody knew right if nobody knew and he just did that so there's a there's a line that he can cross where he's capable of doing that you don't know what they're lying that they kill themself point is we're not dealing with an exact science yeah we're dealing with something that varies so why bless this for anyone they're just the dosages depending on how you react to it only reason why people are saying it's fine cuz they make money from it is it they didn't make money from it they'd be like oh how many people are being prescribed what yeah why how good did you try exercise you didn't okay so you just took a pill you're eating sugar all day and you took a pill now everything's supposed to check your hormones did you did you do anything other than that yeah it's yeah try meditation did you try exercise did you try jogging I want you to try jogging for six months it'll give you the pills yeah but can you but then again is that hypocritical shouldn't if I think cokes should be legal should know shouldn't I think the people should be able to take a pill well I think your your objection to that is that there's an entire industry making lots of money and making claims about those psychotic drugs those drugs psychosomatic whatever the word is drugs that that maybe in many cases are not true I'm sure that things like Prozac and Zoloft have their place yes I'm sure they work for some people I know in fact that family member that really do well with xanax do as well just like weed is good for some people and other people can't function I can't really function on marijuana talking pretty good right now thank you but yes I am but but for the most part matter it depends on your chemistry on your body but I think what you're objecting to is that there is people who get there people are getting very very wealthy certain companies on on claims that are not measurable and not always true there's that right but there's also the same reason why I don't think a 900 year old dude should be able to fuck a 50 year old lady because I think she's basically the full circle this is what I think I think that people are too goddamn vulnerable and gullible and when you have these commercials where there's people walking down the street and are cartoon butterflies are flying around and they're all jolly and you're selling antidepressants and then you start listing off explosive anal bleeding heart blowing out of your fucking chest like the alien movie your dick falls off your feet go numb you start reading off this thing while you're showing the same cheerful environment and crazy music I think that alone shows you that there's a problem just those commercials alone the fact that they exist the way they're structured yeah the fact that they have to say all these horrific side effects for like a minute two minutes of the commercial it's a horrific side effect a giant like if you have like legitimately have and what is commercial and 30 seconds it's entirely possible that 15 of those 30 seconds are gonna be the consequences of you taking this drug while you're looking at cartoon bunny rabbits and and wheat flying through the air and everybody smile and yeah and there's a bunch of whistles and fucking piano it seems like everybody's having a grand old time yeah and they're talking about death and suicidal thoughts and psychotic episodes and come on if you want a really good insight into how big farmer works read Ben Goldacre book pig farmer fucking just money and it's the same thing as all of it it's tribalism because if you could look at your team your pharmaceutical team as being you against everybody else you could figure out a way to sell fucked up drugs to people that you really shouldn't be selling them I just have to say someone to make money that's a thing because we're doing this podcast that my entire act right now my new hour is all about this and everybody who's seen me and knows that this is true so I want to say this because you're talking about teams and tribalism the theme of my fucking next hour is exactly this how we break up into teams so I just don't want anybody think that my next hour has been influenced by this fucking podcast because I love that you're thinking about the same thing I am well I think a lot of people are thinking about this now because as we're running into this weird situation where we realized that you know our democracy is in some weird way being examined what's being fractured this is furniture there's a lot but it's being examined by people yeah they're looking at it from all sorts of different angles in an unprecedented manner right and we're looking at the influence that Russia might have had and all this Bernie Sanders was gonna run in 2020 there's there's so much going on right now that's that's this intense incredibly high level that we're all sort of like caught up in this thing trying to figure out what's what's gonna happen next so it's also we're having really trouble trouble knowing what to believe yes what's right I mean yeah we don't know what to believe in what to believe in I mean is this a bot and and what what is Twitter I mean if six people are saying you did something and that's it in Rio is this and if the stories are all remarkably similar and now there's some consistencies ie Charlie Rose but what do we it's very interesting time because trans privacy privacy is dead yet we still don't really know what to believe I mean I I'm getting information from six different sources so who's actually telling me the truth about that person or that event that's the biggest that's to me and that was one of the biggest shit and when you ask that to click be dienes it gets real it gets me a real it creates cynicism and it creates a paranoia and it creates the idea that I can't rely on any the institutions I used to be able to write and there's also been an observed strategy of really inflated headlines that get altered later yeah you know they say something completely ridiculous it's not really represented by the facts and then they tone it down when people complain but they got all the initial hits that's my first politics is doing that you can sway a vote by say floating things anonymous yeah and then by the time it comes out that it's bullshit well you you've lost what's also dirt name stuff after important values like the Patriot Act of course fuck how do you vote against the Patriots hatred hatred exactly like that's rude of course that's rude that's a rude dirty trick somebody should have pointed that out someone they had any balls like that was on the Senate floor David from dead he never called don't think of an elephant I think it was called I read that a long time ago but he basically talks about how language if you you learn if you learn how to manipulate language it is very beneficial you you will it's really interesting I read it's the interesting things about like our population do you know that 80 I think it's 82 percent of Americans can't name one living scientist yet if you ask 82 percent of Americans will say that politicians should be talking to scientists that even though they don't they can't name one living scientist like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Stephen Hawking's or Lawrence Krauss at the same time there is a deep not only mistrust but also respect for science in other words hey you politicians listen to the fucking sighs if there's if there's a weapon out there that can if there's a technology that can reduce all the dust listen those fucking guys at the same time I find it very interesting that science is still being questioned like there's real questions on the right about the science behind climate change right well did you see what happened recently and it was in Texas the recent rash of earthquakes I tweeted about it today directly connected to fracking I'm sure but but what I was also missing is that both sides the left and right speaking of tribalism the left doesn't want to hear anything about the difference the scientific difference between men and women that would be and especially when you start talking about trans women the difference between male and female brains because what happens if you're James Dannemora is that what you're saying is that women are a victim to their biology and ultimately are not able to overcome certain things than men have an eternally James Bond yeah the Google knows yes I just wanted yes yes yes the Google memo guy yeah and I read that Google memo twice and what's interesting is a lot of evolutionary psychologists and biologists basically said well what he was saying was just drawing on on empirical evidence based on how for example 48 year old a 48 month old infant female and a 48 month old male we'll look at two if you give them a choice between looking at something moving in a human face typically the female the 48 hour old female will look at the face the human face the boy will look at the moving object what about lesbians I don't think it is right out of the room like leather Tuscadero that's a different story with a mohawk 90 days that I don't wear that with a Theo von haircut do you remember when pinky Tuscadero came - yeah they did that thing you gotta learn it how do you remember that we're the same age we had to learn in high school tested their pinky Tuscadero gotta learn it and once you learn it you only learn how to do it one side only 50 or was that right who's that you now know that's a new chick oh that's her that's what she that's good era wow that's what she looked like it's leather Tuscadero hmm that's a lovely coat Tuscadero and then there was pinky yeah pinky was inky pinky was like a little tougher she wore like a pink leather jacket sure sure did she's she's she had her shirt like this hottie that was hot and like a dirty mom one damn right she was a fucking dancer talk about nicest guy in the planet might be Henry Winkler I've met him he's sweet doll he's the sweetie he's a beautiful man he's a really really nice guy yes Kevin James movie with him you did yeah guy could not have been nicer you know I was supposed to do it Kevin can wait they offered me a part but I was in New York and I couldn't do it cuz I was I was doing well or in excuses no but I won guy the same because I feel back sigh I miss Kevin I really love have you talked to him lately no I haven't but I love that guy he'll okay and Leah Remini is on that show right yeah she's back she's a new wife this yeah I don't know what happened sighs I love Leah when you mentioned Phil Hartman did some album covers I found this yeah Asia dude have you heard have you heard Charles Manson song he yeah fuckin Steely Dan yeah what yeah whatever what else you have eight album cover is designed by libertarian from America yeah that's right in poco yep fuckin kid now he was awesome man did you hear I'm sorry that the fire sign theater fighting clowns Wow yes and to him I want to get a print of that go back to that see if we could find a print of that fire sign theater phone yeah well yeah let's get a print of that and put it up in the studio did you hear Charles Manson's song I don't hear about it jerked off to it it's amazing sir sir please sorry five to ten five four - Charlie Matthew hi your garbage man you people help me down I played him on MADtv Jimmy yeah that's right baby without the video what do you do is amazing that that guy got so many people to follow him but that's the thing like nine hundred year old people would not follow Charles Manson man stop talking about the nine hundred year old people that's a long well but that's the whole reason why right we are infants we're just infants with a very short lifetime well let me ask you this imagine if people look like you ever look at a person from like 1800s when they first started inventing photographs you see a 25 year old like oh my god he's almost dead yes it looks so weathered they look like they were just dirt or when they would take pictures with their dead relatives oh you never seen that this is my care they all died I have pictures with them oh yeah those people they died quicker they look like shit but if you lived 800 years this is what I think about I don't think about developing that much for understanding I feel like I'd be like alright well I guess I'll start the drums and then the guitar and then the piano and I'll master those as well and I would just figure out all the skin skills I'd master let me tell you what you would be at 80 or 800 years old what you'd be living in a castle yeah and you would basically be having young ladies come to the castle and give them seminars yeah how'd you like your life yeah I did enjoy well older one you're 800 they're gonna look hot as fuck and they're still gonna be like kind of spiritual but not really really just yep why I don't know why just stop being awesome the sex stop being awesome I think that's a crock of shit designed by people don't want to fuck me too one day you not gonna like - you're so right Dixie mouths it's gonna be boring well okay maybe but I don't see any evidence I'm not seeing any evidence that that's real I think you're making things up and I'm not really interested in talking about this so I find your your your fucking opinions are exhausting and they're boring you hang on your opinions are exhausting and they're boring yeah so you hang on oh you run with them but I go nah no I'm good nah the base living here's the thing it's like there's this idea that there's like some higher level of thinking and then there's like base physical pleasures that's not real you have a hundred years and then you're dead so you're supposed to have if you're lucky just because you enjoy some very intellectual pursuits it does not mean you should enjoy getting your drink on every now and then or doing something stupid or being silly or sex or anything just save yourself right what would you save yourself right now if I put your 25 year old or your 20 year old body right there what would you say to yourself right now figured out bitch really that's what I'd say yeah make your mistakes you're what you're gonna learn from someone you're never gonna learn from them sitting down saying listen you've got to learn from me what you're gonna learn from someone is by example who are you gonna learn from someone is by someone out there like following a lead that you know is difficult and achieving petitions that you think are very hard to achieve and you watch that and you go okay what you got to do is gotta get comfortable with being uncomfortable you got to grit your teeth you got to bear down you got to work hard you gotta be honest you can't gonna be honest with yourself about how hard you're working and that's what a lot of people are not doing that's what you learn you never gonna have to slip a job until you get punched in the face and watch it I'm gonna show you how to do it but to really learn it to the point where it's a part of your Norrell patterns yes there's certain things that happen to people where you you see them like slide their hips back oh that's a guy who's been kicked in the stomach yes like where everything you do is a reaction you don't think about it's the same thing for sure yeah yeah yeah those pathways get carved in and by the way those pathways to be really shitty to you can ever watch a shitty pathways carve into your head that ensure your failure is ensure your failure is ensure your you're questioning yourself and also blaming a bunch of other people you got a like you know like people are supposed to edit you're supposed to edit like when you make a document you're supposed to edit when you write a book you should also edit your thoughts you can't just let them all run wild right you can't because the some of them are really like impulsive and they're they're not well fabricated right and if you try to defend those fucking stupid thoughts you're gonna be like what we're talking about with conspiracy and you learn what not to listen to where that's the other thing now all not all fucking ideas are on the same plane there are a lot of people you shouldn't be listening to yes and if you want to be really good at something find the right tutor there's a big difference in how Falco Darrow and you know if you want to learn how to kickbox or whatever and that dude over there right right right yeah if you can well yeah if you have the I mean good good guidance and tutelage is really important it is you know it's interesting now is that people that don't have access to good guns and tutelage still have access to online you got you've got you got the Gracie University you got you've got YouTube hands Oh Gracie giving you a little thing I me Bravo has this whole system 10th planet jiu-jitsu system it's all available online you can learn all the moves and if you're in a small town Eddie has over I want to say go to 10th planet jiu-jitsu comm 10th planet JJ calm I want to say he has more than 80 students or excuse me more than 80 studios worldwide yeah I think he has more than 80 schools so Wow and they put up a lot of the data of like the stuff they're doing and stuff they're working on drills and things a lot of it's online yeah that's amazing yeah how many what does it say look at the fucking that's incredible success son 10th planet the city I hope he's charging a lot to license that he's making money trust me we'll talk later look at this though look at this I mean this is insane that's amazing he's he's got some huge accomplishment a crazy number of people that follow whose digits maybe he is right about his conspiracy no but he's definitely right about jiu-jitsu you know the chemtrail thing is another one like he he Clint that for a long time he still put something up on his Instagram page I know why he believes that because he doesn't believe in the government but my position is I get that and I don't I don't trust a lot of people either but you have to trust the people that are scientists that are all agreeing that if a fucking jet engine that's heated up goes through condensation and a certain atmosphere that creates artificial called being responsive to evidence it is and it's also like you you you can't you can't mock that like that that's very important if you're gonna get anywhere with especially when it's on your wrists and in your hand listen to it like this this is their science that measurable science that works right so the science that goes into your earphones that goes into the vaccines and antibiotics that push you beyond your black biology the science that gets food fresh food in front of you all that shit is is you're benefiting from that and usually the signs that you don't believe in is the same size you're actually using to speak into well that's a say yeah that's the argument we were having yesterday that it's it's so ridiculous that anybody would have an issue with the highest minds in the world deciding whether or not things are real and things are not real and what is and what isn't well he thinks weird I don't know what he believes we could sit him down and talk to him about it but my point about all of it was that the very genius that allows him to like shut down jujitsu attacks like he doesn't recognize jujitsu attacks is like well this is valid to know he's like shut that shit down and move forward it's one of the reasons why he's so good at jujitsu he's so good at jujitsu because he doesn't like recognize your attack as valid gosh I shut down and he moves it's really interesting no because he's an undeniable Eddie Bravo's an undeniable jujitsu genius I haven't said you know I've been so very sure yeah he's great I'm very I'm sorry have some shoutouts I've and he he I went he gave me a lesson in if so awesome I went to Seattle in his school you know he's the only guy in the UFC that has a submission I think maybe one other person might have it now but for the longest time he was the only guy that had a body triangle rear mount submission where he got a guy he got Tony Frick 'ln in the he got his back yeah and when you flatten somebody out and you have someone in a body triangle yeah it's so fucking brutally painful yeah that Tony frequent tapped he was the first guy ever to tap from a body triangle and I remember I watched him do that I was like oh wow because I knew that that hurt but I didn't know if someone would tap from it a new UFC fighters whoa for a guy like me he's probably 43 44 now and he said he invited me to school I was just so psyched and he's gonna teach me tricks and just like in close fighting Bach dirty boxing right and he we put he put vaseline on here yeah see he gets a body triangle he's awesome it's so painful he's such a great guy look at him he's from Chile yeah he's a bad motherfucker and he's got a rooster tattooed I was really yes he does it was funny because we were he came to my show and then I the next day I I was I got in the ring with him and he had put great Simon and we're just doing little things with gloves and when you it's for a man like me for a man like me who was basically 170 pounds and nothing compared and when you feel that a man who's been throwing bodies around his whole life and punching and it's been his life and he's posed by about 220 maybe 230 and he hates a little heavier than when he used to fight but the the strength and the just the density of his body as you're fucking trying to do anything and he just moves you he kind of shocks you around with his hips yeah it's so humbling and he's super technical to fuck you so even was like super super did I tell you I got a picture of him oh it was a picture of him and Maurice Smith being held court and made with Charlie Murphy Charlie Murphy is explaining something called a Chicago Ridge hand that's like a technique karate technique that people aren't using enough in MMA he's kind of right it's a ridge hand is where you had hit someone with the side of your hand do you ever know a ridge hand you ever practice that karate move you know about chess I don't know shit karate move it's a ridge hand it's like this this is Eddie Murphy that's Ivan style very to the right of the table and the black bald-headed dude is Maurice Smith come on yeah you got too bad mother you got two killers at the table and then I'm back behind this all this stuff I'm on this side of it but it was Charlie Murphy explaining yeah I've been soaked well Charlie was holding court Charlie was so funny like I don't think people that never got to hang out with Charlie ever really good to understand how funny Charlie was I was a great storyteller his amazing storyteller but he just would hold court and you would let him you would fall to the ground laughs and he was just a great he was great at like being the guy who told the story the best and it had the but it didn't translate and a stand-up as much as it should have been this is what I think happened I think he jumped into stand-up like way too quick and was headlining like really early like he didn't do like the whole thing like we all did like do the open mic night Ted start dude no dude he was headlining like that he was Charlie why from the Chappelle show so he had him done standing before us he had never done stand-up can't do it so he figured out how to wait I mean he did it and he figure out but I don't think he ever I think if you had allowed Charlie Murphy developed the way we all did yes from open mic ER to middle act a headliner to hold he would have been a world-class assassin yeah and he know he died is still a very funny comedian and he was headlining all over the world did you know he was sick when you were no he wasn't sick when I was hanging out with his leukemia or some kind of special like that all happened after after I'd seen him I hadn't seen him in a while he did my podcast in like 2000 I want to say in 12 somewhere around them maybe 13 him and my friend freeze love did you ever meet Eddie Murphy yeah I met Eddie in Hawaii once just randomly it's funny it was the craziest thing ever really it's like he knows who I am like this is a cool dude he goes you're a funny motherfucker ah fuck he reached out and grabbed my hand he gripped it hey Bobby funny mother father yeah who was married to Whitney Houston Bobby Brown came up to me the other day in the comedy store and told me some crazy friend Bobby Braun came up to me I was I was getting my ticket and I was flying I was flying from my camera were and he came up when he goes you're funny dude man you make me laugh a lot you shake my hand I didn't realize who it was until somebody came home said you know that was right I go I don't and he goes that was Bobby Brown I go fuck that he looked familiar and then we sat I sat next to him I just start singing two songs to him did you know yeah he was the first dude to Darach the microphone on the side of his face really headset son we got a headset for Bobby fucking Ryan and he was dancing who the fuck had a headset for Bobby Brown he was like pushing the

they were seeing I'm sure he's great he's magical he's magical yeah like I've done it with him he's magical because he's so professionally funny he's so professionally funny but also there's a bunch of comedians that he's making laugh like that's what DOM is really best at so it's you know me and him and red band and Tony and then the comedian who does the set and then the audience who are comedy nerds yeah so it's like Dahmer era it's just coming in there fucking with six guns loaded yeah yeah yeah that's his he's like I got an arsenal yeah if I if I was Tony Hinchcliffe I wouldn't fire everybody else and I would say the honchos dahmor era is there and then another guest like it's always down my rare I'm gonna have him on the fighter than a kid I don't we haven't had him never had time no long time ago he couldn't make it I came out it was I gotta get him on oh I fuckin love him get it who's your least favorite guest on the fighter in the game on the fighter indicate yeah my least favorite guest don't tell me let's just keep this I don't know I don't even I can tell something to you ask them a question you hope they don't answer this one some people just kind of like just don't come to play they might have be having an off day if I don't pee right now I'm gonna die how do you not have to pay a huge platter right back Jamie and I'll talk about LeBron James tell me tell me thanks jamie anneka he does have a new seeker oh wow do they have one every season yes he's got two different pairs he also has his own imprint label on Nike which is uh it's a baller any sponsors Ohio State that's like if Connor McGregor starts Co promoting with the UFC like it takes it to the next level right did you hear anything about Connor yesterday don't look at the rumors or not well you got into a fight and in a pub or something and I'm terrible random shit about I don't know if it was even accurate yeah and that's the problem with keeping it real yeah you know if you want to keep it real and hang with the people eventually someone's gonna test you someone like you were when you were 20 you know maybe sure I don't know if Connor was into that I assume he wasn't because he's a winner but man that absolutely can happen if you want to be out there again hashtag keep it real ballin - yeah hashtag ballin I mean he's he's walking around with expensive watches these beautiful David August suits on he wears these tailored suits everywhere his he's super expensive shoes and watches many of their Lambos are driving around Ireland - Lots that's where I know let's get one that's a good point yeah he's balling out of control I wonder what did it take him I mean now that he had that big crazy fight at the fight when he jumped over the fans and pushed referee mark Goddard I wonder what it would take to get him back in the cage now like one of there's gonna be fines and suspensions I wonder what the fuck is gonna happen this is quite fascinating but I'll tell you one thing he makes things fun he does it makes things fun with Oscar De La Hoya's hitting the heavy bag on he should say that he'll fight Oscar De La Hoya but only if Oscar agrees to wear a skirt you got to wear a skirt and you got to wear fishnet stockings I don't fucking fight you think there's anything still - I've heard Roy Jones is still trying to fight Silva which I don't know is there any not that it's gonna happen I was not take that bait yeah he have Roy Jones I mean you see what happened when Floyd fought Connor and Connors in his prime you know and I'm not saying that Roy Jones in his prime but he's still very active he still fights Roy works out all the time and he knocked out some amateur boxer MMA fighter last year he had some some fight remember that like there was like a contest to see who gets to fight him yeah he ko'd that guy with one punch a day nursin gets suspended for his yeah yeah Anderson's gonna be suspended for quite a while really yeah once if he indeed is guilty let me just preface that if he indeed is guilty and they they don't have any reason to believe he's not what's your um what do you think is the move for Conor McGregor should he fight Manny Pacquiao until I get tired of doing it every day in crappy jokes I'd be fucking drinking I'd be drinking ski I drink a fucking gun barrel full of Viagra a huge gone back corner and make my way to the pub and just start shooting rounds off that's not a very good it's not a good economy gregor eriksson but it's a good Lucky Charms I would hire the most beautiful huge volleyball player women to just carry me everywhere hmm yeah just get giant super athlete women to just carry you everywhere do you think he fights Tony Ferguson does he fight that's the move Manny Pacquiao he used to be not the move but I think Tony Ferguson like I think Eddie Bravo had a real good point about it when he and me and Brendan talked about it I think Tony Ferguson is the right move is for the fans I think over many yeah yeah I don't think that's smart I think if he wants to do a boxing match the real smart move would be fun an MMA fight and then fight a boxing match in a year but I think that the Habib nurmagomedov fight you've really got to see how being fight somebody else first and the Nate Diaz fight although it could be huge Nate's not really fighting anybody right now I would what I would like right now this is my thought I think Nate if nate comes back and fight someone and wins connor fight someone and wins Connor as a boxing match they have a huge MMA fight after that fucking huge goddammit I mean three million pay-per-view buys huge gigantic yeah he's got gets great yes that's the fight it's gotta get through yeah but that's a big fight he might not even have to get through that if he can lose but lose in a respectable manner like lose a very close five round decision where it's like a nail-biter where at the end of the ring and new Tony Ferguson drops the ground and Conor's like fuck and then there's like controversy yeah I thought Connor won and the people that the pundits will debate it online if he can lose a fight like that yes but if tony lights him up crack some darts chokes him puts him out in the first round and then spits on his dick yeah yikes and the Nate Diaz fight isn't worth a lot but yeah if he can do that he's like he's so loved by Ireland that he could almost do anything yeah you know like Daniel Cormier said this to me we were at a fight it was in between while we was doing the stand-up thing we're like you know they set you up with the microphones and give your analysis about the upcoming main event that kind of shit and we're looking at each other and he goes he doesn't lose anything when he loses because that's what's crazy yeah he goes he loses a fight and the support is exactly where it is if not more that's right he's like I've never seen anything like it well I didn't they applaud his courage he's just so brave like he just puts on the line there's definitely that there's death backs up what he says was to definitely I'm crazy the fact that he came back and beaten eight because I said that Brennan after I saw him lose the first time I go Nate's just too big for yeah he's just too big came back beat him yeah and then and then and then knocks out in the first round knocks out Eddie Alvarez second second rounded him up it's our first round unbelievable second round wasn't it I want to show you second round I want to say made it to the I want to say they were just fascinating man it's it's like to see him kind of back it up that's what they applauded just his courage and his spirit it's also he's he's a great shit talker yes that's a big part yes he's fun to listen to dresses the way dress is to dude yeah khabib needs to fight a 170 there I said well you say that but he's got a new nutritionist and Cormier was telling me that he's having way less problems with his weight now he's to be sighs no no he's not even okay know that he's in the 170s now really yeah yeah yeah that he's like way lighter now that he's ever been anytime close to a fight and that he'll have way less problem making way for this fight and they've got him on a very strict nutrition really now yes because he's fighting his team yeah my coworker Cormier tells me Rock Hall Luke walks around at 2:15 you know it doesn't make no my good man off bigger you understand how that works right no it never made like he looks at they did Luke posted a picture of him training with khabib and I was like who's the Giant this is dud look he's one of the most impressive grapplers I've ever seen in MMA yeah its ability to take guys who are very good you know like half failed dos Anjos and just sort of rag doll him Wow his wrestling is it is it's it's stunning it's a different kind of rust because I think dos Anjos is better now than he was during that fight but it doesn't matter it's like oh the way he did it to him it's like man if there's levels where it's hard to tell with him ma because striking is involved when striking is involved the you don't get to see the pure grappling level but what I was seeing when I was seen just pure just pure grappling I was seeing strength endurance technique there was just like 30 percent like they're stacked up on number come out if he gets ahold of you yeah you're not getting him off yeah mowgli driver yeah nobody gets him off look at the size of kabhi breath yeah but now that might be the camera angle but it could be but he's you know he's in front and but he's you know he's not cutting weight right there or he's if he is he's you know playing into the game yeah he's a monster man he does I think he does really well at 72 that's all I'm saying he posted something on his Instagram this is it show you why this motherfucker so hard and why all those people from Dagestan is so hard he posted some ones on his Instagram one of his friends who'd been tortured now posted photos of his friend who had his stomach cut open yeah he put posted on his inner in his Instagram this this guy there's two photos there's this photo and then there's the next one and this guy had a stomach cut open they were tortured him about something and there's a translation you can like translate all of it but it has something with you know him saying that someone was wrongly accused they were trying to get him to confess but the point is this is a UFC number one contender or at least number two in the lightweight division one of the most talent stacked divisions in the world and he's posting stuff on his page about how hard his environment is that's where he comes from for being tortured yeah he's when he gets in there his mind I mean you're fighting literally fights like he calls himself the eagle he's like a fucking EGH yes I mean he's fucking ferocious when he gets in there and he's at a level of grappling like man he's been doing it his whole like crazy and at an intense super primal level you know so intense real technical super knowledgeable about wrestling and jiu-jitsu submissions I think Daniel said that they like they basically tousled for you know 15 minutes damn Daniel The Olympian you know yeah he said whose hand fighting with him I said whoa shit it's like he's a beast never coming off as a beast and when you see him get a guy like Michael Johnson down the ground and just own him he owned them and he was saying look I'm sorry I got to do this to you man but you got to tap like I need my title shots already sank yeah he's beating the fuck out of him man he was just holding him down and pounding on yeah it was really hard for me to watch cuz one thing I'm like I'm impressed with Michael Johnson's complete unwillingness to tap just just like beat me up keep beating me up fighting through it and then eventually got keyboard but it was just ruthless yeah it was ruthless and the control that he had on him just his arm tied up and just beating the shit out of I was like wow this guy's new there's there's certain positions we see a guy is so much better at a guy that he's not better than a guy that the guy is holding down just not get out it's not gonna get out it's a matter of time before he gets beaten and unconscious that's right I thought you raised the same way when Jacquerie gets on top of you or gets you down you know unless you're low yo romero you're we'll see you later yeah see how he's got his right arm tied up he just clamps down on his wrist and his right arm became he became a one-armed defensive guy just a guy's been fighting his whole like wrestling his whole life so fine details it's fucking details though it's where his hips are it's all the minutiae the micro movements that any anyways he probably feels like he weighs 300 pounds I'm sure like those wrestlers like that like you know when you when you tussle with a guy's been doing it his whole life he can make him he can he can tap you if you're a regular guy by putting his weight on you after a while you just you'll just tap was you know which Ben Askren it's gonna be on the podcast I'm working it out with Ben Askren gonna get him out here finally I've been a Ben Askren ball rider killer for several years not technically a dick rider ball rider whatever ball does the dick is so deep in uses and now you're riding his balls over there all right hold on the balls how much does he weigh well what is he weighs fights at 170 okay so he's won seven a 30 50 years she cut some weight for sure but I don't think he cuts a lot of weight you mean it's not one of the bigger guys in the division is just super technical with his wrestling who's his that where'd he learn well he's a fucking serious world-class amateur wrestler I mean he knows yeah before I thought it was just two kids no Ben Askren pull up Ben aspirins record you could see his collegiate wrestling record he was a fucking monster put that here powerful Missouri look at that uh if you pull up his record those Wikipedia record and he does a lot of work with a lot of Duke Rufus's guys too yeah he's always been a corner man I've always seen him at the UFC yeah he just had he had some sort of an issue with post-olympic career so like what is the Olympic Games yeah he was in Beijing what did he win in the Olympics he lost one anyone one is that what it says Wow yeah phenomenal wrestler I mean just phenomenal and he's retiring undefeated mixed martial artists he just I think he just beat Aoki I think that was his main his retirement fight Wow another contest after the Olympics to dave schultz memorial international he won mmm probably yeah probably ever medal or defeated two silver medalists in another tournament interesting um go to his MMA career because i want to see who he just beat for his retirement fight because he just had it was a retirement fight yeah Shinya Aoki who at one point in time was one of the most exciting submission guys in the world and he was a refine it Diaz right right maybe he used to wear tights that's is he still fighting though you say that was recent yeah okey just fought Ben Askren I didn't know Ben was still fighting it so yes yeah this is his retirement fight just like just had it like last week Wow yeah I set him with congratulations and I said let's do a partner he's got a does he have a twin brother or am I thinking about Hughes you thinking about Hughes yeah are you sure I think I have a twin brother - might as well I don't know and and but let me ask you this does how was Matt Hughes doing do you know he's doing better apparently they're really excited about his progress you know he was in a coma for quite a while from there apparently what they're saying is that he thought that he could make it across the tracks and that if he waited the train takes like ten minutes to go or ten it's fucking giant ass train so he took a chance and he hit some gravel you know he said I worked with him on warrior and you know what he said to me what you guys I just hope I can put my shoes on and put my own shoes on when I'm 70 like you because he were we were talking about head head trauma he worries about it he should he should you know and towards the end of his career he developed a a compromised chin it's the best way to put it like you could seal it doesn't everybody Jay Penn knock your brains I found us everybody does chuckle Adele who had the probably one of the greatest Chin's of all time he exhibited it later in his couldn't take shots anymore cuz your body goes oh I've been here before I see you later and shuts down yep young sense that's a guy who is as just rock-solid ferocious as Chuck Liddell he just to walk through bombs guys who just throw bombs on he'd walk through them at the end of his career could not do that anymore so interesting how your how you know lifetime fighting makes you more fried you know yeah I mean your body's just not designed for that x-ray of his face yeah and he has micro fractures all through his face oh my and he said and the doctor said it's very common with fighters and football players Jesus Korea just micro just cracks all through your mask oh my god of course yeah you think about Brendan sparring Shane Carwin all the times getting mugged how about getting punched full-on and having his nose shattered by cro cop it was an elbow and yeah and and still coming back blam yeah so shots took some good shots from a big country before he got hit behind here yeah he watched that fight boom and Rothwell K Oldham Pony Oh Big Ben he's another guy what happened him he got caught with something right yeah yeah Ashton does not have a twin bro I know he's got a brother oh there it is hey go ask my brothers I think one of the things that I mean we were talking about in these the fucking athletes that we're dealing with today you know he talking with like what they're experiencing I think with medical science I bet like in 50 60 years we're gonna be looking back and they're gonna be going god damn and these people couldn't even take bla bla bla to fix their problem they couldn't even go to the bla bla bla machine to fix their brain and they just had to have bad brains like remember what Robert Sapolsky said in your podcast last time he said I thought was amazing he says we learned more what do you thinks gonna happen he said I think in like 20 30 40 years we're gonna go my god look at the way we treated people who killed and who did things that were impulsive they their brains were just fucked up and we didn't know how to fix him well not just that he he was not just talking about their brains being fucked up he was saying that the idea of free will is a ridiculous concept that's ingrained in the psyche of the American people in particular and that's a Christian yeah but it's also that you as a scientist the way he looks at things I mean he's boiling things down to the fuckin the the very atomic level and he's essentially saying that you are behavior has been determined by your environment by your genes by your the experiences that you've had by all the things that your prefrontal cortex may not develop because you grew up poor under a lot of stress you making decisions lack of nutrition they got the guy who kidnapped that girl I was talking about that the young girl had two kids with her when she was 13 for 18 years his father said that he had a motorcycle accident he was a normal kid and he had a motorcycle accident he was never the same he'd his whole personality that's the Kinison story the kid Johnson got hit by a truck Oh Kinnison was one kid Sam Kinison got hit by a truck and he's like do you know what changed your personality they say sometimes which is fascinating off in your own mouth almost almost that would be trying to change a person that would be traumatic for a little bit does a little tell you end up liking it but here's what really changes your get having a heart operation oh that makes sense now what was so weird though an operation on your heart and it changes your whole personality well there's one thing about that that dr. mark Gordon you know Mark Worman he actually did a paper on post-traumatic surgeries like open-heart surgeries and the effect it has on depression and perhaps suppression of your body's ability to produce hormones there's something about being under anesthesia for long periods of time with very complicated operations it leaves people uniquely depressed afterwards Wow yeah and he was he was telling me about this after the whole Robin Williams things happen because Robin Williams got sick he had a heart condition he had heart surgery and then he eventually wound up committing suicide and he's like I'm not saying it's the courts the reason why Robin Williams did that but there is absolutely some connection between this compromised hormonal system and depression and between a compromised hormonal system and long operations while under anesthesia I was like wow haven't you had a lot of guys on about the gut biome oh yeah and how that affects your mood from having people on from having Chris crecer on the last time he was on I changed I'm eating like four cans of kimchi a week oh really big ass cans man I mean fermented cabbage of course because you're an extremist do you have to eat that much saying no but listen to me look at me right now who are you dead lit just because fucking kimchi's good for you doesn't mean you have to eat that much brown all the time always you're the you're the extreme can you have a little bit like the way the Koreans do feel pretty good I know but yeah the fuckers got he gets it a big piece of information and he'll just eat I mean he bowls of kimchi yeah I played video games I fainted I fainted I never do that but that bone broth and Kim's of course you do of course you did I put habanero sauce in the bone brought a surprise I sweat beads of sweat coming off my bald had his pouring down of course and I'm eating spicy kimchi and our drinking some ice cream did you extremists mortality mortality is what he loves you find out until the lights go off this motherfuckers going good I'm gonna be dead so this he was young this engine is purring I'm cornering everything's listen if you don't think if you think I didn't have a long conversation with mr. Justin DS who is Phil Heath stranor was and he's a mr. Olympia guy he liked trains all those guys I talked to him for a lot I cut to the chase I go Phil finished me I do you Justin not Phil just Indies I go Justin right now came to my son saw like I go and his beautiful wife Heather DS is number four in the Olympia she and I won't kill you she looks amazing and I went oh hey bro let's cut to the chase you know everything about nutrition and everything about weight lifting there's no doubt about how to build muscle he's a fucking genius talk to you about TRT cuz I'm 50 and it's getting to a point where I'm gonna have to start shooting myself up what he said we had a long talk don't worry about it the point is I'll be seeing a doctor guys see me really Muslim no no you mentioned I'm not afraid not afraid you know first of all she's got a girl for a boyfriend other excuse she's got a husband yes wouldn't even talk about giant-man he's a very thick Rafat man Jaime's pulling up pictures of her hey bro I wasn't looking I was just looking at her back judged on it I'm looking back I'm looking at a mask of someone else but by slaves doesn't mean you have to you son of a bitch son of a bitch probably in the Orcas today we just lighted is the real problem with the social justice warrior movement as they eat their own to try to take away any sort of blame on themselves I just think the left the liberal left is not that just their sense of humor you can't even be funny you can't say anything I predict that this is the inevitable demise of a vast majority of the colleges in this country migrant and the people are eventually going to learn how to form communities and learn online Jonathan Hyde he's creating the heterodox Academy you know about this No so John is a fucking giant Jonathan Hyde I can't believe you have an avalanche podcast he's a giant he wrote the happiness hypothesis instantly fit in this room yes his brain might not though and he basically is a Columbia University and he was like this place you got fucking students that can report you blindly and you get called up in front of a whatever and he appropriate it's all it's 17 to 1 usually like 17 17 hardcore liberal sort of leftist and one conservative to every to these colleges like brown and Columbia and he said this is Orthodox thinking it's so bad that they've created safe spaces where you're not even allowed to hear the other side because it might be violent is my reading too much so he said I'm crazy is Jonathan height h8i DT you have to have my Darius he's a fucking he's a genius and he's awesome in every way and he's so important as a thinker he's been he's one of the more influential thinkers in the past thirty years yes basically proving that intuition and that your your feelings control so much your thinking he's a fucking genius a social scientist anyway that's my shout out to Jonathan Hyde I'm glad I had a chance to talk about him but powerful shout out to Jonathan hight yeah but he created the heterodox Academy he's like this Orthodox thinking is fucking you know is not good for anybody and what we talked about earlier it's people being tribal is X we need idea sex do you remember that thing at University of Missouri with that woman that guy was an Asian young student photographer and this woman came over and she was yelling at him to stop taking photographs because they had created a safe and then she said can I get some muscle over here to take this photographer out he's like this is like the First Amendment he was like I need freedom of speech freedom of the press taking photographs like there's an event that's happening on public property here like what do you I'm part of the school I'm being hired to do this because she's so she comes over to lysing them she's a woman she's protecting them she's not even a child child she's a professor in training well so crazy she's not very smart well she got caught up in the moment yeah you know I mean that's really what it is more than anything she probably thought she could get away with doing that she didn't realize how crazy it would seem on camera saying I've got some I want I need to get some muscle over here she get a rope so she shows she's thinking the same way those that are intolerant are thinking right she's say methodology her brain works the same way you're you're in the way yeah I'm gonna get you out of the way well Isis goes you're not a believer no point in trying to convert you I'm gonna shoot your cut your head off because you know it's the same one mentality you were totally right you're totally right same methodology yeah and it's also like she's in a heightened state right she's in the combat state she's immediately argumentative the guy's got a camera on her because anybody anybody who disagrees with or is rooted in evil and falsehood the enemy my racist sexist xenophobic and when you said when you hit somebody with racism you go you're racist or sex is what you do is you shut down the whole debate because you just you just labeled this very complex human being with all kinds of emotions right who goes through some days I'm having a moment I fucking hate everybody other days I love everybody I listen everybody then you hate black people then you raise them all but if I'm listening and rude a if I'm listen an or day I care about terrorists and their mothers everything you know it depends we all have moments but when you brand somebody what we do is we go you're a racist you said one thing so you're racist now I'm gonna inflate that I'm gonna blow that up like a big balloon and fucking strap it to your face and you are out of the conversation ever you're done for bail cuz you're my competition that's right that's right and your ideas your ideas might be threatening to me more important they're actually they create vile towards me therefore I need a safe space oh and by the way I have all the answers my side is rooted in the truth and love plus crabs in a bucket trying to push those other crabs down so I can make my way to the tippity tappity pile of crab metaphors goddammit best way to do it is to call other people racist that's it everybody's like what me what what you immediately get people on their heel what we're not racist what what you sexist tool yeah yeah yo yo we're tribal right you think there's a logical basis to sex and that is patriarchal in another uh-huh there's no biological basis for sex not hormones not XY chromosomes now uterus for saying that on ironically in 2017 they're saying it on a regular basis really yep yeah it's one of the jordan Peterson discussions that he had with some I don't know if was a man who became a woman or a woman became a man but she was a professor he oh I saw a professor of medicine no professor at University of Toronto professor in like transgender studies oh I saw the debate I was hilarious debate I know she's saying there's no sexual or bio there's no difference very popular misconception to think that there is a difference between a male and female this doesn't exist there was no biological basis for general okay but if you go to the puppy store and you say I want a boy puppy and they gave you a girl puppy what do you say you say well there's nobody that became a woman and was a competitive power lifter as a man and stop you right there because she is a woman she's always been a woman sorry don't be a piece of shit no she's a woman now no no no she's always been a woman just now she gets to express herself at the most unique way I see so before when she was even though she had an X Y chromosome a dick and she was competing in men's division she was still him she was a woman this is so transphobic I can barely handle this that's a question man she is her authentic self okay you get a lot of shit for your when you talk this way from only by people that are retarded yeah exactly I feel like most transgender people would be very reasonable and not be and it's had a bunch of transgender people come to see me at the ice house the other day they'll give me hugs they were super sweet I love that they said with the trans community loves you I go I love you guys like there's a lot of trans people by the way that we're upset at the whole Bruce Jenner Caitlyn Jenner on fiasco they like look this is not who we are like you're you just want more attention hey your Kardashian exactly big old male Kardashian became a chick settle them right you know there's a lot of people that felt sort of like also when they found out that Bruce Jenner then became Caitlyn Jenner and then after that didn't believe in gay marriage okay so fucking weird think we're done here yeah maybe you just crazy you can you can be a boy who wants to be a girl or a girl wants to be a boy it doesn't mean you're smart it doesn't mean you're smart and that's a problem that's a problem and if you're an intelligent person who's in the transgender community you don't want that as your ultimate representation don't you just don't you know once someone's got that much of a contradiction where they look and they asked him about it one of the most crazy things he said is like well I've always been a traditional work like what you're not traditionalist you're a man who became a woman that's not traditional yeah you don't believe in gay marriage because that's even dumber because what you're talking about you're changing biology and you're saying that some man-made bullshit fucking thing called marriage mmm that guy shouldn't be able to do it if they love each other but you should be able to be a girl right shut the fuck up that makes me angry it's making me angry it's so it's so I can't even I end up rubbing my eyes cuz I don't know how to I don't know how to respond to insanity it's the only time I've ever seen Ellen go after somebody really Ellen had Caitlyn Jenner on her show and she actually went after her and just notice how I said her not misgendering cuz I'm a good person yeah you are I'll vote Democrat if it works strange remember I said that on the podcast you were like bullshit I was like I'd heard it yeah you called it way before

golden grace I got your greatest in my arm hold my ball back too much gotta get stem-cell shots oh yeah yeah yeah I'm going crazy yeah good time wonderful time boxing shot gets mad at me for sparring but I just love it so much let it ride bitch let it ride I'm with you let it ride yeah did you see that that where Luke Rockhold punched me in the fucking nose yeah I don't want to do that and then and then I had to go get makeup to my nose was so black I'm the way to go I'm at the fucking San Jose improv I kind of take pictures I've this is ridiculous I couldn't cover it it was black and blue why'd you let him punch you I didn't it wasn't like hey Luke I was like obviously he threw me headgear and I go hey look listen to me right now I'm a gazelle right now and they're a bunch of lines out there let those people know like all those guys training that I'm I'm a bitch that I'm an actor fifty and I dance around a gym I've added ice par because I do it with people who are in athletic yeah it was way worse than that what's that what he hit you with he punched me with his fucking glove right in the nose that's when it was it wasn't even it got purple okay well why do you think it's cute to fight professionals well first of all I didn't want to I thought I was gonna hit mitts and he throws me headgear and I go I don't want to do this and Daniel Cormier goes I got him first and Cormier double legs me look at it look at that stupid nose they're gonna take pictures with ridiculous it didn't work you should just stick to just straight box and when you could school them with your skills oh yeah you know me fucking slit those jazz batbot that's the one of the worst things like why are you getting involved in jiu-jitsu that way you don't have to get hit I'm going yeah because this wrestling I miss mat work I really do miss first start doing jiu-jitsu way back when we were at Carlson Gracie's please you took to it right away and it was like oh this is over for a year I love jiu-jitsu I love it love it yeah I like boxing though I really like it's fun it's such a challenge to me like like like um obviously jiu-jitsu as a whole world and it's really difficult but there's something about boxing at my age I guess I like because it's it's I guess it's just such a mystery it's such a mystery Turner well you're learning a skill and yeah and on top of that you're also working out yes that's one of the fun thing is assign a sport like here's a good one soccer I'll give you play soccer you're gonna fucking run around a lot a lot but you're also gonna fuck your knees and I'm too old but boxing you actually stay pretty injury free believe it or not and you can get to the point yeah but you wear headgear you don't go crazy on each other I'm not fucking fighting you know do you know you get hurt when you spar do two don't box and they swing through the fences and they catch you if you fight dudes like that are really good like I'll spar Sinai's the great Wayne McCulloch I'll spar with him sometimes I got I'll get in there Wayne's fucking Wayne Wayne at44 is gonna do whatever he wants even though he's a hundred and thirty five pounds but it's worth moving around he'll hit me but it's not he's not going crazy exactly yeah exactly that's that's the best in jiu-jitsu - you get less hurt when you start with someone who's really good correct you don't win no you tapped a lot you know you won't get hurt he'll just control you and you learn patterns and in pretty soon you learn these patterns you start practicing then you go against a guy who doesn't box a lot and you look good like you know what you're doing yeah and he goes dude you've been doing a long time fuckin yeah program yeah look good you see my left what's funny is you can find so many can learn how to hit mitts it's where you punch him from yeah and what kind of like how are you setting that up that's and how are you not getting hit yeah what happened to the body that's the worst fucking worst that's why kickboxing is so much more terrifying and Muay Thai watch dudes getting need the body okay thank you that's watching John Wayne Parrs he had a video up on his Instagram of him fighting when he was 17 the first title then he won Charlie part is like 44 no Johnny parts my boyfriend's 41 41 and he's 41 and still going after it but like watching a video of him from when he was 17 years old me and some dude in the body yeah I don't have time to condition my shin the zoom 17 man not crazy 1993 the lines are crazy look at those needs of the body son is that him in the red yeah Johnny positive fuck Savage boom-boom-boom is a real fighter man yeah it's um it's a crazy way to express yourself you know but you really get to see a person's character in a fight the thing that's the thing that makes it so crazy it's just it's this wild melee of bones and flesh and you get to see how bright your star shines it's also really awesome to learn defense and learn how to get out of the way learn how to block your eyes open when somebody's kicking it's tough yeah problem-solving how to figure out what to do when yeah when the issues are that's it by the way I shouldn't but just so everybody knows I didn't spar with Luke Rockhold a punch in the face I got to move around and they were really nice to me and they they they move me around at will so let's not I hate when people like me say I sparred with sensei no you did to spar you didn't spar with them because they'd beat the fuck they'll fucking yes you moved around them and they were being cool and you got to throw some shit and do some stuff that you've learned and giggling yeah relax yeah if I had opened up with my Taekwondo debut soon dude my wheel kick you want no fucking sued I've seen it like sort of like when
