hello freak bitches but I feel a lot better doing this I'm gonna do the Kilimanjaro by the way on a barefoot well uh yeah man they're like some challenge I have a friend of mine who went to Bolivia he filmed he has a television show called meteor his name Steve Rinella he's a professional hunter and he went to Bolivia and he lived with the Chu monney for a couple weeks and he they brought them shoes like hey you know hey try these shoes on that they didn't want to have nothing to do with those shoes yeah stupid things out here yeah because those people walk barefoot everywhere and their feet he said their feet don't look like anybody's feet he's like they're all splayed out like their toes are splayed out and there's like a thick thick padding underneath you know where they're basically have their own shoes like the calluses on the bottom of their feet act as shoes Hey that doesn't sound too attractive for me to have you know attractive I mean to have feet like heart hmm no I what I do is using my mind so you don't want to have like calluses in the bottom you mean um what no I I got very soft baby feet so yeah yeah yeah my always tell that softy feet so you are gonna do this barefoot are you gonna wear ice shoes Elise no no nothing like that so you your challenges to go once again mind over matter mmm but what about frostbite ah yeah I did the half marathon barefoot you did beyond the polar circles in temperatures even far more below than the Kilimanjaro is is it do you think that's possible there's any benefit from the fact that you're walking so much or running and then your body's heating up and maybe that has a positive effect on your skin the thing is I'm very able to to go away and to tap into the hormonal system creating adrenaline you you know this fact where people are sometimes referred to they lift up a car a mother because a child is underneath that actually is the mind staring directly into the reptilian mode there the reptilian brain which is the primitive brain and there you have direct access to pure adrenaline makes you able to do almost inconceivable feet mm-hmm and accomplish it only you need a right trigger now because I have been so much into the cold cold is cold is a real power force our impact upon you so you need to learn how to connect with in with your mind and your breathing into the brainstem into this adrenaline to withstand this force the cold impact I've learned it so you're tapping in your brain you're causing your body to produce more adrenaline and you're focusing on the areas of your body that are contacting the snow like you're focusing on the bottom of your feet yes yes and it works you know I'm still able to look around heroin ice the sunset or the sunrise and ambi so there is a margin even there in we just need to go back to belief and believe therein means the neurotransmitters in the neurons those have signals and say charges so if you charge you your body then you are able to influence up till DNA level and we have proven this already with the aisle six interlude cleaners those connected to safe inflammation we could not find it off we could not suppress the site against the flam Ettore markers and we showed very effectively not me only a whole group of persons which I trained just in four days to be able to go into the DNA and create a right chemistry consciously by breathing and using the mind to fend off flama Tory Marcus caused by say a bacteria in inside so we are actually able to tap into the deepest of hours have control of adrenalin stress amount and go up to not only in the deepest part of the brain but also in the DNA
