[Music] there's a new band females and III do a fucking really shitty beatbox I'm feeling that money coming in already Brian we got a winning combination we need to put this shit on wax ready just the general experience it's brought to you by Annette calm that's onn eye tea makers of alpha brain shrimp export you can keep doing them and that's kind of fun just shrimp Tek immune new mood another favorite new mood is actually a 5htp and l-tryptophan supplement that aids your body in its ability to produce serotonin so it actually can make you happy this is one that is not to be taken by people that are on antidepressants though if you're on antidepressants apparently there's an issue with creating too much too much serotonin too much 5htp so you should be careful if you're on Serie B on SS artis don't don't take new mood but if you are not it's safe natural healthy you have to worry about it nothing dangerous all the supplements at new mood all of them have a the first 30 order of the first 30 pills first order have a 100% money-back guarantee you don't have to return anything you just say this shit didn't work and you get your money back the idea behind that is no one's trying to rip you off or only trying to sell you the very best supplements possible all supplements that I personally believe in all things that I took long before I ever got involved in on it I've been a vitamin junkie and a nutrition junkie for a long time because there's a there's a difference there's an unquestionable difference in how your body responds when you feed it good nutrients and you take care of it and there's a lot of science behind all this stuff especially nootropics there's plenty of studies that show benefits of nootropics and what working on our own now a double-blind placebo study and will let all the details it takes a long time to hook something like that up is it because they're all blind no that's just scientific method Brian this is it's not for boy he seems like it takes a long time for those double blinds yeah I don't think you understand what the fuck it means son anyway we also have kettlebells battle ropes if you use a codename Rogen you get 10% off any supplements the battle ropes and the kettlebells however that code doesn't work because we sell them literally as cheap as we can so go to on it user code named Rogan buy yourself some supplements you

posters for shows and all the information for t-shirt sales or any fucking fruits rich roll is here we're fin to get busy sending it down to the bottom of this thing the Joe Rogan experience when I did a podcast with Rob wolf who was the Paleo diet guy one of the first things that happened was that I got an immediate influx of vegans who had a set Rob wolf straight because Rob wolf said some crazy shit like I told him I drank a lake every morning and it makes me feel great gives me a lot of energy he's like no you gotta eat bacon and eggs you dick suck my truckers he was my superhero yeah he he said some awesome shit that you should have bacon eggs and coffee in the morning and that's a good way to get your day started a lot of people didn't want to hear that a lot of people fellow silly and you were one of the people that contacted me and then I looked up your story and it's a it's a pretty fascinating man you were you were like around 40 and you were out of shape yeah I mean I was I was I'd been an athlete in college I was swimmer in college but it kind of got away from me after that you know when when college is over that was kind of the end of that athletic chapter and you know life goes on and you know I went to law school and then it's just about the job and getting married and having kids and you know climbing the corporate ladder and all that kind of stuff and you know in the wake of that you know lost sight of being fit and being healthy and you know it was pretty much a couch potato depressed lethargic a little bit lost in life you know how it goes so yeah decided I had to take it back I had a little bit of a health scare that kind of triggered me to you know take did to do something about it and so what what action did you take specifically well I mean I wish I could you know say ran off to the library and got a bunch of books and you know read all the Paleo books and read all the vegan books and did a double-blind study with the right way to do it and you know that's not what happened I mean I I fumbled around for a while trying to figure out what would work for me but the the first thing I did my wife is like she's big into yoga healing and meditation and she's like you know she's constantly reading like crazy spiritual texts and you know she's pretty well schooled in alternative thinking and life style and all that kind of stuff and you know if you were to open the refrigerator is pretty clear like kind of food she was eating and what I was eating which was essentially crap so but she would do like a juice cleanse pretty much every year you know and that was fine for her but that was definitely not something that I was ever interested in doing but you know I was kind of desperate and I thought you know maybe uh maybe I'll try that and so I just sort of reached out to her and I said yeah I think I want to do that and she hooked me up with we got all these crazy herbs and you know we got a juicer and the whole thing and kind of dialed it in and you know I did that for like five days kind of a pervert not like the you know Hollywood a lot of people do like the cayenne pepper thing or yeah I mean that's like a starvation thing so it wasn't like that it was like I kind of weaned myself off food for a couple days and just did juice for a couple days and then kind of lean back into food but it was a pretty like eye opening experience you know like the first couple days I was like it was like I was in rehab man just like buckled over on the couch like like shit I could barely move what was your diet like before that like what was standard cheeseburgers yeah I mean she's you know fast food all the time and you know Domino's Pizza Pizza Hut Wendy's jack-in-the-box late at night coming home from work just it didn't matter and you know part of that was because when I was in when I was swimming in college you know I'm training like four hours a day and you're you know you're 19 20 years old or whatever and just it was just about how many calories gonna put down the throat and trying to fill myself a bright you know it didn't really matter and you know you can get away with that stuff yeah you know and I did for a long time but you know it catches up to you but those habits you know you form those habits they carry with you and they're you know they're hard to break yeah we really are a creature of habit that's it's a strange thing that even bad habits like gambling like people they've become gambling addicts it really is some sort of like a like a like a hijacking of your reward systems and or sure giving you this this rush towards something that there really doesn't any sense and there's also the comfort factor that comes in repeating patterns it's like your brain knows how to do it it's done it before let's stop fucking around just keep doing the same shit you've been doing and just you know blow off the gym and take a nap and go beat off and you know just do do the same stupid shit you've been doing it's really hard for people to like to move away from that yeah you get these like cemented pathways in your brain and it's just your default like I think you you know when with certain behavior patterns after a while you don't even know you're doing it you're just like it's like your program like a computer you just follow that pattern every time change is hard man it is hard and it's it's also it's hard to find a healthy meal at like fucking Burger King or Jack in the Box it's hard to go in there and really get some nutrients yeah I mean you like you look you like you got a salad you got a salad over there and you look at the salad like oh Jesus it's all like iceberg lettuce it's all will turd and everything's closed early here in LA so if you're working late and coming home like sometimes it's the only option Subway's here yeah yeah subways though that's you know all that stuff that they can keep on a shelf for that long yeah none of that is good for you so much it's way better I would have you imagine if you just got a chicken sandwich or like on whole-wheat or something like that yeah the drive-thru isn't more drive-through Subway's if they even have any at all but that would be perfect this dude's talking to you about like some serious fucking vegetable nutrition I mean I can't imagine the produce that like subway there's such a huge corporation you're getting the low rent you cannot fuck with in-and-out burger man if you had like some like really sexy tofu lettuce wrap thing you're selling but right next door is in an out burger you're doomed son it's tough man it goes back to those pathways you know you know you know you smell it it's like a pheromone yeah it's powerful it also goes back to the fact that in and out is fucking delicious yeah that's a problem too you can't deny that shit's delicious man I did it for years and years and years yeah especially in and out those fresh burgers so much better than burgers it like you know someplace where they nuke it didn't they just have like a little of a scandal there though with some other meat did they screwed up yeah I thought I remembered reading something about that no no crotch roll this might be vegan propaganda yeah probably wasn't like the zen curators maybe I don't want the death squad coming down on me my Twitter already exploded you ever wanna go to war you know you just rallied a true what we're trying to build armies that's why we're selling kettlebells we're selling kettlebells and battle ropes and selling vitamins and brain pills and and subscribing to youtube videos the yeah you were right there in and out burger the plant got closed by a USDA supplied or rather the yeah the the for the inspectors temporary shutdown California meat company that provided the beef for the popular in and out burger chain ill that's not good no propaganda here man and also the item of course I'm just I just it's always good to have the information if I say things all the time and I need to check them so I do it when anybody else has something to but the US school lunch program they also provided food for them if you're sourcing that much beef you know you're a huge company like that you're gonna have a problem like that from time to time yeah there's a lot of cows involved in that not like what is it what are the numbers and something like that oh no it's got to be enormous Diane Sawyer looks pissed as fuck there's the last person you want on TV no Nancy Grace is the last person you want to take talking shit about you angry faced but like how many cows do you think they use like just in and out a small chain like in and out how many do they use a day yeah woah really stop and think about that it's like the Holocaust of cows over there well you know what it is man we figured out how to make this society work without people hunting if you like least this this weird notion that we have a zero connection with how the food is gathered like that's a really fuckin crazy way to live so everybody's like yeah I'd like me yeah I'd like me you don't have to do any of the the stuff that makes you respect the animal you know to hunt it down you have to kill enough to like be thankful that you got it and bring it back there's none of that anymore the system is set up to prevent you from thinking about it yeah it's almost like grocery stores in a certain way it's analogous to like a Vegas casino where you know the casinos I don't know they're pumping the air-conditioning in there's no clocks you can't find the exit door it's disorienting in the same way like a grocery store everything's perfectly packaged it looks clean or what you know you're not you're not supposed to think about that I was at a grocery store that has a butcher shop in the back and they were sawing through a side of beef and you don't really see that you know you really rarely see that you know you would do usually you get is you get like you know then you have these packages and the steak is very nice and wrapped down and you go this one is a full pound that's a good sized steak I'll take that home no no this dude has saw and he was running meat through this so I was like yeah that's real life son that's that's our body it's not like a steak now there's a body that has to get chopped up and become sex and we're so separated from that that actual experience of that you know that seeing the animal lose its life and understanding what it means to eat it we're completely separated I mean really straining imagine if your job was the guy in the slaughterhouse like doing that he's cutting the throats or what I mean that's kind of mad emotional it's gotta be madness it's got to be madness all day you're seeing terrified animals and you're giving them the very thing that they're terrified of the terrified of losing their lives this is fucking horrifying yeah it's weird man and I think you know you know I think you can appreciate this as a deep thinker but you know food is energy man it carries a vibration and so when you put something in your mouth and you know you're making a decision to take that vibration into you and so you know what what is that vibration you know when you're taking in a terrorized animal does that affect you is that does that change your perception your decision-making your outlook does it not I don't know it's a very good question the you know the the solution though it seems to be it's not as simple as don't eat meat because even if you don't eat meat what are you gonna do with all these fucking cows are you gonna stop them from breeding are you gonna let them starve and die-off are they gonna go extinct like how we gonna regulate these cows you're either gonna shoot them or you're gonna castrate a bunch of them you're gonna have to shoot some of them because otherwise you're gonna have cows wandering through the streets everywhere like you got to deal with the fact yeah we have to deal the fact that you've created a species you know essentially we've bred cows to this domestic form from wild cows and you know it's we've done it for so long that they're pretty much helpless without us it'd be mad cows yeah there's no predators out there it's not like we live in fucking Africa and there's lions running around they could take care of the cow problem it's not gonna happen well you would have a real problem with cows if we stopped eating them just the fucking sheer numbers that exist now I mean unless you could absolutely keep them from breeding and then you would have to figure out what we're gonna do you're gonna just let the old ones die you're gonna let some of them breed you know what you gonna do no it's not a solution but the vegan solution of not eating the meat at least removes karma from your position it moves it removes you from interacting with the terrified animals last moments and to do for you to be I don't say profiting benefiting from that well I don't know I mean I'll you know I just speak to my own experience you know and I know I feel better I feel you know more energized I feel like my energy is even and good my my mood and my outlook is positive and and I think that you know when you when you talk about vegan and the word vegan and what that means I mean that means different things at different people you know it's a tricky word it's you know what it means so a lot of elbow well what it means fuck you know in me it means you you run the high risk of them being annoying it doesn't mean that they're not a lot of vegan friends that are awesome mac danzig is a vegan he's a great yeah and he's by the way he's gonna be on the podcast tomorrow again we we fucked up and big disaster I can't wait for this park is just so my Twitter feed like Brian still be a lazy fuck yeah people are so silly you know no max a great guy he's an awesome guy and he's nobody you know he's got his reasons and they're intelligent reasons for being a vegan however there are a few people that do it as like a sanctimonious starting point they do it as like you like they they cook they're claiming a moral high ground with this new position and they've lawn it and it's like really you know really annoying self-satisfying kind of in-your-face way it's it's defeatist for what they're trying to say is yeah and I think that that yeah it's a very emotionally charged word food in general as well be religious talking about food in general is emotionally charged I mean just look at you know the Twitter fee is gonna explode over this and you know barometer of that but you know it's right up there with religion and politics it really is and when you say vegan it immediately you know people snap into a preconceived idea of what that is and what that means and they have a visual image of a person in their mind you know it's a guy with dreadlocks kicking a hacky sack up in Humboldt always blowing a guy yeah I mean whatever it is somebody has that image so that word you know is and and people have different reasons for getting into it you know you have the people who are into it for the compassion and the saving the animals that's a very different crowd and attitude from the people that get into it for health reasons or because they don't want a heart attack or whatever yeah and and you know they both I guess are technically vegans but they're also you know very different and just because you choose not eat meat or whatever doesn't does that mean that you're automatically a Democrat or you know what is your political point of view and all of these things get woven together and it and it makes it it makes it challenging you know to even talk about it with an open mind I think yeah it is a quite interesting situation and there is the very real issue the fact that we are at the top of the food chain and when you're at the top of the food chain it bears some responsibility and you can you know we're the only animals that can really decide and choose how to alter other animals lies like on purpose and figure out how to do it and when you look at how we choose to do it if you look at like Food Inc and you see Factory farming and stuff like that it really is a is a it's a damning statement about like where we're at like spiritually like as a race like we're getting away with this really heinous shit because we can because it's easy to just not pay attention to it and that's uh that's that's the worst case scenario like the best case scenario you would think they have it set up so these animals live like they're on an open prairie and they all just live a natural life and then you call them from the herd when you do it you do it you know easily so they live a natural life no different than any other cow in a large environment where they get to roam around eat grass instead of being force-fed corn and and then you just kill them I mean that's like the best-case scenario if you're gonna eat cows but the way we do it is it's pretty damning that human beings in the idea of maximizing profit have decided to run these ridiculous places where you're packing pigs right next to each other in these little boxes and you see the chickens all stuffed in together with each other and pecking at each other it's fucking gnarly man we yeah when you see food in can you see the chicken coops it's pretty that's pretty disturbing too wrong you know and make that connection because you know it's easy to go well chickens you know chickens the healthier option or whatever and then you see that it makes you it makes you think twice but I also think you know we've created the system that ultimately is not sustainable I mean like an insane amount of our agriculture goes to you know produce grain to feed these it's a feed livestock like something like ninety percent or something really it's crazy hot crazy high and and you know with and then and then it it you know brings up all the ecological arguments about greenhouse gas ISM oh fart up a fucking storm those goddamn animals ruined India do you know they do they fucking they cause global warming no bullshit farting yes dude it's not bullshit it sounds silly but they fart so much you're dealing with in India you have so many fucking cows but they really have pollution issues because of cow farting in the air I heard that grass-fed farts even more really yes we're oh that's hilarious well that makes sense because India would be much more grass fed right and they're the ones who have the big issue but they also have the issue that they don't kill cows or or at least the Hindus do you apparently can buy beef in India it's not uncommon it's just there's a huge group of them that won't fuck with the cows is that why they don't wear deodorant so it smells like the owner or armpits more than poop and farts although you know like it's like you're better yeah maybe your own body smells yeah cancel out the shit smell in the air yeah that's like way better than fucking shit yeah man that's like the worst case scenario is like you're living around animals who stink up the air constantly with their fart gas and you can't kill them cuz dog farts are fucking nasty like so a big cow farts that's way I'd be sniffing our hands all day long you're hungry and you know there's people starving and they just let these delicious cows just wander around how the fuck did that ever happen I don't know I think he goes back to religion what a bunch of silly bitches they are in India that is though one of the silliest choices ever what do you want to do you want to starve to death or going to eat these fucking delicious cows let's just sit around smell their farts and complain and have more people's cultural mores though I mean there are there are cultures that think that we're insane for having dogs in our houses sure yeah it's interesting how we just sort of adopt a pattern of behavior based on our surroundings and what's existed in that area yeah the Indians I guess what is the the cow is sacred in the Hindu culture so what is God or something like that or relatives come back to life or something yeah well no when I worked at an Indian company I had a steering wheel up my knee my ex-girlfriend used to share a car and her steering wheel cover it was a cow print right and they saw me drive up to that and I had a meeting and they told me to please remove that from their steering wheel because they have they respect cows wise yeah real an Indian company was called the software people oh wow well you showed up with like murdered skin you know just be nice yeah yeah it's gotta be weird what a strange thing to just choose to really worship lock-ons in it just but it shows you I mean that's what they did in India you know he ate someplace else it was Buddha someplace else it was Jesus it's we're so fascinating when it comes to that human beings are really really bizarre animals so your your story was that you were an athlete and then you got unhealthy and then you had a little bit of health scare so that's when you decided to go vegan yes so I did so I did that juice cleanse and then you know by that by the fifth day of that I just felt unbelievable you know like my energy level was through the roof and all I've been doing it was drinking like fruit and vegetable juice and drinking this like beetroot broth and some teas and stuff like that and and it was it was amazing because I had I had abused my body for so long with terrible food and terrible lifestyle and I'm also recovering alcoholic so you know I used to drink like a shitload you hit it on both ends yeah I was hitting it I was hitting it hard like I just you know I did not treat myself well and the idea that like within five days I could feel that good like I didn't know that I could feel that good or I hadn't felt that good in 15-20 years it's pretty amazing you know the body is like incredibly resilient hmm you know when you treat it right so when I was done with that I thought well what am I gonna do you know like I wanna I want to keep feeling this good like but I don't know you know I don't know what to do next and you know again I wish I'd gone out and you know read a bunch of books or something but I just thought maybe I'll try a vegetarian diet like I didn't do any education or research but I just it just seemed like well that sounds you know healthy or healthier than what I'm doing but kind of coming from an addiction perspective and a recovery perspective like I went to rehab 14 years ago and so a lot of like the way like I served rewired my brain and the way I think is kind of in the context of addiction and recovery it just seemed like something I could wrap my brain around because you're either eating meat or you're not you know it's very it's very black and white just like you're using drugs and you're drinking or you're not you know you're either sober or you're using you know and so that made more sense to me then hey I'm gonna eat better like I'm just gonna eat healthy and go to the gym because it's so vague like I don't know what that means you know maybe I would for like a week or two but I would definitely fall back into you know my regular old behavior pattern so so I started doing that but it wasn't long before you know I'm looking for the loopholes or whatever because you can eat like shit on a vegetarian gut you can eat like shit on a vegan diet so you know I could I could eat Pizza Hut cheese pizza and get nachos and you know eat McDonald's french fries and I'm a vegetarian right so certainly you know that wasn't working but I did that for like six months and of course you know didn't lose any weight I was about 50 pounds heavier than I am now and you know it was kind of back on the couch and lethargic and I was ready to just bag it but I thought you know I wonder what would happen if I just kind of went that extra step and got rid of the dairy and cut out the processed foods and I didn't really think it would make a difference like I almost did it to prove that it wouldn't order like you know prove to my wife that it wouldn't work you know so I could kind of keep doing what I was doing and be guilt free about it but so I tried that and within a week like I was back to that energy level that I felt when I did the Klan's like my energy level is through the roof like it was so high that I could only sleep like a couple hours a night and I was like bouncing off the walls really yeah I really did it Wow they made a huge it made a huge difference and I think getting rid of the dairy made a much bigger like not eating the meat wasn't that hard for me but getting rid of the dairy in my diet that was a lot harder like that was almost like another detox you know of like because dairy and so many foods so and I crave it man you know I love it so it was very difficult to kind of break that do you have cheap days I don't have cheat days so your your attitude is essentially the same attitude that you have about like recovery yeah because this well that's the thing like I know you know like Tim Ferriss is big on the cheat day with his slow carb and all of that and it seems to work for a lot of people and it makes sense for me like for me it's about I it goes back to like the addiction model because I I do crave this stuff man and I know if I had a cheeseburger like once a week like I'd start eating cheeseburgers all the time because it would you know you break the cycle and now I don't think about it that much everyone smile smell it and it smells good to me but I don't go around like creating it all the time but if I was to have it every once in a while then you're kind of you keep you're still kind of like fertilizing that little seed I respect that Anthony Bourdain loves pork so much he loves pork so much that they gave him the option of quit eating pork or take medicine to lower your blood pressure and your cholesterol rather and he took the medicine said I'll take the fucking medicine I need pork ya talked about another show yeah like being addicted to food and for him it's a fork fatty pork he's willing to sacrifice telehealth yeah cuz he likes to eat pork I mean that's that's pretty heavy man fucking intense yeah and I don't know how good that anti cholesterol medication is for you is that okay for a statins I mean you know there's a lot there's there's plenty of side effects from that I mean their house or a crazy number of people that are on these drugs and it's amazing the extent to which the the health care system you know the doctors just you know they just need your prescribe this stuff and they're not that educated about nutrition whether it's paleo or vegan or whatever it's not really part of the medical school curriculum I'm sure I've been shocked talking to doctors about nutrition I've been shocked to having conversations with very very few or that it's not their fault like you know they're studying all sorts of stuff and you know maybe there's an elective here or there like one required course that they have to take but they're not really that schooled and and in our system where we're sort of grown and raised to believe that you know doctor knows best and you go to the doctor and the doctor knows everything and it's kind of alarming and eye-opening to realize that that's not necessarily the case at least with respect to nutrition there should certainly be a doctor of nutrition that you go to a doctor who is a full-fledged doctor at the top of you know all the information that's available today he's on top of all of it and his job is just to check your blood and and give you a detailed write-up of what's wrong with you nutritionally you know what so you don't have any b12 in your body you don't have this in your body you don't you're missing niacin you know whatever it is that he could show you what your optimum levels of your various nutrients should be very very very few people you know ever get that done no and they do exist but that should be part of your physical yeah it should be a it should be a regular thing because for you know I talked about on the show all the time how much it changed me when I when I started drinking kale shakes in the morning and I'm not vegan I still I drank milk I still eat meat but in in massively increasing the amount of plant nutrients I get into my body and especially it seems like starting my day with them that I usually I don't eat like right when I wake up I like to exercise sometimes or just get up and do some stuff and then I'll eat and my first meal is always really light it's always either some sort of a hemp protein shake or it's this this kale shake thing that I have but the difference is the kale shake gives me this fucking steady energy like I can feel my body responding to the nutrients like you can literally feel it and there's no the only negative about it at all is you have to shit more but that's just like cleaning out your pipes and you actually look forward to it because they're they're wonderful these poops are like a ride like we you can feel it you can feel it in the way that you know like when you have that first cup of coffee and you can feel your spine getting tickled it's like a similar thing I mean it jacks you up I could not live without the Vitamix I mean it's man it's an amazing creation we got a town we bring it with we like travel with it you're an animal you're an animal it's good for your part of your life I mean it's amazing it's it's a heavy thing cuz it's it's expensive I mean things like 500 bucks 450 bucks or whatever it's it's a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people to tell them they ought to get one but it's a motherfucker that's you have it your red can't imagine yeah it's a motherfucker it's it's a beast that thing's amazing it's such a great thing just stuff everything in there and plunge it and then just turn that bitch on whoa whoa what was that like well I had a bunch of other stuff for you that's wrong isn't that the poison that's got like nitrates in it or something crazy like it has its fucking nuclear it's like those sneakers that light up when you step on them there is that stuff it's that's I wouldn't recommend doing it all the time I just wanted to see that the point is that I couldn't believe that it was so powerful that it could actually blend that yeah for folks who don't know what a Vitamix is it's essentially a really high powered blender that's designed to make like vegetable smoothies but it also has like a top with a hole in it and you have like a plunger and the plunger drops down to like right above the blade so it shoves everything into the blades and matches it's incredible it never breaks the fucking thing they're they're indestructible like a world war two relic kind of thing ya know even the design of it looks like it's been around forever have you I think I tweeted you this did you have you tried putting beets in there no with the kale no I have it my recipe is so fucking good I I don't want to mess with it too much that I messed with there by chain beets does sound good by change hairs to pineapple put like a half a bead in and the beet greens because the the nitrites is it nitrites or nitrates I always get that wrong or whatever it's been shown to have like a significant impact on the efficiency of your oxygen utilization like it really it's a it's an it's a pretty significant like energy booster Wow okay so the notice of greens as well yeah you put the greens in and then it'll turn everything red like even if you put a tiny amount of betta in the hole shakable in red and it's you know you want to put some other stuff in there because it has kind of a heavy taste but but you'll notice a difference alright definitely I would definitely I'll try that shit tonight the same way that cordyceps work because you know the cordyceps are so good at boosting your oxygen uptake and has a similar effect I mean the cordyceps are crazy it's amazing you know yeah but that's what the main ingredient of shrimp export is and I take four of those before jiu-jitsu class and even if I'm you know I have been training recently like it's amazing how much more energy you have yes mate it's like a significant feeling of like an extra little boost that you have it's like you've been training at altitude and then you come down to sea level yeah like you feel like you don't get winded you don't go into the same way that's for sure and people who have gone to altitudes like you had to change altitudes rapidly like move up to Boulder like real quick and that normally would have issues with that they've found that if they take cordyceps mushrooms it can can settle them in settle them in quicker because for a lot of people that altitude sickness is no fucking joke I've read this thing about babies being born in Colorado that like a record number of babies are born prematurely like in Colorado because the the high altitude but it totally makes sense like that's a harder way to live though the whole thing is tougher oxygen utilization is fucking everything man that's everything it's everything and it's in beats beats man check it out she got some rhubarb while you're at it Jo awesome so you don't do you miss me at all do you miss the smell like if you have a neighbor who's barbecuing and you yeah had nightmares about to Fogo de Chao human being you know like yeah you know eat that stuff for a long time I like it you know I like the smell with it I mean I there are certain vegan people that will say disgust them or whatever and you know but I'm sure it does or whatever but for me I smell it it smell that's my problem smells good I Drive by jack-in-the-box I think that smells good I mean and it's yeah see that's think that's like my problem that's why I can't have a cheat day for me yeah I understand so how did you get involved in endurance athletics what happened there it was another kind of you know weird like organic thing that just evolved over time I mean when I when I got on the plant-based diet I started exercising again you know mainly because I just had all this energy I had to burn off like I did I didn't have any designs on going back to being an athlete or being competitive in anything I just wanted to lose a little weight I wanted to be able to enjoy my kids at their energy level you know I've four kids now so mmm it was really just about you know connecting with that part of myself that I kind of lost touch with but nothing crazy you know I would go to the pool and swim a couple times a week and you know do a light jog here and there my wife bought me a bike for my birthday I'd never really ridden a bike before and this was when I turned 40 but then I had like a an experience after I'd been doing this for maybe four months or something like that if really moderate exercise I went out for a morning run out at you know where Mulholland Drive the dirt road part of it that dumps out at the bottom of Topanga on the valley side so there there's trail there cooking you can literally go like all the way to Brentwood right goes forever and I just went out there one morning on a weekday for a morning run and just you know you have those days I'm sure you have it in jiu-jitsu where you just feel unstoppable like you can just keep going forever now you start running and I just felt amazing you know I just kept going and going I don't have to be back you know I'm gonna keep going going and I end up running like the better part of a marathon you know like I think 24 miles or something like that that morning excuse me and I got back and I just was like what is going on gee that's um Forrest Gump she yeah it was it was a real I mean I'd never been a runner you know it's not like I had a background in running or you know had any proficiency in it really and it wasn't like I was going fast that day either but it was just the idea that I could keep going and I thought something's going on here you know I don't know whether it's the nutrition change or I've just unlocked some dormant gene inside me but you know this felt good you know and then I was like I'd like to you know challenge myself and then I started looking for something to do and you know when you're 40 it's like you know what's the bucket list item or what's the midlife crisis thing you want to do and started thinking about doing an Ironman because that's a that's pretty typical goal for a 40 year old guy wants to you know conquer Mountain or whatever and and started trading a little bit more and more and I didn't know anything about triathlon I didn't know anything about Ironman or anything like that but I figured it seems like there's those Ironman races are like every weekend somewhere I'm like tons of people are doing it it can't be that hard to get in when I'll just pick a city you know a ways out and you know train for it myself and I went on the website one day and realized that that they all sell out like a year ahead of time like they're like you two tickets like the after the day after one of those races the next day stration and they just sell out like in a couple hours so I couldn't get into any of those and and it's like well you know what am I gonna do and nothing seemed to excite me and I kind of lost my mojo for a little bit but I was at Shyama juice one morning like maybe a month after that experience getting a juice and you know how they have those like competitor magazines that you see in like running shoe stores or whatever like running shoe reviews or whatever just laying around and I picked it up and started looking at it and there was an article about this dude named David Goggins who's this badass Navy SEAL guy like guy had been like a football player and a power lifter like big strapping guy I think he was up he had weighed like 275 pounds at one point and had seen some shit you know as a Navy SEAL and had lost a lot of friends in in action and he decided that he was gonna go he was gonna find the 10 most difficult endurance races in the world and do them all to like raise money for it wasn't the Wounded Warriors foundation but it was something like that like like you know so that he could raise money for the families of these these friends of his that had fallen and he had he had just done this race called bad water which is a hundred and thirty-five mile run through Death Valley that goes up like Mount Whitney at the end like this and it's like crazy hot like 110 120 degrees out in the desert and he had just done really well in that and he had never really done much endurance sports before that like he literally had like fallen into it and and just put in an incredible performance and then like a month later he did this race called ultraman which is this insane double Ironman distance race in Hawaii where over the course of three days you circumnavigate the entire Big Island of Hawaii which is like a big islands like the size of Connecticut right so I was reading about this and it just seemed like such a cool event like it not only was it longer than Iron Man which I didn't think was possible it was broken up into stages so the first day is a 6-point to my lotion swim followed by a 90 mile bike and the last part like the last 20 miles of that bike you go up to volcano National Park so it's like a 4,000 foot gain and the second day you ride 170 miles around the eastern side of the island like up through Hilo and you end up in this little town called havi on the third day you run fifty 2.4 miles double marathon from havi back into Kona where the race started and I was like what is this and it was cool because they limited it to just 35 like invitation-only competitors like you had to apply to get into this race they don't close any of the roads and it was almost like this family affair we have to bring your own crew and they kind of like take care of you and feed you out of a fan while you're doing this race and the crews kind of help each other out and the competitors help each other out so it's a race but it it seemed almost like this crazy spiritual Odyssey you know like this experiment in expansion you know much more than a race and I was like that was what I was looking for you know it wasn't like I was looking for a race to go see how fast I could go or how many guys I could be like it resonated with me because it seemed more like an opportunity to learn more about myself in a way that was unique you know what I mean like it was like this crazy down the rabbit hole like spiritual adventure and so she's captivated me and I was like up it was one of those things where you know when you come across something and something just clicks inside you and you know like that's the direction you're supposed to go in or you're on the right path or you know maybe you've had that and stand up or at some point in your life where you just feel like you're directed in a certain way mm-hmm you know where everything just kind of seems in alignment it was like I just knew I was gonna do that race like I just I didn't know how and I hadn't done anything of note you know to merit getting into it or anything like that but I was like I'm gonna find a way to do that like I've got to do that and I couldn't stop thinking about it and I ended up calling up the race director and it was some months before you could even send in your application because I was like I couldn't stop thinking about it and I needed to like just if she was gonna tell me like there's no way I was getting in then I could at least like put that to bed so I just call her up and said you know I read about this race and I can't stop thinking about it and I'd really like to do it but you know maybe I'm crazy because you know I don't know why I'm even calling you because I haven't really done very much you know and she said well what have you done anything fairly you know fairly you know I'm just getting back into being fit again and she had every reason to just say well you know want you call me in a couple of years and you know we'll see what you've done that and maybe I'll let you into this race but she was like well listen you know means a lot that you called early and why don't you just touch base with me in a couple months and we'll evaluate your training and we'll go from there so she kind of like left a crack in the door open you know so it was enough to like give me a little bit of hope like the pilot light was lit a little bit and I was like I'm gonna get into that race you know I'm gonna find a way to get into that race and I hired a coach and I start training as if I was already in this is back in early 2008 and I mean it's a long story but ultimately she ended up were landing and letting me in and I ended up doing that race in 2008 and I hadn't done an Ironman before that I tried to do a Half Ironman the year before and I didn't even finish so you know I wasn't going in with some crazy like endurance pedigree so it was it was it was a cool experience though and I ended up doing pretty well in that race how well did you do I got 11 that year wow that's amazing you couldn't finish and then a year later you get 11th I had 11th in 2008 and then and and at that time like we were like the Bad News Bears like I had no idea what I was doing like my dad came out to help me crew and a couple buddies from out here and none of us knew anything about anything and and I just wanted to finish you know and I just wanted to like not die so I I approached it like very conservatively but I needed up exceeding my expectations so I thought you know I wonder what would happen if I spent a year like preparing to go back and actually race it you know rather than just trying to finish and kind of being timid about it so for 2009 I trained my ass off and I went back and and I ended up getting out I got out of a swim with a 10-minute lead on the next guy and I held that lead for the rest of that day through that 90 mile bike so I finished the first day with the 10-minute lead on the field ten minutes holy shit huge lead going into day two if that was a race car that would be ridiculous he was crazy because I didn't see anyone else all day you know what cuz I was out in front and my wife and my kids were occurring me actually so I was like I have havin to kind of like tell them what to do and they were great but it wasn't like they had experience with anything like this which made me very nervous so what does a crew person that I do well they're in a competitor has to bring a van and that van is filled with like all your shit man so you got to have all your food that you're gonna eat like while you're racing and then and then afterwards and then you know ice for ice baths afterwards and they're filling your bottles and feeding them you know feeding me you they kind of leapfrog you in park and then you do bottle handoff so you always have nutrition on the bike and and they keep you make sure you don't take any wrong turns like they're in charge of navigating and just you know and if you have anything mechanically goes wrong with your bike or whatever extra parts so and it's filled with all your clothes because you're going around the island you're not going back to where you started that day you're gonna stay in a different place each night so you have to have all your stuff with you so these vans are like packed from floor to ceiling with stuff Wow is that much involved in racing yeah logistically it's very it's it's it's there's a lot that goes into it to pull it off and everything now is there does everybody know how to apply nutrition to these races is it like consensus or do some people try to do them without eating there's no way you can do it without eating yeah you got to be taking in I mean the consensus is you got to take in about two to three hundred calories an hour and everybody's stomachs different and the intensity with which you're you're going will depend upon how well you can digest the food like if you're on the rivet and going hard can be harder to digest calories and the kind of calories become more important because you can't you're not gonna be able to eat solid food if you're hammering you know what I mean what do you what do you do you eat fruits so I eat and what I eat is probably different than then certain other everybody has their own thing I like to stay away from the sugar like a lot of endurance athletes run or whatever you know usually kind of Gatorade II kind of stuff like the sytem ax and the that kind of stuff the real high sugar stuff mm-hmm but when you're going all day like you're gonna be out on the race course for eight or nine hours and then you got to do it the next day your system can't handle that so I try to eat a more like a lower glycemic higher carbohydrate fuel source so they have this stuff called carbo pro or something called Perpetuum they're like molto dextran powders so it's it's a like a low glycemic kind of carp complex carbohydrate fuel source and you can put like 900 calories in one bottle and you can kind of step up that it's like pancake batter it tastes terrible huh but Ollie tally bananas I'll put like lightly baked yams or good dates are good and well how come only lightly baked because if they're overcooked that like fries a lot of the nutrition out of them but you want to soft enough like there's they're almost like you can squeeze them into your mouth they're easy to digest when you're riding bike you know and they have mostly real nutrition in them yeah they're great for nutrition yeah what is it that kills them to me if it breaks down the tissue like that hakama it doesn't kill the nutrition if it makes it all soft and mushy well you just don't if you if you if you like completely fry it and overcook it then it becomes like a dead thing right do they know like exactly what temperature it down yeah I mean somebody probably does sometimes yeah I've always wondered that about like cooking like killing vitamins like it when like they say if you lightly saute it you're yeah sure you know like right what what level does it is it really that bad iam raw then we have to fucking jazz everything up with with fire and hot metal yeah I know well were the only animals that cook our food right we're also the only animals with TVs the only animals that drive cars were the only elves at all let each other how good shit tastes when you cook it we talk to each other dude fucking shit tastes good when you go VIN that is the problem it does taste better like like you know there's there's even vegetable dishes or two absolutely delicious because they're cooked you know yeah but that's just not as good for your body well I don't know I mean it seems like there's differing schools of thought on that I mean I think that you know you have the really hardcore raw foodist so just eat everything raw and certainly I think it's it's it's great to eat lots of raw foods you know what I mean like the raw foods you put your in your Vitamix or whatever and I eat a lot of raw foods but I still eat cooked foods you know right just for the like the feeling of it right comfort food you know do you eat pastas at all I'll eat brown rice pasta like the gluten-free kind CQ Lia rebel zekiel easy kill bread too yeah yeah yeah I mean I try not to overdo it on the pasta usually have more like brown rice stuff instead brown rice steamed veggies saw tape and top it off with a coca-cola or perhaps a Pepsi Cola a red ball do you take it in the caffeine would you what are your thoughts on that I've gone back and forth on caffeine I've gone periods without it and then I've used it as well I think that you know when you're using it compulsively and addictively it's not a good thing and Fries your adrenals and makes you tired ultimately I think a cup of coffee in the morning is not the worst things but particularly for an athlete it means definitely a performance enhancer like if I'm going out for a long bike ride you know a nice little strong cup of coffee before my ride definitely I can definitely feel the difference but yeah I think it you know you can't be just hammering coffee I like a nice cup of coffee before a podcast and a nice cup of coffee before jujitsu you like to get a little but it's really a crutch it is it is this week but I've gone periods when I when I don't you know drink coffee at all and I feel fine and you know that I'll lapse back into drinking it from time to time well I during periods of heavy writing I will drink a lot of fucking coffee and I had one day where I was working on this this piece and I was up to like five o'clock in the morning just just wired with coffee and then the next day I tried no coffee and boy was that a trip like I had a headache all day like my body was like dude let's just have a cup of coffee let's just feed the demon just feed demon give it a little it's like I was like I got to be careful like this is how you get addicted to that powerful drug yeah and I was setting I was setting the stage for addiction that was like Ghostly I had a headache like I didn't I didn't want to not have the caffeine yeah you know so I just was taking too much and it was over a course of a few days where I was like really hitting it hard writing you know yeah be careful fucking I had headaches I had withdrawals but I found that a really strenuous exercise like if I have ever anything wrong with me if I have jet lag if I'm just a little out of it from landing somewhere I can't shake the cobwebs loose just really intense strenuous exercise just seems to reset the whole yeah snaps you right back snaps your right back I really I really feel bad for people who don't exercise who try to travel a lot because I hear people tell me that they're fucked up for like two weeks and yeah I don't think that's crazy I've been traveling a lot lately and that's the only thing I don't sleep great in hotel rooms and just you know that first night in a new environment or whatever it's always a little off and you know the first thing when I get there just I've got to work out or whatever it's that's exactly what it is you got to wipe the slate clean and then it just it really helps with the jetlag and sleep and acclimating and everything yeah it's and it's one of those things we just got to start it just get it going and then once you get it going it sort of takes care of itself and you're in the middle of it it feels great but it's like that first step of doing that first squat you know first anything it's like oh come on now but if you can overcome that it gives you that feeling like you know like lately I've got a lot of shit done that I wanted to get done and I got this great like feeling because of that you know it's got I've got like momentum you know whenever I feel like that I'm accomplishing things that I wanted to do and you know do like you know I set out to do X today and I got it all done it's like yes like the next day I feel like a little more charged up I feel like I've got won't look I'm doing what I'm trying to get done I'm getting it done I'm feeling great about it and a lot of people I think don't have that they don't build that momentum enough in their life they don't you know pick a few goals lock on to them go with it and then let it build up to something else let it build up to more let it build up to the next thing and also I think that there's this weird equation with exercise because it's so easy to say you don't have time or yeah or whatever and you know I go through that a lot and and it's easy to justify not doing it but ultimately when I just quiet that thought and and do it anyway I end up getting more done and everything that I needed to get done ends up getting done and if I don't do it I end up wasting time and I'm less productive and I'm not thinking clearly and yeah there's a lot of like down wasted time I think everybody has a different sort of biology and I know I know this for sure people have different needs so I I don't say that everybody needs it you know I mean I think it benefits everybody but I don't know that everybody needs it but I certainly know that I need it when I don't have it it makes a big difference I don't like the way I feel I don't like to I don't like getting annoying things too easily I don't like this a weird testosterone build-up that happens after a few days of not exploding on something you know it's like my body's become most certainly addicted to that release and it knows that it can navigate like social waters better when it's just totally drained of all the the monkey DNA you know if I don't get that out at the gym I don't feel like I'm as nice a person I feel like I'm as balanced yeah my wife will just kick me out of the house need to go ride your bike or do something don't come back I have a crazy gym in my house it's in the garage half of the garage was done for a company called Garage Mahal Wow so my garage is set up it's got mats I've got a grappling dummy that I strangle I like to chew Jitsu on a dummy and I have a kickboxing bag and ropes to climb so I never have to go anywhere it's always right there so there that cuts out a lot of the fucking bullshit and procrastination with the 20-minute ride to the gym and then I'll only have 40 minutes to work out because because I just took a nap right now maybe I would perform better tonight and now I can just do some working out at home tonight I having it in my house for me it's huge the ability to just go outside and even when I was broke I always had a heavy bag you know just tied something to the rafters in the garage you know having something like that is to me having just a place where you can at least release in some way you know get that fucking blow out in some way so important for maximizing sanity yeah I need it I don't know some people some people don't need it you know I just sneeze a lot yeah Brian's fine without it I'm telling you angry guy I think though it's it's a it's a great benefit to everybody people can get through life without that benefit but you silly silly to do it that's what I told him I'm like you silly he got he got really skinny at one point time though yeah Brian was like way fat at one point in time and then he went crazy Weight Watchers and he shrunk down to like a tiny man strange yeah now I'm about halfway back to what I used to be but now it's more just I barely little like I eat only at like 9 or 10 o'clock at night until I go to bed but it's it's not like I eat crazy bad it's more like I'll go home and eat lean pockets and a salad you don't eat until 9:00 at night I'm saying you literally no any food all day yeah and it's mostly because of Starbucks yeah brenton double shot he gets Trent to double shots which is basically cancer it's just cancer and a liquid form you go all day all day then you hit the lien pockets at night yeah crash out yeah yeah it's fucking super good for you you're on the right track [Laughter] when you were super skinny yeah super skinny I was you've got really what did it was the lightest you got you got below 170 right [Music] you don't think this motherfucker doesn't want to hear about Rick rollin when your name is rich roll how annoying is that so rude and it came out of nowhere - you lived most of your life without it without a rick roll and then all of a sudden this is one fucking song the Internet is so bizarre you know it's funny - there's a you know this rapper Nipsey Hussle no this is rapper named Nipsey Hussle me in he has a song called rich roll all right so it's so it's it's all about the role and the end so my Twitter feed fills up with all this crazy insanity from people retweeting the song that I guess it's a pretty popular song and so I have to eat you know like I'm getting confused with this guy you should embrace it you should go like the opposite of what Rick Ross did you should claim that I'm the real rich roll sign that's right you know and then maybe you could like hip-hop people into being vegans it's so close to being too written - rick ross - it's all confused it is right you know it's right there it's right next door neighbors just buy a lot of trench coats you'll be good do you um the fuck around with probiotics do you yeah a little bit yeah yeah there's there's some pretty good like plant-based ones I have this nutrition guru my buddy Compton ROM he's got a name his name is Compton wrong you should factually got something on he would make an incredible gonna blow your mind you can watch videos of him on YouTube he talks about some crazy stuff like what just like the energy of food and he's super into like he said he has a PhD in microbiology and so he's helped me a lot with like my nutrition and he spent a little bit of a mentor and he's got a startup company called ascended health and he's all about trying to find the best superfoods all over the world and provide them to to customers and he's traveling all the time he's going to like Thailand all these crazy places trying to find you know places where he can grow this stuff and and so I would go to his house and his house look like in his kitchen it looked like it looks like a giant meth lab he's got all these tubes everywhere you gotta try this I just got this resveratrol in from it's from the finest Bordeaux grape skin it's like stuff's amazing I'm gonna I'm gonna make up I'm gonna make some powder for you and he's he's always trying to like help me with my like training and racing nutrition by giving me some of this crazy stuff and and so his whole thing is he's super knowledgeable about probiotics and microbes because he studied microbes and like like the GI tract microbial activity forever and ever and knows more about it than anyone I've ever met and it's fascinating man because and I talked a little bit about this in my book too that we think we're you know we're made up of trillions of cells right and we think were these sentient beings and we have control over what we think and our decisions and all of that but at the same time we have to realize that we're we have like 10 times the number of our cells in microbes in our gut alone like our microbial ecology and our GI tract has like you know 10 times the number of microorganisms compared to all of our cells in our entire body and there's been these studies that have come out and they're starting to come out where they're studying the extent to which your microbial ecology and your gut can trigger your nervous system and actually impulse you in a decision-making way and they've discovered like links between what kind of microbial ecology you have in your gut and the and the foods that you crave so yeah yeah and and and having like probiotics are all about improving the health of your your flora in your gut right and if you have healthy flora it craves and feeds on healthy foods right but if you go to jack-in-the-box every day or you eat lean pockets every night that your son you're gonna have like a different kind of microbial ecology like the microbes that are in that food start to propagate in your gut and that takes over and that becomes the ecology and they're realizing that that ecology then sends signals to your brain that makes you crave more of those foods so it's that craving cycle that I was talking about earlier that's so it's not easy and it sounds insane but then I was thinking about that you saw remember um the documentary Super Size Me yes so so Morgan Spurlock when he first starts out remember he's like getting sick when he's eating McDonald's like he can't handle it like he barfs out the window one day when he's a couple days in yeah it's just like cannot manage he's like I can't imagine going back to McDonald's he's only like three days in he's getting sick all the time and then fast forward like a couple days later and he wakes up with headaches and he's like craving the food and he and his headaches won't go away until he goes to McDonald's so it's like you can make the argument that that could be you know attributable to a change in his microbial ecology you know like now he's replaced as healthy because I think his wife or his girlfriend at the time was like a vegan chef he was eating really clean and then he just starts eating this McDonald's and he replaces that microbial ecology has got with the kind that feeds on McDonald's and suddenly he's creating it all did you imagine if they found out that McDonald's actually had implanted microbial biology that they that they created in a lab that specifically makes you want their shitty cheeseburgers you just just fucking crave that cheeseburger Oh McDonald's cheeseburgers that I I saw a thing online where a dude left one out for six months and never wrought it and I was like check please that's it I'm done no more only fillet of fishes which are nutritious yeah and delicious yeah he let out that it was the burger and I think the fries too maybe you know I saw that though yeah I don't think the fries rot either it's it's fucking crazy it's uh it's not food it's like it's just filler it's weird I mean it's like gut filler right I mean you can live on it for short periods of time it's better than starving to death but man that stuff is fucking bad for you it's so calm it's everywhere and his numbers from that movie like just after 30 days his doctor was like yeah this is crazy bad and it took him like a couple years to like lose the weight and get back to his baseline did it really yeah I mean it said it took him a really long time well that sounds like he's a lazy bitch you've lost weight clerk in a couple years but I think it fucked it wasn't just his weight it was like his cholesterol levels and all that comes reeling did he try to go vegan after that or happy vegetable diet I don't know I mean I know his girlfriend who's a vegan chef so I would imagine you returned to something along that lines but I don't know no what do you think of when you hear guys like Rob Wolfe say eat bacon and eggs for breakfast well I mean the first thing I would say is that that you know I have a lot of respect for Rob you know I think Rob great guy yeah and and I love the interview and you know Rob and I have the same goal you know what I mean like we're both working towards the same thing which is trying to get people healthier and more fit you know we differ on a couple you know subcategories of that but like I think Rob is is doing good stuff I mean I I definitely disagree when he says you should eat you know bacon and eggs for breakfast I think that you know and I remember your reaction to that even you were like surprised you know that that was I've never heard never heard I've never heard anyone say that myself I've never heard anyone say that kale shakes like don't eat kale shakes right right so so there's a lot about paleo that I think is fantastic you know they they eschew dairy they eschew processed foods and the only oil that they say is okay is olive oil in moderation you know we disagree it's a very like the idea is low carb right like it's low carb kind of high protein and I think that you know that works really well for losing weight and maybe works for some people in terms of energy levels but my perspective on the whole thing is I'm coming from looking at the healthcare crisis in America where like people are just Keeling over with heart attacks constantly you know I mean heart disease is rampant you know and people are getting diabetes like crazy and you know even children are getting diabetes I mean when we were kids diabetes wasn't really a thing right now like diabetes is a huge thing like obesity and the obesity figures are insane like 40 percent of Americans are gonna be obese by 2014 and childhood obesity rates are crazy and school lunches are terrible and and when I look at it like that like I think that you know I can't get around the fact that when I read the studies on plant-based nutrition you know when you read the China study or you read dr. esselstyn's book prevent in reverse heart disease there's a pretty clear correlation between getting rid of the meat and dairy and eating a whole food plant-based diet and your ability to you know repair your body from these conditions that are plaguing us unnecessarily I mean heart disease is a foodborne illness you know you can not only prevent it you can actually reverse it and this this guy dr. Elson have you ever heard of this guy yes okay so for maybe your listeners who don't know he is a he's a badass first of all the guy was like he's Yale educated and he's Olympic gold medalist in rowing in like 1968 and I think he's a I think he's a he was a Vietnam and also I'm not sure about that but then he became a surgeon and he was a you know head surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic which is if you have heart disease or you got heart problems like that's where you want to go like those the Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic yeah so if you feeling like shit right go to Cleveland he's yeah they know what's up there and like back in the 70s he started to realize that when he treated his patients with a with a plant-based whole food diet that they were able to like reverse their heart disease without surgery and he and he was starting to you know he look at the the what he having a brain fart the what are those the pictures of the heart called the angiogram so you'd see these before and after in angiograms and you could clearly see you know the clogged arteries becoming clear again and and it working and that was not a popular thing like in the 1970s in the 1980s and you know to a large degree it's still not popular but you know it didn't make him a popular surgeon there because what wasn't popular well because they make money off off surgery you know really so you're you're saying the putting that information out that you can heal yourself through vegetables was not popular because they literally want people to be sicker it's not that they make money it's not it's not that they wanted people to be sicker it's just that the system is set up you know the way that you profit is by sir you know performing expensive surgeries yeah that is the way they profit but it's a big leap between that and being upset at something that heals people it's not it's not I don't think that it was that they were upset it was that it was new and there wasn't enough evidence at that time to fully substantiate what he was doing and so was they had their sort of this is what we do here and when somebody comes in and they're in this condition we prescribed this procedure and he was saying I don't want to do that I want to do this like intensive diet thing with them and counsel them and see if I can avoid that and that was not that was not a popular option okay that that makes more sense so the essentially the the doctors had a very specific path that they would follow when you had X wrong with you and that that path usually led to some sort of a surgery and he was trying to avoid it with vegetables yeah yeah and I think that's still true today and we were talking about statins you going with high you know cholesterol or whatever your doctor is most likely gonna prescribe you statins he may say you know change your diet or do this and then you'll come back and and it doesn't change and then he'll say well it's genetic and you need to take this medicine when in fact you know I I believe that it actually you can lower your cholesterol if you change your diet properly but but the point getting back to dr. Esselstyn is that you know he was sort of blazing this trail a long time ago back when you know not too many people were listening and it's taken in many many years to kind of get traction with this and it's taken you know the China Study and and his book and you know the documentary Forks Over knives to get people sort of paying attention and listening now and now there's kind of like an awareness that didn't exist before and the scientific studies are pretty compelling that when you you know you remove the animal proteins you remove the processed foods and you remove the dairy that you can really heal yourself well if you cut I mean is what it has hasn't been proven that that is the order that works has it been proven that if you cut out the dairy cut out the process food cut out the meat specifically on vegetable live off of vegetables vegetable nutrition that that is the only way to go or have they done vegetable nutrition and grass-fed meat and natural mean yeah there's plenty of studies out there and what do they showed what are the different they found that it's the the the actual animal protein is the is the activator of a lot of congenital diseases really yeah and what do they attribute that to just even a get even game or is it fatty nice even even game well certainly the saturated fat doesn't help but there's something about the animal proteins themselves and in particular the casein which is the the the protein in the in the dairy that proves problematic and what does it do specifically to the human body that's a good question which I wish dr. Esselstyn was a little too technical I don't I don't want to speak out of school or say the wrong or say so what they found though essentially was that a lot of ailments are started and and the activator for starting these ailments and diseases is animals you see eat animals you're gonna get certain diseases that you would avoid if you just ate vegetables right and the China Study originated around studying cultures where there really wasn't any animal products or animal proteins in their diet and looking at the extent of cardiovascular disease so there's a certain area in China where you had a huge population and like two hundred and sixty thousand people or something like that the incidence of heart disease was almost a zero Wow that's crazy and so yeah and this long epidemiological study where they really took a hard look at it and it's interesting it's really interesting that's incredible the number zero it's ridiculous I don't know if it was zero but it was close to zero is very very very low do that that's incredible what how do they make sure that they get the the proper amount of protein and the proper amount of amino acids but from what I understand the real issue with the vegan diet is that you have to be really diligent about the the proper proteins that you get because all the various place like even broccoli has protein in it but it doesn't have like a complete protein like like say meat does but there's quinoa and hemp is a very complete protein but how do you make sure that you get the right amount well I think there's a lot of misconceptions about that and there's been a lot of sort of debunking of the complete versus incomplete protein argument that gets pretty technical but I think that if you're eating a well-rounded balanced plant-based diet with lots of different you know if you're especially if you're eating grains legumes fruits and vegetables and all the different colors and you know you're rotating them through or whatever then you're not gonna have a problem it's almost like Nature has rigged it like you're not gonna have a protein deficiency and you know just speaking from my own experience with this when I first started on the vegan diet you know I was nervous about that was scared about especially as I was starting to train more and more and my cabinet was like full of all kinds of crazy supplements just tons and I was like just mounds and mounds of plant-based proteins in my shakes because I was nervous that you know I was gonna injure myself or you know I was gonna get sick or something like that and over the last couple years I've slowly started like weaning myself off of a lot of that stuff where I use very very little now and I haven't noticed a difference in my ability to one recover in between workouts or build lean muscle mass or endurance and and my endurance is continuing to improve so I do use you know I use hemp protein I love hemp protein I usually combine it with like pea protein or our sprouted brown rice protein wait what pea protein I had some today in honor of this podcast that's different from urine therapy yeah peas men yeah it's very high in protein so what is the time to do it I don't even do it every day like I only do it when I'm training really hard or I feel like you know what I'm not gonna you know I don't have any lentils in the house or something like that I'm always trying to source my proteins from Whole Foods so the misconception is that you gotta you gotta you know eat tons and tons of protein and you can only get you know real good protein quality protein from animal products like I just don't believe that to be true do you remember when that dude was named Travis Barker got in a plane crash and he got burned and he needed a drummer yes he needed a a skin graft and when he had his skin graft his body was not healing until I started eating meat again and we started eating meat again it started healing rapidly interesting he said that was he was a vegan before that but he had to stop being a vegan pretty sure I don't want to paraphrase this guy's story but I'm pretty sure that is how he said it is there any possible benefit in your eyes to eating animal protein for as far as performance physical performance as far as I mean even though it may be the catalyst to triggering certain ailments in certain individuals and that could be documented is it also possible that there's a benefit to it to and from a performance perspective yes it's certainly it's certainly possible I don't know especially in the fast twitch sports yeah I mean you know what I do is so long it's a very specific kind of sport that's very different from jiu-jitsu or sprint running or anything like that but there are plenty of you know athletes out there in various disciplines that that seem to be that seem to be doing well but you know it has there been a double-blind you know sort of case study on the difference I don't know the answer to that and I think that that you know for me it goes back to the reason that I started doing this to begin with which was you know really long term wellness and and not having a heart attack like heart disease runs in my family my grandfather who was a champion swimmer died of a heart attack in his early 50s and you know I have to constantly remind myself that that was what motivated me to do this to begin with it wasn't performance reasons at the same time if I felt like I was missing something like if I started to feel like I wasn't recovering or I wasn't improving wasn't he I wasn't able to get stronger or I wasn't feeling good I would I would certainly entertain the possibility of eating of eating meat if I thought my health was suffering but I just I haven't had that experience yet so you know I just try to stick to I you know I don't want to speak for anyone else right so how do you feel about that idea that everybody's got a different sort of nutritional requirement and that some people really shouldn't eat red meat and some people really should be vegetarians it's like it's you know based on your blood or where your family's origins are geographically and that's the kind of genes that you're carrying around yeah by Antony that I don't know I don't really buy into any of that no no but it hasn't there been evidence that different people that grow up in different parts of the world have different nutritional requirements like for instance people that live in like Eskimos are Inuits they don't like to call Eskimos apparently Inuits they they have no issues as far as like scurvy or anything but they're not getting any vitamin C they also have like they have a relatively high incidence of heart disease oh do they really do yeah they I thought the whole deal was is it cancer that they do almost never see yeah yeah and a new population and they were attributing that to the nutrition that they got from fish oil do you do substitute with any animal like fish oil or anything like that no I mean you know I think getting your omega-3s is really important you know fish oil is really popular with a lot of people but you can essentially do the same thing with flax seeds ground flax seeds I wouldn't I wouldn't use flax oil but like ground flax seeds or something I put in the Vitamix all the time why wouldn't use the actual oil the oil has been linked to there's some evidence to suggest that it's linked to incidence of prostate cancer but for some reason the seeds aren't tough to seize the seeds have like the case you know like they have about casing on them or whatever mhm you have to grind them up because otherwise they'll just pass right through you so Vitamix yeah yeah or you can you can buy them ground or you can put them in like a coffee grinder or like a Cuisinart or something like what about hemp oil that's supposed to be pretty nutritious and I can boil all that stuff has the same benefits as fish oil well flax seeds are the closest from my understanding does it have the same benefits as far as like joint inflammation relief because fish oil is incredible for for that yeah I mean I think I think it's important when it comes to joint relief and looking at inflammation is looking at the acidic or the alkaline nature of the foods that you're eating you know and and and animal products dairy dairy meat tend to be very acid forming like your body has a certain pH right it's trying to it's trying to maintain that sort of pH right in the middle but you know the foods we eat and the toxins we breathe in the air and stress of our lives or whatever can all put you know try to push that one way or the other and then our body has to kind of go in the hyperdrive to bring it back to its normalized state so the truth is is that most people that are eating a standard American diet and you know living the North American Way of life are eating a predominantly acidic acid forming diet and and they're in a state of what's called chronic acidosis and that's a that's a state in which you know you're constantly bombarding your body with a very acid based diet and your body has to kind of go into hyperdrive to bring it to bring it back and that's an environment where you become very ripe for getting injured for getting sick and it's also you know an environment that is makes you more prone to those congenital diseases so when you're eating a more plant-based diet those are those tend to be me not every plant food or whatever but it tends it tends to be in balance more alkaline forming and when you're when you're in a more alkaline state you're you're not getting sick you're recovering more quickly because inflammation is is sort of the root cause for a zillion diseases and it's like the enemy of the athlete right you're always trying to like if you can reduce your inflammation your muscles are gonna repair themselves more quickly you're gonna be able to bounce back quicker you're able to train harder it doesn't necessarily make you a better athlete right you know in a short period of time but protracted over the course of the season you're going to have a more efficient and effective training period and that's going to result in performance gains in the long run so you're essentially saying that all the benefits of taking fish oil you could get those same benefits with just changing your diet to a vegetarian diet that you don't need with respect to fish oil I mean the the purpose of fish oil is to get those omega-3s those essential fatty acids right better that are important I mean you know we you know there's a lot of talk about a FAs and the omega-6 and the omega-3 and we get plenty of omega-6 and all the foods we eat or whatever but the problem comes when the ratio of 6 to 3 is kind of off and most people don't get enough omega-3 in their diets and fish oil is great for kind of rectifying that but it's just you know my point is only that it's not the only way of dealing with that what are the other vegetarian options such as hemp oil flaxseed oil and walnuts I believe there's some nuts that are that are pretty high and I mean you do have to eat hip seeds not that many really you don't you don't need like a ton of this stuff fish oil I've been on like a really high fish oil diet for a long time now I take like five five thousand five thousand milligrams Milutin milligram pill I take five of those in the morning at five of those at night right and when I don't do it I notice a difference and like how my joints feel right like from doing a lot of jiu-jitsu especially if you if you switched it up to ground flaxseeds if you felt a difference or not yeah I would be willing to try but I always thought it that it was like almost like there was like lubricating it doesn't make sense really but it was like BG forty doing so yeah it doesn't make sense we how much oil would you need that's how I almost I've thought it in my head because there was such a correlation between taking these pills and and and joint pain relief that I found that I've read a lot of great things about fish oil and Studies on fish oil and there's absolutely some nutritional benefit to taking it I don't know why you wouldn't take it unless it was because the fact that you wanted to not have anything animal like to just subscribe to well I think that you you have to be careful with the the toxins that are in marine life too well it's all filtered you bye violet Carlson's fish oil that's all they test that stuff it's all filtered out and there's nothing you don't have to worry about them though Steve the the very high-end companies they they test all their stuff but I don't just don't see why there would be unless you were into it strictly from the point of view of staying vegan or introducing no animal into your body at all it doesn't seem like there's anything that you lose from taking fish oil there's um I mean it's interesting because anytime you say this food is good then you can immediately go on the internet and find some reason why you can fall on any category of that and there are there are some studies out there that show that that the fish oil thing is a little overhyped and you know it's it's hard to quantify like who's right and who's wrong and all that kind of stuff have you ever have you been to a there's there's a guy named dr. Michael Greger he's got a site called nutritionfacts.org and it's amazing that God has like a zillion he puts up videos like almost every day and they're short they're like two to five minutes at max and you can look at you can enter in any food or any disease or whatever and most likely he has a short video on it it's all based on peer-reviewed scientific studies or whatever but I always go to that when I have a question about this food or that a really good resource I went to nutrition for the first time when I was like 17 and I was losing weight for martial arts competitions and though it was fucking my body I'm not trying to figure out how to monitor you know my nutrition had a you know leaned myself out in the healthiest way possible but dropped the most weight before I had to dehydrate myself but that was Nancy Clark who's pretty famous for working with athletes she was in Boston at the time she's got a bunch of books on that stuff and I think she's worked with other MMA athletes too now this is like way after I mean I I must have done it did it with her and 85 or something like that but that's when I first became it was from martial arts competition before I had to worry about my diet I didn't I didn't watch what I ate at all I just ate what I felt like eating even when I was competing I died no emphasis or focus on nutrition it wasn't until I got older that I do you know I just through trial and error and you know just going on a whim and saying you don't want this I'm gonna juice all day I'm just gonna have beet juice and carrot juice and celery juice and and I've done that a few times and you you you get this is a weird kind of energy that you get from that intense plant nutrition that you don't get from anything else you really don't it's not the same feeling that you get when you have the satisfaction of a fat ribeye and it's just perfectly cooked and slice into that medium-rare mmm so good it's not that satisfaction but it is this weird sort of a vibrancy that you get like you're injecting and you're ingesting live live plants and essentially they've just died a short period of time ago there's still vibrant with with energy and you don't get that from anything processed and there's a lot of people out there that are miserable that are depressed that are and I have friends that shit fucking diets and their their way of dealing with this take antidepressants right and it's like there's no you got no exercise terrible sleep shit die you feel terrible take a pill you feel better really hope you got to clean up all that other stuff man and then see how you feel if you have all these goddamn issues as far as your diet as far as your sleep as far as in stress levels get clean up that shit first before you go take a goddamn pill I mean we're a nation of crazy people who are addicted to all these weird new not natural non native chemicals that were introducing into our body and that would become addicted to it if we could just look if you could have a overlay of the United States and who's on the influence of any sort of a pharmaceutical drug right now it's like the matrix yeah and it really is and and you know not to spend too much of a new age thing but you know you're right it the you know food carries a vibrancy and and energy to it it's very specific and in my case you know if I've been on this crazy amazing journey that I would have never predicted and it honestly started with like changing my diet you know and so I look at it with like a respect and a reverence and I go this is this is what catalyzed this path and it opened me like it opened my heart to the possibility of living differently and and to doing different things than I was doing and look you know people are sicker than they've ever been where the we're such a prosperous nation and people are just over medicated they're fat they're unhealthy and for the most part they're people you know there's the what do you think the level of happiness is now compared to what it was like you know hundred years ago do you think we're happier do you think we're more unhappy well I think obviously it's in the individuals I'm happy it's fuck yeah I mean but the thing is you're doing what you're meant to be doing you know what I mean you're on you're on a path that you know you've been blazing for a long time but you're you know you've made something happen that you're passionate about but most people unfortunately you know don't live that kind of life that's true but I think they they could live their own version of it they could you can't they have but but a lot of people don't and I know this because I would you know I was a corporate lawyer I was miserable I was doing the 80 hour weeks and I'd I'd done everything right my whole lives you say it is fine chill no I studied hard I got into the good schools and I you know I played the game you know what I mean and I and I got to the place that was supposed to be the brass ring you know and I was like what the fuck you know I was like not happy and I felt lost in it's it's like a feeling of being in freefall and you have a choice you can you know I was making a decent amount of money so you know a lot of people in that situation they'll just they'll just killed themselves with stuff they can't afford like well I'll you know I'll lease that car that's a little bit out of my reach and reward yeah exactly because when you're unhappy you know you need something to sell that that wound and then you do that long enough and then you're stuck and you can't make a change or it becomes too difficult and you know I think it was it was Henry David Thoreau that's a the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation I think that's very very true one of my favorite quote ever and it's it's sad man it's sad and you know I look at you you've built this thing here you're doing what you love you spend your day laughs I didn't build shit Bryan bill oh yeah but I mean you're you're like you're you're like you know in your juju you know what I mean yeah and most people most people aren't I think that's okay he knows Jews you'll have use that yeah I know most people aren't but they could be you know but I think one of those heart it's hard I mean you think it's hard to change you know your diet I mean try you know overhauling your entire lifestyle yeah oh very very difficult yeah and scary it's terrifying and you know and we live in a fear-based culture you know um but I did it you know I went from being a martial arts instructor to being a stand-up comedian and it'll got my car repossessed went broke lost all my credit I mean I just was a loser for like years but you were willing to double down to do that you know I just didn't want to get brain damage I saw a future in kickboxing and I was like you know what this is this this stuff is not good for your fucking head and I was meeting guys that Jim that I knew were were punchy and I just was tuning I did too many hard sparring sessions where I never got knocked out and sparring but I definitely got my bell rung before and I got hit with hard shots before we would we would trade you know but I I worked out at it particularly heavy-duty gym and these they you know it's the different gyms of different philosophies as far as sparring and our gyms philosophy was he put on big gloves and you fucking go at it there was there was it was basically kick boxing bouts with big giant gloves on and headgear and shin pads and stuff like that and I knew that it was not good for you so for me it was like I had this crazy like I got a jump ship I got a job because this is a path of deteriorating brain function a guy would have moments where I'd be lying in bed and wasn't even like there was a like a goal like it wasn't there was no UFC back then so it was just kickboxing and in my opinion mixed martial arts is a its first of all it's it's just way more options and just because there's more options you could protect yourself period there's no I mean you could say that mixed martial arts fighters have damaged too and I'll tell you some do but there's some that don't have any there's some that rarely get hit and that is possible as well and the the ability to mix up between striking and the grappling and the fact that you have so many different options if you have a creative and spontaneous approach as well as being able to drill things over and over again till they become Zen when you reach a certain level you can get away with way less damage than any boxer does like you'll see certain guys fight in a five round UFC fight and take very little damage like a George st. Pierre because he's so fucking good and its plan is so good but with boxing and kickboxing you're standing in front of each other and you're hitting each other period and there's no takedowns and there's no there's no rear naked choke for the finish in the first round does none of that there's there's slamming bones into your head trying to shut that melon off you know and ultimately for me I knew that I had to do something differently I was terrified and there was no future in it you know but I but because of that I developed a real compassion for understanding like how difficult it is I was 21 I had no children I had no I mean they'd repossessed my car so I had no car anymore it was like it was really like I could live on the cheap and I could scratch by but if you're a person who is trying to change careers and you have a family and you mortgage and you have you know a car that you lease and you got to you know pay for your kids after school activities and like that is unbelievably hard very hard then at the same time it's like you know life short man and it's true most people are not I'm not doing what they what they want to be doing or maybe even what they're supposed to be doing so what did you do how did you how did you just exit yourself out from the Machine well I I had a you know I left corporate law firm life and started my own my own little thing and you know because I just couldn't I couldn't live that way anymore what little thing I'm talking about just a solo entertainment practice and you know it's made a lot less money but was able to control my time and that was just a little bit before you know I changed the diet and started getting back into fitness but because I had control over my day because I didn't have a boss anymore I could set up my work schedule the way that I want like Tim Ferriss style then it allowed me to be able to to train at odd hours that wouldn't necessarily flow with somebody who has you know a nine-to-five job but I was able to structure my life so that I could make that possible and and again I was just feeling like you know when you feel like you're guided to move in a certain direction in a certain path you know when your car was repossessed and you were starting to you know do stand-up and move into that world I mean I'm sure you felt like this is what you wanted to be doing is what you're supposed to be doing even if there was no kind of real world material affirmation of that initially it was there was a lot of apprehension there was a lot of thinking that I was fucking up and I was doing the wrong thing I mean it was there was not much confidence it's certainly not like I knew this was my path like I had an idea that this was something that I could do but I was terrified because I sucked at it too there was no evidence that I can ever be really good at it you know when I quit teaching martial arts when I was teaching at Boston University I had my own school and I was I was making a living teaching Taekwondo and then you know I deliver newspapers sometimes in the morning I would occasionally take like a newspaper routes I to switch from that didn't give up training and teaching entirely altogether to do something that I wasn't very good at it was fucking terrible that was a terrifying move that would I would only make when I was 21 and you know when you're 21 you're all fucking cocky with but you know this like if I was gonna do that in this day and age is that really one of those old-school alarms right outside out there you dumb motherfucker it'll be very hard for me to do something like that today well yeah it's different when you're 21 but I mean is you know does anybody pay attention to car alarms ever I don't know open the door Brian and make it louder that's a good move yeah your instinct is never oh my god somebody's stealing that car no is kunti fucking law is ruining our conversation is it anybody in stand-up good in the beginning no cuz I've heard that everybody says they were you know they were awful when they can think that they're what what are you doing man you shut my mic like go off they're young you might think you're good I mean I've heard people say that they were good right from the very beginning but they're either full of shit or they were stealing jokes yeah it just doesn't make sense that you were good right from the beginning unless you'd had some experience as something else before one one group of people that were actually pretty decent like not bad for beginners was Alcoholics Anonymous people cuz that this is driving people on iTunes fucking crazy I guarantee you take a quick five-minute break you might keep going right how long do these things keep going we just pause those folks we're gonna pause this for a couple minutes and let this shit stop thank you [Music] this ladies and gentlemen with vulnerable folks technically but we were in the middle of talking about this shows off air there goes we were in the middle of talking about changing your life and changing you know changing your diet changing your path into something that you love that's something that we stress on this show like like as much as possible because it's something that someone doesn't tell you when you're growing up in the most formative period of your life they don't say you you're different than me everyone's different you have to find what you're drawn to find what you love and then go chase that I love when I see is this mic on it's working because I'm hearing young people that like latch on to something that they love doing when they're when they're young you know whether it's playing the guitar or whatever it is that they're just passionate about and then they just become very self-directed about it and I'm like so jealous I wish I had when I was a kid I wish I had that you know I never I spent my whole life kind of doing what I was supposed to and didn't never really stop to think like well what do i what do I want or what makes me happy or what am i passionate about it wasn't really just wasn't really part of my equation you know and that just seems so wrong sucks like yeah it's terrible and and and it it almost like it doesn't even matter what it is you know everybody has something inside them that they probably you know love doing or could be passionate about or could be good at or whatever and for whatever everyone do you think there's some people other than its diggers not listen I think that not look not everyone is you know can be an NBA basketball player or whatever so not everyone is innately gifted but I think everybody inside inside of themselves has something that makes them happy and I think that if you pursue what makes you happy without getting so caught up and how am I going to make money doing this or there's no career or whatever and living a little bit more faith-based with what you're doing and focusing more on the passion that you know we'd probably be better we'd probably be better off I think people would be happier if that was a priority there would also be a bottle trade already trying to borrow money there would be a lot more of course yeah there's there'll be a lot more people that need a loan to try to get through this next thing that they're trying to fucking get launched Kickstarter we're going and then a long time ago yeah King started changed the whole game of begging yeah you know it made it kind of cool you know you figured out a way to put a name to it that makes it seem lets kill just kick starting my business did you see I just saw I tweeted this yesterday that this this company came up with this new light bulb that you can control your your iPhone app you can you could you put all these light bulbs in your house and you can do all this crazy stuff with them like change all their colors yeah like that like change the glass have them turn on have them like you know on timers that go off and on or it was it's pretty cool but they waste a ton of money on Kickstarter no shit yeah I'm sure yeah it's a brilliant idea and you you know you there's all sorts of different offers that companies give to people you can actually become a part of like cocaine Cowboys I didn't he'd do something like that where he no no that wasn't that was the Union the guys who did the Union his next film that he's doing he he got people to buy it in advance on Kickstarter instead of just like asking for money said listen I'm Guinea you you're you'll get the first copies of this film right I think yeah the successful product ones are all they're almost pre-orders yeah a lot of money because you're gonna actually get the product yeah I mean it's it's like it's such a it's like the people that enjoyed the first film can actually fund and financed the second one I mean it's just it's really cool you know if you look at it that way it's really cool I mean we live in we live in the most strange times this is the really things like that you know are just like you can do that yeah you could do that and you can make a lot of money look at these fucking the Kony guys yeah that made millions dollars off this where'd that go by the way that fucking was the quickest in and out fad that Kony fad man that's almost like an alien blip that they just tested us for retardation like art a pH test from the from the heavens in the same way that technology is accelerating our attention spans are or shrinking you know it's amazing the rapidity with which stuff comes and goes now like it's immediate like it could be the biggest thing ever and then it's immediately forgot did you imagine though Joseph Kony's email box it's like nothing then and millions of emails millions of emails stop if it should not for nothing - he's not getting any emails today Joseph Kony doesn't even get Nigerian scammers emails today that was just viral marketing for Peter Pan on Blu ray yeah we had it at the same time you do this podcast and you hold people's attentions for three hours a day man that's ridiculous there these people need to get outside stop listen to this fucking show go mow your lawn son well they probably won't a lot as we do it a lot of people do it while they're working which is cool as fuck because then they get to be a part of a conversation instead of just be sitting there you know screw and widgets together I got on my long training ride so I just I stack it with podcast cuz I can I can't if I'm going out to ride my bike like for a long daily eight-hour training ride or something like that I can't listen to music the whole time you know I'd go insane so I I'll listen to your podcast a couple other podcasts and I just start and I just lose myself in the conversation so for me it's like the longer the better man I love it yeah we but when we first started out everybody was telling me we're crazy for doing an hour Ari Shaffir was constantly you go to go to go definitely out of it you can't have more you know people are not gonna listen I go well how about does this don't listen to the rest so you just shut it off at any point in time like what fucking difference does it make son this is ridiculous for two hours three hours so you don't have to listen like do I get bummed out that a radio shows in four hours long I only was in my car for an hour no you listen to whatever the fuck you want to listen to it's I think the key is just giving people content just keep keeping and coming like that's the most important thing is the momentum keeping it coming and then you've become a part of people's sort of daily routine and when you become a part of people's daily routine then you have an obligation and the responsibility to keep it coming you know cause like you know you're bumming a bunch of people out it's not as simple as you put something out and they enjoy it it's you don't put it out and you bum them out like what the fuck's fucking angry with you fucking expectation yeah but it's your you're making junkies and you you have to feed those junkies I mean it seems like yeah but you're keeping the quality really high I mean that that David Seaman interview was amazing I never I've never even heard of that guy I was like why is he having like a guys running for Congress on his show I just thought and I'd listened to it I was like that is amazing I immediately started following him he's coming back he's doing it a gasps amazing guy and it's a real interesting I was thinking about it the other day because he's the first guy from like that generation to be in this sort of you know a political candidate yeah and and the generation gap is very palpable that kid can present a very different place and his priorities and perspectives and all of that are so just in the way he speaks are so different from what we're used to yeah I mean smart he's a smart kid he's like 26 years old it's beyond my shit he is but it's it's beyond that too because you know he is interested in things and it's talking about things then no one in you know the traditional political stratosphere want to get anywhere near right well the could either he'll wind up being killed or he'll be the new king right either way we got your back son you know I I think it's it's it's very important that the only way this future is going to be any brighter is if it's very important that we enlighten young people coming up two alternative paths of thinking by you telling your story that you had gone down the exact correct path you know in some sort of a predetermined pattern to success which would equal happiness supposedly for you and then reaching that that point of success you you're not speculating you know Mike you were one of the rare people that actually made it to the end of the game and went this is horseshit okay let's get out of here and you can't get trapped here let's get the fuck out of here and try something different it has to be done that message when that message is in some kids earbud when he's on the train you know headed to his job or headed to school or whatever that that message can resonate and change thousands of people's lives I have had more fucking people come up to me in the past two years and say your podcast changed my life then then any than any one thing that people said to me other than fear is not a factor they post said that than anything else but that that key that fucking theme keeps happening and a lot of it is nutrition and a lot of it is exercise but a lot of it also is just this understanding that you're not alone in thinking like that that the standard path seems like shit you're not alone in that it's it's your there's a lot of other people like us out there and we could all get pigeonholed into some ridiculous patterns that were created without individual personalities and unique traits and artistic intentions and qualities in mind none of that stuff in mind they're just this is a plumber this is a vacuum salesman this is go down that path so I'm you'll be an electrician and you know and we're disconnected from our own heartbeat you know yeah I mean it's like you could say well you know most people are well I don't even know what I like you know it's like we're not were disassociated from like a higher version of ourself we have a more authentic version that wants to come out is lockdown so deep that it's almost like the key is you know unfindable well we've become a we've become a victim of our own culture of our own creation the culture of our own creation as a culture of predetermined patterns and obligations and things that you just must do that a lot of them suck and we've become a prisoner to that and this idea that if you do those things that somehow or another you will be happier is ludicrous it's ridiculous yeah but then there's also you have to pay your fucking rent and you know you want to drive you all cars or expensive gas is expensive what are you gonna do you got it you got to get a job son it's finding the the ability to pay yourself you know to feed yourself and on top of that still pursue a dream that's the hardest thing be car gonna do it before you develop any fucking baggage live lean yeah young man I could have done one thing when I was young it was just to live as lean as possible and keep all those doors and options open so you don't get stuck in someplace you don't want to be and and and make it more difficult for yourself to get out yeah I got out but I could have easily just not gone now I know a lot of people that didn't I know a lot of people that are postman somewhere that really wanted to be a rock star you know there's a lot of a lot of weirdness in this world and then one of the most depressing things to be around is someone who never for it you know the people that you know that never went for that had an idea in their head whatever it is being author or whatever it is whatever it is they just never change I want to be a longshoreman I want to be a fucking professional fisherman I wanna I want to fucking do with those crab guys do on that crazy show those guys go fishing for crab just to fucking know I'm alive if you have that thought in your head you don't do it you're gonna you're living like a bitch man it's the saddest thing in the world isn't it the the feeling that you get when you're around someone who just stayed on the couch just never pursued anything artistic anything physical anything anything for me it always feels like like one of the big things of happiness it's like seeing improvement either seeing improvement in stuff that I'm working on like comedy stuff or seeing improvement in my my jiu-jitsu or seeing improvement and playing pool anything to me it's like if I don't see improvement in things then I get like I get really bummed out like I feel like I'm not doing anything I feel lazy I feel like I'm just getting by you know if I'm if I go four or five days where I'm not like Chili's actively working and improving some aspect of my life I feel totally lazy right I found out I met danziger's home is that what is yeah why why is that why would that make it haunted uh-huh because his podcasts are haunted oh is podcast thats right he's had two podcasts that fucked up one re Ari's podcast he did this long podcast with Ari Shaffir and it got deleted and they couldn't return retrieve it and then mine which just crashed recently so he made me podcast haunted is he gonna come back coming tomorrow yeah tomorrow is gonna be a crazy day ladies and gentlemen we have not just powerful Mac Danzig we have Billy Corbin who's the director and producer of cocaine Cowboys he's coming in with mad flavor aka Joey Diaz so Joey Diaz and the director of cocaine Cowboys and Joey's on the phone with me yesterday who's dropping knowledge he's told me he was warming up for this because let me tell you something dawg I'm gonna tell people shit I ain't never before I tell people shit I never told before Joe Rogan I'm gonna go back to my uncle we can call him in Miami 70 years old he'll tell you what the fuck happened and he started going off and screaming at me on the phone after he screamed at me for leaving a message I fucked up and left a voicemail message on his machine if you leave a message as machine here we'll go crazy and call you up and motherfuck you why why he doesn't like to listen to message but he gets angry at you so if you call his voicemail it goes what the fuck did I tell you no messages do not leave a message on this fucking phone so if you leave a message he goes bananas even if you have like tell him to turn that you can turn that off can you know he's Joey good fucking ape he doesn't know that you have cash that job yeah the phone might as well be solid wood he doesn't know what the fuck the buttons do it shuts off and it runs out of batteries in these hands to somebody he's getting better that though he sent me text messages before and I stuck in his face I go what the fuck is this you sent me a text message for the longest time Joey just had a pager when everyone had cell phones he still had a pager yeah I didn't have a cell phone until like the 2000s I'm not bullshitting either man I know what Joey Diaz had up it did he have a pager when you met him yeah he might had a pager when you met him yeah yeah he kept a pager deep deep into his history yeah when a lot of people had given up the ghost on the pager it's weird how these things just haven't been around that long and yet you can't even imagine not having him anymore you know do you remember the transitionary period where a lot of a lot of folks in the urban community had those little pagers that would send messages yeah you could send like a little message to somebody yeah meet me at the club they would that the black folks were way ahead of the curve on that they were way ahead of the curve I never thought that would it caught on like what you guys doing you texting away technically I didn't even say texting wasn't even called texting I was like you're writing each other letters like what are you why are you doing that and they were like well it gets loud in the club in the club that makes sense that's what started yeah for real that's - I was too loud in the club people vouched for her to the iPhone 5 and not only that but a lot of times there's another thing that is a phenomena in the urban community they like to talk on speaker phone you know I don't know what's up with that I've talked about this on this podcast and people have accused me of being racist huh touching that right after they accused me of being racist I went to Roscoe's chicken and waffles and there's a dude standing right in front of the place talking on his phone like this oh hell no oh hell no the other dude was talking loud you could hear the other dude like still the loud and he's maybe he like heard the Sheryl Crow story he's worried about brain tumors but I don't think so I think there's something going on like they even had a commercial remember that commercial for Boost Mobile whatever so close like where you at they would talk into it they're not doing this they're not treating it like a white person phone now they're holding it what are you a well you were that was the that was the commercial they were doing it urban style it's a weird thing so I guess that didn't work you know cell phones and clubs it's when you're gone speakerphone all the time it's like in here shit chaos right so imagine me remember I used to have jokes in my act about text messages were stupid good before I like in 2005 my Showtime special I totally mocked text messaging like it takes you four presses to get an S I was like this before anybody had keyboards yeah people would like they were starting out with that crazy shit we would have to press four times to get an answer yeah that was ridiculous you remember that tuba dinosaurs I remember when the texting plans were like 25 texts per month 50 texts per 100 yeah if you've got a girlfriend you go through that day yeah you know girls love texting people are dying and crashing their cars because they just can't keep their fingers off it oh yeah it's real issue it's a real issue they say it's one of the worst distractions ever that you literally cannot focus on your phone like it's like zooming in on something like that and intently it's like it's so it's so non peripheral you don't see anything peripheral you've completely concentrate on that thing some lady almost ran into me at the mall the other day she was on her phone she was doing this and she looked up and I was like right in the crosswalk people are fucking nuts man they're nuts well and we've created this weird culture again that we're a prisoner to and one of the prisons is technology I mean we we benefit from it no question about it but we are also locked into this really weird symbol like relationship with it like I am I do not leave my house without my phone man if I I if I don't have my phone on me I feel weird yeah it is where's my fucking phone shit now panic even though it's like all you have to do is you buy a new phone and he's sticking in your computer all your contacts come overtakes you I mean if you lost your phone it's not the most dip but you're like oh my gonna call people I'm alone I'm out here on my own with no no tether it's like that we're afraid to be in a fucking town without a cell phone I mean I feel bizarre if I leave if I if I'm in a town like saying it's like a place we could walk around and I leave my phone in my hotel room and then I'll go downstairs and I'll just walk to a restaurant sit down I feel fucking strange like I feel like I can't talk to anybody right now it's worth I mean it and it gets even crazier with all the social media like you have this comparison to like check Twitter and see what certain people are saying that you don't even these are people you don't even know well some people have it hooked up to their phone where they get a text message every time someone tweets any sort of a mention of their name yeah that's that's insane Doug Benson has that so does Dahmer era I tweeted a Instagram the other day a picture of Dahmer era in his sexy pool moves I was shooting pool and it showed up on his phone I'm like you bitch turn that shit off I'll have people just I think already have do that no your phone's gonna blow up time around well you know you're not you know it's insane it just Scrolls like crazy yeah you can't know that stuff I read as much as I can but the problem is some people think I read it all and they're like did you respond to Motors get mad at you she responded my tweet I'm like Doris Paro what tweet you want me to really go into your thing and there's a lot of people here dude just you had a chance to say it again right there and he didn't you say dude you're born with tweet you were spoiled fans do not respond fence that what's up all the negative approach I get the guilt move always always good I was hearing Howard Stern talk about Twitter about how many people are nasty to him on Twitter and how evil they are I don't get that I really don't get it was pretty overwhelmingly positive yeah compared to other platforms yeah I found I get overwhelmingly positive I mean there's always a few cons but it's so easy to block on my wave even bring a mine and it's rare it's it's just really rare and I think a lot of people on Twitter like you look at their names it's like that's their real name it's it's it's more than same message boards message boards I've always felt like we have a message board on Joe Rogan net and I've always felt like part of the problem is the anonymity that it provides in a way it's good because people can talk about things especially like people that have sensitive jobs and people that are at work they can get away with talking about things and there's no way to google them and data reference their name but in a way it's bad because people say shit without any reek they don't worry about the the social repercussions of looking in a person's eye and calling them a cunt a douche bag you know and then you're like what the fuck man you know like that that negativity is gone so it's just these verbal Barb's I think with Twitter like a lot of times it's the people of their photo that's their there you know it's not everybody but a good percentage like I'm looking at my my Twitter feed like most of these are people's name real people yeah there's a few that aren't there's a few like weird names or you know it's like maybe like one of them's Divo bitch you're not Devo you know and it's Devo as me is his Twitter name - you're not Devo son I mean you might like girl but you're not Devo who are you really respondent name is Mike Callahan or whatever the fuck is real name is when I think the more we have that the more we have like a sort of a transparency about like I think people are less likely to just lash out and have it become super negative yeah that's true I mean I think like a couple weeks ago when you had you retweeted like a video I made of a kale shake or something like that we had back and forth over like yeah kale Vitamix or something like that so you retweeted this stupid little video that I made of just me making a drink after a run and I got slammed with the comments desk squad army full effect just like if I saw that guy in the street I would I would you know stab him in the face and like what it's like the most benign thing out that on my face for me yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah really no I mean there were some that were fine too but I was like suddenly out of the blue like all these comments popped up so it's clearly as a result of you know you having this huge following or whatever it was just to have you though for your dietary choice very threatened by the kale Jeff yeah that's why they don't know what to do with me because I enjoy the kale I love the kale I'm a big fan of pure vegetables just meals it's just food it is just food but the people need to be on a fucking team okay it's now they're in the death squad army and if if they feel like they're being attacked by vegetarians they'll fucking throw out all the vegetables I don't know why you know we all can't just get along to quote Rodney King before you drown on PCP and a swimming pool it's it seems to me that the real problem is annoying people it's and it's not vegetarians it's not meat-eaters it's not the real problem is annoying people people that are annoying that that's the issue it's not a different ideology or different desire I know people that legitimately really love classical music and they can't wait to get home to put on headphones and sit there in front of some shit that to me would just drive me out of my head I can listen to classical music for a couple minutes and then I go you know what I could be listening to right now Led Zeppelin why am i listen this stupid shit when I can hear a whole lot of love you know to me I don't like classical music but it doesn't mean that it's not awesome to you you know it's the same thing with dietary choices the same thing that the way you dress have at it man they just yeah we enjoy your life we've lost a little bit of tolerance acceptance intolerance yeah you know one of the dumbest things to lose it's you know that diversity is a good thing huge so why you know why are you you know taking a dump on somebody else's preference that has nothing to do with you but yeah and by the way tolerance and acceptance of people benefits your life very much directly the benefits that we feel the more tolerant accepting you are people and the more you know you know you're just cool with people the more positive interactions you'll have the more positive interactions you'll have the better your your your feeling in life will be and that's like a real direct thing for sure and that netted the negative shit that a lot of people project at people for no reason what it really is is your own shortcomings magnified through your personality traits it has nothing to do with the person that's being projected or very rarely does very rarely does you just choose them to for your ire the target of your bullshit but the reality is you wouldn't have that bullshit I got try to explain this to a guy once it was a heckler I know that I was like your you have to be a loser there's no way it can be a winner you know what I'm saying like do you really think that Michael Jordan would go to a comedy club and heckle do you think anybody who'd be really good at anything would interrupt a performance and just try to interject no you you've no appreciation for things that are good like this is a this is a dire moment for you where you need to realize this anybody who would try to fuck up someone's time if you're trying to fuck up their enjoyment you're trying to fuck you got something wrong with you man you got something wrong with you 100% there's no way around it you have to be fucked up and if you weren't that way you would be happier believe it or not like that energy that you put out is palpable the energy that you put out being an asshole is real and it does come it it does flavor your life comes back yeah and for you you feel that's dietary as well right so it what do you mean you mean I mean as far as like putting out energy I mean you're taking out vegetables you have like almost like a pure you know that that existence of only eating vegetables and not not being connected to animal you know farming or you know any of that horrible shit you see well we're still all connected to it you know by just by virtue of living here and all the other things that we have to do do you drive a Prius suppose I know if you drive a v8 like a fucking muscle cars or what have we been talking about these past two hours do you really wish you really wish I know you need to get a kick start now together every need that GTO a muscle car ya know there's a certain I guess it's you know it sounds weird to say but there's definitely like a feeling of like greater harmony mmm the environment makes sense it sounds really stupid it doesn't you know um I'm going hunting for the first time in October with Steve Rinella he's a guy who had a TV show on the Travel Channel called the while within now he's got a new one called the meat eater and his show is essentially his original show was all about you know like sort of like living off the land and he would do a lot of things that were like really similar to what like people had to do in the 1800's like you would kill a water buffalo with a musket and shit like that and in his new show it's all about what you call like fair chase hunting and one of the things that I've been really paying attention to a lot lately is the idea of a hunter-gatherer lifestyle being actually like physically benefitting experience for people and that there are certain amounts of there's a certain system a reward system that's in our bodies that is satisfied with growing your own food there's a certain reward system that's satisfied with the hunting and fishing and that our bodies are essentially the same as the bodies of people that lived you know 20,000 years ago there's very little genetic change and that we still have these reward systems these primal feelings of satisfaction that are built into our very being as a human being in order to to to motivate us to do the correct things to survive and to carry on and at me personally as a person who's a meat-eater I've never killed an animal ever you know except accidentally like car accidents and shit you know I've never like went hunting I've never actually shot a squirrel with a BB when I was like a little thing I'm gonna kill that little guy sorry sorry squirrel but what I'm saying is I've never hunted anything and killed what I you know what I ate and I don't know how I'm gonna feel you know I might I might shoot a deer and be like okay fuck this I need to get some beats because I'm done with this or I'm like well you know what if I didn't shoot that thing it would probably get hit by a car or it would get killed by a coyote or it would you know it's like it's going to die so what is it forever and become magical what's the term you use fair fair chase fair chase what does that mean that means you don't set up bait you know put out like bait and and leave food in a very certain a certain spot over and over again so that you know the animals will be there in Texas they actually have feeders where they have these giant drums that dispense food on a timer so in the morning the deer just start walking in because they know they're gonna get fed because most of the time you're not hunting there because they have giant what they call high fence ranches and these high fence ranches it's essentially like they've converted they've done like a mixture of farming and hunting because it's like it's really like farming I mean you're just harvesting meat the the animal you're in a bind the animal walks out the spot he goes to every day goes to get his food and blew me his heart blows out of his chest and he's done he lies there at his legs kick and you turn him into meat and you cook him up and that's that's a way more humane solution for sure than a factory farm no doubt about it and I'm not criticizing it but that's not what Steve Rinella does what Steven L it does he believes that the the real satisfaction comes from like stalking the game finding the the right place to be whether you're you know upwind or downwind and getting away from the the area where the animal can you know detect you and you know and stalking and hunting an animal the way people did thousands and thousands of years ago did you read did you read that book Born to Run no so what is it it's it's called Born to Run by Christopher McDougall it's an amazing book he's a contributing writer - I think Men's Journal or outside magazine or something like that was a hugely successful book that that shut this door this people are so anyway this guy went down to the Copper Canyon in Mexico which is this really remote area I think it's in the northern part of Mexico but you know below the Arizona border somewhere and it's like a land lost in time like it's impossible to get in and out of there and there are these tribes in there called the Tarahumara and they're like this this population of endurance runners that essentially run barefoot with these little they have little sandals or whatever and and they'll run incredible distances and and in the course of the book he gets to he gets to sort of commune with these people and it goes into kind of like ultra running and the barefoot running movement and the history of how the runnings you know how Nike sort of created this business around running shoes and it's it's fascinating but one of the things he talks about is this theory that man evolved as a persistent hunter as and that and that we were we evolved to be endurance runners because we would go to chase down these animals that were that are faster than us that have much more fast twitch muscle we could you can't run as fast as them but eventually they just they get exhausted like they can't run days at a time and these humans would just you know patiently like sort of track them and just follow them and follow them and follow them and then just wait until the animal I killed over out of dehydration or exhaustion and that's how they would conquer the animal and bring it back to eat people still do it today right and so so the idea that we were sort of bred to be endurance athletes or runners out as a result of this you know thousands of however many thousands of years of doing this that's fascinating so did they did they use weapons when they first did it or do they just like strangle him and hit him on the rock once they yeah yeah I think it was sort of like it was really dry so exhausted that there wasn't much need to do anything severe like they'd keel over they'd get him or the rocker wouldn't be passing if we really knew for sure it's like really funny when you have like things like that like how did we develop this ability to do this when do they figure out about persistence hunting and running it'll be really amazing if we could know for sure it's so funny about how much of like the past of human beings it's like this weird just ideas where you're trying to like piece it together and like formulate like a vision of how things went down it's really hard to just extrapolate that across you know and apply it to a certain nutritional way of living like you know with paleo it's sort of all right well Paleolithic but you know how many how many thousands of years ago are we talking about our millions of years ago four million 40 million 40 thousand right what is it where your body what what part of the world and you know certain people's evolved to you know had it approach to food because of what was available to them in a different way than somewhere else and and piecing that puzzle together is you know I mean it's tricky and they just started finding some really interesting things that that show that you might be dealing with far far older societies than we think in in the first place like they're always pushing the dates back if like when people figured certain things out like there's some cave art now that they've discovered now that they're they're looking at like 40,000 plus years ago I'm like okay this is like this is just throws things way back right you know there's it's it's really a fascinating thing trying to piece together what human beings how that how we become what we are right now and what what led us to this point this this apex of 2012 the the whole process of hunter and gathering of I mean that's what people a lot of people say the the thing went wrong when we developed agriculture that's when the thing went wrong then we figured out how to have a surplus because then we had to defend that surplus and then we had this big fucking fort but that was also sort of the the birth of civilization and the and the intellect Taganrog it swirl went wrong man we fucked it up fucked it up by thinking we could have been having a great time back in the spending a week chasing down one gazelle yeah the video where the guy does it he doesn't in Africa the video that I saw and he's fucking persistent hunting so he just how long did it take him forever I was a long day and he just kept chasing this fucking thing and at the end he was so tired and they said that the guy doesn't even heat it the guy who kills the animal didn't even eat it out of respect for you know the process or you know the connection that he has to the animal you know which we that's the the weirdest thing and I think you know the one of the weirdest things about human beings is our lack of connection to what food is you know people that are they get upset if you want to go hunting yet they're wearing leather people that eat meat but would never kill it themselves it's like we've really liked figured out a way to completely disconnect people from the process which I just I can't see that being natural well if you know this ignorance but denial and disassociation are very powerful and they're they're powerful defense mechanisms for just getting through the day yeah how do you fix that how do you how do you is there a way to to its inspire in the classroom some a different way of looking at things so that people don't grow up to be the same fucked-up pattern monkeys over and over and over again well it's weird because in some ways it's I feel like it's changing and it's getting better and then in other ways I feel like it's moving backwards I mean when you have the internet you have all this unbelievable you know amount of information available to you where you can find out anything in an instant and you can get to the bottom of you know what's happening in subject X that's like a good thing right like it pulls the covers on a lot of people and a lot of organizations and what-have-you and yet at the same time you have traditional media that's becoming even more and more entrenched you know it's sort of like remember when we were kids it was like the local news and that was how you got your news you know and it you're gonna believe what they tell you and and now it's with the internet it's you watch the news and you're like wow I don't know if that's the whole story and yeah they saying this and it's easy to go online and and you know extrapolate upon that and find out more and figure out why they're not telling you this part of the story or that whereas you didn't have that before yet at the same time I feel like we're more and more entrenched in this fear-based culture in which there's a clamp down so where does that lead us like is ultimately does that like implode on itself or like weird how does it all play it how does that play out that's the question right I mean it is playing out and I think believe it or not without sounding grandiose conversations like this are part of the decision-making process it's a part of how society looks at it about about how we approach it because there's a lot of people that are like you that realizes this is that this is not natural this is this whole thing is bizarre and it can go wrong it can all go wrong behold this fear-based culture that you brought up the idea of the the lack of civil liberties the lack of privacy that we really have in this country now the laws that are being passed over and over again that allow people to look into your stuff because you might be a terrorist I mean how did we not learn from the McCarthy era how did we not learn that the way is not to crack because we're distracted we're distracted by our iPhones and the Kardashians and you know what I mean like people are there is a malaise you know and and technology you know plays a huge part in that in distracting us like again it's like the matrix you know it's crazy well I've said it's weird because you used to be if you were to talk about this kind of stuff or proposed any of these ideas you were just a crazy conspiracy theorist but now it's there's too many crazy things going on to to not you know realize that there's a lot of truth to all this stuff I mean everything from like the the label on the front of a food product that you buy that's telling you this in that would you turn around and look at the nutrition facts panel and you realize it's nonsense or how about genetically modified foods well that's saying have you looked I mean after the pits you know to that many the people that are making have you looked down the road 20 years and found out what people are gonna what's gonna happen when people eat these well that's because you know alter the environment like you bring your pests you're developing a fucking thing that has a natural pesticide and humans are not we're not wired to be forward-thinking or to consider the long play you know no we're a bunch of scary creeps button-pushing who's that was recently somebody said I heard this but if all the insects died that if all the all the insects died the the whole would be dead in 50 years or something like that but if all the humans died the earth would five would repair itself I believe that yeah yeah that makes sense I mean just the the mass of ants and the jobs that ants do people don't understand you know gazelles have to be there then that means you have to have cheetahs you have to have something that cleans things up and you know ants play a very important role in the removal of shit that we leave around I mean ants have you know when you leave something on the table and the ants swarm it that's they're supposed to do they find shit on the ground they find dead bodies they find everything they and they they go to work what about all this craziness with the bees it's weird yeah it's very weird it's weird because there's a bunch of different theories and no one seems to know what the fuck it is some people say it's cellphones and that the extra cell phone signals are fucking with the bees and I've talked to experts and they say there's no doubt about it that it has an effect on the bees then though the frequency that they operate in that they can pick up bands of radio waves and things because their antenna I mean they communicate with each other we had a thing on fear factor once when we covered these people in bees and when we were we were out in this place called sable ranch and it's a huge ranch and a natural hive of bees was at the ranch so there they have all these bees on these people these local bees came flying in like a giant group of them and they all made a huge cloud in the sky and the bee handlers like all right everybody let's back away from this everybody get way back they got to work this out so they worked it out they communicated with each other and they found out who was who and then the local bees like separated and they let the bees that were this guy's honey bees the train be I don't know they're never trained you know the contained bees I guess you would say let them go about their business but it's like there was some communication going on and this guy said they had to work this out like that's how he described it and I go what do you mean work it out like what's what's going on here that's incredible I was amazing cuz I what's amazing is that nobody seemed to give a fuck you know the I was I was baffled by the like are they up there talking are they talking right now his bees were like they all got together and I was amazed that this guy knew was going on that he knew that some local bees came in and he knew that that's all they had to do they just had to get together and talk I'm like how often does this happen he's like it happens all the time the bees find out there's some other bees in their area well how the fuck are they finding out I guess they send scouts maybe they have one God's like dude there's a fucking hundred guys I never met before how does this come out and then come back and communicate that information to get everyone else to come out yeah they say they do it through pheromones you know there there's a lot of them there's a lot of confusion about how they do it and what what level of communication they actually have because they're so alien to us I mean they're what they fascinating if they're using our cell phone networks for par just texting each other I think they're just getting jacked I think our cell phone network like jackhammers in the area they don't they can't find them either I know it's sort of like where are they where are they going well they're not disappearing they're dying they're not breeding properly right yeah it's crazy and if we don't have bees especially honeybees we're really fucked we need to come up with little robot bees do a better job than bees there's a little tiny microscopic robots that go out and pollinate shit what is that so hard yeah why do you have to have drones to kill people in Pakistan bees need some drone bees so complex if we have this badass be there's less complex and we control that with a motherfucker all it has to do is pollinate I don't you know we can make our own honey I'm pretty sure we don't need bees for that right can we figure out a way to make artificial honey they say that local honey from the area that you are contains protection from the local ailments like say if there's local colds going on then it would be a good anti antioxidant or not not cure but a good prevention from from catching local colds that raw honey and raw food really is where it's happening that was the real problem with milk for a lot of people is the the the fact that you have to get it homogenized pasteurized if you get raw milk it's way easier to digest I don't necessarily know I mean government crazy well I mean that whole thing I went down in Santa Monica they're still in what there was that there's a was at the Santa Monica co-op or there's someplace in Santa Monica that was selling raw milk and government like clamped down the head they like raided the place I guess they'd given him a couple warnings or maybe it done a like a mellow raid earlier and they kept they kept trying to sell raw milk and then they finally went in like guns blazing and shut them down there's always lawsuits now but yeah they get the guy sound like a million dollars bail or something right right right well that what I found out though is that raw milk is still legal you can buy raw milk in this country in this state what did it what did the guy do that way I don't know some regulatory issue but sprouts in Woodland Hills has raw milk they do yeah there's certain companies that in California sell raw milk yeah hold on there's uh there's a famous raw milk company and they they they list where they sell it and they sell it at quite a few different places yeah I mean we need to find the law on that because raw milk I was under the mistaken impression that it was illegal because they pulled it out of Whole Foods right raw milk Los Angeles yeah let me see here yeah yeah you can get this web sites that are and what happened with that guy in Santa Monica because that was a gnarly situation there's actually a raw milk store in Hollywood shout-out to the opie DC hub a raw milk store where you can buy raw milk in LA mm-hmm oops every now and then it sickens 10 people raw milk sickens 10 people well you know the thing about raw milk is it's like the thing you're not supposed to be able to take milk and it sits on the couch or it sits rather in the refrigerator for a fucking week and a half and it's still good that's crazy like that doesn't exist in nature you can't take a steak and leave it in your fridge for a week and have it looks like shit smells terrible cuz it's rotting you know and that's that that's going on with your milk too like at a certain point in time like it's not gonna be good anymore you can't just but that homogenized pasteurized shit you just leave it in there look weeks later stays good yeah you open the top weeks later you smell it you like it's fine that's crazy I mean we've figured out a way to preserve things and make them all fucking funky did you have a milkman when you were a kid for a very brief point in time I think my grandparents did because I do remember it but what I don't think it was our house but I do remember it so I think it was my grandparents but they had like a glass bottle with a foil top yeah exactly does it I mean dude does that even exist anymore and what somebody must offer that service there's always these like small companies like grass-fed is a big issue now with a lot of people um specifically before we end this I wanted to find out what is wrong with what the Paleo guys are saying and in your opinion and like what uh what what's faulty about their thinking what's faulty about their thinking well I think that that what's problematic for me is this idea that it's this look it's a low carb focus right it's low carb high protein I think the focus is to eat like people ate thousands of years ago because that's our body set up yes essentially like just vegetables I think that the the research on how we ate thousands of years ago again going back to what we talked about before like you know there's there's holes in that so is there yeah I mean we were hunter and gatherer so there's a gathering part to that that gets overlooked in favor of the hunting part because that's a little sexier I guess it is fun but the idea of eating you know such a such a like the no grain thing the no fruit thing all of that to you know focus on the meat the saturated fat the high protein the low carbohydrate is is sort of in a certain respect is kind of an extrapolation of the Atkins diet you know which is where this whole idea of you know this way of eating which helps you lose weight relatively quickly but also can cause you problems if you know with ketosis and eating too much protein which can which can be damaging and so as it you know as an athlete like I don't know how you're supposed to function without eating more carbohydrates like I couldn't do it without eating plenty of grains and fruit and that's just speaking from my own experience but my biggest thing is again going back to what we talked about earlier which is which is this incredible incidence of Western disease that we have to deal with you you know and when people are dropping dead of heart attacks left and right and it's a gigantic problem and you know diabetes obesity Alzheimer's all these kinds of things and there are studies that link animal products to the incidence of these disease and the to me it makes more sense to eat plant-based and the studies show that when you eat a plant-based diet you can actually you know prevent yourself from contracting these essentially foodborne illnesses so that's so it's not that I have some huge beef with paleo per se I'm just more Pro plant-based diet and again I think there's you know a lot of cool stuff about paleo like I love the evolutionary fitness aspect of it you know this sort of return to moving your body and the kettle balls and the focus on core strength and how that birth CrossFit and all of that I think that's that's just fantastic yeah there's you know and it's certainly you know I think that a plant-based diet and a paleo diet have a lot more in common than they do differences when compared to a standard American diet for sure what standard American diet isn't even really a diet it's just a filler I know but the problem is that if you ask people 90 percent of people if you ask them will tell you they eat healthy when in fact it's probably like one percent of people that actually eat healthy or everybody wouldn't be Keeling over with heart disease you know and I think that heart disease starts when you're a teenager you know you start clogging those arteries at a very young age and you hear these stories of like I had no symptoms and then I keeled over from a heart attack well you've been working on that disease for twenty years you know what I mean and it's a real problem and it just doesn't need to exist and so from everything that I've read the best way to prevent that is to cut the meat and dairy out of your diet you I don't know how to I don't know how to say it any other way so why do the paleo guys deny this and the pillow guys seem to point to the fact that there's an actual benefit to eating meat and that a vegetarian diet or a vegan diet does not have all the nutritional benefits of meat eating protein eating diets I don't know why they say that because I don't I don't believe that to be true I mean if they're saying that you can't that you can't you can't thrive on a vegan diet I mean it's just it's an it's a ill-founded it's an ill-founded statement I mean I think even Rob himself said you know lots of guys do well on a vegan diet and he said he tried a vegan diet and and ultimately he lost a ton of weight I think he said he lost it you know a whole bunch of weight or whatever and I can't remember why he said he decided to not do it anymore whether he wasn't feeling good or whatever but I'd be interested in knowing what it was that he was eating because I think most people that say yeah I try to vegan diet didn't work for me area I felt lousy well I don't know what that means you know I mean you can be a junk food vegan and eat terribly and be be nutrient deprived for sure you know so it's not about it's not about eating Tofurky and fake chicken fingers it's about the Whole Foods you know the whole food plant-based diet and that means you know similar to paleo getting rid of the oils you know or or you know reducing the oils well not the saturated fats but the other fats I mean this most you know most of the plant-based oils aren't don't have saturated I mean coconut oil does or a couple that do but you know it's actually still some of the other yeah exactly but but those also you know contribute to arthrosclerosis and stuff like that no just oils and oils in general coconut oil can continue well if you are yeah I mean there is a certain contingent of the whole food plant-based diet movement that basically say no oils oils in your diet what yeah but I thought that as oils are essential so for brain function and for their these are these are the people that are this is like the dr. Esselstyn and the T Colin Campbell like the hardcores or whatever and they're speaking to people that have suffered heart attacks or you know are in seriously poor health and are in a position where they really need to reverse a condition that they're in so it's an extreme situation personally I you know ie oils I put coconut oil my morning vitae max I like olive oil am i dressing or whatever I try not to overdo it I do dishes about it but I feel like I need that in order to you know get the calories that I need to train the way that I want to train yeah because there's a lot of people that believe that fats and oils or that they're critical to to brain function not only that there are very efficient source of energy especially in endurance sports because you know every gram of fat has you know much more whatever-it-is kilojoules of energy than a you know gram sugar or gram carbohydrate really mm-hmm so you're better but it's metabolized in a different way you know what I mean like in in endurance sports you're always looking at you know sort of what what zone of exertion you're training in and that can be calculated by heart rate like we're in a heart rate monitor or on a bike by a power meter that measures the amount of watts like the force that you're exerting on the pedal and you can be very specific about what your exertion level is and how that correlates to which energy mechanism you're using and so when you're an endurance athlete you want to really emphasize the fat-burning zone which is like the lower intensity of the aerobic the aerobic zone of energy which is kind of like just below that that level where you feel like you're you're getting a little too winded you know what I mean and that's it's a certain level of exertion in which you're metabolizing fat for energy as opposed to glycogen and if you're metabolizing fat for energy you can essentially go all day the more you train that that mechanism it gets more and more efficient but if you are if you're exertion ramps up and you're burning glycogen and all of a sudden for energy you're only going to be able to go about 90 minutes before you run out of fuel you can deplete your glycogen stores you're never going to deplete your fat stores there's just too much of it so you can train your body to burn off fat instead of training your body to burn off what are behide rates your training your training your body to utilize fat for energy so it's not like you're you're you know there's a difference between dietary fat subcutaneous fat but we all have no matter how lean you are and how matter you know I've gotten very very lean you still have a lot of fat in your system that's available as an energy resource and how do you train your body to do that by by being very specific about the training zones and the exertion levels that you're that you are that you're that you're doing whether it's running swimming or biking so for example cycling is like a perfect machine for for the human because you can rig it all up to a computer and you can be very very specific about what your output is you have a heart rate monitor you have the bikes these days have a computer on them right so you have your power meter which registers the force you're exerting on the pedals and watts and then you can extrapolate that out after a ride what your average Watts are for that ride and then you balance that against what your heart rate was at that particular Watts what the grade you know how much elevation gain you had what the exterior temperature is and you can create these insane graphs and look at it and like make judgment calls about where your fitness is where your weaknesses are and adjust your training program accordingly and so when you're training for endurance or ultra endurance again it goes back to really emphasizing that fat burning zone that aerobic zone because because the more efficient you can be at that you can you can you can improve your speed without doing that much speed work I'm not I'm not saying this very articulately but for it I'll give you an example when I first started doing this endurance stuff out and wanted to stay in my zone - which is the aerobic zone I would have to keep my heart rate when I was running below about 145 initially when I first started running I couldn't if I ran faster than like a 9 or a 930 pace my hair I would go over 145 and when it went over 145 I knew I was no longer in the fat-burning zone that I was getting into the glycogen burning zone but by staying in that specific heartrate region over time my pace increased without my heart rate going up which which is telling which is telling me that I'm becoming a more efficient athlete at a certain level of exertion my body is becoming faster and more efficient so by training less hard less less physical exertion you actually improve your boundaries in a certain respect yeah I mean it was explained to me initially like if you want to go fast first you're gonna have to go slow yeah and build that build the foundation of this machine from the ground up and that doesn't mean there isn't a time and place for speed work and you know super exertion work at a higher intensity zone but but the key to success in endurance sports is really emphasizing that that aerobic zone training in efficiency more efficient and so for example when I first started doing this training and I'd go out for these crazy long training sessions I come back I'm starving I'd be eating you know as you couldn't eat enough food now the toll that it the the tax on my body for doing a similar workout like four five years later is de minimis compared to what it was before so actually my appetite has gone down even though the training has been the same if not more difficult so the body adapts in other words Wow tennis fascinating stuff so um how often are you wearing a heart monitor while you're training wait you're always always your key I never did I always buy them and I just fucking leave them sit then I just work out I just work out hard and then I'm done well you know coming from swimming and what it was like in the 80s you know is always you know go hard or go home and no pain no gain it's like if I had an hour to work out and I was gonna go for a run as hard as I can you know as fast as I can in that given hour and that's the best workout that I'm gonna get and actually you know the truth couldn't be more different so if you want to get better and that's the problem with a lot of sort of amateur athletes that want to do marathons or 10ks or even like shorter distance triathlons by training that way of just kind of using the time allotted and going as hard as you can in that allotted period of time you're gonna reach a certain level of fitness and aptitude and what you're trying to do but you're very quickly hit a glass ceiling and you're gonna plateau and you're not gonna be able to break through so what is the way to break through the way to break through is to step it back and really again go back to building that foundation from the ground up and focusing on if you slow down and really focus on improving your aerobic efficiency and it's time-consuming it takes time to do this then you are building a platform upon which that speed work which you will do later is going to catapult you into a new realm of proficiency so it's all about it does make sense it's so it's all about pushing the heart rate at a certain pace maintaining that certain pace for prolonged periods of time and then building up to the point where you could do that easier and easier and easier and that is your aerobic base and it's not about these wild Sprint's - your heart wants to fucking explode it's it's actually about building up your ability to maintain a heart rate even though you're doing more work maintain the same heart rate of 145 that we were well yeah I mean that's just my personal example but I mean it it requires a different kind of discipline because you kind of have to check your ego at the door you know what I mean and and sometimes you want that feeling of like I just exerted myself I feel like I did some work I got something done and having the discipline to say every workout has a purpose and the purpose of this workout is I'm gonna run for an hour and a half and my goal is to never let my heartrate exceed that zone to threshold so go save lap dogs I'm gonna finish the run and maybe I'm not even gonna feel that tire I might not feel like I was like I don't feel like I got anything out of that and believing in that program and sticking to it over time to build that house do you think that that's a good way that someone should approach martial arts as well and that like strength and conditioning for martial arts like say kettlebells or something like that they should also do the same sort of a thing maintain well it's a little bit different because endurance sports are so much about efficiency of movement you know and over a prolonged period of time whereas something like jiu-jitsu or what have you is about explosive speed but at the same time you're gonna be in the ring for a prolonged period of time if you have this sort of lung capacity and stamina to endure you know longer than your competitor so that you're fresher in that last round than he is then you're gonna have an advantage so I think that what that would mean and certainly I'm no expert in martial arts or what-have-you so I don't want to get schooled for yeah the wrong thing but it would seem to me that in the offseason or you know quite a bit of time before you get into your training camps leading up to a fight you would focus on doing a lot of base aerobic training work to kind of lay that endurance foundation and then you build upon that with the specific strength and explosive speed exercises to you know have that pyramid come to a peak when it comes to fight day well one of the best fighters in the world Nick Diaz is a known triathlete I mean he's he's constantly doing massive endurance work and right the thing about Nick is that he puts guys he puts him into a pace he sets him up like when he's when he fights he pushes a pace that other guys can't compete with like he uses his endurance he uses his very strong endurance base as an extra weapon it's an extra yeah I think that's that makes a lot of sense because he can he can just keep going he's swimming back from Alcatraz twice I mean he's got ridiculous endurance right and because of that you know that's he's like one of the scariest guys in the world because that because you know you're not gonna wear them out you're never gonna wear them now it's impossible he'll be scrambling deep into the fifth round well you're gasping for air he'll be fine and he talks shit to you why he's beating on you terrible he's at the same time pretty sure he follows uh basically a vegan diet as well yeah that's what I thought yeah he does it for performance reasons I think Jake Shields does as well I think Jake may eat eggs occasionally but I think that's it for a lot of people who don't know I didn't know if I was 30 that when you have an egg it's not like something died the chickens to slay those eggs and if they're not fertilized by the mail through sir doesn't get in the henhouse those eggs are just they just go to waste you can eat them you don't even have bad karma dude what could someone is there a book that someone could read about this this conditioning thing I know that for a lot of people that do jiu-jitsu this is gonna be really fascinating for a lot of people that do anything athletic what is a good book that they could read about heart rates and well they can read they could read my book what tell us what it is what's your book my book is called finding ultra actually can i grab it i yeah please do i would love to read it is it on that Oh boom and this is your life story is it also yeah I mean this is uh it's essentially it's essentially memoir it's like my my personal story but it has a lot about how I sort of reinvented myself as an athlete and how I had to kind of relearn some certain principles about fitness that I grapple with and didn't understand initially that sort of allowed me I believe to reach a new level of fitness Heights that I certainly didn't think was possible particularly as a middle-aged guy and you did this all through that method of building up the aerobic base yeah and I was training for a very specific thing that is you know not what most people are training for but the kind of principles that we were just talking about I think are applicable to you know the this sort of weekend warrior athlete whether you want to you know go out and be able to feel good in your pickup basketball game or touch football or whatever it is it's how to use your time crunched days effectively you know rather than just going out haphazardly and saying I'm gonna blast this thirty minutes on the treadmill and do it time and time again and wonder why you're never getting any faster so um so people can get any answers to any questions about conditioning and what you learned from finding ultra gonna get that on Amazon and my choice yes everywhere it's on Amazon Barnes and Noble and if people want to reach you it's rich roll RI CH not Rick not that fuckin Rick Astley this is not a joke rich roll the real rich roll just like the real rich Ross but a different guy and you could find rich roll on Twitter just rich roll RI CH rol is it the best way to get ahold of you that's better information right now I'm on Facebook too and my websites rich roll RI CH ro ll well listen man your story's an awesome story I love a comeback I love I love a guy who figured something out in his life and makes a change and then spreads that information and your inspirational dude and having you on the podcast was really cool and I would love to do this again yeah we keep talking about this forever yeah yeah but I I had to stop myself from the endurance questions I would have bored the fuck it I know it's like forgetting a little technical man I don't know if people really are gonna be some people will hopefully thank you thank you very much man really appreciate it so rich roll out and follow him on Twitter go to desk watch TV you dirty bitches and pick yourself up some funky ass cat t-shirts oh and and they come with a free sticker too so you put it on your call so people come with a free stick stickers how they pay for that sticker
