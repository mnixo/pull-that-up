hello Bridget hello Jeff what's happening nothing I'm so excited made it happen we did happy sober October the first podcast ever where Marshall is in the room oh my gosh I feel so honored you are honored this is a special one he's just exhausted and I knew he wanted to just lie down next to me my dog always comes through the YouTube show and we're always like oh just gonna knock over the lights in the middle but you see her come in and out in the edits well when red Ben and I used to the podcast back in the day we stood in my office at my house and my kids were really little so I'd hear like screaming and crying the background so thanks for doing this thank you how's this house over October going it's great I want to thank you for doing that why is that because it creates a community and it's super cool for people to just have that month of clarity I just think it's really cool I'm grateful it's my sober birthday in October so I was like how many years six years that's a lot no that's that's insane it's you said weeds the hardest part yeah weed is are you sure you need to be sober from weed yeah I've tried because here's the thing here's the kind of you really want to know what kind of addicts I am I will I can do it for a while I've tried so I was in rehab when I was 19 for heroin and I started using everything when I was 12 13 years old well not everything but I mean I started drinking and smoking weed I mean a girl all over I moved every year and a half it's lying story um my my whole thing sounds like an improv and like I'm making it all up but it was just chaotic up rain but I'm from the East Coast and then I graduated from high school Minnesota so to give you we just moved a lot I went to like 11 schools in 12 years so I started drinking really young I started smoking weed right around when my parents got divorced and then I was pretty much a daily smoker from the day that I found weed it was like oh my god I like 14 I loved it a release was an escape was it just a perturbance of normal you know my my upbringing was kind of chaotic and honestly I think that I Oh we'd a debt of gratitude because I don't know that I could have been fully present for what was going on and in the house and and and not like killed myself or had done something worse it was just too much for like a small developing brain to handle and we'd put enough of that nice like fuzzy distance between me and like chaos I'm gonna start it it's just gonna be me alone crying I had no idea it was and so it was it was good except then I s callate it after I was drugged and raped when I was 18 oh sorry not to get heavy it's part of my story it's horrible but bad shit hat like one of the things that I've had to come to terms with as you know I don't blame myself for that happening but I I do have to take responsibility for the fact that when you're a woman or a girl and you're out getting blacked out and in this instance you're around people who are bad things happen that are not good it sucks but you know if I had daughters I would be like watch your fuckin drinks and like be careful and don't get don't try not to black out cuz you don't know what is gonna go down there are so many people that I know that have been drugged yeah I know I know the thing about that that's so weird to me well a I don't I I try to make light of everything because I have to do in order to survive medium and I'm from the East Coast it's just how I handle shit like my family's from Rhode Island my dad's one my dad's one of ten it was a roast battle growing up yeah you either if you were the sensitive one they're like oh you're gonna cry about it you couldn't survive you had to just be like I'm on top of it that is Rhode Island Boston Connecticut yeah you're getting and you either keep up or you're like you're out you're out you're the loser in the family and you're drinking - obviously sure heavily so he died unfortunately was like if you're gonna do that like use enough to make sure that I don't come to in the right don't be an amateur bro like it because I have memories of and kind of came to so it was like I would have preferred just the nothingness of you know if being lunch like stuck in my subconscious things what was the whole Cosby situation like for you then I wrote a whole thing about it because I wrote this piece on medium Bill Cosby raped me kind of because we're not because it's a little baby because when all that stuff came out I was like oh really ladies like you're gonna come forward now and I had to stop and like evaluate my own my own cynicism and just response to that and writing is pretty much how I process everything it always has been and so I'm like I'm just gonna write about this and see what comes through and essentially it was that internalized shame that had I had been holding on to was I was projecting it onto these women who were cuz if a bunch of girls from Minnesota I came forward and said this sleazy dude you know drug doesn't raped us back in the 90s yeah I'm 40 I'm 40 so yeah it was like the 90s I would come forward and and support them in support of that if it was the person who did it to me I wouldn't be like come on ladies it's a little late for this now right but that was my kind of gut instinct I don't think it was I like I said I think it's internalized shame I think I just I I had not forgiven the girl and me either the young girl and me who blamed myself I didn't tell anyone when it happened I I woke up and of I'm lucky I'm not dead I'm lucky I made it to get sober six years ago when I look at how my trajectory was and so I ended up like kind of coming to and the weird thing about roofies is that you don't really remember so I like thank the guy for having it you know it's like oh thanks for letting us crash in this place I didn't even mean to crash at and I think and then things started coming back and one of the my friends I think something happen to her - and and it's crazy I'm telling this story just based on what happened last week so I just went we went to like the Apple River which was this place in Minnesota and just I got blackout drunk for like the next five days I couldn't I couldn't handle it I felt ashamed because I was drinking underage I had I was working in a restaurant I had a lot of older friends we were downtown in Minneapolis I felt super cool and my friend and I both have the exact last memory and then I have memories of like crawling around on the floor and trying to find fault like just bad things and um I always hesitate to tell them - because I don't know they're guys they're like yeah tell me more defensive mechanisms and yeah so then I just went bananas I started doing hard drugs that year and you think you did that as a response to them oh yeah I just was trying I was already running from so much there had already been might and that was a tipping point yeah my my stuff I was a little crazy I don't really publicly talk about it all that often but it was like whatever I met like crazy stepdad do you like it yeah I think you can figure things out and it was really chaotic and and then that kind of escalated my drug use I found hard drugs and like then I tried speed and math and I hated it because my brain already races I don't need any help with that that's rare though that somebody doesn't like speed and math oh I hated it I hated it get on that stuff no no no I don't I'll of heroin I didn't get like it heroin is like that maternal like womb I think it's also I don't I don't need stimulation for my brain I need I I always wanted relief from this were you snorting it what parallel yeah and smoking it and you ever get to the point of shooting it it it was right before I quit so once and then I was like I'm gonna die essentially cuz you realize like I was 89 pounds in nineteen I had like one of those hallmark movie moments I had been out here with a boyfriend and he had a movie and we were just like it was like Sid and Nancy movie I was parent I was doing so much blow I had delusions of like a movie meaning he was making a movie he was in one movie and we were out here and it was just chaos and we were like it was this shit that I did you get into comedy that was and not for a while thank God I got dared to do that and 2010 basically and so somebody dared me to do it and the comedy stores where I popped my cherry and it was on like one of those bringer shows and it was an absolute shit shell like every fucking stereotype that you ever heard people were doing blow at the green room and like everybody it was like Holly were in the belly room man no it was on the main stage but it was one of those like me it was a it was when isn't like the years before the yeah you were around from 2007 yeah so you you got there in the darkest days oh it was fuck he does say the darkest days were like 2007 till like 2012 it was dark and then my set went okay enough that I decided I wanted to like do it again but that was many years after after the like trajectory so I long story short I ended up in rehab and 19 and I was there for seven months seven months I wasn't halfway so you were arrested no I put myself in a halfway house but it was like does that work like you put yourself in jail no it's not jail how can you how come you can put yourself at a halfway house because a halfway house like that in between jail it's not mandatory they let you put yourself like hey look I'm fucked up you mind if I just hang out here for a while I couldn't go home because of my home stuff and so I basically after two weeks my insurance was up and they're like okay you're free to go I'm like I can't go I mean three drugs in like two minutes and so they'd let you stay no I took a bus and put myself in general assistance and Minnesota the joke is it's Minnesota our land of 10,000 treatment centers it's like a great place to get sober and so I put myself on basically welfare and then I found a place and I'll never forget I called this place and the woman answered it she was like I was like hi and I had had some guys try to do stuff to me so I I was looking for a woman's place and this woman was like yeah who ever said ok what's that like here she's like you ever heard of boot camp like sounds perfect I needed that structure I needed something and so they I basically because I was on welfare they accepted me and it was like me and I was the only white girl I was by far the youngest it was it was basically a lot of women just who the judge said like go to this program for three months and you won't go to jail there's nuts to that's an education oh yeah I mean I realized what a privileged little spoiled brat I was that's for sure and then I never but I also hide behind that so I never wanted to share anything and they're like it's all relative everyone has their problems and we can't but these stories versus mine they're not I feel like I just had too much and then I started sharing them they're like damn white people are fucked up now is when I learned it was really an early lesson and like all this intersectional bullshit it was very early lesson for me that like it doesn't matter it does not matter what color your skin is white like when you're an addict or when you're at rock-bottom or we're all humans just like fucked up trying to get out of our own way yeah and so that was that was an interesting experience and then I got in my car moved to LA well your fucking Twitter feed is hilarious you have one of my favorite Twitter Hey wow that's not like or retweet your shit all the time I love I well I I was recently in DC and somebody and they they said that oh this is Bridgette she's a Twitter celebrity and I was like what the fuck I've never wanted to kill myself on being a twitter celebrity Marshalls trying to say hi to you hey buddy hey buddy I didn't even notice he got up I'm sorry he's my best friend how dare you Martha yeah yeah that that I forgot where we were sorry you're talking about that's exactly my intersectional oh yeah hi Marshall come here no I knows he wants to play you can play you want to lay down yeah I just don't want to get in the way um um so you were saying that you realized that everybody has their problems doesn't matter if you're black or white yeah I really learned a lot those women it was run by lesbians they they like taught me some shit that stuck with me my whole life like cluttered room cluttered mind yeah I loved that one it was basically like they were very strict but what happened was I learned how to be a really crafty drug addict so I was like well as long as my room is clean I don't have a problem because I came I came to LA at 19 or 20 I guess and this was like mm and I started interning at this website called buddy head it was like this old music website and they were all Punk and they had the number-one gossip site for music in town at the time and everybody was obsessed with us with with this website and then feeling Marshall is a distraction here he seems like he seems a little restless buddy come here come here pal come here he's so cute though I can't bear to kick him out and gentlemen is a sweetest dog in the world seriously you've been asking for him to be on the show forever he's just gonna he'll do the rounds he'll go to you hi what are you doing in here he'll go to you who get Pat and maybe he'll get Pat but the I just don't want to interrupt the conversation now a little bit of a distraction that's fine I'm all over it I don't want to yank any wires out either hey he's going to Jamie now told you doing the rounds that's what he does there's such like love sluts it's amazing Golden's are love sponges so is my boxer she'll go sleep from one bed to another to another she gets all the love well he doesn't he's not allowed to sleep in beds yeah but he's uh he's very loved I've never had a dog like that before they're just so different than any other dog I've ever had because it's just he's just a constant friendly lover mmm no he never gets annoying with you it never wants to go lie down but he's always happy when you say hi to him yeah just start talking or unconditional yes I mean it's crazy those used to be wolves I know them into this thing I know domesticated themselves sort of thin they yes like a visual thing well initially but you know there was actually a display going on right now that I went to last weekend at the what's that Science Museum in LA what is it called yeah it's downtown the one next to the arena with the football arena I think it's the California Science Center whatever it is it's there's a whole thing on dogs okay it's a whole thing there's one of them it shows how dogs became dogs from wolves and the slow process of their ears starting to droop and their snout starting in short they became smaller and I mean every animal and this is something that they didn't realize I don't think it fell like the last couple of decades for the longest time they thought that wolves were wolves and dogs were a mixture of wild dogs and cannons and all these different animals and they realized oh no these are all wolves Wow fucking Chihuahua is okay I just have such a hard time believing that doesn't make any sense that's like saying a Prius is a car a Corvette it doesn't make any sense no that's true though yeah it is true they found out that somehow another human being is manipulated you know through selective breeding they took a wolf and turned it into like an English bulldog it's crazy but I love them well that's yeah she let him out just let him out because he probably he might have to pee or something like that and he wants to go talk to this he's going to the door because he wants to go get love from everybody else yeah all the security guys of all time I'm never so good to have around oh yeah he's like whenever you feel bad you just go to him and just he just gives you love and kisses their presence is huge for things that are pretty silent for the most part when my dog is boarded or whatever it's like what I feel like there's this like giant presence that's gone well you know what it is though it's like emotional candy like you shouldn't have candy all the time and you should have people in your life yeah right you shouldn't just be one of those fucking weirdo dogs yeah they're just eaten candy like oh I don't go to dog parks because of that oh it's so true right the dog park scene in LA as psychotic and there's always some more the dog that can't control yeah that's been me before too when I was one my one of my dogs one of my pit bulls was a puppy he was like five months old maybe six I would open up the door he would run to find the first dog you find him in the face bro like I had never had a dog like that before yeah I didn't know how to handle it I didn't know that like he can't this is a male dog with his balls and he's five six months old you literally can't bring her around less you like have them rigorously trained yeah and it needs to be rigorous like shot-caller someone yeah and someone has to show you how to do it correctly yeah that the dog after seeing two attacks in a dog park I was like okay I'm out no it's people bring fucking crazy dogs dog barks yeah and I treat my dog I mean there's some I there's some leniency but I'm very much like it's a dog I'm not one of the like let's trust in sweaters and have a birthday party for like no no that's it we're not having a birthday party for my dog we're not putting any kind of Halloween costume on this pet just my kids do all that shit to Marshall they do all that shit to him they dressed him up like a fish the other day they got him a fish cause I'm like nah he's a fucking dog with a crazy he's like I can't move this weird outfit on yeah um so you were talking about Minnesota and you're talking about here then he moves here yeah and then I went back east and then I was in the restaurant industry for a long time so basically I was in rehab and then I left rehab and did you start writing I always wrote you always wrote did you always publish things like one no I didn't know that you just do I started writing I mean my journal holy shit from that first rehab have you ever seen that movie se7en where he has like that's what my journal is Christ like why am I still single that movie still fucks with my head yeah I saw it in a theater and I remember driving home thinking I was gonna get murdered that was Kevin Spacey yeah I'm just realizing that now yeah being creepy as fuck yeah but one of his most brilliant roles well American Beauty was another one I think that I think oh god I hate saying this you think when it deserved it I don't think I wonder how fucked up you have to be as a human to be able to play someone that fucked up I know I know I go to that place yeah not just to go to that place but you fucking believed it hook line and sink yeah yeah okay like the Joker Joaquin Phoenix I fucking bully I haven't seen yet spoiler alert I no no it's fine it's been two weeks I know well I mean I'm not gonna spoil it but it was a dark week for me I couldn't go see it I wasn't emotionally strong enough well just because of some shit that happened that was crazy that triggered all this stuff from when I that we would started this conversation as you know as crazy it was like I'm crazy PTSD is real you know I hate I hate that the word triggered has been destroyed like it's been destroyed because it does when you have had trauma and there's a brilliant book the body keeps the score and he talks about how it lives in your body basically and you and he worked with vets and you know it's crazy like he in this book I've been rereading it again and he's talking about how when he was writing to get some from the VA to get like a grant to study PTSD they were like no we don't even really think that it wasn't even part of their profile which is crazy to think now that he wasn't part it wasn't even like a thing it was a granule shot it was yeah my grandpa I mean I have all my grandpa's I should have brought some at my all my grandpa's letters from World War two I mean that guy it's correct he would be getting bombed basically going on getting underway every single day for months and he's like the most striking thing to me is how he's like I don't want to feel sorry for myself I know nobody would want me to feel any self-pity I'm like we live in the biggest pussy generation of the entire we live in just the whiniest culture he's literally at war and he's like I'd hate to be whining I think why we have such a whiny culture is because things are so safe relatively yeah I do definitely because the people that are complaining for the most part the people that are egregiously complaining they don't have real issues it's just so weird I always see this like I am fighting for my life and like no you're not you're fucking your couch get in post maids your your your story like when you tell your story like that's one of the stories that like legitimately makes you sit back and go holy shit okay those stories nobody gets upset at you yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a little mean they don't get upset that it happened to you I mean they don't get upset at you expressing this like it's some horrible disastrous event your life because it clearly is well yeah and it is that's why I hate that the word triggered has been so destroyed because it is a thing that people have to end so in this recent this girl is my hero and this recent thing that happened it was like this person walked in into a situation and she looked a strut and like long story short we ended up at a rape trauma center together and it was you said she walked into a situation it's like we it's hard to she gave me permission to like talk about this if it came up and and so I'm okay with it just don't say her name no no no and I know I'm not telling her story no details of hers um so I was in a 12-step meeting and she kind of walked in and looked destroyed and I'm not one of those girls like hey look it like it's not like leave me the fuck alone but I saw the look I this is where I might actually cry um I saw the I recognize that look like it wasn't like I'm having a bad day in sobriety it was like something happened and I just made a beeline for her and I was like are you okay and she was like no I'm not and she's like something bad happened to me and we went left that there and then we went out onto a bench and we're I was like how old are you and she's like I'm 19 and young you know and and I was like she told me what happened and something bad it happened the night before and I was like well and I told her I shared with I was like that same thing happen to me at your age and I was like and she's like what you know like that look of like relief that somebody could understand and she's like what do I do I'm like well I know what not to do and it's nothing so and it I'm telling you it was it was like that girl is so brave T I'm like what compelled you to even walk into that into the meeting what come I wasn't even gonna go to that meeting and then when we ended up in that Center like the counselor was so amazing the nurse was so amazing every it was like a warm blanket of love was just wrapped around her and was she in sobriety like it was like I can't it's like not really my story to tell but it was a she was she was fucked up yeah so it wasn't like dead sober but yeah so it was just it was basically like my story that she was telling so it triggered like oh it was weird to hear my story as she's relaying it and I'm having like flashbacks so last week I was like her I haven't really told anyone I'm even gonna like talk to you or anything because some of my friend was like so what have you been doing to like get ready I'm like what I've been crying a lot and eating a lot of cake yeah like it's just Joe in a conversation but I think people think it's like it you know some people it is it is things get weird with people when when there's an event coming yeah well and it was my anniversary of six years which always is like that was Friday so um it was me you know it was amazingly healing like to to be able to just it was one of those moments where there's there's where something bad that happened to me I was like oh suddenly this has meaning like I can use this to help someone else and that's you know I interviewed this really brilliant woman who escaped from like a million things and her whole thing is like if you what good is our freedom if we can't use it to liberate somebody else and you know come circling back to like the world war two in this generation ayaan Hirsi Ali says that basically this generation is like they're like trust fund babies with freedom because they're so far removed from having to fight for freedom that they just take it for granted that's an interesting way of describing it yes fun babies with freedom that's a and she's just brilliant yes she is brilliant that is a that's that's a great way to look at it too but it's very hard for people um without struggle I think people don't know what to do yeah and they they create problems that don't exist it's a very common thing I think human beings are designed to deal with so many different problems that could come up in your environment physical threats danger all these different things community all these different things that you're designed to handle and when those things aren't there your your brain and your body starts to manufacture things okay a lot of people that you see that create drama online yeah you know if there's so many people that I follow secretly this is what I do I bookmarked their Twitter page and then I go to it just what I need like a dose of madness yeah and there's YouTube videos like that as well and you know that used to be blogs you could go and read where people were just obviously their real life is so meaningless that they're seeking all of this drama online they're seeking this distraction online and there's people that have followed that are involved in arguments 1214 hours a day and now and I can relate okay I truly can relate because I've been mad I'm madness like crazy yeah I've been crazy before and I'm still definitely a little crazy but yeah I get it now like I know what it is do you notice there be no oh no how do you know how did you figure out you were crazy like how do you how did you self reflect I guess I think I think I'm honest with myself yeah yeah isolation tank mm-hmm drugs mm-hmm the drugs that have helped me like so you know drugs yeah although those are looks whatever you tell your therapist you could lie to your therapist you can't a lot of mushrooms yeah mushrooms go what bitch yeah yeah and show you everything and so yeah all those different things will show you all the real problems that you have yeah I know what these people are doing I know that it's a sight people get caught in cycles of like creating bullshit and and then they get in cycles of like festering and you know Jamie kill Steen yeah one of things Jenna Jamie's a reformed super so yeah one of the things that Jamie told me who said like he would like say something about someone like this guys are not seeing a piece of shit yeah he would say it on Twitter and then he would be glued to his phone looking at every response you know every once it came in on Twitter and he'd be reacting to order freaking out getting anxiety from the people turn on him he'd be like no yeah then he would fucking fuck you and go back at him and he's just like this thing where you're trapped in it you're trapped in it all day yeah yeah Faisal and I were talking about this the kid from Iraq who is on my podcast and he was I was like it's so weird and you know they and all those like dystopian books it was like this wreckage everywhere and then you plug in to get to a better place and I feel like when I unplug it's like a Disney movie again and it's like chaos I don't want I don't want a flip phone I want one I know I know I like taking pictures of things I like having the option but I've done much better over the last six months of being way more disciplined with my time yeah yeah you know like sometimes I'll have my phone and I'll go don't don't do it so I'm like giving myself advice that's the same way I've become my own therapist yeah I've given myself I give myself advice on don't just randomly just start reading Google stories yeah yeah yeah I go I look for information I'm like there must be something but some of the funniest things that you do like my favorite of your routines are your rabbit holes when you take us yeah through your internet rabbit holes those are like my favorite bits that you do because I can't yeah cuz I can identify so much with that like you'll be and I always joke like I know I'm in trouble when it's like maybe 9/11 was an inside job because all roads lead to 9/11 was an inside job on the internet like that's just if you're finding yourself like mmm what did happen there you're like okay Gavin well the private eyes you can find no matter what the subject is even if it's completely ridiculous you can find someone with a compelling argument that it makes sense yeah and then you watch a YouTube video yeah and that the problem with YouTube videos is - there's no one standing there going that didn't happen that's not what he said that's not real no no no architects and engineers to nine eleven truth all the architects hold on hold on drill engineer hold on no no you're missing 30 seconds of that video with a Center building your abs hold on that happened minutes before hold on yeah the beams were cut during the demolition of the building that's not what happened you need all that back Jack game so you don't cuz you get a like a flat earth video you watch those motherfuckers you look what is this real are we really gonna go we're on a disk i watch that like zeitgeist movies like there's some good point there's nothing guys is not that's Peter Joseph's movie that's not completely preposterous yeah no that's a very good movie yeah but if it's not theirs I think any time like if someone wanted to write a blog on you like this is Bridget this is Bridget feta see there's not there's just one voice that's right you that's someone writing about you if you were there you'd blame well that's not entirely true and yeah I'm like that sometimes with 99% of time I'm not like yeah yeah cherry picked the worst aspects of me and write a blog about right you'd be able do that I mean that isn't but it's not real no it's not and that's the problem with someone writing a blog about you or making a youtube video about you right or even tweeting about you if they went on a tweet storm you know I read Bridget's 4 Twitter feed and she's a fucking rancid cunt in this way I'm fine I mean it's interesting too because you know you are very public I am very public there's a lot of material for people to draw from but still like they don't see me cleaning up my dog shit in the backyard like that's me you're the whole love you yeah tries to and even like I you know I have friends that have done stupid shit and someone said that guy's a piece of shit like no he's not he did a piece of shit thing right one time who hasn't don't tell me it's not a good guy for fucking 20 years I love them to death like yeah people are not a thing of one thing there are a bunch of things and the problem with like some like internet interaction is so incredibly limited because whether it's through Twitter feeds or or blog posts or whatever it is it's it's a shit way to get the whole picture across especially when you're defining a person yeah if you or you're discussing a subject like it's a good way to get your thoughts across at that very moment yeah but if you're a pretty like if you want to tell me that vaccines cause all these fucking horrible diseases and I'm like okay we hold up stop let's get some scientists in here yeah let's let's get some people let's have a fucking for our discussion about this and let's bring up peer-reviewed studies yeah let's find out what the fuck is going on you know can veganism really cure diabetes and cancer and it is all that shook really caused by meat well let's get some scientists yeah let's talk let's talk to people that have actually reviewed the data because there's so many goddamn documentaries that somebody goddamn video you know tell you know you can find anything you can firm anything you want to believe and that's the craziest thing and there's it and there's no check on that belief if you've decided is truly confirmation by it you're like here's what I believe and now I'm gonna seek out things to confirm that you should be seeking out things to debunk that belief yes if you're trying to be intellectually honest but most people it's not even really in our wiring to want to do that we just want to be right we want to be no I have some friends that believe every fucking conspiracy theory that comes on the pipet I'm sorry see there's they're fun I always send them debunking things they get mad at me you're like now is that it's but it's so easy to go down that it's it is a weird you we all kind of become like two-dimensional abstractions online yes so I had friends that I waited tables with and then what happened to me kind of getting caught in the crossfire of the culture wars is that I just noticed I wasn't saying things that I wanted to say and I was like why aren't I tweeting these things it was weird to me I'm like huh that's weird why am i self censoring and then I realized because it was and then once I started saying those things there's like oh this is why I'm not saying yes I wanna get in the war but I didn't even know the war was going on I was always going I was an idiot I was drunk waitressing and I put my head up in 2015 it was like there's a war controversial Tzipi controversial opinions there's always a war and you know on the flip side of it dear sir people want to believe the official story about everything and they're just as annoying as the people that want to believe every conspiracy I was not aware that the war included controversial opinions like boys and girls are different I didn't know that the thing had gotten the war had new rules and some Michael malice always gives me shit like when I was on as fuck ass cuz I've been doing all this when you start kind of speaking out against the left you end up on right-wing media because they're the only people who have a conversation with you and so yeah it's crazy so I go on like Glenn Beck and I'm like did you know that the left has different rules for themselves and he's like yeah no shit first yeah we we knew that we've been aware of this and I'm just like this moron is like can you believe these bandits deeply entrenched in that culture war you wouldn't understand how far it's gone and I was like literally just getting high waiting tables trying to make jokes trying to maybe get some of that TV money sell show and and like trying to pay my bills every single month this past February the first time since I was 17 that I knew how I was gonna pay two months of bills like that's a long time to be thank you I have some friends that are blissfully unaware and occasionally I'll send them things like I have a friend of mine and I was sending this article about all these different track and field events that are being won by men now oh god women not only that men that identify as women but you know that like in some places you don't even have to take hormones all I have to do is identify oh no way yes way yes high school kids like you can't force them to take hormones all they have to do is identify as a woman is different everywhere cuz no one knows what the fuck is going on so there's all these different rules everywhere you go I was getting my eyebrows done and my the woman who does my eyebrows Vietnamese and she was telling me that her kids got their ears pierced and she's like hi I went and like my the kids they got their ears pierced and my daughter who's not sixteen yeah I wanted one in the like ear top of her earlobe and the guy was like oh no she has to be 16 to do that and I was like yeah yet she can take hormones it's like it ohad the youngest of kids ever an article about this guy who's losing custody of his son because he wouldn't let his son transition at six my son went to his wife and the wife in him split up and the wife wanted to chemically castrate the boy and give him hormone blockers because she had decided that the boy was a girl whether or not the boy decided or not they still we're talking about a young kid and the guy was being ordered by the state that he had to refer a boy I don't believe it was California he referred the boy as a girl and he had to and he was gonna have only supervised custody now because he wasn't referring to he was not allowed to misgender his son his son was no longer his son was now a girl well here's the thing about all that shit it's like no one wants to fight against the mob of the left but no one there's no established science on any of this stuff and everyone's different I mean people that are trans yeah for sure of course are there young people that know that they're a girl from the time that they're young and they're in trapped in a boy's body there's so many of them to say they are I would be an asshole to deny that right but how what do we know about this how much do we know about this and how much should we interfere with their hormone or hormonal development well it's so important to like brain functioning isn't it this is that brain development and don't you change your hump day men if you're a if you leave them alone they just become gay men I've seen this online there's like a lot of pushback from some communities saying that it's very anti woman and homophobic but a lot of these things are kind of a rate it's like just right since our woman is the competition that and 10 also just like I can't you know sometimes you'll see examples of women can't talk about their periods or something because it makes like a trans woman feel bad or if you you know so there's this a ratio of like me being able to talk about something because it's it's like that's weird to me too I should be able to talk about my experience as a woman and you're ruining the experience for trans people but see that just it's all about compliance I mean that's what most of this about all these nut bags are achieving while they're tweeting 12 hours a day it's about compliance I mean most of what they're doing is trying to get there's one that I tweeted the other day over and over and over again in all caps she wrote any gender can have their period any gender I'm not playing this game this is where I draw the line I know that we just got demonetised but I'm not I can't there that's the thing I'm like do whatever you fuckin won I wanted to be a turtle when I was like sex yeah real turtle like live in the service know that our turtles live in sewers I wanted to be like a sea turtle like a ninja turn no I wanted to be like a turtle in the Bahamas I didn't even know there's a difference in a turtle and a tortoise until us 30 oh I know I don't I don't think I was aware that different name for turtles turtle in a water turtle they're all fucking Turtles I don't know anything really and so that's the beauty ones lived like hundreds of years TARDIS or sea turtles do too though oh I think so yeah but there's tortoises in Joshua Tree oh yeah right yeah yeah they're tortoises they tag I want to be a ranger today therefore when you're tripping what the fuck I'd put them there it's like they treat it's an artifact so when you're tripping how many people have tripped in Joshua Tree versus not tripped and Joshua Tree I don't know it's like 30 70 Tripp versus not sure I feel like I so enough to kind of offset a ghost over a lot now yeah like once a quarter so I'm offsetting those numbers do you ever do anything like isolation tank never do that I've always wanted to have one here if you want to do yeah I do I've always wanted to do that um I do I want to kind of go back and say like I don't want to disparage therapy I think it does help a lot of people it definitely does help me I think therapy is like comedy there's good therapy yeah and there's terrible yeah yeah yeah and and by the way certain personality types really are kind of untreatable so if you have like narcissistic personality disorder my therapist like the dirty secret is will kind of like pass them off to someone else or something because it once you realize somebody can't see it they're wrong they they won't really well I talked to therapists that about that and they said some therapy doesn't work because all these people are really there for us to talk about themselves yeah yeah yeah my therapist is kind of calls me out on shit oh so I like her my friends who have overheard overheard us because we FaceTime she because she's holdover from the East Coast she they're like it sounds like she's your friend and she's being kind of like hard on you but I need that I need somebody who's gonna III don't necessarily always it was interesting I just learned this past week that when you've had trauma one of the kind of byproducts is that not only do you not trust people but you don't trust yourself and I was like oh you put yourself in a bad situation right so you don't trust your own often like your reaction to it so my reaction to what happened to me was very I mean yes I was young and I can forgive myself for that but it was - I would be like hyper sexual after that you know I I and then I I recently last week at this moment where I was like God all the like men that just didn't deserve me and this is one of this I mean I really was like I felt like I was revirginized or something I don't know what happened but I suddenly was like wow I I don't I suddenly have self-worth it's like well this is one of the you know where I'm squishy I'm squishy and a lot of things and I think feminism is really important and to like shit on it is there are women who died and got jailed for like the right to vote so that doesn't sit well with me but the some of the excesses of feminism and of the in particular like sexual liberation is that I was told sex is empowering and it's not fucking empowering if you're not empowered already like in my experience you were told sex is empowering it's kind of well it's kind of the messaging is like you know women gonna have sex too and just like it's it's like it's some empowering whose name more of an anti shame thing because like what shamed further they're sad yeah and I think that's why I think that I understand it I understand why that would be the but I feel like what got lost is that sex is very intimate and for years there's like intimacy is so creepy I just thank you I didn't make like eye contact no no we're not doing that that's not happening and it's I do yeah thank you yeah yeah the back we we I just didn't have that I I don't know I just I I missed the memo that it should be something I was taught that it was you know like to kind of with hold because then a man won't respect you which feels a little bit transactional so there's that messaging and then there's messaging of like free the nipple and be empowered and like you can have sex with whoever you want but if you have trauma and you're not really great on the self-esteem Department and then you start trying to sleep your way to empowerment it's only gonna create in my experience for me it created a lot more shame and a vicious cycle that was like very connected to addiction for me to sleeping your way to empowerment is a funny concept well suck and fuck your way I mean I'm not gonna throw the baby out with the bathwater and I know I can already I can you know the problem with my brain is that I can I'm always like contradicting myself so I can that's because life is complicated yeah and it's not it's not binary like sex is good sex is bad like there's different situations where it's good and different situation where it's terrible for you yeah and it's just the whole weird writing for Playboy at so to ask me us when I started writing I always wrote I wrote that piece Bill Cosby rape me kind of that was a great title thank you and then I ended up Twitter was really how I got every connection in the writing world I started somebody hooked me up with an editor from Playboy and there was this piece going around that was like why I don't suck dick and I'm like well someone needs to stick up for sucking dick and that person needs to be me and so I pitched to playboy like in defense of why I love giving blowjobs basically and I didn't know again cuz I'm like a child of the 90s he was just high I didn't get the memo that now a lot of that is seen as like internalizing the patriarchy like literally not eating pussy sucking dick but how does that work oh that's okay but oh it's only okay dick is internalized well taken into your body well no just some some went the whole point of like that not why I don't suck dick is that it's like it's a degrading experience which it can feel that way and I would say anything can feel pretty special and it's not it's not a it's not this or that you know like sexuality is so fucking complicated that's why I loved writing for Playboy because it is everything it is shame and fear and intimacy and love and passion and all of it like it all happens in sex and in those messy relationships and the whole consent culture thing which there again like they're good things that come of it but then there's another thing where part of it where I'm like how are we going to hack something is awkward as sexuality when you're especially when you're liking and your hormones in your again it comes down to compliance the whole consent culture is about I mean look consent is imperative it's important it's everything you don't want anybody doing anything without your consent however this idea that you should ask for consent before every single step of the way can I touch your left left leg yes can I touch your ass no not yet here we see that video no it's a great video it was like teaching consent it's this consent can be hot and it's like this guy and this girl kissing and the guy and the girl the guy's like can I kiss you she's like yes can I touch your shoulder yes and he has to say to every step of the way he's at but it's always the guy but it's explicit - it's not guy the girl's neck can I suck your dick of course you'd have to ask questions there's like the idea that the girl has to ask is ridiculous right yeah yeah so if you have a video with the girls asking the guy everybody's like what the is this she's asking if she can fuck you that is crazy can you put it inside me yeah yeah like no one does know it does that has anybody ever said that ever yeah but asking the guy for consent is one of the most ridiculous ideas ever if you're making out that's consent well be and this is a difference between explicit and implicit and there's so much a consent that occurs it's implicit and that's some of the sexiest stuff right it's really talked about it yeah it's and it's learning to read that body language and read the like she's you know hold it want compliance that's what it is there's people crazy people that have no life and they're on Twitter all day the power trip thing what they're trying to do is get people to bend their behavior and change it to their will but why because they're nuts because they enjoy power tripping right like why do people why are people saying stop using guys stop saying guys stop using gendered language you ever see that video which one whether there's been in front of the social oh that I was gonna say that's right like permission for a point of personal privilege yeah I made fun of it a dumpster fire fucking video is amazing yeah but when the guy guys can just stop with the chatter because I have a really hard time paying attention I've seen and then the guy who's like the trans woman gets up and says please stop saying guys stop using gendered language like oh my movie no it's insane reality has become parody I I was watching someone was saying like please stop using the mascot and it had like thousands of retweets and it was like please stop using male and female the binary needs I'm like no well you know Todd Phillips director Joker yeah one of the things that he said in who's talking about it so he's really difficult right now to do comedy right yeah it's just like he's doing an interview they're like why are you doing this like really dark superhero movie this dark action movie like he's like well fucking hard to do comedy in these days I mean you know you guys don't understand that this net so he used the term you guys and one of the reporters that criticized it was calling you know say Todd Phillips is a piece of shit and look how he uses the term guys like 1 points though the main points this person made was that he was using the term you guys like that guys cuz everything is the patriarchy like what it's gendered language language you know that's and this women use it all the time I use it all the time I use retard all the time it's I know it's not good it's not good but it's not bad here's a thing about being on the East Coast though it is but it's also it has nothing to do with a disease there's no the problem is it has to do with people literally being retard dead like retard like slowing down the progress like a person who thinks the earth is flat that is a retarded way of looking at the world yeah and if you make videos about it you're slowing down scientific progress if people get caught up in usually going to be canceled together I'm hoping to get canceled you keep trying your dredge so you're like South Park this is what I think I just I think what what's going on right now is just like this K period of adjustment to our ability to communicate with each other openly and across the board and in this weird way through social media why are we responsible for everyone's feelings we are not but this is the world we live in you you are responsible by your language and jokes that you tell you if your jokes are offensive you are responsible for literally every person's feelings in the audience not necessarily Bridgette here's the thing it's such a small number of people yeah they're so loud this is what we saw with the Chappelle special yeah right right tomatoe refused by Rob's males they decided for whatever fuckin goofy reason to make it reviewed by five super woke critics they gave it a CEO percent they open it up to the public he gets a one hundred percent right what the fuck are you talking about everybody else says it's awesome and they're gonna like it more because they don't like you assholes that say it's zero well in the critical theory guys you know like James Lindsay you've had and they're great but they're the whole idea ninety nine percent and 35 percent yeah at least the tomato meter went up a little bit with the critics yeah so listen many laughs to either oh my god edgy but empty sticks and stones won't break any bones that it won't listen many laughs I I mean this was it I don't know it's James Lindsay I posted something today he just he just posted something today to just said oh my oh it's about diversity in in medical institutions and that they think that people who are at the head of of medical institutions they should have tenure because we we by this will it would take 50 years like some Smallman posted this thing like forget about competence this is their hair it is what does it say diversity leadership diversify leadership researchers say term limits may create more opportunities for women and minorities in academic medicine like term limits like forget about how competent you are at brain surgery what we need is more brown women in your part during your part it's so we're gonna teach them how to be brain search so what I've learned from them is just that it's it truly behaves like a religion like woke ism yes and this is the piece that I was writing I think I quoted you and Bill burr and just I was saying like comedies last stand and about around Chapelle and how his the his special whether he meant to do it or not go is like right after every single one of their tenants you know it almost like strategically he goes after ever and I would say and everyone's like oh it's reactionary its reactionary I'm like no they're fighting they're not reacting they're fighting back well that rotten tomatos is the that's the battleground right that shows you like this is the ideological battleground right it's very small number of woke people versus the vast majority people that don't turn to comedy to have reality define for them right into it to laugh right these people relief these people are trying to define reality through all forms of art and they're doing it by again trying to get people to comply with their very rigid terms of what you can say the way you can think whether you're punching down or punching up and how you treat people and how you treat minorities and trans people and I just get to the like why why I mean why it's a power trip I understand but what because I don't I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and so I know that they wake up and think and that's the weird thing about the time that we live in right now is that literally everyone on all sides thinks they're on the right side of history and I and you and I were talking about this like that before we were how weird like Trump derangement syndrome is where it definitely exists on the left and there's like the craziness and the people who literally see all day lying there online tweeting about Trump I'm like what how do you feed your children there I imagine they have starving children just waiting for like dinner and then on the right you see it with like he can do no wrong so it's like these the maggot and resistant strains of of Trump derangements and in its and it's so it's like most people don't live in there in either one but they seem to have the loudest platform but that's there you know it's in the right the further you go left the further you're right the conversation they get together because they do when I was getting attached of working at playboy you retweeted it actually and it was why and you had no idea but it was I wrote on women date assholes because you're a pussy that was like the first column and they were testing me to do a column and you just so happened retweeted so you probably got me that job so thank you and I didn't realize because I got attacked by like all the like dudes on the right who were like I'm kind of beta dudes and they were like I'm not a pussy I'm a good guy and then Austin and then there are all the people I'm a little left the like radical feminists and they were like you can't you know this is toxic masculinity and I was like exactly the same you should date how to solve the problem well I always think it's hilarious when a right wing person of a Democrat date ah how do you make that work maybe it's just like hate fucking yeah Pelosi no fuck me goddamn complicated we are very complicated so that's what was so weird about working at playboy was I got there right when they went not nude like one minute it was like McDonald's being like we're not serving fries anymore sorry guys it's like new coke like what yeah why would you fuck with coke so that was a weird time and then it was a lot of transition but just writing for men waking up to the fact that there was this culture war and then writing for men at a time when it was like anti men right I didn't realize that it happened either I was like still singing this is a man's world like you my mind and then suddenly I was like oh there's a there's a sex war going on - whoo I got the idea behind me - like I was also sexually abused me - I didn't get the times up like the other thing if time's up times up for what like what is the time up for it's such a common phrase like it's so weird when a guy like I can't wait to see you and I'm always like hashtag me - cuz now it's become a joke yeah I know there's been enough Asia Argento is enough you know hypocrites enough for the crazy one but it is important you know because I mean circling back to what happened to me last week and in my young like childhood it's important that these the you know I see that woman that I that the 19 year old as my hero but also the culture is more supportive of her going and saying something and it was not 20 years ago at all so that is progress you know that's definitely progress yeah does that but progress is not clean no progress comes in these ways knocks rocks over x over pile on and then everybody rebuilds and then figure out where the fuck the ocean line is now you know the shore line moves everything moves and that's been the weird thing is that it's I I you know I was joking the other day that I'm like you know sometimes something will happen with Trump and I'll be like all right that's it you know like sign me up for the resistance I'm gonna be marching in the treats in the streets in the minute they're like uh yeah and what's your gender I'd be like I'm just out I'm out hey them I have a friend whose daughters they are they she calls herself they well I would be you know that's the other thing too is that you you latch on to these things when you're a kid of course you're totally gonna be ripe for having that happen to you so for sure ya know your have like - they them's babies they call me baby baby it people are raising their kids as they be I just say let them decide what they know I don't push them in any one way or these kids are gonna be so fun it's like a fucking Disney ride that was a weird thing when I was working on the this is also another weird moment I'm having right now because I listen to so much of your podcast when I was trimming weed and anyone who's trim weed knows you do it for like 13 hours at a clip and go crazy and somewhere in an alternate timeline I'm trimming weed listening to me this was all that that whole culture and it's so funny because the way those kids revolt like the way they rebel all the like hippie kids who grew up with like their parents on acid losing them you know festivals and shit and The Burning Man kids like one of my friends she joined the army I'm like yeah this is what happens that's how they rebel the kids they grew up with all this crazy shit they're like yeah I'm gonna be I'm joining the D fuckin a mom that's what I'm doing yeah yeah if your parents are drug addicts you become sober and a marathon runner yeah so your kids are gonna be leg you know it's day dad I'm pretty good no I'm not I let them do what they want to do I'm not like not that rigid yeah I mean I have like rules and stuff but there's also a lot of communication in my house yeah yeah I think that's I mean I know what the fuck happened when I was a kid dry real hard to not make any of that happen to them yeah yeah were you like come from a crazy upbringing it was crazy wasn't bad they're nice but they were distant absolutely was born absent but they were working yeah a latchkey kid when I was a kid my parents have worked all the day yeah you know and then when they got home I was going into martial arts yes never Roma at least you had martial arts that you probably would have been a freaking hooligan oh my god that saved me from the time I was 14 till the time I stopped fighting that saved me Wow because that gave me structure yeah yeah no structure and it teaches yourself self-discipline yeah it teaches you to respect the whole idea of discipline that's what I love about Jacko the whole discipline equals freedom discipline egos freedom is fucking all where do you see the post my wife put up a post of marshal with a watch on I love it he's so inspiring you know that way like is that blood or is it sweat sweat with Joe he's a fucking Savage he's like jungle really does get up every fucking morning at 4:30 and works out like a beast but I think there are some men where like they should you know well we should be there just like born warriors and in this society where there's not really it's so kind of easy and it's not like there it's what do you do and as we were talking about I think a lot of that energy of like the negativity I always say to people online and my goal build something because I know from my own experience that if I'm if I'm not using that energy creatively I'll self-destruct right it's like it goes inward or I'll project it outward and I'll tear people down or whatever because that's what you see yes make something acting all the time well discipline is a very important part of being a healthy person and and for men I think there's a certain amount of energy that you must expand you must see and you must you must blow it out of your system yeah and this is actually why I'm very grateful and again for you and your platform because I know from writing for Playboy I would hear I would say hey guys what do you think about going bald and I would get these like long letters from men who had never asked like hey how are you doing dude and they would tell me these stories are like what it was like to lose their hair what it's like for to have Edie or whatever and it there was not really a space for in in this culture or there's not the the male magazines have been kind of taken over by the there's not really a space for men to just be men noise spaces podcasts it is and you get but you give these guys a voice and for all the shit you get you I feel like you use it responsibly for them you could be up here being like go cuz a lot of chaos guys and let go get whatever and you're trying to you know better yourself and therefore help other people to matter themselves and ask questions and like it's not like you're up here you could be doing a lot of bad shit with us you'll be wielding this weapon like you know you could run for president let's do it but yeah I think that there's very few legitimate outlets for men because everyone has to be you have to go through the filter of executives and producers and all that if you're gonna put something out there like some sort of an entertainment product it has to be filtered by the network it has to be filtered by all these other voices and if they want to keep their fucking job they're not gonna let you just be yourself right there's no way they're gonna try to mold you sir what about the diversity what you need is a girl sidekick to balance you out because everything you're doing is so masculine and people gonna be really turned off by it and what about girl voices you know I can't believe you two guys are on there and you know you're talking about gay rights and there's no gay people in the room you need a gay person and then actually you know fucking this woke round table it's a goddamn disaster and Men again they don't look I have no problem with anybody saying like you can if you have a podcast and you're a guy you just love taking in the ass go do a podcast called take it in the accent have a good time yeah that's you but and if there's no one filtering you and no one's stopping you you can really accurately reflect who you are you can act accurately project who you are yeah but if you're a man just a regular man who likes manly shit do you like do you like hot rod do you like fights do you like tits do ya you're a piece of shit yeah and in this day and age if you have that these these normal male desires yeah fucking every male has everyone yeah the gate called toxic manic masculinity when every man has it there's no outlet yeah yeah cuz everyone has to the everything has to be filtered through an executive or a director and then what shadow does that create so every time you know what you resist persists what you repress creates a dark shadow so when you're taking all of this masculine energy and you're constantly beating men over the head with how bad they are it's not going anywhere now it's just going underground and it's gonna leak out and weird fucking ways because they're not allowed to express themselves and the problem I see this all the time is like oh toxic masculinity toxic masculinity let men be men let men share their feelings and then it's like they do and they like shut the fuck up they want men to change they want men to adjust and they want men to look you can be a really good person and also be a man yeah I'm manly man yeah and I don't think that you can they think that you have to evolve and change because the men that are a part of that are all pussies and there's a lot of those guys out there there's a lot of those that don't like manly men and they want to think there's something wrong with someone like Jocko there's something wrong with a guy who likes hot rods and Ted's and there's nothing wrong with a guy who's not a manly man either like there's nothing wrong with that but they're competing right right male feminist is competing I saw somebody with like a sis header Bubba and I was like oh you're awoke dude trying to get laid it's like whenever I see that in my head around normative I'm like okay so you're just the that's all they have but they have to do that like I had a bit that I was doing about male feminist or oh they don't exist find me a male feminist that can pick up heavy shit and run fast they're not real they're not real you know Serena's people have been to me online other than like in cells and radical feminists blue checked liberal dudes like some of the like the like allies there are the people who have come the hardest at me and then the most cruel to me about what they're just always on my nuts about you oh that's that's exactly what it's like what are they getting after you about um what was the last one you know I think I said something about it like tulsi big you know how they're like ah she's a foreign ass and everybody's like you're a fucking idiot and and they they just as I kind of started just speaking my mind and the weird fucking hard thing about being a feisty comedian and somebody that sometimes writes more serious pieces is that I get to I I don't mean to but I danced that line of like it kind of cracks me up when people get all outraged it kind of makes me laugh I can't help the comic in me is like that's my I'm supposed to be pushing the envelope and buttons and I you know the free speech stuff I will die on that hill that is literally a hell I will die on that's the old a dime and that is when I say when I see these like the the sides going I'm like okay yeah we got to push against some of the corruption and this is getting mad over here and then I'm like whoa okay this is a Thorat Aryan and insane and you can't say anything and he's so many of these woke left dudes are mush they're mushy they're made out of mush like come run a hill you're made out of mush do a deadlift that was I remain out of mush those are my favorite Bilborough jeans ever of the guy screaming on the plane where he's like and he's like that is the screen which come from a woman or a child he's like no grown man should ever have that coming out and he's like that's like if the and he was talking about how animals would be like stay away from that one Lindsay because it is I don't I don't think I was thinking about it I'm like I don't think I've ever dated a liberals because they're there I don't know I don't think so I don't not in them not recently because I like my man masculine which you could be masculine and also be liberal I'm pretty liberal yeah yeah I know you are I know I I'm not saying that I you can be masculine and liberal i I just doesn't happen that often I think they're all taken would you like snatched up pretty quick by the liberal women are like I see what he's the Unicorn it's well and I think too we come from a different generation so that it's more of a struggle maybe now than it was like back when oh yeah I think there's something wrong with it now which is not good so crazy no no it's it's and I think most women many women I am feisty and opinionated like I can't have a guy who's not gonna put me in my place as much I can't have a man who's gonna just let me walk all over them because I will yeah it's normal it's natural and no one wants that well I think there's a natural inclination that certain women have with weak men to push them around it's normal I think you you're you're testing the boundaries of what you can get away with and not get away with communicating with each other well and it's also the whole like concept of nice guy it's like well you're not a nice guy you just were trying to backdoor your way into dating me by being a friend and it's manipulative George Peterson talks about that Jordan Peterson says that you you don't want to be a nice guy you want to be a dangerous person it's nice a dangerously nice very not a dangerous person who is nice but just being a nice person all the time like you're you have to be nice well you're nice because you have no choice a Dane you want to be a dangerous person who chooses to be nice there's a big difference that's interesting because you have a choice to be nice or to not be nice and I want a dangerous person when this shit hits the fan yeah everybody I don't want son everybody does what a dangerous woman - yeah yeah you want someone who can figure it out yeah you know what mush my people are made at a mushy that we're making more mush yeah if there's anything I think in this life that is unfuckin bendable is that we are making more mush and how do we how do you think that we hopefully and that you know I find that I do what I did as a child which is shame the mush went through a whole fucking litany of chaotic events that shaped you and you had terrible things happen you when you learn from them and then you became who you are but I don't want it don't have to do with them no but my point is using how to how do i how do you inspire people who might be attracted by this kind of you you know the reason I started my podcast is just so that people could tell stories of grit and resilience because I find that what happens is we'll start talking about the victimhood culture but then it sounds like we're victims right and I don't want to do that either I want to build something written resilience but how do you you know I worry that these young minds are being indoctrinated and this is what I always ask them like the women in particular with like intersectionality which seems like this race I'm like play the tape forward for me where does this lead how does this lead to self-esteem how does this lead to feelings of empowerment I mean my therapist and I talk about this all the time how hard she's having how hard a time she's having with the younger women because they're all coming in with this sense of Perpetual victimhood of everywhere you go like that it's the patriarchy and it's everything is depressing you and and how the whole idea of therapy is to get you out of feeling those you know going from maybe being victimized feeling like a victim to taking that and and being more empowered I don't exactly know what you could say to young women because I've never gone through that experience but for sure for young men they need something that's difficult yeah young men need difficult things in their life like like those out they need country waters or whatever that doesn't thing anything up for me I always tell them jujitsu involved in jujitsu so cuz I don't getting involved in martial martial arts that involves striking is fucking dangerous brain damage is for keeps right that shit for the rest of your life that's why I'm so adamant about trying to get fighters to quit when I think they should quit you know and when when they've hit this wall and they come to me for advice and it's happened many times I'm like you got to stop you got to stop there's no offense or buttons don't look for that fucking pot of gold at the end of the rainbow because you already been knocked out four or five times you got to stop yeah is if you don't stop you're gonna be a 60 year old person that shit's their pants yeah yeah your wife's gonna have to walk you to the car and you're not gonna know where you are in a supermarket you're gonna get lost like you this is what happens this is real so striking striking arts they're very dangerous I think you got to know when to get off that fucking boat you gotta know grappling is a different animal yeah Appling you could teach people jujitsu and I went to jiu-jitsu with a guy was fucking 62 years old yeah 62 years old this guy I was like how old he meant like sixty to Mike holy shit purple belt yeah 62 going after it yeah trying hard training his black belt I'm like good for you man like it was a fucking cool conversation that to me is something that I would encourage young men to do because it's really difficult and in the beginning you feel hopeless and then as you get better at it you learn oh my god with hard work and discipline and I just fucking keep showing up just keep showing up and figuring it out I can get better at something it's a very difficult thing I can use that as a vehicle for developing my human potential and also I realize that I can overcome struggle right I could overcome these things I can overcome and I can get better and then also the exertion of energy the just going out there and fucking exhausting yourself you're more calm and peaceful and then there's other thing about jujitsu is your constant physical contact yeah people need hugs sounds but many even hugging each other it sounds like maybe gay or something I don't care but it's good it feels good even though you try to kill each other it's connection yeah connection is important and you need to other hood there's something about that camaraderie that you have to have reassess in jiu-jitsu that's unlike any other Kumari ya experience because you not you don't have there's a certain resentment from striking like if a guy beats my ass if I go spar with some guy he beats my ass next time I see him like I'm gonna fuck this dude up I'm like um I don't like him that much he hurt me yeah yeah yeah like I went home I have a headache cuz I gotta hit me with a punch yeah so I'm thinking I'm gonna fuck him up and like this is like what men do like inspiring and sparring oftentimes what turns into fights jujitsu like you could choke me an armbar we could choke each other and then afterwards it's all love clap hands and thanks man and people tell you how how they caught you or they tell you you know I almost tapped there and we'll laugh about it like I wanna there's a really great class that I've been wanting to take and it's a Gracie and it's women's empowerment but it's all just like self-defense the one in Beverly Hills okay but it's an amazing class I like sat in on it because I like it as a woman it feels like the most realistic you know I feel like I can actually use it and it sure just is the most realistic for women just to get away you know just in any event yeah did you find yourself just to get away I'm not gonna sit there and fight I but just give myself that window of an opportunity that I might you know just a chance the fighting chance cuz otherwise yeah no well Jiu Jitsu is also something that someone who's a weaker person can effectively utilize on someone who's stronger right right so technique based yeah I think that that is you know one of the things I've learned from all the men who were writing into me a Playboy is I'm Jordan Pederson has something that really speaks to these guys and you know I've seen him get a lot of crap but like he has saved so many men that I know I mean these guys have written me letters like telling me it's so much and I'm not sure really what it is about his program or whatever whatever it is that he's saying his message well he's concentrating on young men meaning he has he's resonating with young men because of the discipline what is those what is primary he always talks about cleaning your room what clean right make you bet messy mind messy clatter run cut away yeah the same thing he's essentially saying clean your room yeah I mean there's there's so much to what he's saying that expands far beyond that as well and you know his movies are get he says this is a documentary about him right now the rise of Jordan Peterson is getting censored well these people are protesting it being in these theaters they don't know they think they're supposed to censor him they think he's transphobic and homophobic and all these different things but he's helped so many people but you know his origin do you know what happened in Toronto no okay there was there was a bill that was being passed was gonna force you to use one of you know there's the this gender pronoun bill like say if you wanted to use one of the 78 different gender pronouns you would be obligated like legally obligated to use them he was protesting against that it's like you're using compelled speech speech they didn't want to repeat it wasn't that he didn't want to use their preferred pronoun it was that he didn't want to be compelled to use oh you didn't want to use made-up words either right because there's these are gyms all these different crazy made-up words yeah like like you you want to be Ave you want to be a he or she like like what are we doing here yeah and what are you okay if you you want me to call Bruce Jenner Caitlyn Jenner okay I'll call okay thank you only seeds or her okay I'll say it's alright I don't care I don't go but you want to start making up words and that's where he's like no and you want to and you want to call me at help and you want to call me a bigot for not letting my kid get hormones like this is where this is where or the sports thing I get very like that's insane it's insane there's there's a bunch of different schools that are letting kids compete in the gender that they identify with and those in those places those those women's track events are fucking dominated by men dominated they're breaking World Records was that woman's name Rachel McKinnon she just broke the world's record for the cycling event and she used to be a man I mean all the anything like you're a bigot if you don't agree with this now you broke the record how'd that happen what is happening here what's happening here is you're a guy this is really want a gun this is when I feel like I'm in a simulation and and there's somebody who's like let's see how many people we can get to like get on board with this shit right and then and I or I'm like maybe I'm just old maybe ya know what's getting at what's happening is women are getting fucked over that's why this is the most crazy I get called a turf a lot but they're in the middle of this ideological battle and women are losing scholarships they're losing their ability to compete with people of their own gender this is or their own sex their own whatever you want to call it whatever their chromosomes when you start adding trans men and trans women into the mix you're gonna get two things depending upon the sport the trans man are gonna get fucking smoked period when Trant when women transition to men and they want to be a man and compete with men they're gonna get fucked up in almost every sport particularly fighting it is funny how much it's gotten men talking about periods like you know I'll see men defending like a woman's right to talk about her period I'm like yes that's right now you're a feminist what man has ever had a problem with women talking about their barriers no no I know but so there's they exist they guess they're squeamish that is so mushy that's mushy man guys are scared of pussy blood you're not scared of a bloody steak but you're scared of Aegina below yeah there's today art school there are guys who are squeamish about it and there's another one yeah there's a it is it does feel oh banana I read something somewhere where it said you know that there was gender like stereotypes were being determined by biology and now we're using biology now we're using gender to determine biology as so biology determined gender stereotypes the male and the female whatever and there was a reaction to that and now it's a reaction to it they're using gender to determine biology and how it's get it yeah it's like it's so maybe is this just a bra spectrum of people and there's low testosterone males there's hottest rafino and that should be okay we should be allowed to be whatever the fuck we want and then but the thing is that the low testosterone man can't compete the high testosterone males and the high testosterone females can't compete with a high estrogen females and there's like if you want a Barbie doll and you're built like the Hulk like you know I mean like if you're if you wanna be Barbie but instead you're you're built like Tom Arnold I know it's yeah yeah Ian's always wears vests just type lesbian the wears those Patagonia vests everywhere right I have a Subaru my brother's like come out come I those thick ones with a wide waist just I get called an alpha wet all the time that's what the in sales company alpha Widow it's a term a widow yeah you google it and everything it's like a woman who chases after alpha males but they're not interested in like wiping me up and so I end up a widow that doesn't make any sense but what I was gonna say is it like it's like that realistic body types yeah yeah like this is a thing that gets brought up all the time okay maybe but they've even had these promos and these advertisements taken down particularly in the UK there was a big story about that because they were promoting unrealistic body types okay one of those guys try to do that to one of those Vox guys was trying to no it's not I'm trying to like say don't follow these gate is it he's a gay guy you're saying don't follow these gay Instagram thirst pages because they're promoting an unrealistic body type and I'm fucking gay guys just attacked the power we had a shot as his fucking Instagram down for a while because guys don't play with that shit they don't like that unrealistic body type you could pull it off on some women though yeah it's unrealistic cake yeah but it's not unrealistic that's a real woman oh yeah it's just not your body or it's not typical well look if you're a fucking a person i'm 5-8 if I look at a LeBron James 7-foot tall man well that's an unrealistic body type no it's realistic yeah play a bass professionally he's a real person yeah fucking hard is that unrealistic it's just unachievable for me that's just this is what it is right that's what that's what you got that's the fucking hand you got yes nothing to do with realistic or unrealistic if you see a girl and she's got a tiny waist and a big ass and big tits she's just got that Jennifer Lopez Jean fuck yeah that's just her she got lucky you didn't get that lucky that is realistic yeah now if they're using that to sell fucking Fanta or Adidas shoes or whatever the fuck it is so what if you're saying well all these girls feel terrible because that's unrealistic that's life that is that is life yeah that again we come back we come back to why are we responsible for everyone's feelings get get off the fucking couch and go do something about it if you don't if you don't want to if you don't want to feel sad no one cares about the fat dudes fat dude fuck off no one cares no one feels bad about fat dude well they get away with the whole dad bod thing which I wrote a whole piece about got like buds that bod dad bod isn't an excuse to be lazy though I know some guys do will lean really into that but like it's a dad but I'm like they're like they like it yeah they kind of get away with it cuz it's like you know guys get like cute adorable little dad bod and women get like Fupa I don't think so though no girl wants a dad bod do you think the only reason why a woman dad Baz because they know that the guy has like glass options he's more likely to stick around alright okay that's good dad wise like where you going bitch sorry I'm gonna fuck you they're not either one but I mean look I'm sure some women like guys they like yeah yes and I think some women like more like girth and me like a little bit of weight yeah yeah some girls like big thick women too everybody's different everybody I just think that if you like somebody that's here to your point is that it's fine whatever you like whatever your type is if you're into like a big dude if you're at whatever but the people who like people who are fit are somehow now beans shake only thing that's changed is people's ability to express themselves online through social media that's the only thing that's changed and because of that people are yelling about things that don't that that they can't do do you get fit shame odd you called a meathead I guess that's fit change yeah yeah discharged yeah I don't care but you if you're ashamed me for being in shape like congratulations okay I don't care it doesn't work yeah what do you feel great get your summation thank you for being successful oh you got me sorry sorry I figured out a lot of shit it's such a weird this is the weird the weird world is that it feels like we're raising the you know where the bar is and it's being lowered and lowered and lowered and so instead of raising our standards and trying to everybody lift each other up it's more just like a very small majority that's like calm down but again it's a tiny amount of but we've been talking about it it has an outsized influence well it has people reacting to it they're bending towards it but I think it's it's temporary you think it's gonna like eat its own tail like that was never be woken up yeah each other they turn on each other this I don't think it's real I don't think it's real yeah look they're certain but as the people always are gonna like and there's certain things that men are gonna like a certain things that women are gonna like it's just it's just the way it is I do think it gets sorted pretty quickly like in in in natural disasters you know I always say this I'm like you call yourself whatever you want and the other interesting thing is you know your computer knows better than you whatever you're saying online yeah they've done studies and it's like it doesn't matter what you're saying online your search engine knows what gender you are essentially yeah I mean it can generally tell like probably with a large accuracy search results it would be fucking super obviously but I think that we just live in this really confusing moment in history so I guess my fear is that the they're the the youth are in ingesting all this kind of confusing for them yeah it is it is but it's also there's look as much as I like to make fun of wool culture the good thing about it is is making people more sensitive high grades making people nicer yeah but not not necessarily nicer because so many people that were broke are using that as an excuse to be a fucking asshole to people right to force compliance and be an asshole but because of that because of that it's again it's like the timeout and it's it's gonna find its healthy level yeah Gen Z is amazing I have nephews Origen's E and they're so funny note the other than ooh they're like they're basically like 19 and below so and they're just so um I don't know they're just funny like my you know three years ago my nephew they're they've already taken all this kind of woke language and they've they metabolized that yeah they're like they're like dude mom she was so triggered and they didn't mean it like she was she was like getting bullied or anything she it was like a girl who got a bad grade and they were already using the language yeah they're already taking it and memeing it know why podcasts yeah yeah they listen to podcasts oh man you listen to it all the time and there's a huge small ben shapiro cult of like 12 to 14 year old boys it's no joke no it's really funny the moms who hate him well that's why yeah i mean all my friends i have a lot of female friends on like the west side and they are all super live you know like cried for three days acted like it was 9/11 I'm like dude boy after Trump with the glasses oh yeah watch every week it's very very tell me that lady didn't know her cameras on her no but that's he fucking knew yes that's half the reason why she was doing it this book meet you have to read the book mediated it's my Bible for this time and I read it in 2006 Thomas stayed Xango tisha it's he wrote about it's essentially like how the how we're all self reflexive and he talks about this how everyone and when everything is mediated everyone knows they're wrong they know what part they're playing this book is amazing is he shapes the world and the way you but he calls out oh he has a chapter on identity politics right and it's like he called out all of this he was explaining all this post-modernism before Jordan Peterson and all of the critical theory all of the people there and he's a brilliant writer 2006 it came out it's so good and I just end since six isn't it crazy when someone catches shit like as it's happening catch the smell in the air no I know yeah yeah he called it and I've I I probably reference this book on every talk I have because he talks about exactly this when Princess Diana died he said you know everyone knew their roles it was and he was talking about how like the Monica Lewinsky thing is so interesting because she was like and her TED talk she talks about this how she was patient zero for online mobbing show it was like the first news story for the 24-hour news cycle and really the first person who got like mugged by by everybody have you ever read Jon Ronson's book so yeah I love him yeah that's great that book is amazing and I remember cuz I got on Twitter right when the Justine Sacco thing happened and I was like this is bad what are you guys doing I didn't know what was happening I was like this is not good you guys story of your life is like walking into a fucking gang fight hey hey put the bottles down I know it's true every time I go on one of these things are like I do I know if you're like I literally tweeted my ass into the Senate and culture wars I don't like wait what happened not writing about it oh my god and then it is such weird times because in so many ways I mean I went to the sex robot Factory and I just wrote about this for a column is coming out and it was like that whole uncanny valley you know that you know I felt like I was like walking in and out of it through the whole it was a place for me yeah seeing hers yeah and he was hers done yeah and it was such a weird it was like it was so you know how they're making them like war I'm like as soon as these things can make sandwiches like we're fucked that's gonna help women are done we're gonna be toast who's next machina yes she's hot even though you can see through her skin into her robot minds she's still hot yeah like that that whole Turing test that's going to happen like people are going to not be able to distinguish whether or not something is a robot or a person it's gonna happen and then they're so funny because I in the piece I was writing I'm like it's so weird because they're all so optimistic and they're like no it's for the guys who are lonely and it's like that opening scene in Jurassic Park where you're like what could possibly go wrong I wrote something a long time ago where I was making fun of people who had real dolls and this guy wrote to me and it made me feel bad did he lose his wife oh no no no he was just like horribly scarred from acne never girl and you know he just had just a shit roll the dice yeah yeah and you know he was talking because I'll you know I'd be happy to talk to you about like sometimes and you know you make fun of something and then someone reaches out to you and they're now you're a human that your community came yeah yeah oh this isn't fun anymore well that was what Wendy was saying you know she's like she was saying that she wanted to kind of think they were all creeps and then she went on there on their message boards and they were all like really lovely guys who took really good care of their dolls and and I think that again there's you know relationships and human sexuality are complicated but when I was asking the guy in charge of AI because what creeped me out more than even the dolls hanging from the meat hooks like all that shit was that they're so with the app you know how you just I'm sure she explained it how it works where it's like now they're getting into did you see the movie her yes okay so it's that's really what they're focusing on so that it's essentially like if you had the app and then you left to go to the podcast because it's in your schedule then the robot would be like see you soon Joe miss yeah and it would send a and so now you have this relationship and really the doll is just the physical form of this persona that you have a relationship with in the cloud and I was like okay so bad how can we stop we don't have to say but can you guys talk for a second sure talk to me real quick I said two podcasts are very real bad I'll be right back yeah it's jump in a restaurant talk we're gonna talk about restaurants yeah I could get it I have these when did you go to the sex doll factory like last month oh really yeah okay the pieces in um it's coming out soon actually it's an Spectator it has a it was it's like the oldest magazine in the UK and they are lot they launched a United States version and so they have one and then the the next column I wrote for them is about that it's like that called the uncanny valley of the dolls they show you any new anything new they're working on I mean it's all the same and it seems pretty they not you know they have like the self-lubricating ones coming and like the the ones that heat up and it's more of the technology that they're trying to make more interactive so it's the actual AI that's really interesting and then I think they want to move towards like getting cameras in the eyes and it was so funny because the AI guys are so funny guys who deal with but they're just a different breed and he was like I was on a jury and I was thinking this would be the perfect place to have a sex doll with a camera on the eye corner with that with the cameras in the eyes I think of a quick question I wonder like is there any women that are working there is it all guys no no and that's what we're so interesting is that and I talked about this in the piece I'm like there's my perception which is that I'm going to this huge warehouse and it's like all these kind of sketchy dudes and it's like a dystopian kind of creep show and then I get there and it's mostly just artists and when and people who are you know like character design and they're truly artists or like all these you walk in and it looks like a fucking tattoo parlor and so your other than like the different sets of lips and nipples on the wall you would think you were walking into like a tattoo product so it's so chill and then and yeah you kind of go in and out of it being like that when you hear the stories of the people who laughs their wife or somebody who had acne you I see that how this is useful and and maybe like people just want to hold like you said they want to hold something incremental steps to reality reality is going to be either virtual or you're going to have a combination of virtual and augmented and you're going to probably be overtaken by robots I think that fucking Unabomber guy was right yeah Ted Kaczynski you know that guy fucking cooked his brain what did he say well he thought that technology was gonna take over the human race that's why I was killing all those people that were involved in technology I have a theory that with the escalation of our like climate you know whatever that and I heard this panel back in 2000 it was like I remember being it was all about the nature of the soul and is the soul essentially and human consciousness essentially going to jump elements from carbon to silicon in order to survive the wasteland that we're gonna leave there's something gonna happen and I think Trump was on extra adderall when he's like I know what to do I'm gonna buy Greenland I think he was onto something I think that was like probably the best fucking idea that he ever had I wish people got more excited about it because he came up with it and like it was dismissed and it was in and out of the news cycle in like four or five days green land was like fuck you he's like alright but I mean I don't know you could buy a green land but if you could and that was like America Northeast like where is green land on the map Northwest northeast way northeast right yeah so if he was like that's American northeast just like a last kinda why we got a new one that's a fucking great idea cuz when shit gets really warm and people start moving there and like guys this is the shape it's fuckin 70 degrees yeah you can defend it I mean how big is Greenland how huge big enough for all of us could it be American northeast really really let's rap active put on the screen the size of Greenland in the US yeah let's what do you think never mind continental US are we including Alaska Alaska makes its way or yes alaska's and nor but nobody lives there like three people live in Alaska sorry Alaska we love it yeah I was way bigger Alaska's Bear they are barely Americans they're awesome don't get me wrong I mean they live in paradise that's like true size is what it says mm-hmm but holy shit it's huge yeah I know but when you drop it there it fits right in the middle so yeah but that's bigger than Texas yeah dude Texas could fit everyone in America Wow look at the size up there yes Texas assume people don't realize how big Australia's Australia's pretty big it's as big as the contiguous United States hmm but there's only as many people as less less than as many people as Los Angeles and look at this one right look at the perspective oh shit well how does it look isn't that crazy when you see the actual position it looks way bigger the United States sometimes but then when you oh that's because of like taking a round thing yeah yeah that's so stupid I don't know what to do that really gave all the evidence the really crazy thing is the oh okay that's yeah the really crazy thing is how many things fit in Africa everything fits in Africa ah almost every continent almost every country in the man no but if you look at like how many countries fit in of Africa because you see Africa you go oh yeah the South America there's Africa okay about the same yeah it looks the same but then when you see like superimposed all of the United States Europe Asia China okay fucking everything look that's Africa uh-huh look at all that shit wow I didn't realize that no it's nuts India fits in there everything fits in oh my god dude like the whole France look at that Spain wow I really Berlin Switzerland so tiny Italy Switzerland even on there cuz they make good make army knives Wow I didn't matter I didn't realize that China China China China it's crazy how big Africa is I've never been I want you at all have you been to India no why are you scared malaria kills people kills more people than anybody my dad got malaria when he was there woah he's alive Allah is he yeah are you sure my friend Justin who he runs fight for the Forgotten charity building wells for the pygmies he's gotten at three times oh yeah three times malaria yeah did he have to take the pills that made him crazy he took the pills and it made him crazy for sure but he got malaria and then if he gets really sick he can get malaria again yeah they've come a long way though cuz the old school pills made you like crazy yeah the ones the soldiers had to take they're all like psychotic Dave Foley from Newsradio I had to keep him from assaulting a reporter once he was drunk a malaria he was drunk and he'd take malaria man yeah yeah and some he took the reporters microphone or it took his tape recorder and shoved it in his drink and I was like Dave act no never last time I acted was in a Kevin James movie oh okay cuz he's a buddy of mine you just don't want to do it no oh no desire I guess I have been to Africa because Egypt yeah Egypt yeah Egypt yeah I've been that's why got this ring oh it was amazing you get it from a tomb and is it kid is that I love that part no um it was it was one of my favorite trips an insane science museum had insane exhibit on on Tutankhamun I went mommies twice yeah I'm obsessed fucking incredible I was I was really obsessed with Egypt from a very young age just my naturally do you believe in past lives how do you feel don't not believe that's how I feel yeah I just what I think you know how people are you know like some people have arachnophobia this unusual fear of spiders I think that probably comes from someone in your ancestry getting bitten by a spider oh that's interesting look people have instincts right and I like Marshall okay Marshall has been live he's pretty lovable the best he doesn't seem too fierce he's not fierce at all sweetheart but he has instincts right like he lifts up his leg and pees on things right he smells where other dogs at Pete and he pees or two I didn't teach him how to do that no when he was a puppy but when I got him when he was six weeks old he would just pee all over the place didn't tell me how to pee we squat down in pee but then as he got older he has instincts like some in inherent memory in his genes I want to know how they decided where to poop if I find out one thing before I die like if I get to choose one thing I'm like how does my dog make this decision I mean I know it's instinct but what someone's what if she's a terminating that's not true I've I've I've kept track I have lists of every direction hope is pooping in well when I run with Marshall he generally poops in the same area like within like a hundred yards like wherever we run like there's this area that we come we come down off of this hill he's like there's a good spot take a shit yeah and then he drops a log right there I just want to know is it like territorial is there some dog that has some food that she's like out fooding where she's like my foods better there's definitely some sort of territorial thing too because they were they'll roll in shit - my dad doesn't she's not she won't even step in it she's like very prissy about that stuff Marshall has rolled in other dog shit she doesn't want to eat it she's not one of those dogs uh-uh she's like she's she's very particular and she always has to go to the edge of the it's weird she always goes to the edge of the curb like her the you know in between the like in whatever spot but she it's not the same spot every time she and she's very picky it's like okay if I can pick a spot I want to know and my whole thing about past lives is I'm like well until you can tell me they definitively aren't true I'm gonna believe they are I think it's gonna get out is that there's a memory that's passed down through your jeans and I think desires in Egyptian there's well there's probably some weird fucking memory that all of us have from all the different ancestors that we share DNA with it only makes sense isn't it funny how everyone always thinks they're gonna be like the king or the queen and it's like no you're so you were this played one I was a fucking starving slave for like ten thousand generations I know it I was a nobleman no you are moving across a great land that's like guys I wrote about um I write a lot about when I was a Playboy I wrote about like I had this experience so I was like the second wife I wasn't a wife but I was a second in an open marriage and all the guys think they're gonna be that guy and it's like the I was reading this book and I forget which book it was or something and said actually that men who had multiple wives and women had to start like not hogging all the women because it was causing so much strife within the like tribes yeah Jordan Peterson talks about that too that that's one of the problem with in cells is that there's the men like the alpha man like Jason Momoa of the world they have you know if they wanted to we could have a gang of women yeah other guys be like yeah but I kinda honestly I kind of liked this situation the guy was so alpha and it almost took two women to like balance them out and from my perspective I was like I want a wife I mean as a as a wife would want a wife too I would want someone else like we it was so like we did the gardening and legs sure this work outfit it didn't work out for that long like a couple months no no is it was a while did you see the king of Thailand like formally got rid of his concubine what he caught he like royal mistress royal mistress yeah concubine would be a whore border yes old school old school the same thing I think I'm not sure well thank you bye Anne has a flair this royal mistress that was actually like she had rank in the military oh yeah and she apparently disrespected the Queen see you how to shut her down and he had to strip her of her power oh and I was Roberto yeah I was like piss on her what's happening when you go to time you cannot talk shit ever there it is there's the for King I don't know how to say his name oh my god corn comes no responsibility at all well so he has this was that his wife let me see that what is the article the king of Thailand how to say that peremptorily I've never seen that word ever have you ever seen that word you're a writer no I don't peremptorily Ram totally as that just misses his official mistress I've known that she was talking to you about the wife she disrespected the wife kick rocks bitch what does it mean I don't know look at her name well now I have to I'm gonna be I look up every word I don't know this ingratitude misbehavior and disloyalty these were among the failings of try saying her name si an EE and a t seen Sydney at and here's the big one wo n GV a G I r AP Wow d I I don't even try that one long detailed in a scathing royal statement on October 21st apparently the mistress she wants to elevate herself to the same state as the Queen of course yeah that was ultimately why it didn't work out really well number one I didn't want to be number one because that has a lot more responsibility and I'm not really that type a but I didn't feel like I felt like everyone's needs were being I was like hey are you okay are you okay no I was like Brigit okay so I felt like that my my needs were the ones that got pushed aside pushed aside yeah well you can call that bitch we can start a little meeting you and that whatever name it was really just one of those things I'm such a writer and so curious but on this she was just made that position in July it was the first time it was done in over a century um so she lost it very quickly that's really fast she basically was like yo I want to be number one after like a month all right that's a little entitled she gave it a shot calm down what do you think that I state herself before the king and queen former flight attendant who he married in may know

strange like people that love me people that hate me all of its weird yeah all of its weird it's strange though all the attention every time people call my name like I'm about to go on stage and people cheer am i yeah yeah that'll feel strange yeah it never feels real and when did you start this podcast yeah 10 years 10 years ago December oh wow it's December 24th it'll be ten years oh that's amazing and what have you learned the most from it over the year did you have any why did you start it just forgive me and Brian Redman did it for fun cuz we used to do this thing we would do in the green rooms where we would was on a thing called justin.tv justin.tv and we would flip up this laptop and we talked to people in the green room yeah of like comedy clubs just for fun okay and then one day I was like yeah let's do it at my house so you came over my house and we did it and we were like people to ask questions you're like fucking literally like 10 yeah yeah one or a hundred people yeah that was like pre I mean definitely podcast we were doing that there was some podcast back then it was like Adam from MTV what is his name again Jamie the guy Adam curry Adam curry was probably the first and I think he actually invented the name podcast mmm and then Corolla in 2012 years ago this is their mine ah Irvine improv yeah twelve years ago we would be in the green between shows well that was when red band I'd lost a ton of weight red band broke up with his girlfriend and decided to get sexy yeah I don't know it's hard to tell just kill this I want to see myself look a beautiful beard though so anyway we decided to do these videos just talking to people yeah online and then the next thing you know we're like let's do it next week so we did it next week let's do it again and then Brian was like people are asking us to put this on iTunes okay let's put on iTunes so we started putting them on iTunes all right let's do it every week let's do it every week and then it just by complete just sort of natural occurrences by natural circumstances is just snow balled and they know the other guys start doing it and then you know so many got to like this yes I am that's what I'm saying I don't know I think this thing has a life of its own yeah I think this thing like this tarantula hawk sticks a fucking needle and that tarantulas body and impregnates it with eggs technology impregnated me it gave me this idea to do this it forced me and it it found what I'm good at and what I'm good at is talking to people and I'm curious yeah yeah so like if you can get me a place where I could sit down for three hours and ask a guy like Sean Carroll explained to me astrophysics explained to me quantum mechanics explain to me this how do vaccines work how does this work how does that work you know what is what is a propulsion what makes the Sun stay hot like what why does that work how does the interworking of a cellphone how does it what is 5g is that bad for you is that giving you cancer you know what all these I'm I always been a person who asks a lot of questions and likes talking and you don't seem to be too I feel very similar to you in this respect of that I'm not trying to like God get any you know just have someone on and talk to them to be like I got you I just want to hear people's perspective and their point of view and learn things I mean I I laugh when I think of when you're naming all these people and I'm like and then you have this moron who tweeted her way into the center of the culture or I feel like I have gym teacher mouth right now what does that mean white stuff like when you talk you know I don't know I've always call it gym teacher miles no you're fine okay no worries I'm gonna get self-conscious don't I mean you know gym teachers always add that I never noticed until now I know I know exactly what you're saying we used to laugh as a team like people and shit I feel like this is relatable Joey Diaz gets that all time like a little white piece like on his lips you're like do I tell him hey well I'm talking no tell him oh not Joey no no I don't want to be self-conscious yeah I'd rather just stare at the white thing no I think it's cool though that you've had in this time when there's um everybody is like these political abstractions are just two-dimensional abstractions you seem to have actually like hit that zeitgeist so desire because they're like Oh everything everyone has a short attention span I'm like well people are listening to Joe for like fucking twenty five hours a day I don't think people have short attention spans I think that people can have short attention spans like you can be distracted by a music video that constantly switches scenes all over again but some people like to sit down and watch conversation mm-hmm like me I don't get bored having long conversations yeah enjoy them and if you're not bored while you're having a long conversation interesting conversation the people that are listening won't get bored either yeah but if you're bored they'll get bored yeah you have to be genuinely interested that's why the beautiful thing about having a podcast where there's no one that's telling me hey you have to have this person on or this guy's got a movie coming out I want you to have this person on we're gonna have this person he has an album out there's none of that right so if I have someone on like hey Gary Clark jr. has got a new album I love that guy let's bring them in it's always someone who I genuinely think is cool yeah yeah I have real interests yeah talking to them and you get to just I mean it's it's just so it's so funny how many I was laughing cuz I'm like I think a lot of my exes listen to you so this very moment right now is like sweetest revenge of all it must be you have I think you had a joke about that really I'm sorry to the ladies who had to come yeah because her boyfriends made them I went to your your set and it was like it was literally like a what do they call it like casting you know central casting of like Joe Rogan fans I was the only one in the audience who didn't have a tattoo I'm 100% sure of that maybe not a hundred I wouldn't bet all your chips yeah it doesn't make any sense to me either the only person who didn't have a drug addiction and they just hold up your face I hear it's on the wrists they're gonna slice it up right quick are you are you saying Kelly I don't know and I am preparing for this thing to fall apart fucking Palisades was on fire yesterday yeah I know when the Palisades is on fire that shit's rough that's like one of the things we were thinking about like hey fucking all these fires over here in the valley yeah maybe we should move to the Palisades no the palaces catch on fire yeah yeah I heard it was arson did you I think I read that I mean I could be completely wrong let's not do any research at all don't Google it spread that rumor Joker Premier someone's private home that's what that's what it was yeah no I don't I'm not sure I go back and forth because I know that's the thing I love it here I mean no tie like Colorado yeah I like Colorado a lot it's a healthy estate I think it's the most fit state again I could completely make it up with it makes sense yeah Boulder everybody's out there jogging hiking it was just an aspirin fucking gorgeous there oh my god rich people know what that they're not stupid they're rich no they know it's not that just like the guy says yeah this is an aspen yeah it's like they're trying to keep the riffraff out oh yeah I mean and you have to when you do that dodgy fly in which I love it I love it dodgy I know a dude whose friends died in a plane buying an Desmond but Jack slammed it in the mountain yeah you're fine right into the yurt no out there's a whiteout terrifying me and it fucked up hit the mountain couldn't pull up and I was like I never been to Cabo until recently and I was like rich people know it's up yeah they know what's up Cabo's Iraq though is this it's everyone's so drunk I'm so ridiculous like I wasn't a rich people part there you go I was like oh we're like Jennifer Aniston rents our house yeah golf course he owns a fat condo out there in Cabo they go there all the time it's special and magical there were lots of whales it is Beautif gorgeous yeah it's fucking amazing did you see what's going on right now in Sinaloa the Sinaloa cartel's and what part of it Culiacan I forget again god but how do you keep track of all this shit I don't know like in between all of these interviews and all the stuff you do and working out and hunting elk for dinner well this is all over the news though and my friend Edie called her on who's been on the podcast before he actually he runs like the the Mexican anti cartel he's like one of those anti cartel military guys ok ok yeah and he explained a lot of like what's going on down what's going on well they arrested El Chapo son I did see one fight many parts of Mexico the government surrendered in fight against very well us yeah the cartels have unlimited amounts of money because they're selling drugs to white people yeah white people need in America are buying all the cartels cocaine and meth yeah if you care about Mexico today I'm doing drugs dub it that's like that all the hippies I always laugh hysterically when they're like you know super gluing themselves and getting all high I'm like do you have any idea I've worked on these farms I see what they do the environment like you're not exactly helping the environment with you we'd have it no offense to all the weed smokers I love you by any large-scale agriculture is devastating to them it's so sad what's happening with big weed up there because I worked over there it is big weed it is you don't think it is I'm sure it is but that expression big weed is like so hilarious like the weed is an industry now it is and it was I because I worked up in the farms for the transition so I worked from when it was like mom-and-pop just places and now they're paving over some of the most fertile soil in freaking Oregon or California so they can put these huge domes they give off out those lights so they can bill it's fucked up it's fucked it's big weed anytime you have large-scale agriculture animals and the environment get fucked over yeah this is something that like vegans hate here in this but if you're buying grain you're buying grain most likely from large-scale agriculture and that shit is fucking terrible for animals terrible for the environment yes terrible like you're not supposed to have thousands of acres of all one thing yeah I'm not supposed to have that that's not normal you can't have thousands of acres of corn the laughs cause it's such that like they would rewatch the little plastic ziplock baggies you know that at the farm there'd be like we're gonna recycle these and there would be like huge entire piles of just deer netting that you used to like keep the colors up like just piles of plastic I'm like okay guys I'm not at the place where I was that's good as but it was a lot of like the tees they make you know to like boost these things holy shit I mean it's crazy what's the tease it's like they use all these different different things like fertilizers and different and they make these huge batches of tees that they use to fertilize what Compton tea it's not tea it's like they just call it t and it's like booster for the nutrient suspension yeah basically yeah yeah boost the THC yeah and a boost just the you know the it just saw like outdoor it's so interesting that like in the 1990s when I first came here you had to have a license I think it was like 94 95 it became legal and I didn't start smoking until 90 what became a US legal medically oh okay that was that wine girl yeah I think it was I think it was I want to say it was 95 what what year was marijuana really making I think it's 19 Erik James motherfucker Google's better than any man that's ever lived I think it's 94 I think 94 they passed the the medical marijuana laws 96 so i started smoking in 98 I came here in 94 I started smoking in 98 and back then it was still sketchy you smoked for the first time in 98 no I smoked a handful of times when I was young okay but Chomp between the time I was like 14 and 30 odd I don't think so you didn't really start smoking - you were 30 yeah oh wow and even think it was 10 times how do you feel in your in your sober October like what are the biggest differences that you notice or do you notice any I feel great yeah yeah do you feel the booze is what gets here mmm booze get like booze slows you down yeah sure like I feel way better without a couple of drinks but I'd like a couple of drinks yeah yeah so it's like the balancing act of I wish I could have a couple drinks yeah I don't I don't see the point I don't I like you want a bucket to the point it's like decaf coffee or you know my point of a couple of drinks no because I want to get ready to go party yeah and I was saying this you know before we came out I'm like I I could just smoke weed cuz I did that through it so for most of my 20s I did everything to avoid having to get sober again and a lot of my 30s and I definitely was trying to like manage it and there were years where I just smoked weed and didn't drink but what happens to me is that it'll be a gorgeous day like this and I'll be down in Venice and I'll smoke some weed and then maybe I'll get a little racy because the weed is racy and then I want to balance it out that gorgeous-looking half from on the waterfront and next thing you know I'm doing lines in the townhouse like that that's where it goes every time for me do you think that there's like a well-oiled groove that's in your brain that once you get some substances in there like I wonder what it is because it's interesting because so many this is why I love like 12-step because no one fucking wants to be there and there's some of the funniest places ever and then I'll hear people come talk about like 12-step and how it doesn't work and blah blah blah and I'm like it it works for a lot of people and every time I go I get to listen to like essentially some fucked up story that turned into a miracle like some guy who was like and then I had hookers and then I was jarred and now like and you've been sober and you're like an upstanding like they're these rooms are filled with people who would be menaces to society myself included I came out of a blackout driving on the 405 yeah it was one of the hands-down most terrifying moments of my life it was and I had been at Universal Studios so I had driven all the way from Universal to the 405 getting on the 10 didn't even know how you got there I had no recollection apparently I had been out with a bunch of people and I got scared when I was at the bar because there are these guys following me around I was with a bunch of like high poker high rollers and I made alcoholism look amazing idn't crazy like security guards I didn't know this hey love it when you can get off drugs like that's one addiction that people take very seriously and they're happy for you when you get off of drugs or alcohol but if you get off at gambling yeah no no well some people do I mean it's funny because I've had four I've helped four people quit smoking weed in the past year and it is gnarly and part of the problem I know you I know you'd give me this I know I know I know you don't want to hear it but these are people who were really addicted to it and they couldn't bizarrely or mentally well I think the physical part you get over it's just that they'd wanted it's insidious because you get laughed at they wanted that fuzzy distance yeah Fuzzy's doesn't and it's easy and it's like for me what I noticed was that it was like this we'd seal glass kind of ceiling made of smoke and once I stopped quit smoking weed I was suicidal a depressed for three years like two years I've smoked for 20 years in my developmental teenage years I don't think I had any eighty-two years ago I mean it's an oil I think it gets in your fat no I don't think there's any science no I I just know from my experience that it took me a while to like get back online and I felt like I was having a hard time kind of boosting up to like where I'm naturally like a happy guy I wake up and I'm like tralala but for the two first years I got sober it was gnarly it was ugly I think there's different people I mean I'm just joking around but them not being addicted I think there's people that get addicted to a lot of things well it's been what's the problem is that people don't take it seriously so they'll be like oh yeah it's not a real addiction because it doesn't kill anybody so if one says that I'm addicted to pilot I get over but it's like you won't do but so you don't do anything you know I'm like yeah you won't do anything you won't kill anybody you just won't do anything and I think from my experience the clarity that I got at the is kind of priceless I mean I used to write the stuff and think that I was just so funny or so insightful and it was like what the fuck I'm gonna come back and read my journals that I wrote when I was I and thought I was so insightful you can tell I'm just high and drunk you're like writing thinking that I'm being like so insightful occasionally you'll get gems yeah usually marijuana won't let a little fucking air through and like oh what is this I found I miss it I was saying that the addict in me it's the thing I love the most I've always loved it the most and the addicts in me I'm like I'm worried I'm gonna like give myself cancer so that I need like subconsciously and then when I got sober I did get cancer Basil's out did you really yeah but thousands I liked it I was like I guess I need to smoke weed now it feels like it's basal cell frigate like it's not real cancer so it's um I don't know it's it's like some skin cancer skin cancer but it's like the least I have a scar here it's like the least it's not melt yeah it's it's kind of a joke I mean maybe maybe I don't know maybe maybe I'll google it and find out it tells like millions people but it was my doctor made practically a joke of it it's kind of like the beta or arc of skin cancer god it's like it wants a lot of attention but it's a freaking president but it's completely ineffective guys adorable no he's so damn is so close to beta - I know bad ideas yeah I know I know do you think that he's just like using his his like father-in-law's money well he definitely is doing that right I don't know that keeps turning hard the fire in the Palisades he's the one who made you drink yeah I provided the lines the condo I could I do I do sometimes like I watch your podcasts and it's like fuck I but I wish I could just go drink whiskey with the boys like I used to and like go travel the world I was in Sri Lanka partying and it wasn't you ever have a good night partying no we're low on time yeah good night where it didn't go off the rails yeah yeah yeah maybe not alcohol no I do I do a whole standard routine about how and I quit drinking my family gave me like a reverse intervention my family's also there so there's a little ant no it's like an Irish Catholic huge family right it's just part of the culture right and they were like we're worried about you you're not drinking enough already pregnant sober yeah what are you sober away you get vegan now bread and if they using condoms what are you guys do see the whales you stop using plastic straw yeah if I can live dads out there it's hilarious yeah yeah I think there's people that can't do stuff yeah I attend I wish I could I tried I mean they seem to be having a good time it's a mirror I'm still nuts all that ii like wife stuff happened in sobriety that was like a crazy time at that time and mike it wasn't like college it was like i was like 37 years old a little sidetracked no big deal i I'm I'm grateful it's a miracle that I did make it make it to getting sober like when I look from 20 to 35 I mean even those years when I moved back when I was here at 19 in the valley it was just a lot of playing dominoes and doing blow late into the Domino's oh yeah all night with a bunch of like d-list like porn stars and a lawyer who dealt us all of our blow and it was just hilarious and it's I I was uh yeah I mean I and from that to like dating a really rich student being all over Europe and drinking Dom everywhere and being in San Tropez and I was like I've I've always joked I made it look amazing but and people like why did you quit why did you quit virgin and they want to hear some story like I killed someone in a drunk driving accident something that they can and I'm like I was just dying inside like something in me knew that I could do better like I knew there's like a little voice that always know and part of it was being in rehab at 19 like it wasn't like I had evidence that plenty hints yeah yeah I mean I can't imagine me on Twitter in 2016 with alcohol and drugs I would biebe and I'd be canceled and I'd be banned I just you could just say you had a problem with substances and now you're clean you were sick no I've been banned from Twitter for sure you starting to account a lot of people do that I don't know I'm grateful you do sober October because it does make me feel it's like the one month that I can safely not watch your packets and that view like white-knuckling I'm enjoying it it's not bothering me at all really I like a glass of wine with meals yeah yeah I miss that too I never I like it you know and I'm just working out a lot I think too knowing there's an end makes it easier it does but one way I feel like when I do shows at night like tonight I have two shows tomorrow night I have two shows and I know I'm not gonna be drinking the show so I know when I wake up in the morning I'm gonna feel good and do you notice a difference in your is there a difference in your shows a little bit yeah yeah I mean I probably am more coherent like Tommy's probably little better I
