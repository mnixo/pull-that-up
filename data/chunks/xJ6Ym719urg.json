- and we're live hello Paul hey it's happening how are you sir very well who are you and you have newfangled mushroom hats these are surprisingly durable so thing about these mushroom hats there that you would think oh it's gonna fall apart in your fingers but no it's got like it's quite pliable it's quite pliable and known as German felt and this allowed the Iceman Otzi to be able to travel into the Alps it was a firestarter mushroom really and this were actually revolutionized warfare because it helped Flynn spark guns ignite the gunpowder really so on samba do and it comes from a birch polypore mushroom which is a subject of much of our research these days now when this grows in the wild what does it look like because this is you've fashioned it into this hat well I had someone fashion some ladies it looks like yeah some ladies in Transylvania yeah yeah it's called foamies women Terios it allowed for the portability of fire there's no doubt we all came from africa we went north and we discovered winter this loud for fire to be carried for days and so your clan was absolutely dependent on fire starting in order to survive the winter and this mushroom allowed and enabled people to survive Wow it's very light is it edible excellent question Hippocrates first described it in 400 BCE as a tree as an anti-inflammatory so in teas yes but you know that's very very tough when you put it in ash and water it delaminates into mycelium and so some ladies in transylvania still make these and as a fabric that you pull and that mushroom there will become one hat or maybe more because it just keeps on the elongated and it's made of mycelium and so explaining the process how would you take this slab of mushroom that i have that looks like sort of like an enormous Hershey's kiss and then you would put that in water with ash from a fire from a fire and what I asked was that highly alkaline and then it helps it separate it begins to delaminate and literally you start pulling us and it's a fabric that you keep on ah and so it's called German Felton it's been used for literally thousands of years and beekeepers actually use this for smoking hives it we could but it would be kind of it would be kind of bizarre we could let's flick a bit and you'd burn up one of these things here is that it's just amazing how much this is a fuse and one spark on this you know can ignite this entire thing over 15 20 minutes really yeah and so beekeepers use it for smoke so if I lit this right now with this lighter not that the the powder was so you this the ash the powder powder - and then the water and then how does it flatten out and become with it because it soaks up and mycelium makes mushrooms mushrooms make mycelium and so when you soak this and then it gets soggy and then it tenderizes and then you start breaking it and pulling it apart this is actually part we first discovered because our ancestors notice when insects were born does much yeah is that the unprocessed version of it this is so this is what it's like on one side well it's just made it into a little toe table thing but it's the same thing basically so is this stitched together how do they make it like this actually using wood a wood glue and but that's all the natural colors nothing's been added to it and these and so they just pull it apart pull it apart and again flat yeah I really want to make a coat I'm reading this my goal is that have somebody make a coat would it tear easily it's an amazingly strong tensile fabric it's mmm it absorbs water but you have to be careful someone smoking a joint or near a fire or smoking a cigarette it happened to me I got a big hole in one of mine and I was smelling the smoke in my head my head was on fire more than once how many folks are out there wearing mushroom hats these days just a few hundred and we've been trying to actually keep the industry alive by just inundating the there was a like 25 or 30 of these hat makers and in Transylvania um 10 15 years ago then it shrunk down to four or five and a friend of mine David Summerlin visit and said Paul this this hat making technologies on the verge of extinction and so we just sort of inundated them with orders in order to build the industry alive so how could someone contribute to that if they wanted to if people are listening to this how could they buy one of these hats well if you go to my facebook comm slash Paul Stamets I think his name is Mako actually you know squatted on my page to sell the hats and more power to them so okay yeah cool interesting but this had this mushroom has figuring they'd be very prominently important for saving bees and that's where our research has been astonishingly interesting lately where is that thing that you get brought in what is that this is this is a so to get some context to this you know I think shamanistic aliy mushrooms plants animals become important because of plurality of multiplicity of benefits this is one example not only revolutionized warfare not only allow for the portability of fire for us to save ourselves in the coldness and you know we migrated into Europe from Africa not only did beekeepers users for smoking but fly fishermen use it also are drawing flies but we have found that this mushroom is extremely powerful for reducing viruses that harm bees and and we are it's been described today in CNN be insect apocalypse 40% of B of insects or under threat this just came out and this is an all-hands-on-deck moment but I'm optimistic because I think we can find solutions in nature so with my colleagues and when I was here before I talked to my work with a bio shield our defense program and these would conks are very strong and antiviral properties against flu viruses and herpes etc I use these ideas and actually had a waking dream and I realized that the bees were being infected by mites with viruses and the deform wind virus in particular is the worst virus and so I contacted Washington State University we started doing some research and really really happy because I love skeptics who become my supporters we published in nature only 7% of the articles submitted the nature get published the nature of publication ecosystem to this day our articles on top 1% of all articles ever published in nature publication ecosystem now that's phenomenal because that's the most credible scientific journal in the world there at that extracts of polypore mushroom mycelium reduced viruses and honey bees and the this mushroom the Amadou reduces the deformed wing virus 800 times the one with one treatment in and then the reishi mushroom mycelium reduces the lake sinai virus more than 45,000 to one now these are Woodcock's at growing trees and we all grew up with Winnie the Pooh but no one made the connection before me apparently that bees are attracted to rotted wood because of a mean illogical benefit so Amadou and reishi mushrooms we found that we published in this article that high significance and I think the reason why this article is not top 1% of all nature articles is that I've been able to present the theory with proof now that a natural product can have a broader Bioshield of benefits than a pure pharmaceutical up to this time there's been no agents to produce viruses and bees now the deform wing virus is being vectored by the varroa mite came in 1984 and injects viruses into bees and so like a dirty syringe and these viruses debilitate the bees and sort in there with their ability to fly look at that poor bumble bee oh wow that's crazy I mean that that is so sad because that nut will be can't fly now bees can pollinate up to a thousand flowers a day and the average flight time of like honeybees was used to be nine days a thousand flowers a day every almond you eat was visited by a bee so one bee can pollinate a thousand flowers a day nine days was our pollination flight time now it's been resorted to for days so we lost by 50% and the CNN article that we just showed in China now their hand pollinating flowers you know with paintbrushes paint of apples you know so apples cherries almonds strawberry because of those bees the absence of B so it's really it's all hands on deck this is you know I'm really optimistic about the future because we have solutions in nature that we can now amplify and be able to deploy and so one of my inventions and I'm giving these away for the ten thousand of these for free I've come up with a citizen scientist Beefeater that puts these extracts into sugar water and we have a sign-up sheet up the salt is for free says fungi calm slash bees and we're going to give away the first 10,000 of these and this basically allows citizen scientists to help wild bees because while bees will give about 80 percent of the benefits if you scroll down there's a really we just got the CGI done if you go all the way down and then click on the click on that video and we just so here's the Beefeater and this is available on YouTube folks it says be mushroomed feeder be mushroomed all one word and then feeder yeah and now watch that's the bees visiting and they're taking the sugar water look how much they're sucking out of it those little greedy bastards yeah and that's crazy how it goes away so quickly and this is a maze and bees are better at navigating mazes and so you can see the bees going in and out my grandson who was afraid of bees was really fascinated by this so I got him to do this and so these are something that we're going to make these available all over and I know I'm gonna create vertical gardens in in apartment buildings get bees we fly up 200 feet you create ladders then ecological ladders and then this is where the citizen scientists all over the world can take action to be able to help bees from collapsing and then you station these in neighborhoods for bumble bees for other types of bees and then we have it with a Wi-Fi enabled device with solar panels and then we upload into the cloud all this data about bee pollination visits so I'm create a metric on the baseline of bee pollination services so if you see a bees that are declining and suddenly below a baseline and Oklahoma two years ago 84% of the bee hives died now think if you're a cattle rancher and you lost 84 percent of your cattle so the idea is to help bees immune system and the if we create baselines be feeders upload the data and this becomes a new form of internet because they have Wi-Fi ability so this distributed network as well but they where is a Wi-Fi on that well we don't have this is in development right now we're working with a very very large computer company who's making all the instrumentation and they're into big data so we have a solar panel going in here we have blue LED lights the bees are attracted to blue light and they will count the number of bees going in and out and send bees are only find that daytime we don't need a battery and so the solar power will then upload the data into the cloud they don't create mega data sets and then we can look in Africa Indonesia how's it going to upload into the cloud was it using it using LTE LTE oh so she's like a cellular cellular system or low frequency long range communication systems can we help can we contribute there's a way that this podcast can help a lot is yes I want to enable people with solutions that they can teach their children the importance of natural systems and they can take action this seems like a great one I mean I love this idea I can awesome I can afford to give away 10,000 I to this computer company that everybody knows but they asked me not to use her name and they asked how many do we need I said about 10 billion the billion billion and because this but I will do up to my capacity and then I'm hoping that you know we're gonna give these away for free and then eventually we'll create networks of hubs where I have now 40 patents on this and helping B survive from these extracts but not in Indonesia and not in India not in Africa not in China not in Japan I've open sourced it for most of the world mm-hm I'm basically commercial I'm gonna commercialize it so the haves can help to have mmm and I think a lot of people want to help and if you and we're thinking about different ways of doing this I'm open to all ideas but the idea is to get maybe one person to sponsor ten other people they have a distributed network their own social media community where they end up we getting schools we will open source the code for 3d printers so that's really important for schools so what the codes gonna be open sourced but it then if somebody want to make millions of these and sell them of course you know I wouldn't be happy without they have to work with me but individually we can empower individuals within schools to have the open-source 3d printing codes we just have to make it trendy to have one of these in your house like looky I'm helping I'm helping the bees if we just did that it would really make a big difference I know that's a gross way to look at it but what my grad works my grandson kai is a perfect example he was shuddering in fear of being coming near to this and I'm just my friend dr. Steve Shepherd entomologist taught me something about bees I didn't know bees are moving so fast and we look like we're moving slow but if we you move really slow the bees think you're a statue and so the idea of and some of my grandson and I I said look at this and you could see underneath you can see the bees going in and out I said to move really slow and then he got fascinated watching the bees say you're overcame his fear of bees it was excited that he's helping be survived now we've created something intergenerationally and saving the bees is the number one bridge concept between conservatives and liberals everyone wants to save the bees that's number one it's a number one bridge issue between mending the fence so to speak across the political and social divide everybody wants to say the bees so this is something that's an actionable solution and the you know the scientific data out there is pretty disturbing you know 75% of flying insects in the past 27 years and a report from Germany that just came out have disappeared now many of your listeners are out in the country you know I grew up in the country remember all the bug splatter you used to have against your windshield you don't see that anymore because the the insects are dying because exposure to pesticides monoculture we have monoculture you have what's called pollination deserts when you have lots of biodiversity lots of plants and diversity the plants are pollinating at different times of the season when you do to a monoculture all the plants like almonds yeah all produce flowers all at once and then there's no pollen available so the immune system of the bees due to factory farming loss of habitat deforestation by phosphates you know heavy metals pollution all those things are cofactors but the nail in the coffin is by far these viruses and so in logically empowering and supporting the immune system of bees then gives the bees the opportunity of the ability to be able to survive longer do more pollination is there a specific source of these viruses that they can isolate these a new thing as well actually there's a and there's a slide that shows the pandemic spread of these viruses throughout the world that came from Asia and it's now a global pandemic all bees in the world are all infected with these viruses because when they infected honeybee for instance visits the flower it leaves viral particles in the flower and the flower and then a wild bumble bee comes a visit it becomes infected mmm so there it's a unfortunate I'm I usually work perfect storm it's a terrible storm of cofactors and because you know 80 percent of the benefit that farmers receive is from wild bees right well we can't count them and you know I have bee hives and and what happened to calling the collapse you go out on Monday the bees are happy goat on Thursday they're all gone I mean it's that quick that quick and it's not like there's hundreds of dead bees around your beehive they're just gone there could be hundreds of pounds of honey and the beaze you know they're gone so they go off somewhere to the die what happens is because the newly hatched bees are called nurse bees and the nurse bees take care of the baby bees but when the colony senses of nun of pollen and food to support the brood and the colony the nurse bees are prematurely recruited to go out and find pollen so abandoned the babies and then the varroa mites are on there gets go on uncontrolled and they start injecting viruses and so there are other cofactors just like when you get an infection from a viral infection you can get bacterial infections and so there's a there's a cascade of opportunistic infections as immunology is decreased because these viruses so isn't there a contributing factor that had to do with cell phones as well I actually I'm really glad you brought that up this is a contributing factor I have not seen convincing evidence as a hypothesis that's not fully flushed out there are some people quite adamant and their belief in this but I'm I'm driven by science and data I can the the rhythms the frequency of the high of cell phones there's an argument that's made just it's not in the same cosine wave of the wavelengths that we experience in nature and so this is disruptive I understand that I'm still on the fence I'd like to see a really strong data and scientific evidence of that but it's a hypothesis that needs to be tested that's what we're looking also at low frequency long-range communication systems mmm I you know I think I told you this story if I didn't apologize when we were on Fear Factor we had a bee stunt we had to cover these people in bees and a local bee colony flew in to check out what was going on and those bees and the bees that were brought there met in the sky and worked it out and the beekeeper told us okay we have to shut down and everybody's got to back out of here so we had to shut down everything and back out for like about an hour at least a half hour while these bees communicated with each other so they're flying a giant swarm of them flying in the eye in the in the air trying to figure out why hey what do you guys here for what are you doing why are you in our neighborhood like oh I'm not moving in or just filming a TV show like they had to work it out that is so unusual it was really weird that's extraordinary yeah so when a new queen splits from a hive you know a colony they then take a big group of them with so it's all about protecting the Queen I just don't understand how they worked it out there was no fight to the death there was no nothing they just sort of worked it out and the other bees took off and the the bees that were there came back to there hi there little colony also well that's glad you mention that because this also speaks to what's called be drift and so when we publish our article in Nature scientific reports actually I think the data is understated because 10 to up to 20 percent of bees will drift from one college to another so we had treatment colonies and we had treated colonies well because 10 to 20 percent of the bees in the treated colonies went to the control colonies we actually diluted the differential because we had cross you know movement of control bees and beehive versus treated bees and so when we actually I think another some of my other co-authors thinks we actually have understated the data but when you look at the p-values of significance and you know the extraordinary P is less than point zero zero 9 and that for scientists is an extraordinarily significant data set that is clearly showing the evidence that these extracts help the immunity of bees and help them be able to survive and and do a better job that's awesome and it's crazy that it's just a natural mushroom but it makes sense what you're saying that they built their beehives in these rotting trees knowing that these fungi were there somehow or another being attracted to it you know the I'd like to say the first five seconds that I got the first patent award my ego did swell and then 10 seconds later I said are you friggin kidding we're Neanderthals with nuclear weapons how could be the first one to have discovered that bees benefit from my Salim immunologically but there's no what's called prior art there's no evidence and I mean think of that we have the intelligence of nature underneath our feet and this is something we need to tap into and the fact that we can show a natural product you know if you had HPV HIV and you went to a doctor 12 days after having one treatment of these extracts and your virus has dropped 45 thousand to one any physician would say wow you're really well and this is what be able to see them now we've been trying to find what's called the mode of action how are these viruses actually being reduced putatively our strongest hypothesis now is as providing essential nutrients that are important for the immune system to activate gene sequences then our that attack the viruses and give a more host defensive immunity of protection of a further infection now does this work with humans as well like chaga is supposed to be good for your immune system right well it says this is a great convergence of traditional Chinese medicine and European medicine medicine from indigenous peoples all over the world have been used these mushrooms is that now we're finding scientific evidence that folkloric Li the reputation of chaga of reishi of these mushrooms helping the immunity of humans this is translational medicine so but bees is an animal clinical study bees have been stated as being resized for Sofala the second most well studied animal in the world this is a animal clinical study past digestion past was called the cytochrome p450 pathway which is your detoxification pathway mostly in our liver all animals use the cytochrome p450 pathway to break down toxins and it's passed the microbiome into the blood so this is actually this is a an animal clinical study and I think it's a gateway for us to take this as credible evidence that natural products can be more useful and offer a broader Bioshield of benefits than pure pharmaceuticals that go after one molecule with one target one set of receptors there are illogical fields that developed in the complexity of nature this is what our foods are this is we are in concept biomolecular communication with the ecosystem we've evolved in this complex molecular environment and so our immune systems are up regulated through multiple stimuli and that's why I think these extracts because of their complexity they build upon the complexity of natural systems and help our immune system so you have hoped that this is something that we could eventually see being like a peer-reviewed proven thing for human beings as well absolutely I do believe that's on the near event horizon there's a lot of researchers now this is I I believe is on the near event horizon is something that we're gonna see more and more there's lots of clinical studies for physicians it's not no branding though selling of anything it's a popular website called mushroom references comm I populated specifically for physician physicians I just spoke at singularity University Stanford Medical School in front of a thousand physicians I try to make the bridge of the credibility of the science for physicians who are just not educated yet because they don't have the resources or the time so mushroom references comm you can go that website it's got hundreds of references that then you can put in any you know symptom or species etc and you'll be able to find the peer-reviewed references there's about thirty references for instance on soul simon right now which is an area of research that i'm particularly focused on now there was for a long time a stigma associated with anything that had anything to do with mushrooms particularly because of psychedelic mushrooms is that is that alleviated I know that John Hopkins study on psilocybin has shown some pretty incredible benefits and there's a lot of people now that are starting to look to it for treatment for people with PTSD or addiction issues has that become more mainstream in your experience no it's there's a vast title change in medical science there's a slide these are just a few of the universities right now that have been approved by the FDA and other agencies for human clinical studies on psilocybin Wow so we work in Harvard Stan yeah Purdue Penn Toronto University of Toronto that's amazing so that's only a few of them I actually could put the Department of Veterans Affairs that's very interesting as well right if I could put up twenty more but you couldn't read them because I had to be able to just to be able so but this is this is a huge shift and the the clinical studies are coming out for as you know PTSD in particular has been extremely useful but one of them that came out Johns Hopkins for breaking tobacco fifteen patients small clinical studies statistically significant 10 out of 15 people after one or two heroic doses of psilocybin 12 months later had not smoked a cigarette Wow so I mean to break tobacco addiction was sort of the most addictive substances on this planet is phenomenal that's incredible and the other research for PTSD depression I'm really excited about cognition creativity I think we can there's a lot of smart people out there a lot of smart people listening to your podcast I think the idea of micro dosing and being able to increase our ability of cognition and creativity to come up with the solutions that can get it out of get us out of this mess just think of that we had hundreds of millions of people thinking about solutions like I've come up with to solve some of the environmental challenges we have today for food biosecurity the loss of bees is a threat to our national security just think about the threat to our economy so this micro dosing I think has enormous potential as well and when you think about the one of the issues I see right now with the clinical studies it's like almost it's too good to be true oh great universities great science published in peer-reviewed journals at the top of their game but they these mushrooms have so many benefits for fighting dementia potentially Alzheimer's Johns Hopkins has an Alzheimer clinical study ongoing currently for a dose of psilocybin to see if it helps pre Alzheimer's patients and not go into full-blown Alzheimer's there's so many different benefits potentially it's almost like a chaos of data how it's almost too good to be true so might my team and Pam Crisco is an MD from British Columbia we've been working with people and we have just launched today an app that's at micro dose dot me double entendre microdose thought meaning is available in the Apple store and Sevilla Android and this is a quick little vision a micro dosing study a mote in Apple allowed this on the App Store that's a big shift and as this is a Schedule one drug that they're talking about taking on micro dose levels I mean I'm not you know I'm just saying what it is right I mean obviously you know what can't bomb n I want everybody right but this this is really significant is that measures your ability to here well vision the tap test you know and how quickly you can tap your fingers it's it's a whether you're stacking it with but it's also good for non psychoactive substance use what is your baseline so you're getting older I'm getting older I'm getting younger do you have a new thing okay I vote for you I figured it out but the idea is to create baselines you know and then you create a baseline over time so you can find out how far you deteriorated or what your trend line was versus the general population so the idea with with micro SIM Ike reduce dot me is that will create a massive data set massive amount of data and then will offer this to clinicians for them to see signal from the noise I suspect hypothetically I don't have the evidence but several doctors have collected case studies of tinnitus or tinnitus though with pronunciations are correct of the buzzing in your ears and being able and people have resolved that from doing micro dosing real and thirty percent of Americans have hearing loss or more is progressive over time how much hearing loss leads to depression because you can't hear your loved one say things and you getting arguments and I didn't hear you and you didn't say that and let me just it just magnifies how so the ability of being able to have better cognition a better neurological development and helping hearing vision depression if the interesting thing about the micro dosing that we've been collecting is a people tend to be happier and they're happier they're more creative and were they're more creative they're happier you learning a new kata you excited the next day you nailed it you're up and gonna do it again you're writing a new book you're doing an artist work so creativity breeze happiness happiness breeze creativity mm-hmm and then the opposite is true malaise and depression you're not as creative yeah you're an a you're not enjoying life you're not looking forward to the next day so I think it's almost a binary choice and the idea of using micro dosing and that the the definition of micro dosing is is has sort of a variable interpretations so the use of the selasa be cubensis scale which is the most common soul side mushroom in the world one gram is liftoff five grams is what Terence would say was a hero's journey and when I was on last I didn't with you I did 20 grams you know that was a little bit much you might say but when you do 1/10 of a 1 gram you don't feel it but when xx for sure you don't feel it so the idea is you do micro dosing below the threshold of intoxication but then it benefits neurogenesis now there's an extraordinarily interesting study that came out with a mice but I think it's translational medicine and they were doing micro dosing versus macro dosing so and these are some numbers but basically one gram is almost equivalent to one milligram per kilogram of body weight 70 kilos is 152 pounds and so at 1 milligram per kilogram of with these mice that's like one gram of cubensis that's that's a dose super-high dose but it's a dose so what they did with these mice is they had them in an arena with a metal floor and they gave a tone dong then 40 seconds later they were shocked so they had the tone again a few minutes later on 40 seconds later they got shocked after 10 rotations that mice realize like Pavlov's dog when there is a tone there could be a negative consequence a shock happening SCID mice would cower in fear so then they dosed them with a micro dose 0.1 milligrams per kilogram versus 1 milligram per kilogram 1/10 of a dose versus a full dose interestingly the full dose it took 10 rotations of no shock the tone no shock before they forgot or became react limited not to have the fear conditioned response with the microdose 1/10 of that and I took two rotations two rotations with a micro dose and they dissociated potentially PTSD why do you think it's less well well it's a really good question in the evidence we have so far and again this is very early evidence lots of research is going on in this it looks like the neurogenic benefits of micro dosing or greater than the neurogenic benefits of macro dosing you know you flood the receptors you're having this incredible trip is fantastic it's colorful it's life-changing yes that is all beneficial for changing your life but going micro dosing over the long term because the nerves don't regrow in six hours but over weeks of regeneration of nerves with micro dosing it seems to me that the micro dosing instead of flooding and overwhelming all the receptors are feeding these receptors that allowing for neurogenesis now this is a again hypothesis there's so many great people studying this right now but I'm advocating to all of the clinic clinicians at Johns Hopkins at Stanford UCLA at Harvard please do testing of the patients for hearing and vision and other behavioral tests that are not just about emotion and mood in PTSD but let's actually get some physical measurements so then you can track prior during during his to complicate assists to into much intervention you're tripping your brains out you don't have time to they be tested they offer a vision an audit but then post wise and then looking at that the residual effects now dr. James Fadiman he has the the Fadiman protocol I am my protocol the stamina protocol James Fatima's protocol was micro dosing one day on two days off one days on my protocol that I'm suggesting is four days on three days off and James and I are good friends we talked about this we laugh the words you were just basically these are hypothetical potential treatments comparing data between the two of you this is what microdose not me will do we wanted to say are you following the stammers protocol the Fadiman protocol your own protocol are you using it with niacin where you're giving up with lion's mane what are you using then lion's mane it's phenomenally powerful neurogenic Lee and we there's two clinical studies out of Japan with mild cognitive decline and dementia showing very positive results taking 4 to 2 to 4 grams lion's mane per day the mycelium actually interesting not the fruit by the mycelium is much more powerful and we just been contracting with a neurological testing laboratory in France and we just got some amazing results back showing that when we had lion's mane extracts of the mycelium exposed to neurons and they the composite control was the brain derived nerve growth factor nor factor and it was it's used as a baseline for measuring neurogenic compounds comparatively and the neurogenesis benefits from this were for potent stem cells stem cells that then differentiate into neurons and the BDNF clearly shows how to sustain a protocol with a lion's mane it also increased the number of neurons and then we started looking at analogues of psilocybin and the analogues when we added the lion's mane mycelium with these also having analogs which are perfectly legal they're not schedule 1 substances psilocybin analogues are not what is it exactly a psilocybin analog there's a number of them that have been reported in literature there's bavistin and nora biosystem are two of the more prominent ones now I am a psycho not and in 1960 biosystem a report of a child died outside of Kelso Washington from eating mushrooms in Azure the family ingested the mushrooms they went to the hospital the child developed a fever eventually had renal failure and died a chemist by the name of lung and then Benedict and Tyler picked up on this they analyzed the mushrooms looking for a new toxin the mushrooms were identified as being selasa P Baio Cistus it is a mushroom that goes in Washington State and Oregon sometimes in British Columbia but not in Northern California it's very rare species but grows in yards when they analyze the mushroom looking for new potential toxins they found this alkaloid it's a dimethyltryptamine based compound and they named it bio Sisseton after salafi about sis's sobei assistant had the reputation of potentially being a deadly poisonous toxin is present in cubensis as present and many psilocybin mushrooms and my books also have mushrooms of the world has charts that show how much they have systems in these things but no one had I ever eat a consumed bio system because this reputation may assistant is legal I obtained some pure Bay of Sisseton from laboratory legally I have no soul Sobhan you know nature provides I don't people make this very clear but I can have I can possess these also having analogs and so since there was no reports in the scientific literature of whether this was truly toxic or not I was my with a doctor a friend of mine MD that measured my vitals and hooked me up you know their blood pressure ECG that all the biometrics that are needed and so we did a ten of one study I decided that even though it had a history of potentially of killing this child I think that's a false positive and I think it was bad science I couldn't find no one who ever ingested this so I decided I would ingest it now my friend Pam she's an MD that goes into Antarctica she's the only doctor on a research vessel and so she goes down there and she gets to bring a roommate and was me and so Pam and I were working really hard we had over our plane tickets were ready to go to Antarctica we've been planning this for months um and then we decide well just before we go paulus do the the Bayeux assistant test you know i we talking about this for months we finally got the time to do this but the next day we're going to Antarctica so Pam looks at her cellphone is this Russian research vessel crashed into a reef tore a hole in it and it's like it's now the trip is cancelled no I mean I've American Express you know plane tickets hotels I got 24 hours to try I can't recapture all this money because I can't we can't go this your trips are canceled so I'd super high anxiety I told my doctor friend I i I've too much anxiety I I can't go this is too crazy and then she kind of looked at me go on listen we've been planning this for months you know please and I listened to her and so I did 10 milligrams of Bayeux Sisseton she measured my heartbeat blood pressure all those all those metrics my eyes did dilate she said that was good so he's had to talk like a fact then she checked in with me every 10 15 minutes 20 minutes you have liftoff one hour you're full blown into it and she chucked with me she checked with me that's yes and I didn't get high I'm not alone she goes how do you feel and I said I feel great I have no anxiety everything this trip is going to be fine so here we found a analog of psilocybin that does not get you high that's legal that reduced anxiety I think this is the tip of the proverbial iceberg because all the clinical studies are proved right now for pure psilocybin what about the analogues they activate other receptor sites you know and you feel in neurological field and that's why I think this is why looking at the natural form of these mushrooms standardized to the sole Simon a certain concentration versus the pure molecule I think that is the way of the future because Purcell's Ivan is up to six $7000 a gram and you can translate that into growing cells I have mushrooms for two dollars a gram now there are people out there listening saying well the price is coming down indeed it is this down maybe to a thousand to five hundred dollars a gram but how many people in the urban low lower income you know impoverished populations suffering from PTSD who don't can't afford to go to Johns Hopkins to spend tens of thousands of dollars to have a clinical treatment I think this democratizes the the use of Sullivan and micro dosing that could be a benefit across our society and then why proposing is you stock up with niacin and the reason why you stack up with niacin is you take 1/10 of a gram of /b cubensis microdose you had 100 to 200 milligrams of niacin now if someone tries to get high by taking ten times as much they'll have like two grams of niacin this is flushing niacin vitamin b3 and that flushing nice and will give you such an irritable reaction of skin itching of people who've taken vitamin B they three they know this so it becomes the antabuse for micro dosing but moreover it excites the nerves at the end of the peripheral nervous system and neuropathy is oftentimes present themselves a deadening of the fingertip the nerves of the fingertips and toes and it's also a vasodilator so there's three attributes of stacking niacin with suicide mushrooms that prevents abuse becomes the antabuse it dilates the blood vessels to deliver the neurogenic benefits of psilocybin to the endpoints of the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system and it then and also excites the nerve endings so I think those three reasons this could be I hope to see in the future psilocybin mushrooms being over-the-counter vitamins approved by the FDA stack with niacin that allows for the universality of use for the benefit of our culture and what we were talking last time is there any other evidence of people taking these analogs and having this anti-anxiety effect other than you I mean this seems it's a very small sample size where it's just one person yes there are as an antidepressant as far as the anxiety and and and depression are interrelated there are are reports james Fadiman in his studies he is population study which admittedly small did not see an anti eggs anxiety component but other clinical studies at Johns Hopkins also the anxiety of dying from cancer right but that was actually suicide but that was actually suicide but I'm saying with you is also you had a very profoundly stressful situation happening something you had prepared for for a long time than all sudden was gone and all this money's gone you got to try to figure out get it back if I could its immediate right maybe with these other people they didn't have such an immediate anxiety moment and maybe their anxiety was harder to measure whether it was coming or going well I absolutely it's an enemy one study this needs this is just people me no the other one with the other people that have experienced it but didn't experience any anti-anxiety there's no one else that we know in the scientific literature yo handguards mentions he I published Selassie be our essence with him the most potent suicide mushroom in the world yoanne guard says and one thing that he was asked and he said that the Bayer Sisseton was equal to that soul Simon I don't have high confidence in that statement I consider BAE assistant I was ready for liftoff I was hoping for liftoff I know but liftoff feels like and I didn't get it so so this is this is what happens in science so much is the scientists when they you can't do a clinical study you wee bioassay this is very common this is how Albert Hoffman you know discovered you know LSD he bio a sated so we need to it accidentally though an ancient accident Lane right got in the one for the famous bike ride but then he did it purposely after that but nevertheless this is what our scientific you know Psychonauts must do sometimes Shogun yes Oscar Shogun's a famous for the most famous of all and the most revered and he bioassay based on his knowledge of chemistry he wasn't going to try to commit suicide lamb so so this is really an area that I think has enormous value and a several medicine studies have come out one that I had mentioned before is a population of several hundred thousand prisoners and there was a 18 percent reduction in violent crime 22% or so reduction in larceny and theft in a population where they reported they had one psilocybin mushroom experience and statistically significant now Association may not be causation but it can be but a more recent study from the British Columbia what I find to be so fascinating is that they did a large population set and partner to partner violence if you're a male partner had done one psilocybin trip to statistically significant reduction of the probability of that partner being violent towards their other partner statistically significant so I always thought that there's a dating app maybe you should have the dating app have you tripped on Sullivan yes well that may be a better you know candidate for dating so I think psilocybin makes nicer people and I think we did a lot more nicer people that are more creative that are dedicated to helping the community and I think this is a a potential paradigm shifting if a drug unquestionably and here's the other thing this could be profit I mean these these companies that are seeking to profit off of pharmaceutical drugs you can profit off this stuff with particularly with the protocol that you just described with adding niacin to it to ensure that people are doing only micro dosing look man this could be a very profitable enterprise for some company and the benefits if if people can mirror the benefits that you had of this alleviation of anxiety I mean god that's like most of what people struggle with so many people out there listening to this right now like fuck I wish there was something that didn't get me high but just alleviated this fucking angst that so many people are struggling with every day I'd say it's a massive disease complex has swept our societies yeah and and and facing all these problems how could you not become depressed well you cannot become depressed by becoming creative and I think that's all Simon and micro dosing enables the creative pathways for ingenuity for us to feel but we have meaning we can make a meaningful difference it's really important you know we've entered into 6x the sixth greatest extinction event known in the history of life in this planet we've had two other extinction events from asteroid impacts 250 million years ago 65 million years ago but we're and now involved in a massive extinction event and the research that came out today and the other resources come out with 75 percent of the insect population 40% in in immediate jeopardy the research article came out said in Europe and North America they have good data collection Amazon they don't so we do you mean have a measure of the insect loss in the Amazon but if you're a trout if you're a bird if you like drinking coffee and you like chocolate and like almonds I mean these are all dependent upon pollinators so if we lose these flying insects we lose the pollination services and it threatens worldwide food biosecurity this is one of the biggest threats to our ecosystem now I think we can invent our ways out of this if we creatively you know expand our ability to come up with novel solutions and I think those solutions are literally underfoot and all around us today we just have to wake up like I woke up to helping the bees you know there are so many smart people out there if they just started realizing that nature is a deep well of evolutionary knowledge and that we have evolved within this complexity then to delve into that library of knowledge and pulling out a political solutions vetted by science controlled studies but not looking at these pharmaceutical pure molecules as the way of the future but looking at the upon the complexity of the microbiome the complex interrelationships and selecting out micro biomes that then quit guilds of solutions that are applicable to the problems that we face today hmm all right I like that idea all of it it's just it's it's beautiful that there are these natural solutions that you know maybe if we could just shift people's ideas about how we view psilocybin how we view the analogs how we view the interaction people in nature that you can you know we can make a real change make a change that's tangible inside of our lifetime and again selling this stuff like give look we're seeing what's happening right now with medical marijuana and then shifting to commercial marijuana and now hemp it's giant I mean it's a huge industry through its change Colorado Colorado Denver's Real Estate's gone through the roof people are moving there so much that they've got traffic problems now they never conceived of in the past it's it's changed their economy and it's changed their economy due to just a really obvious shift here's the shift marijuana is not bad for you it's not we thought it was it's not we're sorry you could have it now and now you could sell it and now it's legal but federally we're still dealing with Schedule one so it's it's there these shifts are happening these companies are investing money there's a lot of profit to be made and a lot of people are profiting but it's still in this weird transitionary stage it is but this is a People's Revolution yeah you have decriminalized nature coming out of Oakland which I'm fully in favor of how dare we make a species illegal that makes no sense to me but what is Oakland specifically they've made ayahuasca psilocybin what else all natural products with psychoactive properties to the best of my understanding both Denver and Oakland they removed the funding of the prosecutors and judges in the courts so you can't use public funds in order to prosecute people for possession so this is a very still arrest them for it though well you the law enforcement officers not getting paid he's not doing his job he's violating his code of conduct I mean if you arrest him and you take him to a prosecutor or prosecutors I have no funding for this now you're wasting our time you're just coming here is wasting my time I have murders to solve what if someone's selling it decriminalization does not it doesn't prevent you from being prosecuted for selling assets right that's a really really good question and I have thoughts on it that's controversial because this speaks to the ability of some people having access and not if you want I only trip on suicide mushrooms once or twice a year that's all I need as Terence I think Alan Watts said when you when you when you get the message from the phone hang it up um so if you just have these little time mushrooms growing in your backyard or you know how to collect them then you only need one or two doses a year and even micro dosing you know you could you get a lot more extension of that but my view and I I've never had any problem with law enforcement in Washington Oregon in British Columbia in Canada in particular law enforcement has a very pretty mature attitude towards this if you have a small amount and you're not trafficking and you're for individual use it just doesn't raise the level of the need for enforcement no I understand that but I just wish there was no incentive at all there was nothing there like this the idea that you have to rely on the good grace of a cop who understands there's no incentive to arrest you that seems a coarse shit to me yeah like we're growing adults in 2019 with a mountain of evidence this is not we're not living in the dark ages anymore the fact that it's still a possibility that you get arrested or you could face some sort of criminal charges for having something that's only been demonstrated to be good this is why is the citizens movement the federal government I mean the Republicans and conservatives and libertarians are all about state rights this is a People's Movement they should get behind this because individual community rights against the big man against the federal government yeah the federal government it needs to be a title change and how do we do that is because we have we have decriminalized a nature in Oregon we have the Dender and Denver initiative other cities around the country it's now spreading throughout the entire yeah there's probably 20 cities in the next 16 months they're gonna have decriminalization the City Council's I also think it's a significant solution to this problem that we're facing with pills and a lot of destructive drugs there's a lot of self-destructive drugs that people are taking because these people are hurting what what psilocybin gives you that these drugs don't it gives you a potential to heal it gives you a moment to reflect it gives you a change in the way you think and you interface with the world and that just doesn't exist in those other those drugs or escape drugs and the need to escape is what we got to eliminate and I think that's one of the things that psilocybin can help it can help alleviate the need to escape and a shout-out to Rick Doblin and Ileana Gillooly of maps maps org the multidisciplinary Association for psychedelic studies maps dot org and maps dot CA in Canada have been instrumental and bringing forward psychedelic drugs for PTSD and clinical studies and maps is now on phase three with MDMA with MDMA have had Rick on a couple of times so yeah he's I mean he's a real pioneer in this and so what's interesting in getting now I'm from three different groups I have heard who sat down with FDA scientists there's been a new turnover within the FDA and these scientists are looking at just pure science without politics they don't care about politics they want to help people and several of them have said they've never seen it was so sad in particular a safer drug with such a dramatic impact was so it's in frequency of use one or two times and so there was a movie that just came out called fantastic fungi and and Michael Pollan's in there I'm in there Louis Schwartzberg has put it out he he spent 12 years working on this movie this fantastic fungi calm it's a grassroots movement theaters are selling out all over the country they look at New York City for one night they have to keep it in for a week because they're standing lines standing room you know long lines to get into the theater it's all about the use of mushrooms and the Johns Hopkins studies with end-of-life patients it's very very well done but it speaks to this is that this is literally a quote unquote underground movement that's welling up and the the attraction that people have for this is a reflection of the title change that is happening now this is a worldwide movement that is sweeping through the mycelial underground and through a connection so something I very much encourage you to see fantastic fun is it on Netflix it's not on Netflix Louis was offered a lot of money for Netflix but once it gets in the Netflix it's a library book in the library and he wanted to build community so he's been out and people can sponsor theater openings it's got a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes how many movies get a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes so it is really a people's movie in a spreading you know where can you get it you go to fantastic for nj.com and you can sign up for theaters Norma so it has to be in a theater yeah right now it will be eventually after this year it's going to be available on the web right now Louis spent a lot of money four or five million dollars I think Norman and Lynne leer Norman Lear all in the family you know nor chipmunk er there are also a co-producers of this really yeah and so yeah Lindley Roman Lear's out there tripping allegedly I can explore the magic that lives beneath our feet Wow III thought Archie Bunker was one of the most lovable racist conservative assholes I've ever ever seen on TV but um well normally I did a lot more than that yeah this is really interesting though that they've decided to release it in in film theaters and verses on the web because if you really want to reach a lot of people I mean is it selling this way it's just I mean it seems like if he spent a lot of money the way to get that money back would be to sell it to Netflix like wow that's I would agree with you except Amazon Netflix offered him 1/4 to 1/2 of the cost and so oh it was not they didn't value it and they didn't see it I mean South by Southwest turned him down and it's got a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes my people just don't see this violate South by Southwest turned them down because it's not part I think of the Hollywood establishment South by Southwest you know so I mean I can't explain why South by Southwest terms of town or you know or the the other festivals the contest of walk cetera that's not my level of expertise but what is happening is that these theaters are selling out days upon days a huge response people have an appetite for this because it gives them hope and meaning in our time of desperation they see actionable solutions that cross political and cultural boundaries that can help the Commons hmm and I think that we are suffering in our societies from the media from the politics from the science showing the loss of habitat health that were under lots of stressors just like the bees are we have a multiplicity of stressors and these stressors lead to malaise depression disease crime and poverty and it's something that I think can can help to a title change for the better provided it's done responsibly now you've mentioned companies there's 20 at least new psilocybin companies have been formed in the past year a lot of them from the canadian cannabis industry they made a ton of money so they're they've several of them called me up I've talked to two groups in both groups when I asked them have you done a heroic dose on Soul Simon none of them would admit that they did they're scared they had even tripped what I asked him have you done a small dose they said I never my silent and at one group I said you folks just seemed like economic opportunists and one of them said that's exactly what we are we just try to make money so I'll make a deal with them listen I need one afternoon of your time I think it's important to come to Jesus I mean it would be amazing right do that and say look I'll do this deal with you but just give me five hours you take five hours have them all trip together and now go let's reevaluate this I'm with you I'm with you brother and that's what's needed because those of us who understand the importance of this realize that this is something that we have to carefully shepherd yes for maximum benefit and at these commercialization of these companies I call it Spore Wars very soon this can be spore wars between all these concepts good thing that's then that's a sequel spore wars listen Mandy what it's exciting to me is it's not dirty anymore okay when the first time I did mushrooms I think was very very early 2000s and God he'd tell people about it they were like what's wrong with you you're a grown adult you pay taxes yeah you know all my life it's like you what kind of a fuckup are you at your age you're doing mushrooms my god grow up if that's what it was like and you would tell me no I don't think that's what it is I think it expands your consciousness I think it connects you to higher levels of thinking and it just it makes you more in tuned with the great beyond there's something there's something more there and I'm like you listen to yourself yeah go to work go goddamn get up in the morning and have a cup of coffee and go to work but now it's people are slowly but sure the dirtiness of even and then the term micro dosing is wonderful because people know you can take a little bit you know I believe micro dose on this podcast for RN I just took a couple stems recently and then like I guess is probably a little more than microdose it was it was a pretty we were we were definitely noticeably high but like an hour in and like me an hour and a half in I go I forgot we took mushrooms like why am I so happy but that feeling it's like I want people to experience that feeling because it's a it's a relatively clean feeling and I after mushrooms I feel younger yeah and I go to these TED conferences every year and I feel lighter I feel like I was treated like a leper you know and I went to Ted you know and the organism er Ted were so afraid I don't talk about psychedelic mushrooms how many years ago is this into 2008 when I first went what's it like now though there's right this last time I mean I was treated like a super celebrity I had these hugely hugely powerful people some names you probably know who came up to me and would shake my shoulders going now I understand now I understand yeah down boy you know they're there but they walk into something and they're their mates they're friends their business associates you know there seem that the common theme is wow he was such a jerk before and he's so nice now yeah and the seeking cooperation and they still are productive they're still are creative they're banging it out the coders in in Silicon Valley know that micro dosing helps their coding ability so it's a competitive advantage to those other computer companies that do not mmm you know I think any any new business populated in particular by young people who are not doing micro dosing are gonna be a competitive disadvantage mmm because the creativity flow the camaraderie the community seeking to benefit the Commons and also reward yourself I'm not saying it's all you know just just helping helping the Commons but the idea of being able to reward yourself and people rejoice and your success and they benefit from it as well it really integrates people together yeah and it's also people need to understand that there's a lot of this squirreling away resources and money and things and and trying to climb that corporate ladder this is a finite life it doesn't last that long it's a trick you get sucked into this trick and this trick is what every CEO and every head of every corporation every chief financial officer all these people that are just trying to like improve the bottom line rake in more money keep this company growing and keep kicking ass it's a trick you're sucked up in a trick there's a natural human tendency to accumulate numbers for whatever reason good back to our early days when resources were scarce and if you get sucked into that trick one day you're gonna wake up and that that's gonna be usually be too late you usually it's on your deathbed usually it's close to it you like what did I do this is it my health is failing my life is falling apart and what has my life been it's been 10 12 14 hours a day in these stuffed offices under fluorescent lights crunching numbers and trying to acquire things and and for what like what what impact have I made on humans what would what is the negative impact of my ambition on the people that around me like all this is like the one thing that psilocybin and particularly just psychedelics in general can provide is a break from patterns a stopping a cease fire of all the momentum of our culture civilization finances taxes credit-card debt all that shit just stops and you get a chance to step back and look at the Machine watch it all whirl and spin in front of you and you get to say oh I got sucked into the trick I'm starting to a trick a lot of people I've talked to exactly what you're talking you're mentioning and they did do a heroic journey yeah and they then look back and going why was i prioritizing that yeah I want to be out with my children yes you know and looking at birds or walking in nature yeah a chore like I might one of my books else I have mushrooms of the world has a great chapter and I think called good tips for great trips and one of the things I understand the clinically controlled settings for clinical study six out of a lot of us don't need that but I really enjoy being on an ocean Bluff or a high point and by being in the mushrooms about half an hour before sunset being with a loved one also good to have an experienced person who's not tripping who is up the watcher sitter a sitter a sitter is there thinking meditation practice in place folks give these people some space who's just watching and then the people who are imbibing understand they have a watcher they have somebody who's anchored who could help them and then to have this the Sun go down and and the stars come out and the colors and then this oceanic expanse of experience is just as nothing short of spiritual and I agree I think there's one thing we should talk about though there are people that have a tendency toward schizophrenia and these people have sometimes they have psychedelic breaks like they'll have psychedelic experiences and then they don't do well they go off I'm so glad you brought that up and that is a D selection from the from the clinical studies of candidates who want to engage but my good friend Mark Hayden who runs Maps Canada had a very interesting story with the schizophrenic I mean he also cautioned in every physician I know is on the same page as you including medic not to medical marijuana edible edible marijuana seems to have a significant effect on people with it what mark noted with this one person who is a severe schizophrenic was that he still heard voices in his head but the voices now were friendly they were affirming they weren't like you know go that old somebody it was like you know you are a good person right and so he still had the voice in the head but the tenor and tone and attitude of the voices were supportive what I'm talking about is it bringing on these schizophrenic experiences that there has been some evidence particularly about marijuana that high doses of marijuana for people that have tendencies and we don't know right what what causes someone to have schizophrenic breaks because there there is a difference between pre and post right people have had deteriorating mental health that's that correlates with schizophrenia like what what it what it caused them to be less gets a frantic or not exhibiting any of the the problems and then all the sudden having severe problems post psychedelic trip or post large dose edible marijuana and or even large dose smoking it Oh some people they dab and they smoke wax and then it happens to people that smoke too much pot there's certain people that have that tendency I I would defer to clinicians who are extremely skilled in this area and who have seen many many patients I'm not a doctor but I concur with you I think that is a real concern the difference between a toxin and a drug oftentimes be dose and know at lower doses you can see things at the higher doses you you don't right so it's an entire spectrum and it's so complex and individuality zuv if people are so uniquely different yeah I have a friend who's a doctor if he smokes a joint he can't go to sleep hi smoke a joint and I'm a-comin to a cuddle puddle man I'm ready for the pillow you know at night I just I use it for going to sleep yeah I'm the opposite yeah I start writing I want to read and want to watch documentaries but it's a sativa thing too as well right isn't it do you have a significant difference in the way your body responds to sativas versus indicas I like to be educated in this subject I've used both for a very long time I love Afghani indica I you have a beard I have a beard I love the smell cannabis on my legs smelling your beer yeah it's my perfume right I get it so but there's a lot you know we're in a new realm of pharmacology mmm and Pharma cognizant and this and I think we have to navigate this carefully the problem with natural products is how do you standardize them to the active constituent when you have more than one active constituent you know how do you standardize them all there's an entourage or a symphony effect this speaks to the complexity of nature but I have a phrase that I like is don't let the perfect be the enemy of look good just because you can't understand it doesn't mean it necessarily does not have a valid outcome or you know can't be used and I think that what we need to do is correct large data sets and that's why I'm hoping microdose not me is going to give us an enormous amount of data then that clinicians can harvest from and going we didn't anticipate this and like these meta studies about partnered partner violence when if your partner men had tripped on mushrooms they were less prone to violence that was signal from the noise how many other signals from the noise of these big big meta files that we can we can pull out then we can get serious scientists to do really carefully control clinical studies to be able to see this and then and then how do you combine them and I mean there's this it's a whole new landscape that gets away from single molecules into the complexity of nature that we can build upon navigating to that place is going to be a challenge there's no doubt about it but I think we're smart enough now we have enough computer technologies and diagnostic tools that we should begin on that voyage today what do you think is responsible for that shift from Ted of 2008 to Ted of 2019 Michael Pollan's book probably yeah Michael Pollan's book was was the big bridge and now he has 40 pages on me and Michael if you're listening buddy dude I told him not to reveal my secret mushroom tops never trust a journalist and Michael Pollan bless his heart I love him he's a great guy but he said in his book so so to speak he says Paul told me not to tell you where my his secret mushroom patch is but I can tell you that we slept in a yurt there are three state parks along the Columbia River and two of them have Europe's he just basically gave up your spot my spot and it's like okay Michael well do that I think it's the urge of the writer trying to give something to their readership you know so what happened to that spot get raised it's it's run over with people collecting saliva mushrooms they have big signs everywhere they rush people it's a huge income source now for the tops for the cops because they bust people but it but the good news about that as I have gone on three state parks and because there's big signs of no mushroom picking a law enforcement there there's lots of mushrooms they're everywhere and so I can photograph them but you're not allowed to touch them so they look what do they check you on your way out oh there there are like bees on honey so to speak come on they are hiding in the bushes there are alpha males man that they've got drugs growing out of the ground and they start they strode touches I had a lot of fun with my friend because I got a stick and I go okay I touched the mushrooms with a stick now am I actually touching the mushrooms or not because if you touch them they check your pockets they will search you yeah they'll search you for just randomly know if they have reason to believe reason to believe they can search you stuff them in your underwear bro just take a big fat baggie or swallow them quickly but um you know I know this is it is preposterous well if they find you lying down well it with your eyes dilated you'd have to talk to them you know I don't know if they would do a fecal sample later on or what Christ but it is it approaches the absurd yeah you know and this is when the law enforcement because it was absurd even the law enforcement officers I know who you know even the martial arts a lot all your life myself as well I had several schools for about thirty years and I had several law enforcement officers or students yeah they don't want to be involved I know they get roped into it by the system yeah they'd like this is not something they want to do I know a ton of cops or not none of them give a shit about mushrooms yeah it's yeah it's hugely hugely unfortunate consequence of really ridiculous laws and in the idea of grown adults telling other grown adults that they can't do something that is incredibly beneficial that they themselves have never experienced they have no knowledge of it at all other than the ancient stereotypes mushrooms being bad mushrooms being for burnouts and losers and hippies and all you can't handle life those are walking hypocrites and they're tormented but they have to do this so yeah I found that most law enforcement officers are extremely reasonable yeah as long as you show intent you know yeah respect respect yeah under percent so it's it's never been but you know I don't subscribe to the defense that someone joined for spiritual purposes and they have you know hundreds of pounds with ziplock bags with scales in the basement and doing a commercial operation right you're avoiding taxes right you're producing this as a factory you know take it in the chin you get busted a comes with the territory yeah eyes wide open don't cloak it in like the navale of spirituality you're trying to create a spiritual revolution unless you're a true Saint you're giving that shit away yeah well that would be different but yeah I have a phrase nature provides I don't because I don't want to be responsible for another person's experience so for sure what if they have a meltdown and they blame Joe Rogan yes Paul stam yes I don't I can't control that circumstance I don't want the responsibility mm-hmm that's one of the reasons why I've hesitated on getting involved in medical marijuana or so you know commercial marijuana have been offered and I'm always like I just don't think this is a right because you can't especially with edibles you can't control people you don't know what they're gonna do I don't why Kenyon College in 1973 my dad was coming to visit and one of my one of my people on the floor at this dormitory they made some marijuana brownies oh boy and I had never think we starts that way I ate two brownies I got my dad's coming in two or three hours so what the heck and I was so frigging stoned I could not believe it and I could barely keep my eyes were really I was trying to trying to maintain it you know how it is you're trying to look like you're not stoned but you're blitzed out of your gourd and so I would my dad was like you're looking at me really curiously this 1970s and so the next day I said dad I got to tell you something I hate some marijuana brownies he goes I knew something was wrong I knew I could tell what I could tell I don't know shit Sherlock I'm finally on the floor yeah but it was it's but marijuana did he get mad at you no he was actually amused and delighted that I explained to him why I look so stoned oh well that's great that you had that kind of communication yeah just before before he died he wanted to trip on mushrooms and and I turned him down because it was close to the end of his life and he was very religious and I was concerned I would shake his reality tree so severely that he would question his entire life because he was like a Death of a Salesman figure is a tragic life that he led and the mushrooms could have helped him enormous Lee but I was a concern that he would look back and goes I wasted my life so that was too much of too heavy for me you know maybe I am maybe I'm being selfish because I was trying to protect my own feelings but he wanted to do it he asked me actually he said I want to do suicide mushrooms with you and he wouldn't smoke pot do you have regrets about that but not doing it with him I do I have a lot of regrets about that so I I have met several people in the past several weeks at Stanford Medical School at these other conferences that I go to which there's a brain mind conference at Stanford Medical School in the first two sentences they mentioned psilocybin 120 neuroscientists you know and 150 billion dollars in the room and psilocybin was immediately mentioned and when I met some people there that are intergenerational grandparent parent an 18 19 year old child all journeyed with mushrooms together and their interpersonal relationships they told me you know there's no reason for us ever to get mad at each other I just thought that was really powerful Wow yeah that is powerful that sounds inconceivable to someone who's never experienced psychedelics but someone who has you go yeah I see how you could get there don't make mountains out of molehills yeah you know you can disagree without being angry and you can be civil about it yes well that's unless in the world could use right now I think this is in many ways the antidote for some of the problems that we're seeing with social media one of the problems we see with social media is this disconnect from the human experience disconnect from communication person-to-person communication and this anger and vitriol and look at hate and Heidi behind screen yes you know you're Joe Rogan I'm Paul Stamets yeah well who are these people hide behind screen names through just and a great TED talk which I did not understand and the TED talk was fantastic talking about why trolls do the things that they do they do it because they get excitement sure the idea is just to disturb the fabric and the more disturbance they get that is a measure of their success yes and provoking a response even if I'm not wedded to it I just want to be able to cause a ripple in the pond yeah and they don't feel significant so they want to do something that they can get some sort of reaction they have a rock they see a window they want to throw it it's it's a natural inclination but it's stupid it's barbaric it's fun but it's at least a fucking time you know and some people celebrated I'm like okay celebrate it you're not doing shit you're not doing shit for yourself you're not doing shit for other people you're not improving whatever your art is whatever your whatever whatever it is that you you try to do in this life to leave your mark or to contributor to be creative you're not doing that if you're trolling it's not all troller should eat mushrooms yes well all Angry people should be mushrooms doesn't that's true I really agree with that well you know there is good evidence that lion's mane also compensates in many of these neurogenic benefits that's all stuff all the time this is like a lion's mane elixir that I pour it tell me if that shit's any good well it comes from China and was that bad every Chinese expert I've met they said I wouldn't dare buy a mushroom from China rice so this is we have a spoon a bull lion's mane which got and I put that in smoothies all the time and that's my go-to and that's what exactly the research I put it in coffee yeah I put in coffee and Jamie do you pull up that how much it put in neurogenesis benefits of lion's mane how much do I put in who's open no I put about a teaspoon and it's stirred in but the the neuro is good and the neurogenesis the this company in France that we did the neurogenic tests with found out that my psyllium was far more active than the mushroom foot bodies and so the lion's mane stimulates neuro and basically extends the nerves from from from growing compared to baseline yeah so in seven to twelve days of substantial up to 22 percent increase in neural outgrowth what we found was actually there's one who was at 8% one was at 12% and then separately we stack that with an analogue of psilocybin and rather than could be the arithmetic arithmetic additive of cumulative we found the synergy so we think that lion's mane the resources shown increases my Erland regeneration on the sheath of the nerves and this all cyber it's nerve tip growth so it should conceivably help you learn this is so this is an example this is unexpected result this is lines named mycelium that's showing a 14 you know basically 14.8% over a baseline then we have a psilocybin analog that didn't do all that great which analog is this again this is a I'm gonna scribe the analog for now okay for obvious reasons but it's a legal analog it creates a 7% outgrowth of neurites but then we stocked it with lion's mane and and these also have an analogue there's a theoretical additive effect 1:14 plus 107 1:22 but we got 136 statistically significant the outlier actually is even higher so the learner and the neuroscientists in France that did this study was extremely excited and we found that and the more we titrated it to greater dilution the more active it becomes what's that mean well what I trait was it but maybe we're diluting it and it is our human cells for potent stem cells and what we found was originally we were told is it's called 3 micrograms per milligram or 3 micrograms a millionth of a gram but when we went back to 2.03 100 times less the neurogenic benefits became greater now there's something called the PK conversion the the pharmacokinetics when you ingest something only a small portion of it may make it into your bloodstream so but the good news is is that these things are so non-toxic and they're so potent now looking at the dosing regimen it appears so far we haven't done this clinically this is human cells in but this laboratory is predictive of neurogenic compounds that these Punk the neurogenic benefits are so substantial that the peak a conversion of ingesting them can be seen in the bloodstream as a fairly good conversion rate so you for instance if you take vanilla cassidy vanilla about two percent will make it into your bloodstream so if you take a 1 whole gram of vanilla only 2% actually gets in your blood scream so that that's the peak a conversion so what we're seeing is right now is the potency of this is so strong at lower and lower delusions we're getting more and more potency so i'm this is yeah it's a it's i like to say dilution is a solution to profitability the more that we dilute the more potent it becomes so this why the neuroscientists in France are doing a study going this stuff is so potent please dilute it diluted diluted so low and so we're we see this as a tremendous horizon that Lions Mane's legal it's an edible in choice mushroom thousand-year history of use I found that my psyllium is far more potent than the mushrooms for really good reasons the the comp some that compounds are called RNA scenes and these are actually discovered by kawanishi in 1994 looking for an antibacterial agent and so when they when he was looking at the mycelium fighting bacteria he found that the mycelium expressed this antibacterial scythe and derivative and he gave the name Aaron a scene after her ischium erinaceus just like penicillin is named after Penicillium and so he'd stumbled on the fact that it has neurogenic properties and antibacterial properties so the mycelium is navigating through the ground through a hostile environment it's only one cell wall thick it the mycelium has an immune system that's operational between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit you know 35 degrees Celsius that's that's that's the window is growing in so it's immune systems operative in that window when you do super hot water extracts you're in the DreamZone that's not part of the illogical lifespan of the mushroom your decocting it you're taking out ingredients but you're not harnessing within the me illogical window of temperatures that the mycelium has evolved to fight off pathogens and so what we have found is the mycelium is far more active than the fruit bodies this is all new science but then mushroom references comm is populated with dozens upon dozens of peer-reviewed articles showing the mycelium as far more active than the fruit bodies and a whole genome sequencing of reishi for instance founds 25 more 25% more genes coding for proteins are expressed at the mycelial state than at the mushroom State well it makes sense because the mushrooms at the end of millions of cell divisions there were months years even decades finally produce a mushroom that rots in five days the mushroom doesn't need a good immune system is attracting Michael Voris animals deer you know John just showed me some photographs of he's gonna show you if he was in a campground and found deer in the morning digging up mushrooms out of the ground while animals engage mushrooms your your colleagues here or maybe it's Jeff I'm sorry Jeff okay so buddy idea but many of mushrooms attract insects people animals because they're fragrant there are protein there are nutritionally dense and they want to engage humans the mycelium is navigating through a microbial hostile environment and report came out in the literature of a thousand species of bacteria in a single gram there's more than eight miles of mycelium in a simple cubic inch so the mycelium is navigating through a hostile microbial environment is setting up guilds and micro biomes and collections of cooperating bacteria that can help them defend against pathogens look at that estimated up to eight miles of mycelium in a single inch of soil and it's only one cell wall thick that's such a weird looking image so it's so hard to see what that is that's a mushroom that's melted back into the ground its mycelium that's just now the mushrooms generated mycelium and it goes underneath the ground so every time you're walking on the ground you're walking up on my upon miles of mycelium and it knows that you're there these are sensitive these are not only externalized stomachs that are digesting nutrients and externalized lungs exhaling carbon dioxide inhaling oxygen but I believe these are extant neurological networks of nature when you see that pervasiveness of those cells and the climate change scientists are coming around to this seventy percent of the carbon biologically stored in mycelium in the ground the way to fight climate change there's not only replanting trees which is great I love it but it's the mycelial networks you're building in the humans that creates the soil that creates the biodiversity that then guarantees the health of the ecosystem so as that mycelial networks that govern because they're so pervasive they set up because they're antibacterial properties there are pro bacterial properties another example of this is in the microbiome of soils and inside humans stomachs turkey tail mushrooms and a placebo controlled random a randomized clinical study with humans from the Sun scientists associated with Harvard they found that turkey tail mycelium is a prebiotic the microbiome that feeds Bifidobacterium liked lactobacillus and suppresses Clostridium which is an inflammatory bacterium so it's really really interesting that the mycelium is feeding nutrients to the beneficial bacteria within the microbiome that then gives us health and so it's these are precursor nutrients that elevate the populations of beneficial bacteria so the two go hand-in-hand but what about edible mushrooms things like shiitake and those type of mushrooms is there any nutritional benefit to those things like enormous nutritional benefit and there's been - also meta studies have come out this year showing that the ingestion of of mushrooms with elderly people over the age of 60 there's a 50% decrease odds of Alzheimer's like symptoms without population and people consuming 3 much meals per week now they didn't specify the mushrooms is not a single pour but the mushrooms that are commonly eating our oyster mushrooms shiitake and shimeji I made and maybe some of some of their mushrooms but that's that's once a meta study that came out there was a study out of Japan from doctor Ichikawa at the National Cancer Center that found statistically significant reduction in cancers across the board I think one hundred and sixty two thousand people in this data set and he was sent over the Nagano Prefecture to look for this and these are edible and delicious mushrooms also they empower the immune system is again signal from the noise statistically significant reduction overall cancer rates associated with a food they division now between you know foods and medicines is blurred and yet it speaks Hippocrates you know in deities standing that let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food so it's interesting because physicians have been taught you know this sort of monomolecular approach to medicine and now we were realizing that these foods are essential nutrients for your immune system that that down regulates inflammation and so interesting that we're learning all this during our lifetime to you'd think that would all be established by now well I'm glad you asked that we have a paper coming out and next two or three days maybe in the next week and this on Turkey Tail mycelium they've grown on rice and we were able to find out something that no one had really reported in literature the traditional Chinese medicine approaches that these are you know modulators they help the immune system but they also not inflammatory when you have an immune response oftentimes associated with an inflammatory response blood rushes to the wound you inflame you have all these these compounds that are being produced by the blood to suppress infection but you can over amp the immune system and have an implant a pro flam Ettore response that can cause a lot exudative stress damage and ik laterally and so the article that is just coming out with BMC biomed central alternative in a complement peer-reviewed we have found that the mycelium when it grows on rice bio firm rice to then produce a unique geological response that up-regulates was called interleukin-1 ra and interleukin-10 these are anti-inflammatory cytokines and so the mycelium doesn't do that the mushrooms do and do that but the mycelium is bio fermented the rice like tempeh is is transformed or like yogurt comes from milk because of lactobacillus acidophilus and that transformation then makes a novel product we found the same thing that the the rice compared to the rice control has no anti-inflammatory properties the mycelium because the extracellular metabolites changes the rice into a unique illogical product that excites the expression of anti inflammatory compounds while also exciting the pro immune response so it's a buffered response it's interesting too that you're bringing this up that it's growing on something else and that that seems to be part of nature right this sort of symbiotic relationship that some of these mushrooms have with the plants and the the environment around them that's a really really good point because the mycelium will be found with the bees when we grew the mycelium on rice compared to on birch wood the mycelium brown rice reduced the viruses you know 10 plus the ten to one the mycelium we grew it on birch reduce the viruses up to a thousand to one so that's a natural environment that that that speaks the fact that there there appears to be something that's coding within the ecosystem that then excites the mycelium to produce something that is more strongly result in the antiviral activity that's the case with cordyceps as well right cordyceps mushrooms grow on other things yeah but the course of the mushrooms when they grow on the worms this is something that was a big subject of debate because because quarter sepsis is a it's it's it's a a mushroom that grows on a worm basically and that and in the Himalayas I also are in China in the Far East and people were finding these quarter steps mushrooms and they were cloning them and then they got the culture going and then they analyzed the culture and they got what's called an Animorph it's not that complicated it's just two faces of the same coin there's a mushroom fruit body and then there's this imperfect form that is a different looking organism but they're actually the same they have two different expressions when they all the scientific literature kept on coming up with different Animorphs and so they all had all this competition the scientific literature what is the true Animorph of cordyceps sinensis well now it's called Avio cordyceps sinensis they redefined it's called sensu stricto and when they analyzed them the mushrooms not until recently discovered that another fun of fungi are chasing the cordyceps sinensis as the fruit body develops other fungi are chasing right behind the other fungus so he have multiple fungi that are actually present in the quarter SEPs worm it's not just one species it's multiple species that are are co-occurring chasing each other in the inside the the cordyceps mushroom as is fruits so again it just speaks to the complexity of nature so so what where should you get your cordyceps source and for health benefits you know that's a really good question quarter sips militarists does not have these issues that quarter substances does the problem is cordyceps sinensis thousands of articles have been published really which one they are talking about it's like it's all mixed up now what is what a true animal for these scientists using mmm there one's called Basilio my sees you know there's other other ones that her her see Telus announced this is now thought to be the true in a more four quarter substances well this lingo means is basically there's a mushroom with a whole bunch of other fungi that are associated with it and when they cultured these other fungi they did clinical studies or research studies and they came up with results the problem is that they've mixed it up into four or five different species and you can't sort of D a disambiguate the data now because it's too complicated so it's a really good question the course EPS militarists does not have these issues and so I would steer people to cordyceps military right now because the course Epson insists the Osseo quarter substances issues are still complicated and now virtually thousands of research articles are an all now suspect because no one has a foggiest idea what animal wharf they were using oh wow so it speaks to the complexity of the system so and how many people are actually working on this data - of thousands of researchers and and I'm thankful that the Chinese mycologist sort of were the ones who finally sorted this out mmm there was a lot of conflict academically there's a lot of big egos in academia mmm people get wedded to their own research you know we're all like that and and the challenges went back and forth and fortunately a group of Chinese scientists finally were able to narrow down their argument to understand that everyone was actually doing good culture work they were actually expert mycologist taking the right tissue taking it from the right cordyceps mushroom it's just that at that time then a different fungus that was naturally part of the inside of the mushroom that was a mixture of fungi that were racing at different paces up the mushroom well the Chinese were the first to use it for a performance benefit right well they were the first to at least be publicized to use it in the Olympics they were using cordyceps mushrooms that was one of the reasons why don it we developed shroom tech sport which is cordyceps mushroom based supplement which I love cordyceps for workouts for a pre-workout it's like it gives you an extra gear it's really kind of crazy how effective it is especially in combination with b12 and other adaptogens it just has it's a great pre-workout supplement because it doesn't get you jittery at all it's not a stimulant but you have like a little more juice when you exercise and that's one of the things that those high-altitude hurting populations have found right that's exactly right it's likely to be a vasodilator and it has steroidal like benefits as well so yeah the quarter sets were for athletes has been tried and true and many of these Animorphs that I mentioned those properties so for athlete it's like what dose would you recommend like well I'm not a medical doctor so when people ask me recommendations I know that the common usage of these in the order of two grams you know there are usually 500 millimetre milligram capsules there's lots of good companies that are producing this you know I would just make sure it's mycelial based it's not fruit body based the the clear evidence is showing the the problem one find out whether something's my Cecilia Baker sister Clara we say mushroom mycelium on all of our labels so and if you were gonna take that like if you want to take shroom to export if you wanted to make your own concoction you would recommend 2 grams and then and make sure you had no the chain of custody of where it came from mm-hmm because a lot of these companies buy in the spot market what company is this you gave me most defenses defense is this yours yes your company oh okay we'll support you host defense and there's our website where someone can grab this yeah fungi calm or host host defense calm and do you sell cordyceps as well yes we do and do you take this stuff before you exercise do you take absolute assets yeah I take quarter steps I take lion's mane and seven species blend in particular seven species lends what's in that stuff its stem at seven it's got a scotch agha it's got reishi as a gerakan it's got a birch polypore called bit the poorest bunch of - and so it has maitake in it and these are the seven species blend but the the evidence for physicians and people who want to look at peer-reviewed articles the single species have the most elaborated and convincing evidence when you start compounding these so what we're doing if we have five or six full-time researchers several PhDs and our staff we are again trying to disambiguate the complexity of all these benefits by looking at one species out of time so we're doing this methodically spending hundreds of thousands of dollars literally a year now I have a hundred and ten employees and I created my company in order to do research I have no partners so I can now dedicate the resources to be able to do novel research and we love one up against conventional wisdom because you have to challenge conventional wisdom to see if it's indeed meets the muster for instance beta-glucans how big is a bamboo can ten thousand dollars a million government no idea what any of those words just said were baited weekends there are big polymers of sugars okay and so the big myth out there is beta glucans are the the golden compound that used to standardize products - but there is not a certified method for beta glucan analysis we have an article coming out also on a 17 species plan using the same it's called the mega zoom test the same magazine test with one was going same exact test - the same as samples one sample got less than 1% and the other sample got more than 30% you that that is a disparate range of data that does not give you any confidence and so the beta glucan method how big is the beta glucans well the basically has that are giant scaffolding it's like the structure of this building and and inside that scaffolding as all these other compounds that are adornments that are that are embedded in this giant scaffolding and so we did a clinical study with turkey tail mushrooms and breast cancer that was published in a peer-reviewed journal and the scientists that I work with can quail at Al the 19 2016 I think published an article where they used lip paisas which is an enzyme that dissolves lipids because I was arguing the beta glucans are huge scaffolding these other components inside the beta glucans that are amina logically active you know and they they had been read in literature all predominantly a beta glucans i said well let's do an experiment and they did they took the ball and ran with it and then they put this this fat dissolving enzyme lipase 'iz and they strip the lipids the fats from the beta glucan scaffolding and then they took that product without the lipids and reduced immune response by 83% thus proving that the lipids that were inside the beta glucans we're pharmacological happened now then why that's important as we do hot water extracts you don't get fats you know fast is not miscible in water and so that's why fat separates so having these fats and we're made of fat cholesterol is good for you fats are good for you wait what are you saying that whether you're a paleo guy right so you know this you know from the fats or yeah I don't I don't like that word paleo I think it's it's a little inaccurate like what people ate during the Paleolithic I like calling it primordial yeah that's a good one primal you know some people call it the primal primal diet yeah but this is speaks to the fact that the every mushroom species is like a miniature pharmaceutical factory and what makes a species is the accumulation of those compounds that are different mixtures there's around 1.5 million species of fungi a hundred and fifty thousand species are mushroom forming fungi we've identified around fifteen thousand species of this 15 thousand species we have about 20 to 40 species that we know are beneficial for human health well that's a pretty good selection criteria but going from 14,000 identified species are potentially 150,000 out there we haven't identified most of them but our ancestors through trial and error have narrowed the field of candidates down to about 20 to 40 species that we know because of their molecular arrangements and complexity benefit human health now it's when people pick mushrooms and they go out and pick mushrooms the real issue seems to be that there's some mushrooms that are edible that look very close to mushrooms very similar to mushrooms that are very poisonous true to the uninitiated and the people who have not learned but when you learn the chantrelle you will not mistake it nothing looks like a lion's mane mushroom once you learn lion's mane mushroom it's hard to mistake it so there are some look-alikes and with the Amanita phalloides the destroying angel and with a paddy straw mushroom which is commonly cultivated and collected in Asia many of the mushroom deaths in North America have come from not displaced but people's but people who've come from Asia and because they're secretive in the language barrier and the culture of being wild collectors they then mistake the destroying angel for a paddy straw mushroom that's a real common mistake there are other people who said they just looked edible that's a really dangerous thing to say you have to know species individually right there's a there's edible species of Amanita and there's poisonous ones hmm there's deadly poisonous ones Amanita seems to have a lot of controversy as far as its efficacy far as like its psychedelic efficacy what's that that I don't know anybody that's ever really tripped off of it muscaria is yeah oh man do I have a story please oh my god because everybody that I know like and that was something that McKenna talked about as well terrence talked about while he was alive they said that it seems that it's genetically variable seasonally variable perhaps even environmentally variable all those things are partially true I've eaten mg muscaria four or five times ma'am miss Kerry is the red mushroom with the white dots near tail mushroom is a perfectly legal Santa Paws mushroom it contains a muslima muscarine and EBU tannic acid actually very limited small amounts of Musk run but the muscarinic symptoms cause salivation and sweating and I tripped with my friend on on em you know mascara and and I looked at him and he was foaming at the mouth and I had all these bubbles coming out of his mouth man dude you look like ya rabies he goes you should see what you look like so but then emmeline muscaria I've eaten that a few times and people do boil it in water throw away the water twice and they can make it into a edible mushroom but it's not that great of an edible but there's another mushroom called a Madea Panther arena now Panther arena is a kick-ass mushroom it has five times or more the amounts of moose Somali botanic acid almost no mus Curran so the salivation effect on any mascara so I have a had a very good friend we are not friends anymore unfortunately but I was in charge of the herbarium at the Evergreen State College and I freestride em that a panther me know they're called panther cops they're brown in color and they have dots very good the panther cut perfectly legal mushroom an extraordinarily powerful so I was up living up in Darrington Washington at his cabin I was a logger hippie for a few years and so my friend Dave came up and I had these fries fried mushrooms from the herbarium and I said let's go ahead and eat these and I had read in the literature and almost no one had eaten them so I made an omelet and I and we cooked it up and he was much lighter than me so I thought well I should have 2/3 of the omelet right because he's lighter than me and so we ate the mushrooms around 10 o'clock and um we're living in this cabin but across the creek was a scar square Creek Campground and it was the what we call the Winnebago people right back then in the 70s I hitchhiked across country 13 times never Winnebago never picked me up so they were always in the enemy and so we were long-haired hippies you know we date these mushrooms and we thought for entertainment let's go look at the Winnebago people so we it was so close I don't know why we drove our car but we drove the car out of my cabin we went down like a half a mile and we turned left into the Squire creek campground and a static we parked the car and we wanted to go up to a beautiful view spot and so we walked through the Winnebago people and our families and everything else and and we get up onto a ridge and I thought this is a great view spot but we're waiting like an hour no effect you know and I was long the Dames oh wow maybe these aren't that potent and then right after we said that I looked out Dave and I said David do you see that oh yeah and we waited a few more seconds then this big distortion field we had a beautiful view of the volcanoes and the valleys a big view scape but we could see the air we've had to become consider this liquid and then it started coming on stronger and stronger and stronger oh my oh my god this is getting intense we better get the heck out of here go go home where it's safe because this is coming on so strong so we come down off this little this little plateau and we had to come down through the Winnebago people and then oh my god and here we're walking a thing about am adidas and mascara and pants arena you have doll yellows and browns but you feel like this giant and you're moving a slow motion every step you're taking you know you feel like this giant Bay moving really slow and and then I came to Winnebagos of no end there were hundreds of feet long I'm find a water passes but obey go and like when is this Winnebago when I end I keep on walking further and further and then oh my god and so then we're really just really really high it was ridiculous and I had a really flex camera and we came up to a car and so for some friggin reason I locked the car and so I had my key I looked at my key and I look at the lock I went missed oh shit okay pull the key back missed but Dave goes are you okay I go I'm fine because you want me to drive and I go no way dude if I'm gonna slide there's no way I want you to drive right and so I then over and over again then magically just for a repetition it just made it into the lock so I unlock the door and I get into the car and I dropped my camera and then I'm in the car and I'm trying to get my key and I thank God I didn't get my key and I was not safe to drive and then Dave is going like oh my god Paul are so friggin high right now and I go and I said well let's go home I said I dropped my camera and I went over looked like Ron there was my camera I picked it up and going ah Dave I dropped my camera drop my camera again oh ah Dave's I brought my camera I picked up my camera go whoa I dropped my camera I did this over and over and over again repetitive motion syndrome kicked in it is a very common symptom of a Madea Panther arena I dropped my camera dozens and dozens of times how'd it look at the end well it was shattered but Dave goes Paul you should look up and a whole bunch of people from the Winnebago family community have lined up holding their children in close proximity watching this repetitive motion syndrome where I'm just constantly picking my camera so they're watching you for entertainment where you went to watch them after entertainment and now they're freaking out because I have this repetitive motion syndrome and I take one step drop my camera why Dave I dropped my camera and I pick up my camera again I know that I just dropped my camera whoa dropped my camera again now this speaks to the berserkers and the berserkers the word berserk came for the berserkers and in Scandinavia where the legend has it that there were these these the Scandinavians the Vikings were surrounded and outnumbered and there were going to be killed the next day and they ate a whole bunch of em needed mascara and a big big soup and legend has it it's not been confirmed but this is the legend this very commonly reiterated is that they drank a whole bunch and muscaria soup and then they went and the next day even though they were massively outnumbered they took off all their clothes and they attack the enemy naked the swords and that's where the word berserk came from the berserkers so I'm having this Berserker experience a repetitive motion syndrome and I dropped my camera over and over and over again and and I looked up and the parents were holding their children totally freaking out you know I said we gotta get out of here so we left the doors open in the car and I'm taking one or two steps dropping my camera picking it up dropping my camera we finally made a pact he disappeared I didn't know if the Dave you're on your own on dude I have enough to worry about no I made it back to my cabin and I get from my cabin and there's a combination lock oh no I don't need a combination lock right now I can't barely you know it's I'm spinning lock back and forth spending backlight and then eventually the lock just spontaneously opened and and then I fell on the ground and I started convulsing and the cool thing about convulsing was it felt good every time I convulsed I actually went I feel so good so it convulsed some more and I was just convulsing constantly like epileptic conducted convulsions very very intense but they felt good this is the weird thing about it I needed to convulse because every time I convulse I kind of got a reset of my neurology you know I'm a baseline and then I would spin out of control and then I had this cascade of ice didn't ice Tinian thoughts I got oh my god I can save the world I know how to do this and they don't have a prepositional or in verb real phrase and just before I came to the object of my thought that was Einstein II and insight how to have a tangent and then I come to the course at the end of that sentence and then I have another tangent I saw death as if as a perpetual series of alternatives that never gave me the satisfaction of a conclusive thought and I was just lasted for about 12 hours you know I fainted I went into a coma like state so you recommend it and the biggest concern beside the repetitive motion syndrome is hypothermia because if you're out in the woods or something and you're exposed you're not getting up so you're you going it's called soma for a reason it's the soma mushroom is some differences that what's ohm is this isn't there some debate as to what so actually is that's what our Gordon Wasson proposed some magnetic literature there's a big debate about that but the other story I'd like to tell is my friend dr. Andrew Weil was that the Cougar hot springs and and Oregon and Andy's a medical doctor from Harvard and he was walking the trail and people came running down to oh my god this guy's trying to kill himself I come up and Andy went up and this guy had eaten a whole bunch Amanita muscaria big biker dude and it's covered with blood and he was up on a bridge and he was swinging his legs back and forth is above the rocks they threw himself off the bridge now it was only about six or eight feet but it's enough on the boulders down below smashed himself on the rocks and then he climbed back up on the bridge and they swung his feet and threw himself off the bridge so this this causes repetitive motion syndrome both of my camera accepts is a mushroom that's perfectly legal it's probably one of the most dangerous mushrooms that anyone could eat I definitely advise not doing this because I always thought if I was ever called as expert witness having these experiences and someone who was watching Tales from the Crypt on TV and then they saw a knife it causes temporary insanity really I mean it's suicide mushrooms are wonderful they're peaceful they're loving as an empathic oh right but the Amanita mushrooms cause this strange strange sort of behavior that is really potentially dangerous and that is the mushroom that was documented in the sacred mushroom in the cross where gianmarco allegro alleged that he alleged that the entire Christian religion was essentially a misunderstanding and it was really all about the consumption of the psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals and that these were all sort of captured in stories details and parables yeah it was academic suicide for him now with that statement and still very controversial have you read the his work yes I have what do you think well linguistically the guy's way over my head when I read his book it's all about linguistics and one of the translators of the Dead Sea Scrolls way beyond my Ken of knowledge it's so far beyond my kind of knowledge I can't make rhyme or reason out of it that seems to be the problem with it most people can't yeah so but and there's threads of truth in all of this but I don't buy it you know on its face on the the grandiose conclusion that he made but clearly mushrooms have inspired religion yes and I teach these workshops on gourmet and medicinal mushrooms and at one of these workshops is very spiritual guy he's very quiet but very definitely you know walk just looked like the real deal he waited until everyone was gone and then he said Paul I'd been sent here I said really it says I'm a devout Christian I'm in Billy Graham's inner circle and a bunch of us take psilocybin mushrooms as sacraments and it's brought us it's brought us closer to Jesus closer to our religion now I don't care if you're Muslim or Christian or Hindu the idea of these mushrooms making you feel this the spiritual universe more spiritually connected giving your cultural heritage in your reference points but he said these are extremely important now my mother was a charismatic Christian I met some people in her group who came to their religious beliefs through psychedelics don't dislike it looks now but that's was their portal they had their big revelation through psychedelics so the the connection between soul Simon and magic mushrooms in religion I think has a lot of credibility and there's lots of great examples of that the specificity of some of the arguments people make I have great great doubts about hmm that's interesting um what about in the ancient Hindu religions the ancient Hinduism and some of the ancient books speak of various sacraments that have sort of never been defined right yeah and why is that Brahmin cows are sacred you know when this Lhasa P cubensis grows out of cow poop Ron in India and yet they won't eat cows and Buddha supposedly died from a mushroom he was and he was given a mushroom by a peasant and and Justin the mushroom and died you know that and so there is that connection I've always thought curious that the Salah speak Avensis is such a religious provoking mushroom and yet cows are highly revered as being sacred oh I would think you would keep the mother of the mushroom sacred you know you want to protect the resource but again these are at times when when fables and parables and and religious rites were controlled by the cognoscenti and they were the gatekeepers of knowledge that was too powerful for the general population to understand or and so they protected that knowledge and that's that's a rule of most religions is that the the inner circle you know holds the keys of the kingdom and what's happened with Orthodox religions as they create institutions where you have to pay tithing in order to have a gatekeeper just to have a contact with God and that I think is is the problem with monotheism versus polytheism Jack Herer before he died was working on a book about psychedelic drugs specifically mushrooms and and religious experiences and he had some really crazy old paintings that he had found that showed people that were naked seemingly dancing in ecstasy with a translucent mushroom around them and the idea being that this was supposed to this this image was supposed to represent someone who is tripping there's a lot of really interesting books that have been published that show art you know going back hundreds of years even you know into the into the late 1300s showing you know Christian art where mushrooms are are pretty easily seen so there's there's a lot of history to that but but it becomes the unfathomable I mean maybe you can imagine it to be true but how can you prove it to be right how can you so a lot of that is like it's great historical information probably a lot of it's true hard to say which is which is true and which is not somebody simple right yeah but in modern times now Johns Hopkins these clinical studies are on missus isms spirituality showing that these are some of the most spiritually significant experiences of people's lives the interesting thing about the Johns Hopkins studies is that 70 percent that people had positive experiences and 14 months later they still described as experiences being significantly positive their friends their colleagues their fellow workers also say that materially changed these people's personality but the 30 dependent people had negative experiences the negativity of the experience did not extend more than the experience itself so this is speaks to read numbering and what's been determined is when you have these really profound spiritual experiences it's it's with you and when you remember it you rekindle that thought and this may be a way of overlaying PTSD rather than having the reference standard that's associated with PTSD you supplanted or the positive experience but the people who had Native experiences during tripping did not have a negative that negative consequences didn't extend more than the experience itself so this was this is our profound insight and so john hopkins roland griffiths just emailed me recently they have other clinical studies that are ongoing looking and one we just got published on meditators given placebos versus getting high doses of psilocybin and and then measuring the consequences of those experiences months or a year or two later and again the same thing as reinforced these psilocybin mushroom experiences create a positive reference point that you can capitalize on by re remembering them subsequent from this experience by not even having to take the mushrooms again hmm that is profound when you have a happy memory that you can anchor your personality on it's a game changer yeah I just wonder if we're ever gonna see in our lifetime centers where you can go and a trained professional can guide you through something like this happening now is it yes the California Institute of Integrative studies and based in San Francisco are those training therapists and Canada there are therapists in Europe they're therapists there are training programs now on psychedelic therapy this is something that is it has a tremendous momentum indigenous peoples have a really nice structure or many of them do not all but many have a really good structure for the responsible use of these substances us there are displaced people's I would call us European based people and many other people are displaced we don't have the same constructs historically that we can operate within and so the psychedelic therapist movement is huge right now Canada is leading the way the canoe government is very very positive towards psychedelic therapy because the opioid crisis and because significant results is in the movie this has come out called dosed and attracts a heroin addict young lady and Vancouver it is a heroic movie it is not one of these you kind of feel good at the end of the movie but it is that it is yeah it is intense and she's doing iboga and she also does high doses of mushrooms but the opioid crisis is so pervasive they're so poor treatments available that through the psychedelic therapies and several days they're seeing a tremendous success and people breaking you know decades-long opioid addiction within a week and so the psychedelic therapist are integral to that success and so there are there are clinics now arising all over the world for this at Portugal in Mexico in Spain in Jamaica the clinics are arising specifically to meet the needs of people who are trying to get these legally so they don't get in trouble too long and so in Portugal and Spain and Jamaica for instance that these are legal but many of these substances are well what gives me a lot of hope is that everything seems to be trending in a positive direction like all these things you're saying your own personal experiences from Ted from 2008 versus 2019 all these different treatment patterns or pathways that are available now the people that were never before and that we're starting to see an acceptance overall just the general population people understand what this is and that this might literally be the cure to what ails us I you know for people out there who have not gone on a deep Sullivan experience this is very important for me to emphasize and after you do of a heroic journey of a soul Simon the next day when you look at those mushrooms you say no way dude I'm not touching those long time give me six months I'll come back to them they're anti addictive by their nature because it's so powerful so powerful profound and you gone through the gauntlet and back yeah you're not ready to do it again and so how many drugs that can have such a dramatic impact that are non addictive that can break addictive cycles with other drugs I think this is a gateway a gateway opportunity for solving many of the ills of our society I couldn't agree more anything else for get out of yeah no I just want to thank you and your audience for having the courage to bring these subjects to the table in a coherent fashion we don't have all the answers we will make mistakes I think it's really important that we take where the adults in the room we see somebody spinning off the rails rather than being judgemental go up and put your arm around them saying hey there's better benefits from this I fully understand why people want to party with them especially when they were younger they going the coming-of-age but as you mature these are really important for your own sanity and for the health of your community and your family psilocybin mushrooms make nicer people I think that's a great way to say it and I agree and I think it should be on a t-shirt maybe a bumper sticker and I want to thank you man without your knowledge and information and the way you're able to so eloquently express all these ideas a lot of people would know a whole lot less so it's a team effort it's just not me as a whole as a whole isn't uprising instead of mycelial underground that's reaching up and telling people and sharing it with their friends so check out the movie fantastic fungi it's really good and dosed to good movies that speaks to this and your website once again fungi calm fungi calm Paul Stamets ladies and gentlemen thank you Paul all right thank you brother by [Music] [Applause] [Music]
