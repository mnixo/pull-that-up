the Joe Rogan experience they try everything to scare marijuana smokers why why is that they should just smoke weed and get their dick sucked they would change the way they feel about all this they'd be like I can't believe blowjobs feel so good do-do-do-do-do-do from someone who loves you who tickles your balls when you come in their mouth hey while you're high cheese just glue eases okay they don't know about that do they know about that because if they do you know I would imagine if you're the way the sheriff of Greenlee knows about that if you're a girl and you smoke a couple hits of weed and then get your pussy licked that's got feels so good could you imagine like a shower feels good when you're high yeah imagine how good it feels for girl get your ass licked do I like my ass listen this is like a fill out form for a fucking gangbang video okay now do you like it in your ass right because if yes check the box to the right that should never come up you should go from you cradle to the grave without anybody ever asking you do you like in your ass light or maybe maybe that should be it that should be a fun thing about a funeral is you have to write the answer yes or no like on a piece of paper and then have it in your hand like when you're dead did you check his note that was a yes with two exclamation points the problem with the question like do you like your ass licked is that's not how anybody ever asks it if they're gonna lick your ass right they don't go do you like to get your ass licked they don't say that they would say you want me lick your ass oh you do huh they would have a lot of hugs in there like let me lick your ass huh you do like they already affirming it because it's a risky thing to say like your ass huh you know that's like you want that person to have an easy time saying yes you fucking sick fuck fuck you I tricked you asshole right right the bedroom opens up the camera crew comes in you've been on the new show do you want your ass flame then it becomes like a big court case where they try to figure out what what huh means when you add Han to it and the lawyer tries to defend it clearly if she used the word huh she was she was trying to get a positive affirmation out of him she was manipulating his emotional responses the natural responses of a person he was doing it to be polite he didn't really want his ass licked okay he didn't want her to feel bad she said huh already okay what as it was happening he was realizing he had made a mistake yeah you know it'd be like joining an army that thinks they're gonna go out and fight Bigfoot like you got all your fucking gear you really good mountains like we are the Sasquatch and he'd be like Oh what have I done what if I done I can't believe I'm gonna go there's an army of people I've joined fuck I made a mistake shit yeah you can't pull out of it that's what's got to be like it's crazy well that's where you you know you're known for not just being one of the pioneers of MMA but you're known for that expression yamato damashii that you have always you've always promoted that ideal this this samurai spirit and this the spirit of Japan this way of of doing things wholeheartedly and you know you've talked openly that you freely give yourself like when you would go to fight you would be ready to die yes and not just saying that like you you'd really reconciled it in your mind you would say goodbye to your friends say goodbye to your family letters yeah I wrote letters to people that I wanted to say goodbye to every fight yeah that's some deep shit yeah you know but the thing too is um fighting to die trying to die you're gonna train with the will to die too so you can see almost good training I got yeah I mean I'm training every day before the fight so I won't die in the fight I'm planning I'm okay I'm accepting the fact that I might die there but I know that the better I can be is the less chance to me dying in the ring so you know I'm not gonna get up in the morning and because I'm sorry I'm not gonna miss training because I'm tired or I'm lazy because it'll might be the difference in me living and dying in the ring so you know it helped me out a lot in that in the training aspect and you know the dieting I mean I want to eat only drink a coke but I'm trying to eat only good things on my before my fight and it's it's a lot easier to do that when you're in to that level it can't hurt you you know to plan to die in the ring to believe that and to train and to walk that life for that three months while training for the fight it they can't hurt you is it difficult for you because you earnestly embrace that thought process is it difficult for you when you see guys that are kind of dabbling in MMA they're kind of like half-assing it not training hard enough maybe they have some talent but they don't really put their will and heart into it well it's a whole new era now yeah because back in the day we didn't get paid good we were we weren't weird that worried about you know losing a sponsor here right being caught by the UFC you know that kind of stuff didn't because there's all these little association we're fighting for us a little bit money the objective and the the the whole movement of that era was different yeah so you know when fighters start getting lazy you know what they don't fight as hard or they tap out a little sooner you know I understand that because it's a whole new era because you're fighting for a different reason now they're fighting for money they're fighting for living there fighting for sponsors they're fighting to look good you know so it's easier when you're fighting for those reasons I mean there's only so much money will make you do mmm but if you're fighting for your honor and you're fighting for your life it's a whole different level yeah so
