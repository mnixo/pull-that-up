boom and we're live hello Kyle hello Joe Ryan you look very good there in a suit thank you you know I like to pretend that I'm a serious human being by wearing this but I'm just a dick well you're a youngish fellow so maybe a suit would give you more of an air of calm composure yeah thority perhaps that's the idea if you look like you're really serious then people assume you're serious they don't know that I'm you know making dick jokes and exactly like that's good I had some suits made I had to do this function for one of my kids schools and I had to go to this function we had to wear nice clothes it's like a dress-up thing and I really have nice clothes nothing that like fits and so I had to have something made so now I've been wearing it when I go on special dates with mrs. Rogan so it's like it's a suit like this it's a nice suit jack and tailored the whole deal fits me and how do you feel when you put it on do you feel like I feel like a serious person like if I dress like this like a hoodie and a t-shirt I feel like a schlub I feel like a dork there's Graham there's this thing that I do wear especially when I'm doing my show oftentimes you do that half-assed move where I look like this sure it all depends on what mood I'm in I mean sometimes I'll do the whole thing and look nice but usually I'm just being lazy and guy regional who was on the podcast and he made a very good statement and defense of the suit who's a it was a really interesting sort of testimony in defense of the suit in the pocket square he's a big believer of the pocket square which i think is preposterous yeah it's a little too far that's too far I'm with you but it it doesn't go out of style that's the thing is like if you look at a picture of somebody from like 1906 and you look at a picture of somebody from 2018 and they're wearing a suit you know okay but then other aspects of style and fashion change so fast I mean you look at remember the I think they were called janko's like the really baggy jeans that people wore oh yeah like cavalry cheese I don't know what that is that was something that we used to wear I'm dating myself this is like in the early 90s late 80s Early 90s it was like they were tight to like your your pelvic region and then they would flare up when you got past like MC Hammer pants so it's arrabal yeah but those didn't really make it right and then there were but they did make it in the gym like inst if you go to the gym there's still guys who wear these kind of sweatpants that's right that I like these kind of puffy sweat pant they're usually juiced out of their minds right there so this is the work these are the workout clothes everybody wears they probably wear those pants cuz there it is there's kaveri cheese oh my god nice to wear those try to get laid you wear whatever you could yes that's the opposite of trying to get laid not in those days back in those days like people didn't know any better right but my point is that things change that powdered wigs exactly like people that came from no we found out on the podcast it came from syphilis yes the whole wig thing came out of royalty these Royals had syphilis what was the whole story it was about the term bigwig and it was who were the people was a dutch dutch kings who was the king who are the kings so you could find that story because it's a fascinating story what it was was there is these I think they were brothers and they had syphilis they were just banging everybody yeah why do people wear powdered wigs and it all came from a hair loss that these guys would have there goes the the Peru story begins like many others with syphilis by 1580 the STD had become the worst epidemic to strike Europe since the Black Death according to William close Klaus clothes CLO w es I would say that either one close I said an infinite multitude of syphilis patients clogged London's hospitals and more filtered in each day without antibiotics victims face the full brunt of the disease open sores nasty rash is blindness Dement blindness dementia and patchy hair loss baldness swept the land so that's what I'm saying I'm healthy I'm healthy well they just became a thing because these scroll down so it'll tell you like who the people were that did it yeah so it was what you went a little too far yeah and so syphilis outbreak sparked a surge which making wig making victims hit their baldness blah-blah-blah-blah-blah louis xiv was only 17 when his mom started thinning worried that his baldness would hurt his reputation louis hired 48 wigmaker's to save his image five years later the king of in england louise cousin charles ii did the same thing when his hair started to gray both men likely had syphilis courtiers how do you say that courtiers courtiers and other aristocrats immediately copied the two Kings they sported wigs and the style trickled down to the upper middle class Europe's newest fad was born so that's where it came from so the whole powered wigs with people of distinction in in court right all that shit came from syphilis was like most things well whenever somebody tries to you know kind of like deify the founding fathers I always think well yeah they were brilliant on some things but on the other hand they wore powdered wigs and shat now to outhouses and slaves yeah there's a little bit of a balance that we have to take it to consideration there well I mean think about how much cultural change has taken place in our society just over the last few years sure you mean sure words that were commonplace are now completely unacceptable you know styles of behavior and methods of expression are being criticized and critiqued in this really radical way and I think it's good ultimately I think there's a lot of back to annex forth I'd say it's good but the sentiment is good you know I think the reaction and some of the overreaction like there's a spectrum right there's there's always going to be like did you see the there was something that came out yesterday from Portland State University where Peter Bogosian and James d'amour the Google memo guy and Heather Hynes she was a professor at Evergreen State I remember with the Jordan Peterson yes and she was actually on my podcast last week with her husband Brett Weinstein Weinstein can't stay wine so I'm not thinking the same person I was thinking of a person who got fired because of she did not get fired but shame si sir for playing a Jordan Peterson thing is that the same / no no no that's Lindsey okay right yeah sure she was in a different University okay laurier Canada yeah in Canada another University in Canada this is in Portland anyway so they're in the middle of this conversation and Heather who is a she's a biologist and she starts going over the biology of the differences between males and females that are just undeniable and these kids get up and they started yelling that this is bullshit and fuck you and power to the people all this crazy shit and then they tip over the sound system and they're the most hilarious classical liberal progressive lefties green hair the guy is like this poofy afro and he's like you know we don't tolerate Nazis man like the fucking Nazis these are biologists you piece of shit you know it's that stuff is the kind of stuff that I think turns people off to the left yes and almost provides a gateway to the right where all of a sudden people can buy into an even broader right-wing ideology because if you look at the left and that's your perception of the left is it's the people with the pink hair or the blue hair and they're just going around and their whole point is to deep platform people or censor people or scream about ben shapiro or whatever the case is like my whole thing is put if you're on the left and I think most lefties do this to be fair put the identity politics aside okay and let's talk about the things that we actually already have a majority of the American people with us on so you know like a classic left-wing idea let's have a living wage the minimum wage is not a living wage right now it could work full-time and not make enough money to survive well if you're on the left and you go out there and you talk about we need to fight to try to get a living wage and make our government work for us well then you get everybody to agree with you right even most Republicans agree with you it didn't go down the list whether it's legalizing marijuana 60% of the American people are now with us ending the wars there was a poll that came out in 2013's was old admittedly but only 17 percent of the American people still wanted to be in the in the war in Afghanistan and we're still there today I'd imagine if anything that number probably dropped even further and everybody's like what are we doing in Afghanistan right but isn't the problem with polls is when you ask people about it you're not asking them if they're informed you just ask yeah you're just asking dear sure what I was saying is about the left versus the right is the real problem is anybody can be on either so you're gonna get these people that are going to disrupt this Heather huiying you know lecture on biology from an informed scientific perspective and like fuck this man is a patriarchy you're gonna get that yeah you're also gonna get people like yourself you're also gonna get people that are aware of the issues and educated and are debating this in a very public way and trying to figure out what's the best possible solution to these things the problem is anytime you have a group whether it's pick the group gun owners vegans what anybody can fucking join masher and as soon as anybody can join you can't look at like the worst case scenarios the green haired orc that kicks over the microphone because they don't like the idea that Heather is speaking logically about biology like you know you have to look at like the the whole thing sure and we don't like to do that we'd like to point at the green haired dork and say hey liberals there's your left sure exactly and you know the breakdown to me is when you look at somebody like that they're in the category of what I would call authoritarian left because they want to control other people's actions they want to shut down that speech and say your ideas are so dangerous I don't even want to hear it there's a whole nother contingent of the left which again I would argue probably the majority the left which is the libertarian left which is people like me and many others who say listen live and let live on social issues I'm never even though I don't agree with Steve Stephen crowd or ben shapiro on anything I'm never gonna you know try to protest to get them to not speak their mind at a school is foolish it is it makes it look like you don't have an argument when you say I can't let that talk and then they get to go around and say I'm so persecuted because I'm right right you know meanwhile I say okay you want to have somebody like that go speak to college sure fine let him speak let me get the speech after well that's good enough I mean I think open conversations are critical and I'd also I mean it's gonna probably be unpopular I don't think the way to do it is in front of a large group of people I think you open yourself up to a lot of grandstanding a lot of saying things just for applause breaks a lot of there's a lot of bullshit it just it changes the nature of the conversation because it becomes theater you're doing this thing in front of all these people and you can hear a lot of these times people say things like I'm a comic so I know when someone's saying things for a reaction right you're like there's a way you do it when you say it like this and that's what we want and everybody goes yeah you do not you do not talk like that when it's just you in a person well it's just you in a person you are just alone with your ideas and I think that is the way a guy like ben shapiro and you know whoever you want on the left should have a discussion yeah there's something about that that's sophistry you know like so you're not creating the best argument you're just trying to sound like you have the best argument and you know Bill Maher for example it does this where he's very good at the punchy one-liners sure like you're he's in a conversation with his panel on his show and it'll be like bah bah bah bah and there was a anything you just got it was like a quick partisan hacky point you made but netsim people already agree with you in the audience they clap right so it's harder to flesh out the ideas and really that's why I listen I've always said I'm not the biggest fan of debate because so I've done a few debates and people online like when I do debates but I'm not the biggest fan of debates because I think it's like the WWE of intellectual pursuits mm-hmm where you go in this person's a whole point is to defend this side of it my job is to defend the other side of it and it's like okay clash but it's like okay well then when we come across an issue like the fucking 64 genders on Facebook or whatever it is and I actually might agree am I now put in a position where I'm supposed to be like no I'm going to disagree because that's the format of the thing that we're doing where I was just weird and it's not normal yeah and I think that's actually very important for both sides to do like when there's something on your side that you disagree with you should be honest about it and I see even saying that that there's a side that there's sides that there's our side versus their side where I think we're so inherently tribal that we should resist any temptation whatsoever to form teams especially about critical issues like really important social issues really important economic issues really important civil rights issues these are just things we should just talk about without looking at them in terms of the left wants this so I oppose it or the right wants this so I have to figure out ways to mock it yeah yeah I don't even know what to say and response that I agree with that we just it's just you know we were talking about this before the podcast that like what I will try to do is have conversations with everyone I try to have conversation yeah with nutty people like Alex Jones I try to have conversations with rational people like Sam Harris I try to have conversation with all kinds of people but without fail every time I have a left wing person on I'm some kook left wing yeah you know what's gonna happen any time I have a right wing person on I'm some all right Nazi apologist it's like this weird inclination we have to try to label and categorize people and I try to resist those labels as much as humanly possible well I feel like what you're really good at is you can have on people who disagree completely on stuff but you'll kind of find a nugget of agreement in the conversation with that person and then you can expand on that and you can end up having a very nice conversation and you're not you never really bring anybody on to try to like browbeat them and tell them that they're wrong on this issue or that issue you know I have no desire to do that I don't know I mean look I've had I've had a lot of arguments in my life and I don't like them I don't think they're beneficial I mean I think debate is good but every time I've ever been in an argument with someone like a real argument I always come out of it feeling gross yeah yeah there are times in life for arguments are necessary there's times in life where you're just faced with aggression or conflict and you have to do something about you have to meet it head-on there are times unlikely but whenever you can avoid that do and I think a lot of what arguments are and I failed at this in my life many times but a lot of what arguments are is the way you've reacted to the thoughts and the expression that another person has and if you just reacted a different way or approached in a different manner or took it into consideration a little bit more before you responded I think the conversation could have gone another way and I think I'm learning how to do that more and more as I get better at podcasting it better at conversations learning how to just settle someone down and learning how to genuinely be a nice person so we're I don't I don't want to like insult anybody I don't want to be in a disagreement with someone I want to discuss ideas sure who was that who was that skeptic guy from years back that he put you on a list of like top 10 conspiracy bla bla and running and then I remember watching that clip and it was so frustrating when you guys were going back and forth because you would say I think you were talking about the 9/11 thing and you're like I'm 100% not saying it was a conspiracy I'm saying it looked like the building came down in a controlled demolition those are two very different things it's one thing to say I believe it's a conspiracy it's another thing to say the way it came down looked like it was a controlled demolition but he kept insisting and trying to tell you what you believe as you're sitting across the room and you're like no I don't believe that he was trying to tell me what I was saying right no it was very clear you know okay how do I say this I don't think Brian is a bad guy I don't think his brain works correctly I'm being honest I think there's there's a real problem there and when he does these science these videos he sounds like a strip club DJ do you know what I mean like I've never seen his original way that people talk will they take on an effect yeah there's a way that that thing is done by people that are trying to achieve a desired result like this not that they're themselves talking about a very specific thing it's that they are trying to put on an air of intellectual Authority and you know he talks of himself as a science writer whatever that is like I don't hate that guy I'm not mad at him the whole thing was kind of foolish and it was very damaging to him and he wound up going to jail afterwards no really yeah not because of that but because of something that he did he was involved some sort of a scam with was it Amazon or Google eBay that's right he was involved in some sort of a scam where he had embedded cookies he would go to his side and make it made it look like when you were buying things online that you had gone through his site first when in fact you had and there was just a cookie that was embedded some some something along those lines whatever it was it was illegal anyone up going to jail so and even his defense of that I think there's something wrong there yeah I don't know what that something is but there's a there's a sparkplug that's not screwed in all the way there's something wrong well speaking of fake personas I feel like that's the worst when it comes to politics yeah and I do feel like what one there's very very very very very few upsides of Trump in my opinion but one of the upsides of Trump is that he did kind of break the mold in terms of what was viewed as the right way to communicate as a politician because before him you had all these very measured people who had the proper posture and they spoke with their thumb pointed down because they don't want to be strong with their their finger pointing at you like that right so her fist and then he comes along and he's obviously shooting from the hip and he clearly has no filter and he's tripping over his words tremendous believe me he's unnecessarily punchy and short with his sentences and I remember there was a report that came out that said he communicates I think it was like a sixth or seventh grade level or something like that and everybody in the media was mocking it and I did a segment where I said you guys are mocking and that's a terrible idea because guess what though the way he's speaking even though it sounds stupid it's gonna pierce through like you know how when some people talk it's hard you have to focus to pay attention to listen to where they're going with it and he's barred and then there's other people who talk and it's like you just you just get it it's immediately right in your brain and it doesn't matter agree or disagree with the substance of what that person is saying you know when somebody's an effective communicator and when he was out there on the campaign trail and he was for example campaigning in the Rust Belt where Hillary Clinton did not go right and he was like god NAFTA NAFTA is terrible they shipped out all your jobs it was unbelievably terrible and believe me let me just tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna keep your jobs here it's gonna be unbelievable believe me that's pretty good pretty good people tell me a little off but the matter is here excellent so I'll let the fucking thing he did recently where he said that he would gone into the school when the school shooting was going on run in there even if he didn't have a gun yeah it's like saying that yeah you can't I was with him when he was like listen the cops should have gone in everybody's like yeah of course the cops are gone in yeah but then he has to gratuitously take it so much further then he goes I would have gone in and then he adds without a weapon like now everybody knows you're just full of shit man he was there as if he was there like if Trump just happened to be there giving a speech at the school and a school shooting started and and he didn't do anything he just stood on the outside we know he would have there's a guarantee I mean he's the guy who said I owe my personal Vietnam was avoiding STDs at the orgies I went to yeah that was isn't it wasn't that a scene in the dead zone yeah didn't see the dead zone well in the book in fact the guy uses someone to shield him from a shooter and that's what keeps that guy from ever becoming president so it keeps him from pressing the button because the guy was going to become president and he was going to launch a nuclear salt and nuclear war and this guy that was Christopher Walken skit was Christopher Walken was right think so he realized by touching this guy's hand this guy was gonna do this and so there was like some scenario that took place where someone was trying to shoot him and he used someone else to shield him from the bullet and that's what prevented him from ever becoming president what's it's a movie the deads owners it's a movie and it's also a it was also a book by Stephen King okay I've read the book and I saw the movie I'm trying to remember who's it walking yeah fuck that's right that's right young walking look at that handsome face bastard it was a good weird-looking dude ah where does where does it gets but that's what's cool about him it's a great movie though fun may might not be great anymore this might be one of those movies like I always told people we should watch altered states it's amazing and then I watch there's certain things age so bad we were talking about it I don't know but especially with comedy and you've pointed this out if you go back and look at old comedy it's just a different world they were letting stand up and exactly you if you take the conversation we're having and you like somehow get it back to 1950 people who look at us like just the fact that we casually curse and you know the concepts we're talking about they be like this is unbelievably impolite yeah you know what I mean well one of the best examples I think is Stephen Colbert saying that President Trump uses his mouth as Putin's cock holster just set it on you know whatever Network TV or whatever the fuck Johnny Carson doing that I mean no way go back to the old Ed Sullivan Show you know where Jackie Mason got banned for life because it looked like he gave the finger he did this thing right like you know this is what I do I'm Jackie Mason he says he never even gave him the finger but he was accused of giving someone the finger and that was it he was banned didn't they do that with Elvis when he performed he like moved his hips in a way that they thought was too sexual like we can't show this because there are kids that exist in the world well they would only frame him from the waist up they wouldn't show all that fucked motion there was too much fuck Wyatt that's so goofy like I don't get what it is about different times I mean there were just a few generations away from the powdered wigs I mean really I mean that's such a different world I can't wrap my mind around it but you know what it's true that who was it I think it was Lenny Bruce who had all these different lawsuits against him because so in a way he's like he kind of paved the way for people like us where you especially cuz you're in comedy too but even just for the internet where we have this you know this free open platform where we talk about whatever I feel like we wouldn't even be able to get away with talking you know mentioning the sexual style for cursing if it wasn't for guys like that who paved the way cuz people were getting arrested for doing a stand-up set and cursing 100 percent I have a bunch of framed Lenny Bruce posters in my house yeah I think he is one of the most important figures in the history of pop culture because he he was way ahead of his time you know just way way ahead of his time he had jokes back then that I saw people stealing in the 1980s Wow yeah I don't even know if they were stealing it I should rephrase that I think they might have had parallel thinking one of the jokes was about gay people that in certain places being gay and like sodomy is actually I think sodomy still technically illegal in some places in some states Mississippi or some shit which includes going down on somebody but I know so blowjobs are technically illegal and it's fucking hilarious right but it was my point that oh so his joke was that he was dig this man gay he goes they put you in jail with a bunch of men who won't have sex with you I mean that does that's a joke that can last that's a fucking joke that would work today if nobody figured that out today and it didn't exist and somebody just said that on stage today you know there's a lot of those though the people like they don't realize it's been said before because it just seems like that happens of course even what I do political commentary I'm sure I'll make points and it'll be a point that eight people made before me I mean I think I'm some fucking genius over here it's unavoidable especially with like obvious points like when I started out in Boston doing stand-up we're obviously right next to New Hampshire and New Hampshire's state motto on their license plate is live free or die and I said yeah those plates are made by prisoners ah how fucked up is that absolutely positive other people thought that up as well because that's always been the thing right like people would make fun of prisoners would make license plates like it was like a see in movies like yeah you gotta go make license plates like that's what happened you know they'd put the cuffs on them you know yeah now you'll be making license plates you know some reason like being in prison was associated with making license plates there's and there's some just just cuz you brought up prisons there's a pivot here but there's some creepy stuff going on in terms of the labor that they're getting from prisoners oh fuck yeah we were just talking about that with the fires that they were paying those guys a dollar a day to risk their life in the Santa Barbara fires fuck man how is that allowed hey maybe give me a month off you know or a year off or whatever you know maybe if you did you're not a dangerous criminal like maybe did something stupid you know some petty theft or something like that and you know you look I'll go out there and fight the fire but you gotta gotta give me some sort of a break off my sentence nope we're gonna give you a dollar a day so they make them do it and then they still have the normal sentence they don't even reduce it or in I don't know I wish I did I mean I'm sure good behavior reduces sentences I'm sure that probably does something but the idea that they could pay you a dollar a day to fight a fires yeah crazy or a dollar an hour or whatever the fuck actual number was the way we do prisons in general in the u.s. is really weird because I've so I feel like there's like the Norwegian way of doing stuff and the Scandinavian way of doing stuff where they gear everything towards rehabilitation to get them back into society and functioning and in the US I feel like we don't give you towards rehabilitation we gear it towards punishment we're gonna punish you and you know I think you could there are fair critiques of the Norwegian system like you know in Scandinavia who's the guy Anders Breivik he killed all these anyone who was complaining because he's like I only have a ps2 and you guys need to give me like a newer video game system so you can look at that and go listen man you guys are being too fucking liberal fuck that guy he had like two rooms that were his sound he could walk in a fucking courtyard and shit so I think they're genuine criticisms of that but at the same time what's fascinating is they have a significantly lower recidivism rate than we do so here if you go to prison it's very likely that you're gonna end up back in prison in those places if you go to prison you know especially if it's like a lower level crime they rebuilt you and you get out you're functioning member of society yeah so we can learn something from them in my mind I think there should be some sort of a middle ground like I think prison should be used yes in some instances people need fucking punishment in some instances of course but we need to mix that in many instances with a healthy dose of Rehabilitation as well so we are I don't know functioning like an actual society as opposed to jailing more people in this country than any other country in the world yeah I don't necessarily think that punishment by itself helps anybody I mean if you take a guy and you lock him in a Cell and he's in that little tiny cell until his body stops working and he dies is that helping anybody I mean who is that helping so are there some say there are some situations where I get the idea of like life in prison without the possibility but it's yeah I get it too but I mean why look look a Ted Bundy character some someone along those lines just indefensible right some serial killer psychopath what do you do fucking kill him just how do you feel about the death penalty but now I know kill him just come on man there's not enough time in the world to fix Ed Gein or who was the fucking clown William Casey the clown guy who killed all those kids and buried him in his backyard yeah there are some people that Cleveland somewhere in Ohio your place buddy there are some people who are just at the point you're making is there some people who are too far gone when I say your place I'm not talking to you I'm talking to Jamie four people are just listening why is he fucking with Kyle and saying he's involved with the clown just know I don't mind he not even been Ohio might have been Pittsburgh somewhere dark and cloudy so the point you're making is that there are people who are too far gone Mike and I agree with that so but my whole thing on the death penalty is I've always thought the idea of it in principle is something I get like you could point out all those people who did those horrific things and like there's no hope of them rehabilitating and their total monsters and I say philosophically I have no problem getting rid of those people because you're just eliminating a problem right but in my mind the reason why I'm not in favor of the death penalty is because four percent of the time we get the wrong people right so if you have a system where you're guaranteed to kill the wrong people some percentage of the time then what we're saying is well we're gonna let the state murder people four percent of the time and that's something I just can't have my tax dollars going towards you know I meet with you a hundred percent but is it any better to have those people locked up in a cage for the rest of their life to their body stops working well I guess the idea is if you have them locked up and you have people like the Innocence Project working on trying to overturn cases where there was a wrong conviction then eventually you can write the wrong of getting those wrong people four percent of the time but it's finite if you say no you're gonna we're gonna put you on death row and you're gonna die in eight years or whatever it is then you know sometimes you can't finish the case in time to overturn it and mm-hmm so that's my whole thing about the death like I I agree philosophically and that's something many people to my left have come after me for and said no you're wrong you should be against the death penalty in principle but I say no I get it theoretically and philosophically but it's just that when you actually implement it there are pragmatic problems like you're gonna kill the wrong fucking people and I'm not okay with that you know I mean I don't know if it's better to kill the wrong people or to keep the wrong people locked in a cage suffering for the rest of their life who where did where did uh William Gacy live John Wayne Gacy was John Wayne Chicago Chicago his middle name was Wayne John Wayne yeah John Wayne Gacy I didn't know that yeah why I say was William Casey I'm thinking William AC I got from shameless I'm all fucked up yeah well we were talking about something before the podcast and I think this is I think this is really the future whether it's in our lifetimes or our children's lifetimes but I think that they're going to be able to read minds and I think it's not we're not far away from that we're gonna really be able to know the actual contents of your thoughts whether or not you really did murder a bunch of kids and burry them in your backyard we're gonna know and until then we're dealing with a bunch of really big fucking problems one of the biggest problems is people's memories people's memories are so bad they're so bad so when you have eyewitness testimony and you can convict people wrongly which happens every day and they think they're right they think they really do believe they're right yeah I really believe it that's a fucking problem man that's just a giant problem is the human memory is incredibly flawed and when someone's life is on the line and you know you're gonna convict a guy who didn't do anything he just looks kind of like what you remember this person who murdered that guy looks like well that's where a lot of the things get overturned is because they have DNA evidence yes that overrides whatever the testimony was of the people at the time and speaking of technology advancing I there's many scary aspects to it but you know the elephant in the room to me is the fact that look at what the NSA is already doing they're already spying on absolutely everybody in the country they collect all of our metadata and stored it's a multibillion-dollar facility in Utah and then like there's no doubt that all this technology is gonna be used against us you know what I mean well it certainly can be if they choose to like if you become a guy like a you know like Julian Assange or sure who leaks something and then they go hey let's go pull up Kyle's text message records oh look he looks cross-dressing fucking whatever it is I mean they can and then they could leak that to whatever media people that they're in bed with there's just a lot of shit that they can get away with well that's partially what they did with Eliot Spitzer because Eliot Spitzer they called him the sheriff of Wall Street because you know crackdown on Wall Street and then oops look at that his his credit card information from the brothel he went to was leaked to a press outlet well how the fuck did you get the credit card information because they knew what they were looking for because they were trying to bring him down right well worse than that he was actually going after brothel that I was gonna say and I think it was his hypocrisy that brought him down and not the fact that he went to a brothel yeah is that your cracking down on brothels and going to brothels at the same as arresting people yeah that was that's fuck dice was ridiculous it's like if like I mean it doesn't make any sense that he thought that he could get away with that but the real problem with that guy is that guy was an interesting politician yeah he really did have some really good points a lot like Weiner well the Weiner is kind of interesting in that way too he had some really good points he's a great speaker but he was also freak did you see the documentary on him I did yeah I mean well you wanted to I didn't finish it though I've watched part of it and I got bored I mean you want to talk about a fall from grace yeah he was somebody who was viewed as oh this firebreather on the left too he goes after people and doesn't take any shit yeah and then fast-forward and it's like oh you've got caught you know sending dick pics to like 80,000 women some of them underage and I feel so bad for his wife sending dick pics while he was holding his kid he was holding his kid sending pictures of him with his kid in his arms with his boner that's one of those scandals or it's like nope you're not coming back to that everybody's like fuck off what this is what I said so I said on the podcast and I'm saying right now I think he's in jail right now right see in jail I don't know if he's in jail I don't know going to jail Andrew you're a comic you just don't know it you just don't know it I guarantee he's a comic he just never did it and he just went into politics and you know he's a real good speaker he's kind of a funny guy okay so I wanted to talk to you about comedy I really did because so I've had I've done a few live things in my life I did a live show once and then but I also did best man speeches in front of rooms of you know over a hundred people the best man speech I did I cried like a bitch it was the saddest thing ever I'm up there talking about one of my best friends and I'm like on the trip it was it was pathetic whose that's just emotions you you care about the guy well yeah that's the thing is that people came up to me after and they they liked it and they were like oh man that was great it was heartfelt I was like I barely fucking said a word that anybody could understand cuz I was blubbering yeah but that's okay but no I think there's a real problem that people have with avoiding emotions you know I I was too vulnerable in front of people I didn't know that's a downer okay well thanks for that but the the second best man speech I gave I went into a thinking like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna crush a little bit I was thinking about a little bit but like so I I like to when I talk I like to have just bullet points of what I want to talk about in just just a loose outline and then I'll riff off of it and what happened was all the lines that I thought would get a laugh did not get a laugh but all my throwaway lines got good laughs so I was amazed by that and then also I was amazed at the fucking rush of getting a room to hang on your every word and to genuinely laugh at what you're saying yeah and so every time you do stand-up is that the feeling you get you definitely get a rush there's no doubt about it you crush you get a rush yeah you get a bump it's a different rush in different sized places like there's more of a surreal thing when you get a there's a there's an area get to like around 5,000 6,000 people or gets run out it gets real weird man it gets fucking weird that gets weird like almost like you are you just you're doing a show then more than you're connecting with people shares you're gonna come to the Comedy Store tonight that's a intimate place that's 150 people that's tight little small room and that's like you're there you're there with the people it's different that's a rush to though that's it's a different rush they're all it's all a rush but your responsibility to the material and the delivery sort of overrides the rush because you can't get caught up and go wow this is amazing because you have to be thinking about the timing you have to be tuned in to exactly what you're thinking about you can't be thinking about oh this is getting a lot of great laughs you have to honestly be thinking about the actual subject sure people fucking know what you're thinking about man it's weird isn't it well I think it's a type of hypnosis I think and I don't mean hypnosis is like you you trick the people and desync doing something but I mean that like you mind meld with the audience it's some sort of a weird way people know when you're on some sort of a script and they know when you're talking from the heart yeah and it's really strange because you could have somebody who's well versed in going through a script but there's still something that's missing from what they're saying and I feel like that's one of the many reasons why this podcast is very popular because you get people on here and you just have a conversation and you're you two are really connecting and then you're also really connecting with the people who are watching because you're just having a conversation it's like you're at a bar and everybody's just kind of talking and it's not like people come here and they're like let me now go to my point that I was going to make on this and this because that's when people start to yawn and that's actually why I think a lot of the the older shows like you know the not to shit on the late-night host mm-hmm but that's why I feel like that it's kind of dying out and there's this giant rise of the internet because that's all very segmented and structured and you have to go in and out real fast yeah and yet there's nothing human about it it's almost like it's celebrities telling you we're on this different level and you're gonna watch us be on this different level as opposed to just being a regular person is it like working with Spielberg it's interesting Stephen is a amazing director it's just yeah it's also you would be like the talk show host so you'd be sitting there and I'd be sitting sideways facing you mean it's so it's so follow leader copycat because this is just the way they did it with Jack Paar right back in the fucking 1800s whatever the fuck that was right and they go from there to Jimmy Kimmel who does it the same way and then the first time somebody breaks the fucking mold everybody's like what is this this is brilliant why are we doing more of this this makes sense I mean you could kind of do this conversation in front of a large group of people I mean a lot of people do do live podcasts yeah I feel like it's a little different though yeah you feel so like that - that was I don't know I feel like there's an energy that you get from the audience where you kind of try more to do those punchy one-liners and posters flowing 100% yeah you do and sometimes it's great like I've done some live ones before with friends and it's great and we did the end of the world podcast we did a live podcast from the Comedy Store at the night of the election and during the election we realized that Trump we were saying scene of the world no matter who wins because you're right now when Trump won I mean bill burr was just on fire in front of this fucking that guy's smart man very smart not just smart but that he had material about this that was just perfect and he just was crushing and there was a panel of like six other comments were all just laughing and talking shit there was a lot of fun and it worked that worked that's one of the rare times that worked but the way we did it was we had a chair set our table setup and then we all sat facing the audience and just talked you know like like a regular podcast but in front of a live crowd and then someone would come out with Brian Hannigan would come out and give us the updates Trump is ahead by you know 18 points yeah so did you see that coming Trump winning or no I thought it was entirely possible I thought it was entirely possible I didn't see it coming I felt like everybody was so convinced that Hillary was gonna win I just felt like that was probably what was gonna happen so I feel like one of the reasons why my show got popular over time is B I'm suckin my own dick and it sounds so gross but but I actually predicted I pretty early on when Hillary it was clear Hillary was gonna get the nomination where I was sounding the alarms and I was saying listen Hillary versus Trump is a worst case scenario because Hillary Clinton is the status quo she is the establishment she is business as usual she doesn't have a message she doesn't have a vision all she's doing is spewing platitudes and cliches and break down the barriers stronger together doing identity politics non-stop which is nothing but pandering and not talking about policy substance and then like we touched on earlier you had Donald Trump who I disagree with him on virtually everything but the guy knows how to fucking play to a crowd knows how to tell people what they want to hear so when he's in front of a blue-collar audience he's out there ripping the trade deals and saying I'm gonna keep your jobs in the country it's gonna be amazing right and that's something that landed and then when you have Hillary so dumb is to not campaign and I what Michigan and some Ohio will have I think she went to but some of the Rust Belt states well the reason he ended up winning is because of the Rust Belt so and my whole point was Trump is a populist and admittedly when push came to shove now that he's elected a fake populist because he has Goldman Sachs throughout his administration and he's serving Wall Street but a fake populist will always beat a status quo politician right because people are sick and tired of business as usual and they feel like well I'm getting shafted now and she's coming along telling me I'm gonna keep everything the same why the fuck would I be happy and excited to vote for her it was like there was so many things that were in place that were against her first of all she would she has absolutely poor health and is admitted by her husband that she had fallen down and cracked her head open and had pretty severe brain injury that she took took more than six months for her to recover according to Bill we saw her fainting all the time I mean she that was creepy at the 9/11 thing when she's not good she's just and they were all she had the flu I've had the flu I don't fall asleep I'm standing up I mean that shit ain't good that's not good and that was just one thing the other thing is she's a disingenuous person when the whole Comey thing with the FBI when he when there was a video that came out where he explained what the charges were and what they had found about the emails and then she explained the version of it she's just not honest yeah then it was the whole gay marriage thing she didn't support gay marriage till 2013 13 yeah that's fucking crazy that's crazy and then here's the other thing she's a woman there's a lot of sexist there's a lot of people that didn't want a woman to be president period especially not a woman that could point to all these floors poor health liar dishonest in bed with Wall Street gets paid by banks $100,000 won't release the transcripts Clinton Foundation seems kind of shady there's so many different things were against her well she put the fact that she's a woman front and center I'm with her what's her campaign slogan and you know what happens when you try to shove identity politics down people's throats there's made a fuck-off yeah they go I don't care that you're a woman I want to know what you're gonna do for the country but the people were that were into that we're telling her that that was gonna be her key to victory we're gonna make history nobody knows less about politics than Democratic strategists in Washington DC because as of right now what they're trying to do is they're trying to fight back against their base so their base it's people like me and what we want I'm very clear about what I want I mean it's not hard for to please people like me who are on the Left we want a living wage we want Medicare for all which you know every other modern nation has one version or another of a single-payer health care system we just want to be like the rest of the modern world we want free college again Slovenia has fucking free college we can't afford to do free college when we just spend seven fucking trillion dollars on the Iraq war we want to end the wars so I have very clear policy goals that I want and guess what Bernie Sanders came along spoke about those issues he went from being this obscure senator from fucking Vermont which has a population of twelve people to getting 47% of the vote in a race against a political juggernaut a behemoth that had the entire Democratic Party machine behind her know that they were rigging the primers a hundred percent yes and that's what we learned and that's why Julian Assange went from being viewed as oh my god this guy is great that's how the left used to view him and now many people democratic partisans are like oh fuck this guy Russia he's with Russia that itthat's and I was just talking about this before the podcast I was watching CNN before he came here for about an hour and thirty minutes non-stop Russia coverage non-stop fucking Russia coverage and then guess what now when Donald Trump goes out there and he's a fake new CNN everybody gonna go yeah you know what all they do is fucking talk about Russia all day long so maybe the guy has a point so the institutions that we have and the establishment as it is it opens up the door for a demagogue and a liar and a fake populist like Trump to come in there and exploit it yeah so if you give people a choice between a broken system that's fucking them over where half of workers in America make $30,000 a year or less you give people an option between keep everything as is or take a fucking human bowling ball and throw it at the establishment they're gonna say okay fucking we'll roll the dice on this Trump guy and then meanwhile I look at his agenda and everything that he's done since he's got elected it's the opposite of his populist rhetoric on the campaign trail his fucking tax bill had a 33 percent favorability rating and they were bragging about it when they passed it this is a bill that cuts corporate taxes from thirty five percent to twenty one percent at a time when corporations are already paying a historically low percentage of the tax burden and it raises taxes on everybody that makes $75,000 a year or less over a 10-year period I mean you couldn't get a piece of legislation that spits in the face of working people more than that but the saddest thing is this guy is so comically easy to beat but the Democrats can't get their shit together because they're fighting back against the grassroots who care about the issues because they're in bed with corporations the Democrats are in bed with corporations just like the Republicans are so if you got this corrupt party establishment and they're trying to tamper down the wing of the party they can actually win well then guess what you're going to keep losing to these monsters these comic book villains on the right don't you think that the parties themselves there's a giant issue with the momentum behind them the lobbyists of special interest groups the Embedded just sort of ecosystem that they both carry with them for someone new to step in and sort of represent the actual people like yourself that that have this very clear view well that's why I have so many people that they're beholden to by the time they get into a position where they can even run for president they've all been vetted and checked and well that's why there are some keys here so one of the most important things is when you look at a politician who's running I think number one is check do they take corporate PAC money if the answer is yes fuck them not interested if you don't take corporate PAC money that means okay at least I know you're being honest and you're being open and when you talk I can believe you but his problem comes long as that successful politician someone who could actually possibly win they do take corporate Pakman but they're a better alternative then say you know pensive pence shirts to be shown after then you go okay we got to choose the lesser of two evils that's essentially what we did with Hilary right that's right and I didn't do that weird position where yeah she's kind of corrupt but look she's it's gonna be historic she's a woman she's infinitely more qualified than him and yeah the lesser evil ISM thing is a big issue because that's the game that's played on the American people and I think Americans know that it's being played on them you know like if you look at the the opinion polls on Congress Congress oscillates between a 14% approval rating and a 21 percent approval rating and what's supposed to be a democracy so in other words you vote these people in and then two weeks later you go ask people hey what do you think of the Congress you just voted in and like 14 percent of them are like I think they're good everybody else is like fuck them so we all know that there's a problem here and the root of the problem is the corruption of the system and the corporate money flooding our politics and then the politicians get in there and all they do is represent the corporation's and they don't represent the people so to your point yeah in order to rise up through this system that's why they look that's why the establish been loved Hillary Clinton if she played by the rules in this corrupt system yeah did you know that her and Bill through their entire career they raised over three billion dollars in private donations Missal area and that's how you get to the point where it was wall-to-wall obviously she's gonna win this is a no-brainer and everybody loves her know everybody loves her on fucking Wall Street in Washington DC but and again this to go back to the Bernie Sanders point now we're seeing more politicians coming up that are in his model where they say I'm not gonna take any corporate PAC money I I don't even want a super PAC if I run for president and then what happens is people know at the end of the day I can trust that person even if I don't agree with that person and that's why Bernie Sanders is the most popular politician in the country by a mile and a half he's the most popular by a longshot and the reason is there are even many people on the right who look at him and go you know what I don't agree with him on abortion I don't agree with him on this or that but I trust the guy and I think he's fighting for me well there's definitely that I mean there's he's he's a guy that really has a clean record in terms of like the money that he's taken that alone is very unique and that alone makes him stand out from the other people that were running for president when you look at the future though like who other than him and is the problem with him is he's he's another one he's not a good health well he's a thousand years old we could just say it's also well there's people that are his age that are in very good shape like how old is he 75 for subjec that my friend Aaron Schneider had a podcast the other day with a gentleman who's 78 years old who goes on backpacks solo elk hunts and he rides holy mountain bikes and exercises and does all this shit like there are people out there that are his age that take care of their body but the problem with Bernie 76 76 look-ahead sits somewhere in the middle of his sternum he's got like pot he's gonna dr. Auster hosters yeah he looks like a schlubby slumpy sort of unhealthy person yes and he died no that's not important but it is kind of important to people you want someone you're saying the optics of it matter to an extent sure I mean I guess there well there are there are a few good politicians so for example Rowe Khanna is a mother she's actually from California he's a congressman Oh a name he has reason usual he's risen through the race star trek guy well he's a badass he's a badass so yes you know I could maybe hook up if you wanted him on the podcast I'll talk to him and see if he want to come on I think he would but um he's a he's a young guy and how old really smart guy I don't know exact how old he is but he's he's young you have to be what 39 or something to run for Congress 35 presidents 34 35 there you go that's so young I was retarded retarded now and I'm 30 so fucking stupid when I was 35 how can you allow people to be 35 years old and run for president yeah crazy yeah but I mean at the same time I'm sure there are some people who who can do the job at anyway back to Rokon or okana he's a badass he's he doesn't take any corporate PAC money he's got a great record of fighting for the people he's one of the few people who remember when we were talking about going to Syria and and doubling down on Syria well Trump recently announced we're staying there indefinitely so we have a permanent military occupation in Syria ROH Khanna is one of the very few voices in Congress I mean all the Democrats should be out there saying what the fuck are we doing here let's get at it what the what's the point of being there right ROH Khanna was one of the few who actually spoke up about it and actually said no this is crazy number one we shouldn't be there number two we haven't even had a vote on it in Congress the whole idea is if you go do a military intervention according to Constitution you have to get a declaration of war from Congress and real concise this is crazy we're nowhere near abiding by the Constitution here we have to at least have a vote on it he's one person Tulsi Gabbard is another politician who's fantastic who was weird names let me see this Rokon a person first let's see what they look like I'm gonna give him a sniff test this is how Americans do it you look at a man showing Tulsi Gabbard I'm very curious what your Logan essay about Tulsi gabbard's let me go with the Rokon a person first sure yeah my first guest on spelling didn't pull up with our o K H a n na that's one name that can't be one name the first name Khan is the last what's our OS his first name it's a company Africa fuck out of here with that let me see what he looks like he's from Silicon Valley how do you say it silicon or silicon silicon now you're confusing Silicon Valley I think I say silicon I don't know if that's right though well yeah he that fucking name I don't know about that name but then again listen st. Obama got elected president we go the new scrutinise hmm well we've got a lot of good things here going first of all the diversity factor is high it's off the chart no but what I love about Roe is that he doesn't do the fake bullshit identity politics of like I'm not white therefore you know I'm great he does in fact he's one of the very few politicians who regularly speaks up about people in the middle of the country who got their fucking factory jobs outsourced because corporations wanted to make more money and he's against all these trade deals that dork with the t-shirt are fired up ready for ro dude okay I need you I need you to just rethink your life it looks like a shirt a young fatter Mario Lopez to the right to a little bit sorry Mario no offense Woods is that him with Ted Kennedy down there in the lower right hand corner yeah I'm sorry whoever that person is bit of a tiny screen it did look like Ted Kennedy before you blow it up yeah okay so this guy show him tulsi gabbard see so he's a congressman in California yes all right yeah yeah Tulsa tul that's being thought of as a possible Democratic candidate well a lot of people were talking right now about not fuckin I'll tell you who's gonna run 2020 Oprah okay no disrespect to you Oprah if you happen to see this but fuck off no no disrespect to you the rock but fuck off Tulsi is kind of I'd like you're gonna say that two things I like both of those things but so for in 2020 a little too hot she's very pretty she's a beautiful woman I mean is America ready for a beautiful woman to run for president with all her whistle is she she's a brilliant woman and I believe you yeah but she's also beautiful also takes no corporate PAC money also is against all these unnecessary regime change wars so I think she also goes to spin class also does box jumps but 2020 show the military she was yes interesting that's a good that's a positive she's got a lot of those little colored things on her shirt and again she's one of the strongest voices against going to Syria and all that you know we'll also had a lot of those colored things on a shirt l ron hubbard remember let's hear that guy was fuckin i don't think his were legit though i'm gonna go out on a limb yeah she looks she looks good i like it so for 2020 i'll tell you who's gonna run okay Bernie's gonna run again he is yes can he do that thousand different sentences gonna run he'll be 78 years old he's riding the fucking wave them Angie eh I've been little didn't I'm gonna try to straighten my neck out I try to pull it back up into his normal position I got one of those things it hangs from the door I'm stretching my neck he's like Larry Larry David right looks like Larry David yeah what about Oprah Oprah is not running bullshit she's not run she's gonna run I'm calling her right now she died once yeah she's not she's running well that'd be fodder for us to laugh at for a long time I don't know man she might win now how about fucking NBC whoever the dork is that was running the NBC Twitter that was saying our president like they about Oprah that yeah oh no and Oprah gave that speech that was it the Golden Globes she gave this big giant yeah yeah and everybody was like she's got a vagina let her talk and she she's kissing big powerful speech Hollywood is so fucking insular they love sniffing their own farts and suckin their own dick Wow clueless actress stacey dash is running for congress stacey dash is like a republican she's like a time she was a large news job supporter republican yeah she was from clueless the movie not that she's clueless wrong maybe she is clueless - but stacey dash is like super hardcore oh yeah super hardcore Republican Fox commentator known for controversial opinions so Oprah no I'm telling you I'm telling you Steadman's gonna be the first man the rock not running Mark Zuckerberg wants to run but he might not run why don't you think he'll run is he old enough he's old enough but I'd be like get in under the wire how fuckin goofy is that guy man I mean he shows show the picture him like fuckin feeding a lamb or some shit who did an okay to feed a lamb what's wrong with this person I'm anti lamb feeding I'm taking a strong stance on the Joe Rogan someone wants lambs to starve to death tune in the secular talk podcast yeah Mark Zuckerberg he's been like doing this goofy tour where he goes to Iowa and pretends to eat with regular people I was like I spoke to a guy named Ted today and he has a interesting story hmm I hate the pandering where they tried to that's the thing like when they bring up the personal stories and they're like pretending to care about some random dude in Kentucky right it's like fuck off just tell me what your ideas are you don't the fake empathy shit right right right so I don't think he's gonna run even though he wants to because he'll get his ass handed to him Mark Cuban is another guy with a giant ego who's thinking about it but I don't think he'll end up doing it I don't think they want that scrutiny like yeah a lot of shit comes out yeah I mean think about who Trump was pre-election and Trump is now before the election he was kind of lovable who's like this lovable egomaniac weirdo guy the election yeah well you know let me take that back because it was all that birther shit that was pretty wacky but pre birth or shit he was the guy who played the role of the on the big boss corporatist guy yeah I'm the Donald he was a bigger-than-life character large hair big fucking name on the building's gold gold lettering everywhere a gold bathroom gold toilet paper like you so silly does he not know this like there's such a thing as as what's the word local garish is that garish yeah I don't think he does know that well he's old man with old people that was like someone said it best and it's one of my favorite quotes about Trump that he is what a poor person imagines a rich person would be like that's a great point yeah yeah and he said he's a dumb person's idea of a smart person yes because he's very confident any mosts and like you say cold fucking everything it's almost it's almost like rappers more stuntin oh yeah yeah I got my rolls bitch yeah Trump is that showing all your rings in front of your bikini bunch of girls shaking their booty in front of you how did grills ever become a thing how do they not become a thing why don't I have one that's the real question we're gonna get what Paul reached out to us you could actually maybe make grills popular I don't think so I'm doing a good job with fanny packs tell him tell you that oh elzar up sales are up I'm pretty sure any PACs are back you know what I haven't given up on what cell phone holder I saw the polls yeah so the people gave up in that a long time ago and they'll make fun of me but I'm like fuck you it's coming back in style and I'm rocking it somebody had a really funny joke I forget who it was I wish I could give them credit but was something along the lines of that's the type of black guy that's unthreading to white people type of like that a cellphone holder or the outside buckle clip cell phone holders just don't have him weird around a cop because they might think it's a gun that's right don't reach for it yeah don't reach for anything yeah the the grill thing I don't know um I think a gold tooth be kind of fly like one maybe a thing the whole thing cuz I think that they think it shows status but in reality it shows in attempt to hit higher status you know I mean well it's like that jay-z song 99 problems but a bitch ain't one you know if you grew up with hose holes in your Zappa toes you'd celebrate the minute you haven't dough right so many critics you can kiss the whole asshole so when you don't grow up with much then you're like yeah I'm gonna fuckin get a lot and I'm gonna show off that I have a lot so you know I got this shit it's a giant part of the culture I mean and even in the more reserved people like nas like who's like a more lyrical artist type character father was a jazz musician sure he drives a Mercedes and his pictures in front of nice things it's just a part of the whole culture like you gotta you gotta have nice shit you can't be living in a log cabin spitting out rap music nobody wants to hear like anybody from like but what's that show life below zero the the show where they're all in Alaska Alaska yeah mm-hmm nobody wants those people rappin but I feel like if somebody does that then that for that person who really is about the art of what they're doing yeah you know it's not gonna happen no one's gonna listen to a fisherman rap like a dude salmon fishing commercial like one of those dudes from Deadliest Catch if one of those guys hey like when there you can't can't be a rapper you smell like fish you gotta be clean you have to have gold teeth or something you have to have a grill that's a is Paul wall oh he lost a lot of weight it looks good as that beard fake um I think it's just trimmed why do you think it's fake cuz it looks too good it looks like I mean I'm not hating because I'm sound like a hater I just romantic shit out of my hair so it looks like he put some just form a gel on that baby um I don't know he might might have darkened up is Paul I feel your pain man with the I've been dying my hair since I was 18 how pathetic is that your hair start going great 18 18 really yeah I don't know and I have no idea if it was genetics or if it's stress or whatever the fuck are you under stress I don't I mean no not any more than a guy in you must have fucking go to a coal mine or some shit I'm privileged compared to most people so no I don't think so I think I think it might just be genetics I'm not sure but it's working for yourself is a little difficult to write like not having a steady paycheck where you have to and you were also involved in the YouTube team monetization wave that hit a moody pot cocksucker decided it was a good idea to use the n-word on video game streams well just for the record when I was an awkward young white boy who used it to but with an A at the end not er there's a big difference to throw around did you throw it around like a sing-along to lyrics if I singing along to lyrics I roll my window up first out of respect right and then you do it and then I just sort of mouth it like yeah so in the rap songs yeah of course I did did it in the rap songs but also just being an awkward young white boy from nura shell and having a lot of black friends growing up and we just threw it around like nobody's business what year were you and newer show so I born and raised there so I was born in 88 and you know in probably when I was 20 is when I left there dude so when I was living in New Rochelle you were living in Newark yeah cuz I was living there and like 91 that's when I lived there okay but now I'm gonna make you laugh because I was just talking to corn on the way here about this so I feel like I have a memory of being a kid watching Fear Factor you're on it and then I was so young that my mom after it was like okay it's bedtime honey Wow so I was a little fucking baby watching Joe Rogan and now I'm doing his podcast well that totally makes sense because that show was 16 plus years ago right 2001 I want to say two or one maybe two let me ask you a question about when you were doing that show did you feel because you you're a really smart guy and you're interested in a lot of different things and you I I can tell just by talking to you you're somebody who needs to pave your own path and be your own boss and it's clear so did you feel like almost like a caged animal when you were doing Fear Factor because like you had to you were forced to show up at a certain time every day and no I felt lucky that I had a job where I can make a shitload of money was that your first know you had Newsradio before yeah I had Newsradio which was extremely extremely fortunate I mean that you couldn't I couldn't have stepped in shit any deeper than with Newsradio it was just total luck I literally had like three acting classes ever because I had to take them because Disney gave me a development deal because of us just stand up and they just throw money at you and say do something in the 90s they were doing that because they had seen what happened with Roseanne they had seen what happened with Tim Allen and Seinfeld know like that's what you got to do you got to find someone who you think is funny and develop a show around them and it worked with some people Brett Butler had a show you know there was there was a lot of that going on and so they were trying to do that and so I had a development deal and then I had a show that it was on on Fox for a few episodes and it got cancelled and then I got on Newsradio so I'm on news radio six years into my stand-up career I was literally a beginner in terms of stand-up like if you talk to a six-year is considered a beginner yes that's a beginner yeah you don't know what the fuck you're doing I took a guy on the road with me recently they'd been doing comedy for seven years and he's got 20 minutes material oh yeah it's fucking to grind son there's other people like more advanced like Tony Hinchcliffe seven years in had already done a Netflix special Wow yeah I mean it really varies it varies and comedy you feel more is like your baby than any of the acting stuff right oh yeah well the acting stuff was just an opportunity to make money and it was just it was also an opportunity to get people to come see you do stand-up but it was weird like to all the sudden be acting with Phil Hartman and Andy Dick and Steven rude Maura tyranny is like I don't even even be here well how the fuck do you think I feel sitting across from Joe Rogan we're just talking I know but I mean that is true it all becomes normal man I mean I still get weirded out when I meet famous people that I really like well but who I mean they're obviously your people who are you know like Jack Nicholson for example is way more famous than you but like there not many people you're almost are you a Louise you say you're alien no no no I'm like a c-list person no you're just be react yeah I don't act I'm not on TV I'm c-list and I'm a cage fighting commentator you know it's pretty easy to dismiss me yeah I'm more more c-list just a lot of people your age no I am it's a different everybody my age knows who you are it's different world but so the fear factor thing was I had done a lot of stuff after news radio that didn't work not a lot of stuff but a few pilot scripts that I had gotten a few meetings that I had with people they were kind of goofy there was a lot of like and I didn't I loved working with my cat my cast my friends from Newsradio they were great but I had also worked with a bunch of actors who were actors it's a it's not an environment it's not a job that lends itself to authenticity yeah it's a job that lends itself to conformity because you're always auditioning for things so you want everybody to like you so you sort of pattern your likes and dislikes your behavior patterns your your your opinions - what I you lick your finger yeah and put it in the air where's the wind blowing I'm going that way the safest way to make a living and there's a lot of that in Hollywood I was gonna say that gets back to my point about how insular they are now everybody in Hollywood like yeah Oprah 2020 is fucking great who the fuck is sitting in you know Kentucky yeah well I may be somebody maybe some man struggling with wrestling with menopause maybe some housewives Falls annexed out there like so when Fear Factor came along two things I thought one was gonna be canceled immediately I was really convinced yeah we don't forever forever 148 episodes then we came back and did seven more um but the getting attacked by dogs and making people eat eating bull dicks yeah I was like this is no way this is gonna last it's crazy and so I felt I felt like at the very least it would give me some material and it was it was a generous amount of money and it was money that well I was like okay if I do this and I keep doing this I don't have to do other things like I can be free and that having that ability to say no to things and have fuck you money and to just not worry about how to pay your bills I knew when I lived in New Rochelle is actually when I got my first development deal and when I got my first development deal there was this this physical wait ha that left lip lifted off of me where I didn't have to worry how am I gonna pay my rent next yeah how am I gonna pay my gas how many sure cuz that was a I went from that to having some money and the feeling that I got it was like okay this is valuable this is some bullshit idea like having money I'm not saying like that being rich makes you happy it's not but having resources is a valuable thing and having the resources to not have to do something you don't want to do and where you can pursue what you want to do that's valuable as well so it's funny you bring that up because I covered a this study that came out a few weeks ago on my show and apparently researchers found out that when you can't you hit a certain level of happiness when you hit $75,000 a year because I think they they figured out that that's where people can generally pay the bills yeah and be okay and then they said if you make up to ninety five thousand you do see a noticeable increase in happiness when you jump from 75,000 to ninety five thousand so that's when people pretty much across the board or like okay I'm good and then everything after that you're playing with house money hmm so they say you know the difference between make a ninety five thousand dollars a year and a million dollars a year even though there's a big material difference there in terms of how much it buys your happiness it there's a tapering effect when you hit that ninety five thousand dollar threshold I think also the amount of work that you have to do to make a million dollars a year significant share dresses you out the you don't have time to do things that you love like say if you you know you have some hobbies that you really enjoy you feel like I got to leave those alone for a while I got to pursue my career and go after my career really make it happen yeah it's hard to balance that life comfort appreciation for your just your existence here and trying to make a living and yeah sometimes people get that way wrong and they go all in on May living and then you become some fucking Harvey Weinstein guy who's just all about just vices and just filling your life up with things that try to make you happy because you've got $550 in the bank and you're constantly working and you just it's not a good example Harvey Weinstein is a good example because yeah he's a shit yeah fucking people and I asked him what not alleged the the better example would be someone who works so they have a heart attack and then realizes they never had any fun and now the health is deteriorated so radically that they they can't have fun and then they can't work and they can't even do what they do and then they have to sort of reboot their life I mean I just think it's very important to enjoy your time here it's it's fucking fleeting like Kevin Smith just how I saw that yeah yeah I love that guy he's a great guy has he ever been on the podcast yeah a couple times I've been on his he's been on this one a couple times he's awesome he's just a sweet a genuine sweetheart of a guy he's one of those guys were if he doesn't like someone I don't like him oh we trust him that much his judgment right sure if Kevin Smith doesn't like he's a really nice guy like if he doesn't like you you must be a shit right this doesn't make any sense and you know this but my point is that this is fleeting it doesn't you know I'm 50 years old I became 50 years old I don't know how that happened it just keeps happening well it's funny I just turned 30 I just turned 30 on January 31st it was the first birthday where I ever went boo yeah I met my third shit just got a little real I remember 30 cuz I was dating a girl was kind of what want she was just kind of little and not her fault she's a little negative she's like I already thought you already were 30 all right what the fuck does that mean I was telling you something's weird and you're not even you don't even thinking about my perspective you're dealing like I thought you already were 30 well you saying I look 30 with bitch what are you saying it's a weird thing to date for like a surface thing like oh I think the person's older I think the person is worth a lot of money or I think that's what it was she was a deeply unhappy person that was trying to diminish me not a healthy relationship now it wasn't healthy relationship period but there's a lot of a lot of that happens in relationships chips right people try to diminish each other or they feel like they're in a bad position of power like they feel like they don't have the power in the relationship so then they see that there's possibly a vulnerability and instead of like soothing that person they attacked that vulnerability that's how you know you're in a terrible toxic their lives or struggle sure oh yeah man that's the worst it becomes a weird Machiavellian fucking game yeah and it's like well the whole idea of a relationships supposed to be that's where you go to get away from the bullshit of everything so when that becomes part of the bullshit like what the fuck are we doing here what are we doing he will probably get addicted to that cycle they were fucking for sure yeah man it but it's hard to tell people while it's happening it's hard to tell people hey man you're in a bad relationship like this is not good like especially like rich guys with hot girls that like don't wear it doesn't make any sense and the guys like miserable and you're like hey man do you see what's happening it's not gonna work man yeah and it fucking sucks right for that rich guy he's kind of a dork he's like well what the fuck look you know what else sucks when the Antelope has a limp that sucks and the Lions running at them and they're in a goddamn thing they could do the universe does not care about whatever this imbalance is but you yeah as a thinking cognitive species like you as a conscious aware individual you gotta pay attention to that like she's gonna get your money or she's gonna leave but either what something's happening yeah I'm happening so going back to the point you made about the rat race of life and people who get like obsessed with work and stuff like that here's an interesting fact that I nobody talks about it I don't know why people don't think it's a bigger deal but did you know that the United States is the only developed country that doesn't have paid time off by law every other modern country so you go to Europe for example they ask why we win bro talking to me about losers Gordon Gekko xur countries and you say why aren't we like these losers yeah those assholes with health care and fucking yeah and I definitely think people should get paid time off and I definitely think I mean I've had some pretty intense arguments with wealthy people about a living wage I'm like you're out of your fucking mind if you think someone should be working for less than $15 for an hour of their time so I'm telling you a guy's gonna go in your backyard he's gonna dig a fucking hole for an hour you want to give him $5.00 how much do you want to give him you wanna give him $7.00 well Joe that's a market and they need to be able to make contracts free of government intervention and I don't care if years old I don't care it's a 12 year old a 12 year old digs for an hour give them 20 bucks this is crazy I mean yeah the number is crazy and people all the businesses won't be able to survive no that's not true it's not true the person who is making the most money at the top of the business won't make as much money exactly in fact whenever people bring that point up they're all we can't raise the minimum wage because of reasons and stuff and things I always bring up Australia I'd like to point out that I make I know jack shit about economics okay I know a little bit more than jack shit but if you look up the minimum wage in Australia Jamie I think it's like $17 and change they pay you in boomerangs over there bro give you a bucket of poison snakes hey Mike good luck so I think it's like $17 and change and it's not they didn't look at that and are they are they a hellscape Joe is Australia suicide I think Australia is fucking amazing so spare me with the bullshit arguments can't afford to pay people a living wage read this the Fair Work Commission has handed down its annual ruling on Australia's minimum wage raising it by 2.4 percent to six hundred seventy two dollars and seventy cents a week that's excellent it means an extra 15 point $15 point 80 cents per week for the 1.8 million workers who are paid the minimum wage it will apply from July 1st and equates to a minimum our hourly rate of 17 dollars and 70 cents and that's in 2016 May 30th of 2016 that's next year 725 here did you know that the raising the minimum wage here today is actually worth less than the minimum wage was worth in nineteen 68 because if you account for inflation right the minimum wage from 1968 would be about $10 and change today so people who earn the minimum wage today make less than they made in 1968 I believe it what do you think that is do you think that's people just taking advantage of poor people is it they are they do they really believe this is a stepping stone position that no one who's making minimum wage should ever consider this something they're gonna do forever so I don't think that it's bad people I don't think it's bad individuals who are trying to take advantage of people I think the problem is the system and the only reason why we don't have a system like Australia does with their minimum wage is because corporations have bought the government so if you look at the polls 80% of people want to raise the minimum wage but we don't get that and we don't get that because there's a tremendous amount of money being poured into our government from the likes of corporations that don't want to raise the minimum wage so that's the only constituent group that has all the power and they happen to be the only constituent group against having a living wage so I think that's the general dynamic behind it I do think that there are some small businesses where they're like listen I genuinely don't have the money to do this you know what I mean so for those cases yes we can have a separate conversation about those instances but if you're a fucking giant corporation don't bullshit us and tell us you can't afford to pay somebody a living wage because in the case of like Walmart for example they don't pay their people living wage and then they dump all of their workers onto the onto the Medicaid rolls and onto the social safety net so taxpayers end up paying billions of dollars to support them meanwhile the people who are part of Walmart or running out the back door with all the fucking money yeah that's real I mean that's kind of undeniable and the idea that a CEO should be able to earn that much more money than anybody else it's kind of fucking crazy - like the whole CEO position it's very bizarre the fact that these guys get payouts when their companies go under and Wall Street bailout Oh God I mean stop and think about that for a second because I don't think that people really got how ridiculous that was so if you own a fucking deli or you own a dry cleaners and you go under you know what they say tough shit take care buddy yeah but if you're a part of a big bank or you're part of a fucking hedge fund that made the decisions that ended up crashing the fucking economy not only do you not get fired they say in order to retain the talent of these people we're gonna have to pay them bonuses with the taxpayer money that just bailed out the corporation that they bankrupted that was hilarious so it wasn't just that these people got bailed out which was also very arguable our good position to argue against that's right like I don't know what would have happened if we let the banks fail I know how catastrophic that would have been to our economy but it's arguable like it was a debatable point it's not a debatable point to give those fucking people millions of dollars the taxpayers money has gone to the bailout so that they can get that bonus it's in their contract correct and Obama was like well it's in their contracts we'll fuck their contracts the contracts is no good now because the whole company went under your banks fucked up you guys were running the bank's you don't get that 50 million bucks you were promised and here's what they don't do they never come out and say okay what we're gonna do is a bailout of the people who are hurt by this they always go well what we have to do is we have to give it to the companies that just made the decisions that fucked everything up in the first place and sit down and shut up yeah and those guys are already rich that's just even crazier you get rich people tons of money after they fucked up and did a shitty job and this goes back to why Trump seemed appealing to so many people is because you have you know somebody who seems like a measured guy in a smart guy and he said he was gonna change the game but then he also fucking bails out Wall Street yeah and people look at that and they go okay you know what fucking anything but this okay forget Hillary Clinton forget the status quo I'll take the guy who's gonna break shit yeah I definitely think there was something like that there was also that he didn't seem like one of them he seemed like something different like let's try something different this is a new thing yeah the old thing is not working this whole person who talks like this who gives these speeches and for the large groups of people I'm gonna promise you change and hope and dignity and burn and vague words that mean flowery things noises joined here yeah so this gentleman what's his name again the the guy with the short name Rho Connor Roe Connor yeah Rho what's a full name what's his full name no idea I just know me back something crazy I how does he speak does he speak politician as you talk with your normal dude yeah I talks like a normal dude can we listen very honest guy I want to smell them out if you want to find a quip on her on you don't like that clip let's break it down but I'm willing to fucking put my chips in this guy's corner well to me I don't he's not gonna run in 2020 but he's he's all don't be a pussy he's on the radar he's got a tan suit it's over don't remember the tan suit Obama thing I do yeah this is a very respectful gathering and the purpose is very simple as I have had the opportunity to campaign for over a year and a half across this district the best part I think this is just kidding that's dangerous okay you come out yeah he's just him going after his opponent when he was running if you really want to you're wearing you're talking about me get this guy on adderall listen Trump's on so get him on those fucking energy pills we really have like a lot of a lot of vigor a lot of a lot of pep in your step you think Trump's on pills under percent you think he's on adderall I think he's on something like it I mean like sporting on it yeah well apparently there is a reporter that literally named the pharmacy where the Duane Reade pharmacy where Trump had his prescription okay yeah where he used to be on one form of amphetamine there was a diet pill supposed to be on for six months he was on for years it completely makes sense he does about the amount of time that guy spent on the campaign 70 some-odd year old guy out there giving speeches and listen energy is incredible yeah and let me tell you something everybody that I know that did adderall like I have a good I've done it before yeah I haven't but I have a good friend who's on it for a long time like coke and he got off at he gained 50 pounds he feels like it's hard for him like he but he said doctors were just handing him this stuff and that stuff and they that one doctor gave him three different amphetamines and told him find the one that you like the best that's a heart attack waiting to happen take him all along jacked up on these things all the time and last time I saw him was like four years ago when he was jacked up on him and I'm like dude what's going on and he's like he's fuckin adderall Mike I go you kind of like out of it he's like yeah I just you know so he's now he's back to normal but he's like I eat anything and I gain weight now whole system's all screwed up what is it about some people who can't have a little bit of something and experience the upsides of it without getting totally hooked by it because that's something I feel like that's something that I can do like I could try something and then I can't experience the upsides of it and not you know you know what I mean so an activity thing so for example I brought I brought you you said you already have a bunch of but kratom I wanted you try create and create them something that I have and I always feel like it it's like almost like caffeine to me I feel like it allows me to control my consciousness better so if I want to make a decision to do something I feel like if I have kratom in me I can focus on it more I could be more creative and it's just upsides of it you know what I mean right is that how you feel when you smoke weed yeah well weed is like a bunch of different things is one of the things that I like about weed that a lot of people are terrified one of the things that people don't like about weed is the intense introspective I get paranoid yeah that's what it is but that I think is where you get growth really yeah man I think that that fear so do I have like demons in my past that when I when I smoke it I'm like looking at that and I know I went away I don't want to psychoanalyze but I feel like what from my own personal view if I feel bad about something if I smoke pot and then also and I remember something I did like two years ago I think that's an opportunity for psychic growth it gives me an opportunity to examine my own thoughts and try to figure out what what I mean like who you are at any given time is a bunch of different factors right it's what's going on in your career or what's going on in your personal life where's your health at how stressed out how many of these factors are outside of your control what where's your what's the state of your success in life and all these various things and then all those things to get and that's who you are at any given time and it fluctuates it moves it goes back and forth and if you catch yourself at a good time and you smoke pot you feel great and if you catch yourself at a point where maybe you're examining these things like sometimes you'll think about these various factors and you get very uncomfortable and some in when you were in a state just an hour ago where you were super comfortable about your life now all of a sudden you don't feel good like what is that well it's probably there's some sort of subconscious thoughts and ideas sure you've ignored and I think the ignoring those things is probably unhealthy and even though that feeling of paranoia or whatever you want to want to call it I call it ruthless introspective thinking right that feeling is is probably it's healthy because it's a it's making you examine things that you're probably pushing to the dark regions of your consciousness you don't there make them make you uncomfortable so you push them aside and I think they're better off explored and dealt with so I feel I've always felt like substances that either up my mood and make me feel like I want to be very proactive and creative and busy and talkative fine with taking something like that fine with taking the opposite something that relaxes me and makes me feel just at ease and calm but I've always so with my limited experience with weed because I've only smoked we honestly maybe 8 to 12 times in my life most folks I'm right now know I will fucking shit myself and realize that there's millions of people watching us right now and I'll realize that that happens sometimes too but anyway so I've always had an issue with psychoactive substances where so I've never tried and all the ones the drugs you talk on a regular basis like psilocybin and stuff like that I've always been scared of them and I always feel like the drugs that will make me see things that aren't there hallucinogenics I'm just scared of them because I feel like I take that trip and not come back you know what I mean hmm I know that I'm just why I'm bringing up you because I know you disagree with that I'm curious what you think about why I'm scared of those because with my experience with weed most of the times I smoked it it really was like a paranoid type you probably first of all we probably smoke too much I always add sure I did I'm sure I did I always advise people when the first time they smoke pot just take one little hit yes a little hit and just experience the good parts which is like a good weird kind of funny feeling and then there's also I feel like it's a turbocharger for your imagination but I feel like I already have a hyperactive mind and then when I am Adam path my mind will go down when I smoke weed I you know suddenly I'm thinking about I don't know fucking naked Vikings and like it's like wow fuck am I thinking about all this shit oh yeah but it's like a shock to the system and did you the first few times I smoked weed I didn't get high did that happen with you or no no no you got time Elio really high so I have a pretty funny story about that I the first few times I smoked it I thought I was cool I was in high school I'm like yeah I'm gonna be cool kid and smoke weed so I smoked it and didn't have any effect and then by the third or fourth time somebody had asked me before I had class you want to smoke weed I was like yeah sure fuck it let's do it it didn't affect me do a few times why not right wet and smoked it I opened the door to come back in school and I start walking down the hallway no no no doo-doo-doo-doo I was like feels weird and then I'm sitting in class convinced my eyes are probably bloodshot red eye in my mind everybody in the room knows I'm high and they're like thinking like this assholes hi I'm scared to death of the teacher so anyway but there was no there was a few times where I smoked weed and I had a positive experience but it was like all it was was just giggling non-stop with my friends to the point where yeah we'd laugh laugh laugh and then I remember what one of us literally asking hey why the fuck are we laughing and somebody said I don't know and then we kept laughing well that's listen it's a good thing to laugh I don't think it's a bad thing but one of the reasons why you don't remember what you were laughing and there's a real issue with short-term memory in marijuana you know it's one of the reasons why I prefer marijuana with nootropics I like the combination of the two I think they balance each other out the nootropics accentuate your memory and then on top of that the marijuana sort of fucks with your memory a little bit if there's a there's there's real issues I mean marijuana it's not it's not 100% innocuous in terms of your like psychic stability well you said when you took off the month you had your dreams yeah yeah yeah they were way different they were very very intense like within the first week it started getting really crazy yeah like intense like like weird lucid dreams like just very very bizarre and detailed and bright and vivid and so you think that it's one of those things where that's not good so are you trying to avoid smoke weed a little less so that you don't have the effects on sleep or do you like I don't think it's bad for your sleep and what I've read is that what it's kind of wish I could remember see if see if you could pull that up like what what are the marijuana and there's there's some positive benefits to it it just bypasses that REM sleep deeper asleep and you get to the deeper stages of sleep because REM sleep a lot of people think is like the deepest levels it's not yeah there's a deeper level of sleep the idea is that marijuana somehow or another gets you to that deeper level quicker there's a lot of people that I know that smoke pot before they go to bed and it's very helpful yeah one of the interesting things about kratom and why I think it's kind of similar to weed and how people use it even though the feeling is different when they take it is that many people take it because they were addicted to opioids right and it it helps them get off the pills and on kratom if you have too much of it you just throw it up if you have too many opioids you can die from an overdose and this is one of the reasons why the FDA is cracking down on it because they're fucking bought by big pharma and they don't want anything that's going to compete with their fucking profits yeah there's no reason to ban it there's no yes there's no addictive properties it's not it's not something that's fucking people up exactly so people take it for because they had an addiction to pills people take it for PTSD they take it for depression they take it for anxiety they take it for recreational reasons they take it to wake up in a smaller dose they take it to sleep in a bigger doses a substance like that that's a weird substance in terms of like I don't know any other substance where you take a low dose and it's a stimulant noise hope you take lower dose of opioids it's more of an upper you take a bigger dose of opioids is more of a downer what's the rationalization for categorizing in as an opioid because it affects the same receptors in the brain mmm but it doesn't have the same response well that's why that's a very it's a very misleading thing that the FDA did is because what they're trying to do is find a backdoor way to be like that sorry you guys can't have it because it's an opioid and it's dangerous and as this and as that but they're glossing over the most important point which is the one that we were talking about which is if you take too much kratom you just throw up that's not the case with opioids there's why people overdose all the fucking time and actually the bigger problem is that when people get addicted to opioids and then because of the crackdown now they're they're not prescribing as many opioids then those same people go to the black market and they get fucking heroin and then when they get heroin on the black market oftentimes it's laced with fentanyl which is a fucking elephant tranquilizer which then kills them so it's killed Tom Petty and princess here and Philip Seymour Hoffman they were speculating that the fentanyl was in his heroin which is why he barrel that was heroin heroin right he didn't have pills oh no it wasn't yeah wasn't pills he was doing heroin but the the stuff that they found Prince's system he apparently didn't even have a prescription for fentanyl oh so you're saying somehow somehow I know that he got it oh no no okay you know I mean probably want something stronger he apparently had fucked his hips up Prince said you know Prince had done all that crazy dancing on stage and all those years you know my friend Maynard from tulle he had to get a hip replacement from stompin on stage you ever see like how Maynard sings yeah when he would sing he would just be fuckin stompin on stage he blew his hip out that's crazy now he's got an artificial hip they cut the top of his how old is he 50 51 shit human body's so fucking fragile it is super fragile and I'm gonna have to bring everybody is gonna be like shut the fuck up Kyle you can't stop talking about Tiger Woods because I love golf and I love Tiger Woods when Tiger Woods is a great example of the guy had fucking four back surgeries yeah yeah back surgery dude I know a lot of people that have had back surgery my good friend Eddie Bravo has a artificial disc in his back and he does he still do jujitsu and rollin stuff he doesn't right now because he blew his ACL out and he has to have ACL reconstructive surgery I mean look jujitsu is rough on the body I've had two knee reconstructions one from Taekwondo one from one from jujitsu but then I had a third operation from jujitsu as well so two knee surgeries from jujitsu and I had some significant back problems too everybody gets them just there's no way around that if you're if you're training hard your body just can only take so much and you were talking about the stem cells that you guys saw the podcast with Mel Gibson with the stem cells that was it fascinating I haven't gone the Panama you have to do that I've only done them in America which apparently you can't get the same sort of potency but there's some new research that shows that there's some there's some other stuff they're working on now that is uh this is sounds gross but umbilical blood there they're using blood from from umbilicals of people that are you know like just giving birth and they're having radical healing response with this stuff well there was a study that came out a few years ago that said when you took the blood of young mice Brian and put him into old mice yeah different things into concept yeah that is uh that's something that erroneously was attributed to Peter Thiel the Peter Thiel was doing that apparently he said he wasn't but there's a start-up in Silicon Valley that does that that offers and guys are going there and so like a guy would go there and some twenty-five year old kid who does CrossFit everyday would give up a couple of pints of blood and they'd shoot it into your system and then you'd go out there and fuck the shit out of your wife it can't be that simple right like that's almost too simple a concept they just take the blood for the young people put it into the old people and everybody's a fucking Olympic athlete maybe yes and maybe no it's kind of like a vampire too right isn't the whole fear a little bit yeah that's the Elizabeth báthory thing right remember the story of Elizabeth báthory no she's it's interesting somebody contacted me on Twitter and told me that this story might be a distortion even though it's in it that it's sort of in the historical record they might have actually been trying to steal her land so they might have fabricated some of these charges but one of the ancient stories of Elizabeth báthory was that she was this incredibly evil woman that as she got older she would torture and kill young peasant women and and like bathe in their blood because she wanted to regain her youth and she was jealous of these hot yeah yeah yeah I don't know if it's real though this person who said that it was a hoax it was I made me go oh okay I could see that happening to you know whether someone wanted to steal from her so they concocted some charges or could be either or could be both you know who the fuck knows well with the stem cell thing I feel like it should be here already if the evidence is as solid as he was the doctor was saying yes and no the evidence is very solid that there's some regenerative properties of stem cells the problem is we don't have enough evidence of what the potential downsides could be and whether or not there's a very specific protocol that ensures safety now dr. Neil Reardon is on top of all that stuff and his books we used to have him sitting around here but I think we put him in our little library his books detail all the various studies that have shown efficacy and all the the different benefits they have and for a lot of people like Mel Gibson's dad it was nice yes when he went in there now he's almost a hundred sure and Mel Gibson's dad was fucked I mean he couldn't walk he was all jacked up and it straightened him right out so not to get all conspiratorial but it maybe maybe I have no idea but maybe the reason why it has it's not already here is because there's some pre-existing treatment first stuff like that that they don't want to scrap that means I mean it's it's always possible I think more likely they're skeptical and then the FDA also wanted to categorize some stem-cell preparations as a drug because you have to do something to the stem cells and then the in the process of cultivating them there's some sort of a method that they do that they believe categorizes it as a drug I'm obviously a moron so I'm not the right person telling to about this me too yeah but dr. Neil Reardon is lobbying to get it passed in Texas goddamn great state of Texas how if anybody can do it Texas can do it cool yeah they don't care they don't give ya fuck that's barely America Texas had its own thing I would love it if they did that if they did it where you could go to Texas and get those treatments everybody that I know that's gone over there and gotten the treatments has had some radical positive response well they know quite a few people that have gone there there are I know countless stories of people so I know somebody who got the LASIK eye surgery mm-hmm and they flew to the UK to get their version of it because their version of it is on is is better this superior and we have the older one here and they're still waiting on the approval for the new way of doing it well why would they hold back approval and that's it doesn't make any sense don't know and this is what I'm saying I feel like in many instances not in every instance but in many instances you have the pre-existing treatments that are already in place yeah and they're and pharmaceutical companies make a lot of money from having those treatments already in place if you try to up in the apple cart over turn the apple cart I mean that's this gets back to the whole kratom point there's a reason why if this is something that's basically a cure for addiction to opioids why the fuck are we not pushing it like crazy yeah and the reason is they don't want to stop making money off the fucking opioids yes that is that I think that is a much more likely conspiracy because there's just an ungodly amount of money in opioids yes look at the pill mills and fucking West Virginia millions of pills in a town that doesn't have that many people did you ever see the documentary the oxycontin Express I did not know oh actually I may have the one where they go to Broward County yeah I think I saw that they've changed the law since then because people were going down I mean it's one of the most ridiculous things they've ever had in this country they had a setup where they had these pain management centers so it's one box right one building and in this building there's two different doors one doors the doctor you go to the doctor you go hey man my fucking back hurts and it's okay I write your prescription go next door to the pharmacy the pharmacy only has oxycontin yeah it's like if you only have a hammer yeah am I gonna chop this tree down I guess I'm gonna use a hammer thank you it's I mean it's fucking crazy that this was going on for so long and then they also the this is where it got really weird it wasn't just they had these pain management centers they also didn't have a state database so if you went Jamie over there and got a prescription for oxycontin and then you left dr. Jamie's office with a fat bag of pills you could go to dr. Joe's office and I give you another prescription yeah and these pain management centers were all over the place in for sure so Florida was literally because I mean there's no other way that I could imagine that this would be done conscientiously I think this is all corruption I think the only reason why they would have no database it's not we're not in the 1500s matter you guys could keep records of who's fucking on this shit and who's not there's a wait I mean they had records back before the internet yeah this this is no excuse for this this is I think intentional corruption and what's crazy is now the pendulum is swinging almost too far in the other direction Ohio Attorney General suing opioid yester see now this is a good example of what I think is the pendulum swinging too far in the other direction because I have pain patients who contact me all the time and they talk about how since there's new federal regulations over the pills what's happening as many doctors are afraid to prescribe them at all even when it's a legitimate pain issue and so people contact me and they go I don't know what to do because I need my pills because I have severe pain problem and I've had it for an extended period of time and nobody wants to give me the pills anymore and they feel like they're forced to go on the black market now right right and and now that they're eliminating kratom it's even more fucked exactly so what is the status of kratom currently still illegal still legal still legal but it's a monitored substance by the FDA what does that mean it basically means if they want to they cease fucking shipments of it when it comes in to the US if they want to if they want to anything can't get that shipment back no fuck off fuck off we're gonna take your benefit show ants but it's still thankfully it's still it there's still leeway the last time the FDA really tried to crack down on it and make it a Schedule one drug the fucking bowels of Hell opened up on their face because they opened up a comment section a comments period mmm and like 99.9 percent of the comments were like fuck you to save my life you guys are fucking criminals how dare you do this and then they had to back off because the comments were just so overwhelming so now they're trying to smoothly do it again and what's happening is they just referenced oh there are 44 cases of somebody who overdosed from kratom multistate outbreak of salmonella right so this is actions related to credo exactly so there were a few cases of salmonella tainted kratom and so the idea there's another way they try to go out like we gotta get we gotta get rid of it because there's some Salmonella cases at this time the CDC recommends that people not consume create them in the in-form because it could be contaminated with salmonella we instead suggest fentanyl which kills winos we could kill fucking whale with a Altoid sized piece of fentanyl they literally I feel well I know yeah dead whale would be fucked yeah an Altoid so they said whores they said there are 44 deaths linked to kratom 28 cases few people got diarrhea but what happened Hospice that's it 1111 hospitalizations well the story gets crazier because there were 44 cases that the they cited and said oh look man 44 cases people dying when they took kratom so guess what no reporters decided let's look into this let's dig deeper and see what happened first of all one of the cases was a suicide that they counted as a death that they're attributing to kratom that's hilarious another was a homicide that's hilarious and then 42 they're they're worse and then most of them people had like five or six different drugs in their system and they're saying ah yeah it's kratom so that's one of the things they did with marijuana and car accidents they were saying all these different car accidents P like marijuana in the system yeah well they were also drunk exactly yeah people are partying man right that how they're out of their fucking head and they crash into trees it's not good how do you feel now that California has legalized it is it because you had the medical one before yeah and now is it more of a pain in the ass to to get weed because it's it's very easy to get weed in California it's very easy it's not as easy as in Colorado Colorado it's got it down Colorado's got it nailed and they they're swimming swimming in money yeah booming so the point would have to give people money that's right that was that's right they gave a check to everybody in the state and they say I love how they take a lot of the money and they divert some of it to education some of it to substance treatment hmm so it they're doing the most responsible thing for it and like you said they the tax on it everybody's like okay yeah yeah okay what I mean it's it's a high tax rate I think they have a thirty nine percent tax rate on recreational and I think it's like an 11 on medicinal but here's the thing it's not exorbitant ly expensive it's a plant that grows easy it's not hard to grow it's not like some very difficult grape that needs a perfect climate and right it's not marijuana's not hard to grow so there's not a lot of arguments against it for responsible adults yeah and that's the things are we gonna regulate responsible adult use of substances because if we do we'd be hypocritical if we didn't eliminate alcohol exactly right and the worst ones if you look if you look at it objectively yeah you would have to say listen this substance which is legal and has been legal for a very long time is actually more dangerous than many of these ones that are illegal and we learned from alcohol prohibition how terrible an idea it is to just ban the substance because what happened during Prohibition the Mafia got incredibly powerful because they're the ones selling the alcohol they're the ones making the money and then when you have a dispute and your product is on the black market you know how you solve that dispute with fucking guns in the street you know how you solve the dispute if it's legal you go to court wearing suits and ties and you figure it out like adults well this is another thing that Trump should have recognized when he was sessions yeah he's a perfect example that guy is a goddamn monster he's an easy he's the old school mentality of like I was raised and it's wrong if you put substances in your body he literally said good people don't use marijuana well that's crazy bro yeah he's acting a moral judgement on you for that I think there's something like 37 percent of the country is a regular marijuana user so you say in 37 percent of the country's bad people yeah and there's another example by the way of 60 percent of people now want to legalize marijuana across the country yeah so this is another issue where if the Democrats decided let's not be fucking corrupt idiots and let's actually fight for something do you have any idea how big of a blue tsunami there would be in the next election if every democrat came out there and said one of the things were for is legalizing marijuana we're gonna fight for them we're not going to take no for an answer and we're gonna make a lot of money that can go to the schools they can go to the infrastructure exactly the job creation these are arguments that also appeal to the right if you tell people on the right hey you guys say you love small government you know what's really big government when they knock down your fucking door and drag you out in handcuffs cuz you decided to tweak your consciousness slightly yeah that's the biggest government imaginable they kick your door down shoot your dog because you've got a fucking bowl sit in your coffee table there's there's so many examples of that too if Trump really wanted to stop all this illegal Mexican cartel legalize it tax it regulate it done yeah exactly there's no reason for them to be here yeah and that's see this is one of the things that's so frustrating to me doing what I do and one of the reasons why I think it shows like ours have blown up is because we're willing to say the most obvious things that everybody's thinking but the system is dragging like fucking 50 years behind what we're talking about you could never do the show that you do or this kind of show if you had like real serious advertisers controversial serious Network and producers and executives if you had a bunch of executives that were above you and you know fill in the blank CNBC or whatever and their job depended upon you not saying something fucked up that was going to get the advertisers to crack down on their program and you wouldn't be able to do it you wouldn't have resent him in fact Genk youger was on MSNBC the reason he ended up leaving MSNBC he was too hard on the democrats so his higher-ups were like hey listen man I just heard from our friends in Washington that you need to reel it in a little bit turn and he's like wait I don't understand so the whole idea of MSNBC is be partisan be in favor of the Democrats and support the Democratic establishment the whole idea of Fox News is be partisan support the Republicans support the establishment if somebody comes along and they go you know what your whole fucking game is bullshit both the parties are corrupt nobody's fighting for the people you're ignoring the fact that only 14% of the American people even support Congress you're ignoring the fact that 60% of people want to legalize marijuana if you go and talk about real issues that's when they step up and they go listen we can't have you because you know hey you curse too much or this isn't palatable and it's always people above you who feel like they should be able to control your content but they don't understand the reason why the content is popular in the first place is because you're not fucking being control exactly exactly they're operating in this archaic format - the other problem is they interrupt their show every 15 minutes for commercials and it's just they break the flow of it and then they've got fucking commercials for antidepressants and diarrhea pills and whatever the fuck else they're selling and it's just that nobody wants that this is yeah it's an archaic version of entertainment and it made sense back when that was the only way to get your entertainment when the only way to get your ten entertained was the big three NBC ABC CBS then Fox comes along with tosses the opera card up and then you got cable oh my goodness now things are crazy well the cable news really opened it up and now you got wild shit like Fox News and all this and megyn kelly doesn't have any clothes on she's telling you about fucking history all that stuff was really an interesting thing then the internet comes along all bets are off a hundred percent and they're fucked because a guy like you mean who's involved in your operation how many people three four hilarious yeah hi Phyllis Lilith owes a lot of money she's awesome that's nuts I mean how many fucking people would be involved in the Ryan Seacrest show forget it hundreds right and the fact that Ryan Seacrest yeah he's so irrelevant of her you keep something small and close to the chest I feel like that's when you can mold it and make it your own well yeah it becomes a giant big operation at forty three hands or in it right well then all of a sudden it feels like it's stale and detached yes and not connected to anything real that people can relate to no I've been involved in that kind of stuff before I know what happens just there's too many cooks in the kitchen everything gets fucked up and everybody's also trying to justify their position which is almost unnecessary I mean there's so many positions when you when you work on a television set and you see how many people are just standing around you go oh what the fuck is why are there so many jobs like why there's so many people working well a lot of it is like they've kind of created these jobs justify their position and then when there's meetings those people all have like an idea that they want to change they want to change this or tweak that and so they can say that was my idea and that justifies their oh well it was my idea to tell Kyle that he's got to stop doing this and start doing that and we got Kyle to wear a suit and he pushed back but I was right I was right you know like there's all that kind of shit that happens on these goddamn TV sets and it ruins the the individual idea like a person's individual point of view like if you there's no way you're gonna get a real unique individual point of view if you have so many people tweaking and adjusting and restricting and and demanding that a certain behave a certain way or dress a certain way or stay to a certain topic or you know keep on you know you have to keep keep within these very clearly defined parameters where was it worst for you which show was it the man show when you did the man show that was astir yeah that was a disaster for a bunch of reasons but one of the reasons why that was a disaster was because Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake had decided to pull Janet's boobie out on TV oh and so they cracked down so being very singing they were terrified of everything but that's all so you have a bunch of people again that aren't comedians they don't know what's funny and they're trying to impose their idea of what's funny and what's not you have a lot of that on television now you have a lot of these people that aren't necessarily comedians but they might be like super progressive social justice warrior types and now they're trying to push that kind of comedy as being what everybody likes and that shit gets to you know Jamie's hometown Columbus Ohio and these people like without fuck exactly ting me and in meanwhile like we were talking about for the podcast a guy like Joey Diaz comes around Lee and everybody's like that's it that's what we want well you know this guy on in the world he's a perfect example too because for the longest time I was trying to tell people for the longest time like I had agents former agents of mine that would tell me you've got to stop working with that that's literally the dumbest shit I've ever heard my life's not funny it's so easy to see he's like a diamond in the rough yeah in how unique he is and how just straightforward he is yeah he's a genius he's a comedy genius I think the funny in terms of like bursts of Chi might not be the very best joke writer of all time but in terms of being the funniest I think he's the funniest person it's ever lived I've seen everybody I've seen almost everybody either live or on video I don't think anybody's ever been funnier than Joey I've seen Joey some nights at the Ice House or some nights at the Comedy Store hit levels of ridiculousness yeah I don't think I've seen anybody and his whole thing he's a goddamn human cartoon his voice is cartoony love listen dog the way moves just and forever they're telling me that that guy's not funny this is not good this guy can't work and he wasn't getting work other than like character work in movies but then the internet came along and then people got to know him on podcasts and that's what really made Joey and you knew that everybody who is telling you that was working backwards from their conclusion that they had this idea in their mind of what somebody who's popular is supposed to be yeah he didn't fit that mold because he's too rough around the edges and he curses too much and he talks about eating ass and all that shit yeah and then you knew no I know innately I look at this guy and he he touches something in me so I know this is gonna connect with other people well I'm also I'm out there in the clubs and I'm watching Joey go onstage and crush rhyme telling me he's not funny I'm like you're out of your mind yeah you're just wrong I've seen it not only that I'm a fan of comedy I'm not just I'm not just a fan of things that are gross I'm a fan under in fact if someone's gross and it's not well done it's appalling to me right I don't wanna yeah I know when people are just being gross for the sake of trying to get a reaction it's annoying yeah it's like it's bad on your brain especially when you hear it more than once it's like it's it's it's it's grating Joey's not doing that he's just he's being himself and I was watching him kill over and over and over again and having these people tell me that it's not good and then podcast came along you know seven eight years ago so I got to know him and then now when we have him on it's like always one of our highly Jews in a minute always so oh and I was telling you before the podcast too and I'll tell Joey if he's watching Joey don't you don't need guest on your podcast I really like you it's just Joey and Lee and they just talk I like that too but I like Joey with guests - I just like Joey I'm gonna direct and produce Joey's stand-up special oh that's great we couldn't get anybody to do it it's just like they still don't get it like there's a lot of people that still don't get it and I'm hoping they get it when we put something together but we're going to film something at the Ice House okay I'm gonna put it all together yeah and I'm gonna direct it and produce it and the whole thing and just have someone added it and just put it together and just make the ultimate Joey Diaz comedy special so people could know and I'm we're gonna do a shitload of shows too because that's the other thing like when a comic has to do one show ready here Kyle this is your one moment to be funny and it's gonna be seen forever it's like you smoking pot and realizing millions of people yeah that that's that's sort of what it's like for a comic to do a special so you do one you get it in the can you feel loose then you get that second one you like oh we got it and then you're the third one you're like now we really got it needed fourth one that fourth one is generally like a real comedy show sure like where there's no no concern no worries no issues well the evolution of stuff is interesting because it's almost impossible to start something and just get it like you it requires a lot of time a lot of effort a lot of cultivation a lot of attention and you know it's it's that book I forget who wrote it but the idea of you have to do something for 10,000 hours or whatever fuck it is that Gladwell no say might be that might be Malcolm Gladwell but that's true and you know what what I say is even if let's say you don't get there with whatever you're trying to do you're definitely gonna be better after those 10,000 hours and also you might learn a lot about yourself and a lot about what you're capable of yeah and a lot about dedication and discipline if you just stick with something and I've always said you know people like to shit on one-dimensional people and act like you know you're not supposed to there's most be well-rounded and this and that but you know again to bring up Tiger Woods how the fuck do you think he got good at golf you know how he got good at golf by only fucking playing golf yeah and he was able to find something that he got so fucking good at and create meaning in his life and also use that to develop different parts of your personality and it's I'm in favor of people doing whatever they think suits their creative pursuits don't don't feel bad if you're somebody who's own I all I do is this one fucking thing right okay well you can get really fucking good at it even if it's some shit like playing video games okay go be the fucking best video game player in the world right might as well if that's what you're really good at and you can do the time and put in the work especially if you enjoy that and there's there's something about getting rich ever see jiro Dreams of Sushi no really interesting documentary one of the weirdest things about it is that there's a term that the Japanese use for someone who does something over and over and over again even a simple task and becomes a master at it remember what that term was Jamie remember that but this is one guy in the film I was at first I was very skeptical like I'm not watching a fucking movie about a do to make sushi yes the fish he puts it on the rice and when you see what really goes into it it's a shokunin I think how do you say it shokunin a showtune yeah and that is what is the definition of that was that what is it where they call it what is the actual no it's like someone who practices something methodically meticulously forever until they get it and this guy was just making an egg dish it's like really notional fluffy egg dish and he you know how you get those you know you get sushi sometimes it has a little piece of egg on it like this I don't eat sushi I don't eat pussy either well the pussy one I'll deal with the sushi I'm not dealing with the anyway this guy was like almost in tears because he finally reached this state where the guy was like yeah this is the way to make the egg dish the mastery of one's profession shokunin Lodger things I'm seeing for definition ok shokunin mastery of one's profession but and that this is this thing that this guy had been studying the art of making sushi like the properly aging of the fish which I didn't even know I thought the fish was fresh I thought that was the moon yeah really if it's aging you know they want to they ain't known refrigerators for periods of time that I would have never guessed that they did that with fish do that obviously with me everybody knows about dry aged meat you're literally letting the bacteria break down the meat over long periods of time but what's interesting is you would never guess that there are so many different angles to doing something as simple as making that dish right but there's so much that goes into it and if you care enough to look at all the nuances of it and to really get into the specifics of it then you can create something that has meaning to you and really can develop you as a person yeah yeah there's something in that where you you're you're exploring your own potential for getting good at things right that's that's what you're doing you're exploring like what what's keeping this guy from making this perfect egg dish and how does he nail it is it a timing issue is it a it mean is he getting the ingredients correct I don't know what's what ingredients are in this egg dish but I don't know why I'm even using that but for anything there's there's some exploration of these ideas what is this Kaizen is that's the word that's the word continuous improvement a long term approach to work that systematically seeks to achieve small incremental changes in processes in order to improve efficiency and reality Kaizen but I think it was shokunin yes the shokunin definition said like that the definition of tradesmen isn't good enough but there's more deeper meaning when you get into the Japanese culture okay so either one of those yeah I actually think that this topic that we're talking about right now this is one of the main reasons why Jordan Peterson got very popular is because Jordan Peterson he talks a lot about stuff that other people take for granted about self-improvement and like getting your own shit together right and so that was like a market that was waiting to be served for so long where people wanted to have a little bit of direction and structure and framework as to how do I go about doing that you know and then this guy comes along and he's a very well-spoken and he can kind of break that down for people yeah yeah and also he he exemplifies a lot of those traits we were just discussing like he was talking about his first book and one of the things that he said is it in 15 years to write the book the 12 rules book no the first ball the first book first was on the Cold War and he was talking about how he went over every sentence to see if it can be improved or criticized but do you do that was your like the podcast do you listen back or no because sometimes sometimes if especially if I fucked up if I fucked up I'll listen or if I said something I know that could be a bit said sometimes I'll have to go back and get it out of there fine it yeah I'll do that you know if some people say something that's really intense like the David Goggins podcast I plan on listening to that one again because it was so inspirational oh yeah I turned it on these guys talking about how he ran three hundred and seventy four thousand miles and meanwhile I'm like great I'll be on Joe show next week talking about chronic masturbation he's mean he's intense intense it's not a good enough word it's like we need a yeah yeah shokunin word for intensity yeah he's but also you could get a lot out of that there's something about inspiration in that form like the exemplified form there's a term that the Koreans used for a Taekwondo instructor it's a bomb NIM and it means one who leads by example and that there's there's something about a guy like that that that really does practice what he preached preaches and and is so motivational just by his own actions we might hear him talk about it and you know he's actually done it like you just want it like why am I sitting down I gotta go yeah I just wanna I think you said that after the pockets right you were like I'm in the gym the fuck guys I just want to go do something right yes there's something about guys like him that are very very valuable to us and I think people get real cynical about the idea of inspiration because there's so many ridiculous like not to single out girls because as guys who do it too but it's something some funny shit about girls just stick their butt out on Instagram and they have all these like motivational quotes you know a court and I were talking about it before it's amazing how many Kim Kardashian clones exist now I mean and even in her own family I don't know all the names of them but one of the younger ones it's like she went to the plastic surgeon she was like I want to look like him yeah and they just give her the same face yeah yeah what the fuck is up with the butt thing is the most disgusting thing well they're taking fat stuffing it into their ass and they developed this diaper but I mean that there's a lot of people out there with diaper but I met a girl the other day that had diaper but she was at the Comedy Store and I couldn't look away I was like what is happening to her but because I knew it wasn't real I knew she okay she's spin yeah the skinny legs and then the well girl has a big like hips and a right remember our crime comics do you remember our chrome comics and our chrome is our crumb there was a great documentary called crumb and it's about this guy who sits a really eccentric perverted cartoonist from the 1970s and he would always draw these women with these enormous legs an enormous butt but they weren't fat they were just always voluptuous well no it was you gotta it's past voluptuous into like super athlete DNA like if you could get that girl make some male babies with it you would have a fucking Ultimate Warrior like that see that woman like they're perfect yeah how to have fun with a strong girl and you see our crumb that's happened to him Ronnie Coleman legs yeah that's actually him with his boner cuz he was this a really frail dorky guy and he's got this image of this woman who just looks like a tank chezy's giant muscle legs and and big boobs but not like ridiculous stripper boobs but more like just super alpha DNA female boobs yeah he was a freaky guy like look at him he's got sock I mean that's that's who he was like who that one above that Jaime the one to the right here right there like oh my god this is what he used to draw he was always drawing this enormous powerful women this guy was definitely into getting dominated by yeah yeah he would just shove his whole head and their pussy or so I'm sure like look at the hit he had him riding one I guess he's supposed to be having sex with yeah and this guy definitely nut it in like two seconds yeah oh man okay stroking them in these cart like he's always choking them like you literally couldn't have an arc rum today that looks like it looks kind of like a Woody Allen - oh yeah sure yeah well see if you could find video of him our crumb the documentaries fascinating because I think he wound up moving to France or something like that I think you wanna leaving America but there's there's actually if you go to video you'll you'll find there's video of him but that was the guy he's a really fascinating guy that's not him it looks just like all right not on the right oh that's not definitely on the right okay it's him on the left is that him oh there is oh yeah he just looks odd it was he's holding up that picture yeah maybe it's also because I'm looking at him now as an older man yeah the lot of the video that I've seen was him it bothers me to look at him and think like that guy has a strong sex drive like oh that's yeah you might not you might just save it up for every couple weeks and you draw one of those cartoons and beat off to it or to find a gal yeah suitable exactly pay somebody to sit on his face a strange strange character though it doesn't matter Jamie it's okay what's that he did for it's the cat - yeah yeah he did for it's the cat he did a lot of pretty famous animated or cartoon comic book type things but they were all at cartoonish like features everybody was weird yeah and you think Kim has now made that that that's the not with that standard see this is like a real like that those women's asses that are Krum drew I'm not justifying his stuff but they were freak DNA specimens you're like those women at giant thighs and giant asses and that's who they were mm-hmm whereas with Kim she's got those spindly not yeah like her but is this they just it's a surgical creation like there's pictures of her there online that make it look good but they're all photoshopped and we found out about that because she got paparazzi when she was in Mexico they caught her I think that was the one that they were showing no way it's worse than that way grosser they caught her wandering around the beach and they took photos of her like real paparazzi photos she would have faked paparazzi photos where she would hire paparazzi take photos of her and then she would Photoshop them up and they made it look like everything was in place but it's it's not yeah it's cool it's a disaster this is what it really looks like yeah yeah it shows that okay so if the legs match the ass I'd be totally fine yeah but even that ass is a discussion doesn't there's so much going on there because you you're not supposed to have that much fat in one place a girl has an ass like that has legs to match it that's what I'm saying if the legs match the ass I'd like it but those the legs yeah the legs throw it off these little little twig legs and then you got the message it's like those guys that shoots synthol and it's the same thing like you're not that's not a real ass like I know it's like those synthol muscles are not real monster but they're so obviously yeah cuz the legs no but if the legs matched it I'd be like that's nice yeah but it wouldn't match it it's just not possible I've seen somewhere it matches yeah but not like that just it's the whole thing is a disaster it's just he's like I'm nailing this shit yeah I got this shit on lock oh he's got tits he does I mean these guys wind up getting horrible infections too sometimes they've they well they stand green and shit they say that there's an actual thing oh my god you say you see they say how there's an actual thing called bigger exia like there's an anorexia and there's big erect body dysmorphia as exists with me there's there's people that have body dysmorphia in terms of their facial features they just can't stop tweaking their nose did you hear about I read an article about how somebody was like I know I'm supposed to have a hand here but it feels so fucking foreign that and there's been multiple recorded cases of this where they will shove their fucking hand in dry ice so that they can get amputated and I said afterwards they could say look I'm free I finally feel normal it's like you just and they say that to them it feels like if I had a fucking third hand just growing out of here I feel like that shit doesn't belong right there are some people where they feel like their hand doesn't fucking belong yeah and what that shows is like the variation in human psychology is so fucking broad that it's scary because when you really died just that that exists you also can understand how well there's monsters out there to want to fucking massacre people and they dream about that shit and that's that's how they get their rocks off yeah human the human mind varies so much there's so many different paths that thoughts can go down and there's so many different weird pathologies that that the mind is capable of but the idea that you would think that you're supposed to be handicapped okay not handicapped so you want to chop off a foot or something like that it's really I mean it's not common oh we shouldn't say it's common but it's it's it's definitely documented so let me ask you what's your take on if somebody's transgender and they want the surgery and let's say they're either in the military or they're in prison or something like that is that something that you think should be provided for them or no mm-hmm good question I haven't really thought about too much I don't think so I don't think that that's an elective surgery and people would say though it's not an elective surgery but you think that other people should pay for that boy I don't know I don't know what it is I don't have it okay so if I was gonna say I know why people are transgender they're transgender because of body dysmorphia their chance gender because of gender dysmorphia they're transgender because of this because of that because of abuse because of you know they're they're easily susceptible to suggestion I would just be talking out of my ass I don't really know I would imagine though that there is a broad spectrum of reasons why someone becomes transgender some of them being that they literally have the wrong programming in their brain some of them being that they I mean they could have thought they were fucking wood elf I mean or the day that's the furry shit is the weird shit oh it's weird but fairy shit to is like I've talked to some furries cuz we're no other kid I'm sorry I'm thinking other kids shit I'm thinking of other kin shit is nuts but there's also people that identify with being a six-year-old girl I mean there's been cases where people identify as being much younger than they are and they think they just have sex with young kids so I feel like so on the transgender one I feel like for a very long time I don't think I understood it at all mm-hmm and then I think I finally got it when it was explained to me like okay imagine that you has a straight you know cisgender male if I'm so turn whatever it is don't kill the power don't do okay as we do it let's say I walk outside and I'm forced every time I go outside to wear a fucking wig and lipstick and high heels and a fucking dress right and I'd be mortified because I've is not who the fuck I am and why am I wearing this shit right so if you think the first point you made which is hey maybe they were just born with the wrong programming then they're born biologically male but they're really feel like they're a woman or vice versa so if that's the case and it's basically like torture for them to not be the other thing mm-hmm well then I kind of understand that and I'm in favor of them being able to get that surgery where they lose me not transgender people but where I get lost in this whole conversation is like the gender fluidity one mm-hmm like I was a male now I'm a woman and now I'm a man again and then a woman again and then I'm a man again just fucking idiot yeah it's like you're that person at a certain point there are things that are real and there are things that are not real and I feel like it Dee legitimizes the ones that are real yeah when you go to goofy in too far and you try to pretend like gender fluidity is a thing well isn't it what we're talking about earlier when we're talking about left-wing people versus right wing people that you in in the term left-wing people anybody can join and you're gonna get people like the green haired people that were disrupting their high speed cuz she was saying there's a difference you men and women you're gonna get those nutty fuckers and then you're gonna get people that are just reasonable people that happen to be progressive you're gonna get that with gender fluidity you're gonna get that with people that are transgender you're gonna get that with people that are you know you're just gonna get yeah a wide variety it's very difficult to nail things down decide but for like for everybody who looks at that and then gets turned off to that and says you know what I'm more with the right wing because of that culture stuff like I get that feeling over the the culture issues but again the point that I would make to them is just don't forget that when I talk about politics and when I talk about where I fall in the political spectrum to me I break it down tour policy and where I fall on the policy issues and what we should implement in order to fix the country and on those issues like we were talking about earlier pretty reliably left-wing and the poll showed that the American people actually leaned in that direction so if you focus on those issues the economic issues the substantive issues that change people's lives then you know I think that one can look at the culture issues as almost like a diversion because it really is a gateway to other ideas that I think are terrible so I think the idea of people on the Left calling out that goofiness is a good thing yes that you can redirect them and be like well this is what I actually stand for this is what people who are on the left and want to improve people's lives really want to fight for yeah well I was talking to Douglas Murray about this yesterday and there's just this thing where everyone was forced to say that Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful like you can just accept that she was bullying you were forced to say that she was beautiful and then she's a hero and that's where you get the Gateway to the right because people go if you're gonna that's what you're gonna tell me represents the left then go fuck yourself because you're just not being you're not telling the truth yeah you're not so and it's I don't I hate the thing where it's like we have to care more about feelings then what's accurate right so I don't know why there needs to be a giant wave on the left of the take no bullshit approach to stuff well I think when it comes to the transgender thing to there there you need to be open to all avenues of this discussion and one thing that I think we need to be open to we need to think very carefully about why it is that someone needs surgery to be themselves why it is that someone needs exogenous hormones that that aren't native to their biology to be themself like someone who wants to take estrogen is born a male so if you feel that you're a woman or you feel that you're in the wrong body does it make sense that nature wants you to get surgery does it make sense that nature one to to take hormones that don't exist in your body I mean is this is this is a rational area of contention and discussion this is something that people should talk about like when you say if someone is forced to wear lipstick in high heels and makeup and walking down the street but that's not who you are wouldn't that frustrate you yes it would but it doesn't necessarily conversely work where you are walking on a street without lipstick and high heels and makeup and you saying that's what I'm supposed to have well no because that's not real like lipstick is something you choose to apply high heels or something you choose to wear it's not it's no one's forcing you to not have those things on so you saying that those things are what you really are well no you're adding those things to you what you really are is you know makeup naked wake up in the morning take off your clothes that's where the fuck you really are if you say that you should have the right to wear makeup and the right to wear lip of course you should have the right just get your face tattooed like a Maori should have the right to do whatever the fuck you want but that that's who you really are that that's somehow your true self there might be an underlying psychological issue there that's relevant and to discuss that puts you in this category of being transphobic or insensitive or or right-wing I don't think that's accurate or fair because I think this is a real weird issue it's very weird and I think the only people that truly understand it are the people that are going through it themselves the people that actually have it and you know we can call upon those people to explain it to us but you get a broad spectrum of answers from those people as well what if um so what if it is kind of like depression in a way so if some if you you give chemical assistance to somebody who's going through depression everybody goes right good because you want that person to feel like they're happy and I don't necessarily even think that that's good I think exhaust all other possibilities first including exercise and diet and that's a sure sure but there but there are examples of people who do have that genuine chemical imbalance and they do but why do they have that genuine chemical imbalance I had Johan Hari on the podcast I saw that I saw that yeah and he makes a lot of really good points about like what is it that's happening in your life where is it your your your situation with your relationship your career your life your health all these different things need to be taken into considerations that are just putting some duct tape over it in the term of these SSRIs and all these different cycle medications if they're handing out just as easy as they're handing out oxycontin's their past these fucking things around here only over perfectly short radically affect your consciousness so let's say everybody has all their ducks in a row okay and they're exercising they're eating healthy they're doing everything by the book and if you look at it on paper you're supposed to go yes that person should be healthy and what's uh what's her name Oh Cara Santa Maria who you've had on the podcast before and she talks about how listen I was depressed and they tried a whole bunch of different antidepressants they finally got me on one there worked and then she says like listen I want people to understand you need to look at this like treatment look at it like you know hey I've got a fucking disease and they got to give me antibiotics in order to feel better did the problem with does is real scientists and doctors that disagree with that and I don't know if she exhausted every other possibility and Cara is she worships at the the throne of science and she thinks that this is the way to handle it and she might be right it also might be possible that if she had rigorous exercise on a daily basis cleaned up her diet and did a bunch of other things that maybe that would it be just as effective if not more I don't know sure I don't know I don't know what she's done but I think that automatically assuming that this this blanket statement called depression which could be what does that even mean you're not happy with your station in life what does that mean you're not happy with your body what does that mean I don't know what it means I mean we--you you tell me that you have it you know what it is when you have it but how do you know that what you have is the same as what that guy has with what she has or whatever right play sure we don't know but we do know is the human body reacts in very different ways when it's well fed with nutrients and when you exercise on a daily basis you flood your body with the natural endorphins that come from that exercise when you surround yourself with a loving community when you engage in things that are rewarding to you all these things have a very positive effect on the way your mind works as well as the way your body feels the way your body feels has a positive result on the way your mind works to think of either one of being independent of each other I think is ignorant it's the same thing yes your body's all the same and there's radical I'm not a depressed person but I feel way better after I exercise of course I mean we're stuck there science on that that says when you exercise running you eat right of course you're gonna get it definitely get a boost in your mood but it's hard to do and that's why I'd like to take a pill that's totally and he also like to justify their actions when people take a pill and that pills effective yeah they go well this is my thing this is what did work for me like okay but at what cost so can you orgasm anymore like there's a lot of shit happens to people that when they take those fucking things they really fuck them up sure so if you're making the point that they're over prescribed and people rely on them too much and it's part of the culture in a negative way totally agree with you yes if if we look at the example of say paranoid schizophrenia where it's somebody who literally see shit that's not there and it's a genuine psychological disorder where they need a very powerful drug like seroquel or something like that so in the case of transgenderism what if it's more analogous to a mental state that's as real as that where the it's you know what I mean like oh there's a solution surgery sexual reassignment surgery and how do we even know I don't know but then this gets back to the point you made about the personal freedom angle of Italy you know what I'm gonna do this and this is what I want to do I definitely think they should have persecuted him to do it just like they think they should have personal freedom to get their fucking nose pierced and do whatever you want to do yeah but should you have to pay for it well that's then that gets into the broader conversation about who should pay for medical coverage period right but is that is this an elective thing like how about girls identify with a girl who has big tits identify big tits and I have little tits and so your second line is fucking blurry well it's it's certainly it's the same thing it's the same thing in terms of you don't like your physical state and you want someone to change it and if you say you would be happy if you had d-cups but you have a cups and you're convinced this is the key to your happiness how is that any different than a person and you could get mad at me all you want but you're talking about the physical state sure the physical state of someone like how can you how can you say that the only way to fix this or how could you not offer that up as a possible Avenue that these people that can pursue it if you if there's any surgery that can help you and you want other people to pay for that surgery I don't care just because it's it pertains to gender does we have to automatically like we asked I don't think that's I don't think that's rational yeah and when it comes to breasts or other other various elective surgeries I strongly feel that people should pay for those themselves sure well absolutely when it comes to these the example you give about breasts right totally agree why is that different than sex change I'm not saying it is I'm not saying it is either I'm just saying if that is the case where and by the way I haven't read the science on this but I'm sure there has been science on this and they've answered the question as to whether or not doing that surgery is effective well not here's the problem there's a massive massive suicide rate it's over 40 percent so even even post operation I was gonna say am I wrong in my assumption that pre operation that's one more the suicides are versus post-op I don't think it's changes I'm pretty sure see if let's let's be accurate about this suicide rates pre post transgender sexual reassignment operations I am pretty sure that it's very similar that it doesn't change and then there's also causation versus correlation right is it because they were depressed because they were in the wrong body they let them down this road and now here they are and they just can't get past it even if they have the surgery they're still bummed out they're not accepted by society as a woman even have become a trans woman they're still not accepted by society and could that be changed by us being more open-minded and loving and right nature is it nurture is it the environment is it you know in the person I don't know what I don't need but if if it is a legitimate mental health disorder which turns to be called they used to be called gender dysphoria and now if you use the term gender dysphoria it's hate speech in terms of us talking about this might get this podcast demonetized I'm sure it will be probably well if if it is gender dysphoria then wouldn't it actually be a medical condition where the treatment should be paid for it's a good question yeah is that the correct treatment for gender just for you is that the correct treatment for someone who thinks that they should have no hand should you chop that hand off what do you think I don't know should you chop a penis off I don't know that's what I don't Caitlyn Jenner did but the most hilarious statement after she did that she said that she is no more of a woman now that she was before well then hey definitely keep your dick yeah that's a good point if you were still a woman before now which is why I did this really radical thing like no well you did admit that you did that for a reason that you really wanted to do it and now it's different I mean I don't know maybe street cred led her to have the operation to just fully get I mean she's fully accepted by that community and become a spokesperson but you know and it's funny because she's she's super right-wing on other issues remember when she went on she was like I'm a very traditional yeah like I'm sure so a lot of people in the trans community were like you know what fuck her because she was out there arguing I forget it was gay marriages wanted marriage but then there was another one where she was talking about economics and she was you know like pull yourself up by your bootstraps it's like you was privileged prick with him how much money do you have for just sitting around all day and getting paid from the Kardashians she's a male Kardashian this she always was that's fishy always was she's on that fucking frivolous ridiculous show and she became a really bizarre side note in pop culture and that's what's going on I mean when you listen to her talk she's like we're the worst spokespeople ever for the trans community and a lot of trans people say that like we don't want her as because they're you know if you trans people are individual yes so you left a look at people like they're individuals and when they when somebody's put out as this is a leader of this movement then it's like there's better examples they want the woman who created Sirius satellite radio she also created a satellite navigation system she's to be a man in fact very very brilliant person I interviewed her for sci-fi for that Joe Rogan questions everything show right she created a model of her wife who actually had babies together and then she became a woman Wow yeah and they stayed together and she she created a robot of her her wife and she's like constantly programming it and changing in and adding you know a new language and new vocabulary to it and she thinks eventually as technology improves she's going to be able to recreate her wife and a robot right by the way another great example Briona wet Westbrook what is the uncomfortable truth that many surveys including the 2011 Swedish study indicate that suicide rates remain high after sex reassignment surgery the Swedish study reports that people have had sex reassignment surgery are nine ten times more likely to die by suicide than is the general population to be fair to be fair I see the sources LifeSite News which is a very very right word that's true but the National Center for transgender equality reported in 2014 that 40% of the people identify as transgender of attempted suicide very well may be true I'm just saying that's a National Center for transgender equality or just breaking up this article here which is the study okay yeah that's true that's legit so but they're they're reporting facts from studies and I mean this is this is pretty well established that there's a high suicide rate amongst transgender pre and post reassignment surgery okay then I would go back to the same thing it doesn't necessarily mean that they couldn't be happy if they weren't just fully accepted by society I mean I don't know if it's I think Caitlyn Jenner is probably happier because she gets a shitload of attention now yeah she was in the shadow by the way now she's you know front and center fuckin Vogue magazine yeah a lot of attention speaking of people who would be a better example and a better you know face of the transgender movement Breanna Westbrook is a candidate who's running for office and there's actually a special election today and she's running for Congress and she's really inspirational I know about her because I founded justice Democrats which was a group that was gonna primary corporate Democrats and run candidates who take no corporate PAC money and she's one of the candidates and what you find is it the people who are really respectful are the people who they like she happens to be transgender but she's not putting that front and center right you know what I'm saying she's a person she's a person exactly and she's going here the things I believe in and I think this will improve everybody's lives and I'm gonna run on these issues and it's not like hey I'm transgender if you don't vote for me then you're a bigot right right right that's a very good point and I think open-mindedness is is incredibly critical in our wide diverse society and when people when people push back against that it creates all sorts of giant problems and I just think it doesn't matter you should be able to do whatever you want to do and if it doesn't affect you why do you care I think we should be really really really careful but what we do to children though and there's yeah I saw your conversation on that recently and I think you made a bunch of good points like when is it okay to to say you know what okay if you want to do the surgery now you can do the surgery well there's a there's a going back to Heather huiying and Eric Weinstein there was a article that I believe Eric none Eric I'm sorry Bret Bret Weinstein put up on his Twitter yesterday or maybe was Heather but they were discussing this this real problem with kids who are really young where it becomes a trendy thing to think that they're in the wrong gender and then they get reinforcements from there very progressive friends who also get excited about this idea and then to intervene surgically or chemically when your body still in development you're 13 or whatever the fuck you are you don't know what you are yet and you should be able to give yourself a chance to grow and develop but there's a lot of people that disagree including people that are already transgender that in my mind they're probably more supportive of it because they want more people to do it like steven crowder had this weird thing where he and Jared that guy that he does his show with went to this meeting they were talking about they just dunder cover film thing where they're talking about their six-year-old like is that too young to transition them and they're like no a matter of fact studies show that it that's the good time it's a good time to do it and that you could transition back if he changes his mind and he was like what the fuck are you talking about no you can't you're using hormone blockers in the kid you're gonna radically affect the way that kid develops as a grown adult yeah I don't know what line is the proper line adulthood adulthood leave is it 16 no no is it 21 I think it's probably 25 I think we find fully developed frontal choke the only problem I have with that is like I want I hate the fact that we have all of these different lines in society like okay you have to be this age to drink you have to be this age to do to bet you get tobacco you have to be this age for porn I think a lot of those lines are incorrect and I think science will show you that the the frontal lobe is not fully developed until you're 25 years old so but should you also not be able to vote until you yes really yes yeah I think with that why because this green-haired fuckers that were inhibiting speech they're all like 19 and goofy you're gonna look back at that video something go what the fuck was wrong with ya listen there's a lot there on their own vegetables and they have to work for a living but that's the thing is that those people are assholes - and also not that smart so we're just young you know in my mind I think we we should just draw a clean line at 16 for everything Oh God you can fight for your country oh I know what do you want to have Kylie Jenner as a fucking president cuz I don't there's a lot of them I don't want a baby kids I want to make it a baby them either but I don't think like really radical choices should be up to them when their brains not fully developed but Dean you're so you're so young you don't think why don't you first surety when did you first drink uh is definitely before I was 21 at a party I was in high school I don't know somewhere around there somewhere in your teens yeah so then should you be locked up for that no not locked up but I shouldn't be it shouldn't be legal shouldn't be able to go into a liquor store really a pint of Jack Daniels in Europe I don't like to have any age laws in Europe for alcohol and stuff right well am I wrong about that I think there is I think it's yeah maybe wine and things along like that I think first of all having things that are forbidden definitely accentuates the desire to have them we know that sure telling a kid that cigarettes are bad you can't have cigarettes they want smoked cigarettes they want to be rebels they want to drink they want to they want to do things the adults do and what age for sexual consent I mean this is we obviously can't you 25 for that right so you have to draw a reasonable line where you say okay enough people have developed to the point where they're physically mature but there's a big difference between sex which I don't think is a bad thing I think I don't think it's a disastrous thing you don't mind the different lines 2160 I wanted to have sex with each other when they like it like I think kids should be able to give you some massages a 17 year old boy and a 17 year old girl of course that should make out and they should be able to fuck if you think it's our job to responsibly educate them about birth control and about consent and about and and also you know there's different styles of parenting you know some people grow up in horrible households where the the dad's misogynist there's no mom and you know this kid's gonna have a fucked up idea what women are mmm-hmm same could be said about women or girls who grow up with a hateful mother who hates men I mean you have a lot of weird shit that you have to get over as you become an adult as you move out of the nest and you become your own person establish your own ideas based on your life experiences and education what you've learned from all the other people that you've interacted with it's not a hard fast rule but I think there's a big difference between that and voting on what happens with our future what happens with war what happens with there's so many things that a 16 year old kids is not ready for so but it's like again Mike I think my counter-argument to that is but there are a lot of fucking 68 year old idiots out there to truly and we don't try to do legitimize their vote because I think we should but anytime you have a system where you say well you're an idiot so you can't vote it's always inevitably just flip back to be used against the the poor in society so I mean fix that so well look I mean there's a great quote from Winston Churchill I think he said democracy is the worst form of government except for all others yeah that's great yeah exactly and that's like so that's kind of what we're talking about here and in terms of drawing the line I don't know I I just feel like there's something right about drawing one line and saying everything over this but I do hear you like it is true that sex is a very different thing from voting yes so yeah I don't think we should regulate sex except for adults having sex with minors I agree when I was 17 my girlfriend was 16 and I remember I turned 18 and she turned 17 and there was a criminal yeah someone told me that if we kept having sex that I would go to jails like what the fuck are you serious this is madness yes I mean we've been banging it out for 11 months now if we could stop now makes no sense yeah I was really nervous I was like what if I go to jail I don't think that works that way I don't think they put you in jail for that but yeah I remember how bad I felt when I was like in high school and I was smoking weed and I thought like but then you think about it it's like hold hold the fuck on right Bill Clinton smoke well and brocco bomb was part of the fucking tomb gang or some shit where he would what he was part of this thing called the choom gang where he would yeah look at what I mean he he would smoke weed there's picture him smoking weed on the internet he's when he's on a cigarette you sure I'm pretty sure okay because he did smoke weed a lot he admits it and then you know I think that there were charges of Bush used cocaine and then Obama said he did a little bit of cocaine and shit like that so what drives me fucking crazy is that you have these guys who did all these they know damn well that what they did at the time was just experimentation there was nothing morally wrong about it and now we have a system where we lock up fucking thousands of people millions of people over the same shit meanwhile they became president when they did that you're ruining my god I mean the eight years that he was in the office how many people were locked up for marijuana exactly exactly yeah not just not just for selling but for recreational use in certain states there were people who got who have life sentences as a result of nonviolent drug offenses yeah now to Obama's credit towards the end of his time in office he started doing Pardons and commutations of those sentences but the thing that drives me crazy again to get back to one of my main points here is I hate the fucking incrementalism and gradualism moving towards the thing that we all know is the right answer we all know the right answer is to legalize it and fucking let every single nonviolent drug offender out of prison and fuckin apologize to him not only that the hypocritical nature of having all this coincide with the pharmaceutical industry selling the Lloyds that are killing people at a radical rate while they take contributions from it's fucking crazy I mean they're literally a part of a drug-dealing enterprise I remember my grandma on my dad's side I remember she passed away a while ago but I would go to her place and look at her fucking medicine thing there were 70 different kinds of pills mm-hmm I was like holy fuck she's getting zonked out of her mine on a regular basis like that's the whole point of it and I'm not even begrudging an older person who's like fucking I'm checking out unless you give me all the pills you want right but my point is if you're gonna if that's gonna be the mentality for them why the fuck would you lock up poor people for smoking weed or doing cocaine or whatever the case is yeah I don't think anybody could rationally argue that I mean it just seems at this stage of the game especially when it comes to things that are non-toxic or non-fatal things like marijuana or kratom there's no argument against it doesn't make any sense especially when you could go right down the street you could go to the CVS and buy enough liquor to kill yourself instantly exactly easily easily right here that that table right over there will kill you yeah if you drink all that for sure yeah if there's a table over there with a big bottle of gentleman's Jack there's a couple of bottles of whiskey there's some whiskey from someplace in Bakersfield and a big jug of wine dead drink all that dead hundred percent so sorry to change topics roughly but I'm from New York the bagels here fucking terrible yeah is that the water I don't know yes I was like this isn't a bagel this is like a fucking piece of stale bread yeah I think it's the water I think it's the moisture in the air too and wonder if the bagels are better in Seattle is it moisture up there right it's wet and then I'm gonna try to fix it I'm gonna try the pizza I think today here don't do it I'm gonna do I got a compare man I'm gonna compare my whole life I heard like where do you live now and you live in the city no I live just outside of the city I live in Westchester County still but not nourish shell anymore yeah it's better pizza for sure do used to go to Nicky's pizza on Street from I've been there once but there's one next to that called Mario's have you ever been there I don't think so no executive billiards if you walked out of executive and take a right in White Plains Niki's was on the right-hand side but I heard Nicky's burnt down okay Nicky's had I only never had white pizza before till I went to Niki's and I had white Pete's I'm like holy shit this is one of the greatest things humans have ever created when you were there were there that was there the strip of bars developed yet on my plane in in my plane sir no it's hard to remember there was some bars there for sure but all dive bars and shit all we would do is go play pool yeah yeah you know there it is Nicky's is it still there it's still there I think it's still the signs what's that stickers on the door why is that shit on the door the right to the right of that looks like there's like closed down yeah I mean I was there like two years ago so I mean it could have could have closed since then I think that's Mario's pizza in White Plains is the you have the trial it is open so it is open yeah they do so they must have did it burn down and they rebuilt it because that was yellow tape over the door like police tape oh yeah they cleaned it up fucking John damn if they have the same recipe run do not walk run the Nicky's and get some of that white pizza or any other pizza so speaking of your crazy stories about at executive billiards and all the crazy characters you met there my friend Korn and I we when we were in high school we would go play poker at these basically underground spots in nura shell and they were either rounders like the movie with Matt Damon kind of but they weren't Russian they were either like weird weird fake mafioso dudes or real mafioso dudes we couldn't tell difference we didn't know cuz they all talk like this and they're like hey Jimmy give me a fucking Diet Coke in right all they would do is sit there and smoke cigarettes the whole time and so we played cards there and you know we had some friends who did well and me and my friend probably lost money overall but there was years later I was watching I turn on the TV just happened to be a local news report learned that one of the guys who was there got his fucking hand chopped off right in front of the place and I was like well we were in over our fucking heads now where are we we were in high school I know why the Chavez head off for stealing I'm sure I'm sure they were real mafia mafia guys and there was some shortened you know that's dark chopping a person's hand off his fuck yeah what did they gave it to him here go get his head back on bitch but what's funny is they were fucking even though they're mafia guys they were fucking like they were really nice to us and a lot of mafia people who were gentlemen the thing is like you just can't be in the wrong situation you can't owe the money you can't be in a situation where they can get money out of you or they can extort money from you you know yeah if you were running a business or anything where they offered you protection or any of that kind of shit like you're fucked man and that's why gambling should be fucking legal because it's illegal push it underground now those guys run it and they work at their fucking hands chopped off right yeah well yeah in Vegas they just what do they do it kick your ass put you in jail then the Vegas used to run the mob or the mob rather you should've a used to run fun everything yeah even half a fucking Hollywood I'm sure was financed with mobster money well you know we've talked about that many times at Ciro's nightclub was owned by Bugsy Siegel that's the Comedy Store there you go yeah that used to be a total mob run joint and to this day I haven't I don't believe in ghosts but I go to the belly room I've gone to the belly room several times with my friends like over the 20 years that I've been there we go bar when it's dark just stand there what do you think the only thing I'm fucking scared fuck me I don't believe in ghosts at all but I think energy is real and I don't know whether we created in our own mind where we look at something and we're like I feel weird looking at because any rooms give you a feel you walk into a room you get feel off the route well people have been murdered there for sure and that's the thought process about that place is that there's probably some leftover weird vibes and I know a lot of people that have seen weird shit there but I don't know if I believe them they say they've seen weird shit I know Tony Hinchcliffe I saw the podcast rooms like I saw a ghost maybe show you know Tony I love you but I was at home going fuck off Tony I've never seen a ghost there but I felt weird like I said I've gone into the main room when it's dark at night and I'll be gone by myself and shit my pants out of here but I definitely believe people are murdered there there used to be a tunnel that would go from the back of the comic store all the way up to crest Hill which is a street above the comedy store that the comedy store used to own I think they bought the two of them together and you it was like a tunnel well they take booze and dead people and shit and fucking scoot them up there and throw them in the back of a trunk I don't know it's a fun thing to talk about when you look at like all those TV shows that like haunted Hollywood The Comedy Store is very high on the list I have you ever seen that like the paranormal fucking Ghost Hunters so stupid goofy is shows ever it's like dark in a hallway they were running like shit I think I'm over here the biggest like cock tease of a show I know Oh remember John John Edward the guy and then he tried to do it with 9/11 victims they were like fuck you now you're cancelled yeah that's right I used to do it up until that time but I don't like how the fuck dude network executives approve shows where it's like the fucking Long Island medium or some shit and it's like they pretend to talk to the dead how the fuck you gonna put that on daytime TV like it's not complete another horseshit well that was one of the problems that happened when I was doing that sci-fi show that Joe Rogan questions everything showed they wanted to make sure that I wasn't out to debunk a lot of the shows they would have on the network and I go look I just want to find out what's going on I want it I go some of it's probably real I want it to be real yeah that was an eye-opening experience doing that show is very eye-opening because I realized what kind of people are really into these things they're just whimsical hopeful people that don't have much going on they want it to be real that there's a ten-foot tall furry man living in the forest or that aliens come down and suck people out of their beds and bring them through walls in the middle of the night and all that shit well you really took it to the chemtrail people yeah that's poor Fox well they despise you now man you're fucking chill geoengineering is real bro what does Alex Jones say to you cuz I know you're friends with him what does he say to you about chemtrails do I convince you no he thinks that most of what you see according to him but I see Alex he goes with the weather a little bit too he thinks most of what you see is just condensation trails that happen when you have a jet engine and you have the cold air and condensation in the atmosphere and the that's what they are I mean you're yeah there are artificial clouds that are created by a jet engine passing through the air that's what they are you can do it over and over again you could do it right now the idea that they're spraying something and that something happens to have aluminum and barium in it but it also looks exactly a cloud no that's moisture the reason why it looks like a cloud is because it's a fucking cloud and one of the things that I said in the chemtrail thing ugly you want to talk about real chemtrails here's the real chem trail they're burning gasoline in the sky above your head every day to turn to the tune of thousands of flights you're not concentrating on that instead you're concentrating on the natural reaction of jet engines and moisture in the air it's so stupid I don't get because there's a thing that people do where it's almost like they're trying to find the worst possible fucking argument and then that's the part of it that they get obsessive and this goes back to the thing about Trump where I told you on CNN all they did for an hour in a fucking half was talking about Russia and it's like I'm sitting there going I just covered a story on my show last week about how the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a guy named Mick Mulvaney he took over $50,000 from the predatory payday loan industry Donald Trump at his inauguration took over a million dollars from the predatory payday loan industry they just scrapped the rules that were supposed to clean up that industry and now they're letting them charge nine hundred and fifty percent Interest you want the fucking conspiracy there it is right there and you're not talking about Putin if you're Russia he's a fucking Manchurian Candidate loud noises and he curses a lot and fucking stormy Daniels I don't give a fuck about any of that talk about the shit that mattered I care about stormy no I do wonder what's gonna happen with the indictments I do wonder so his people are pleading guilty now and you know the concern is that it's gonna trickle so here's the thing here's the thing is Donald Trump a corrupt businessman fuck yes anybody who says he's not has no fucking idea what this guy's been into there's evidence he did deals with the Mafia he has a hotel in Panama which was laundering drug money so do I think he's a criminal yes do I think he did money laundering yes would it be good if Muller somehow got him on these things of course it would be but the idea that he's a Manchurian Candidate or he did treason is so ridiculous that it makes me a guy who's massively anti Trump scoff and get really angry when people try to push that narrative and here's the thing there's it's an open legal question as to whether or not you can indict a sitting president usually what has to happen is you have to impeach a sitting president well right now Congress is overwhelmingly Republican you know who's not gonna fucking impeach Donald Trump even if they prove the worst case scenario that he's some sort of Manchurian Candidate the Republicans are not gonna fucking impeach him so at the end of the day when the Democrats focus on this ad nauseam the reason they're doing that is because it's something that they feel comfortable and safe talking about because they don't have to talk about medicare-for-all or free college or a living wage or getting the corporate money out of politics or ending the fucking wars which they also support so they're not talking about real issues and they're focusing on this the fake scandal and sensationalism because they think it will score them cheap points with the electorate and it won't and they think there's an end game here and there's not but there is something there right I mean if yes people are worried but if people are getting indicted I'm sure there's a Russia thing so I'll break that down Paul Manafort is one of the people who got indicted right SuperDuper corrupt laundering money Michael Flynn saving money how so so in the case I know more of the details about Flynn so Flynn is a guy he got what's-his-face Muller went after Flynn and it was proven that Flynn took $500,000 from the Turkish government and in return for that he pushed the Trump administration to not arm the Kurds who are fighting Isis and the reason why is because turkey hates the Kurds and they don't want us to arm the Kurds so in other words Michael Flynn was doing the bidding of the Turkish government and pushing their influence in our government and he didn't register as a foreign agent in the process so exactly so he's doing the bidding of the Turkish government and not disclosing that and you have to register as a foreign agent if you're gonna take that money and you're gonna do that and this doesn't run down the Trump well that's the open question as to whether or not at some point along the way whether it's with Russia or with other countries by the way nobody talks about the fact that Trump registered eight new businesses in Saudi Arabia when he was on the campaign trail and then he just gave them over a hundred billion dollar weapons deal he also took two hundred and seventy thousand dollars from top Saudi officials at his hotel when he was president-elect and then again he gave him over a hundred billion dollar weapons deal the case of Israel Jared Kushner has you know millions of dollars from Israeli banks and then lo and behold when Donald Trump was president-elect they tried to push the UN to not condemn Israel over their illegal settlements so you have his entire administration is just a grab bag of corruption and foreign influence say but it's far influence across the board and its influence also from corporations but again people are not focusing on the corporations and they're not focusing on the other countries that they're corrupted with because they're a hyper focusing on the Russia thing and at the end of the day they want to impeach Trump over Russia but like I said it's gonna be hard to prove and then it's an open question if you can indict I don't think you can indict a sitting president you have to impeach they're not gonna fucking impeach so really this is Democrats sniffing their own farts and acting like they're doing something important when they're really not and the only they're there in my opinion is money laundering he's a corrupt businessman but he's not some sort of Putin puppet because he's actually done many policies there against Putin so for example he armed Ukrainian rebels who are fighting Russia right now you don't arm people who are fighting Russia if you're their fucking puppet you know he also is bombing Syria and we're staying indefinitely in Syria they just announced that recently you don't that Syria the Syrian government that's one of Putin's top allies you're not gonna permanently occupy their country and try to fight that government if you're in bed they're doing a NATO buildup on Russia's border right now so if you're if you're at Putin's puppet you don't have a let's Harry buildup on his border there was just a story the other day about how now the u.s. our military sending our ships to the Black Sea right on Russia's fucking border so it's military escalation and that's another part of this that pisses me off is that if the Democrats really wanted to resist Trump resist that see I don't want to send our fucking military to get into a standoff with Russia I don't want to bomb fucking Syria and permanently occupy it this is how the Democrats should be resisting they should be resisting Trump from a left-wing position from an anti interventionist position but instead everything you hear from the Democrats is he's under pootis thumb and he needs to make sure that he's even harder on Putin and he does more sanctions against Putin and he escalates further with Russia listen man they're a nuclear-armed power do you want to fucking get into a confrontation with a nuclear-armed power we're sitting here living our lives just going about our business and we're this is I mean this is crazy we're rolling the dice and we're playing a game of chicken with Vladimir Putin do you think that they're just caught up in this sexy thing yes a lot of it is sensationalism I see it's also what the public is really focused on right now so it's something that gathers ratings I think they're driving it hmm I think it's driven from the top down from the establish from the media down from the Democrats down because again if you talk to regular people they're fucking hurting right wages have been stagnant since 1980 there's 30 million people that don't have health care in Trump's first year in office three million more people lost health care because he did all these executive orders that basically took a hatchet to Obamacare so you have all these people who are really hurting they're they care about their wages they care about you know not being saddled with over a trillion dollars in student loan debt this is the shit regular people care about so if when they turn on CNN and they see Russia Russia Russia even if you don't like Trump I despise Trump with every fiber of my fucking being but when I see this I roll my fucking eyes and then they have the nerve to say Oh Trump won't shut up about Russia you were talking about it all day and he responded to it and because he responds it to it you're like oh there he goes again with Russia yeah it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this all plays out I'm really fascinated and I'm fasting to see if he can make it out of for years well not only well I think he's gonna do you think he's gonna run might be he's gonna run again and he's gonna win again he has a chance it has a fucking chance because if the Democrats run Kamala if they run Cory Booker or any of the other corporatists he can win because he's gonna go right back into his tap-dance about being a populist and helping people and guess what in the first few years of his tax bill regular people did get a tax cut so he's gonna say looking look at your tax bill I just gave you no extra thousand dollars this year who you want to vote for and so there is an argument that he's gonna make to the people and if you don't have somebody like Bernie Sanders or Bernie Sanders talking about the issues that matter to people well then of course he can fucking win again listen there there was I was laughed at when I said if it's Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton he can win people laughed at me because I didn't want it didn't want it to be true because yeah cuz in the narrative story yeah all you saw was that there was like a 75% chance that Hillary was gonna win the fucking Huffington Post one was over 99 percent so silly I know though and the way they calculate they have such good articles too they sprinkle in great articles well usually horseshit the trick is avoid the opinion section and but if but if you stick to the actual journalists yeah and then they do a good job it's gotta be embarrassing for them all for the journalists yeah they're like you guys are fucking shitting all over the hard work that I do yeah Kyle it's been a lot of fun man this has been a lot of fun I really really let's do it again Oh anytime Thanks tell everybody where they can find show Oh youtube.com slash secular talk and if you want to follow me on Twitter it's at Kyle kolinsky boom
