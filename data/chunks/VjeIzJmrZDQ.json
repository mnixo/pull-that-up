about coming on this show is because this show is democracy in action you have millions of fucking people listening and guess what unless we say something unless we wake up from our valium and booze do stupor nothing's gonna fucking happen so why the fuck are you doing it that's the question you should ask yourself in 2015 not am I gonna lose weight now I'm gonna read more fucking books not am I gonna go where Skechers instead of Nikes it should be why the fuck do I get up in the fucking morning and now we're very lucky motherfuckers that were post economic and we can fucking say I'm gonna get up in the morning cuz of this I like how the 1% has relabeled themselves post economic well I'm the newest I'm the newest of the 1% and I'm giving it all away cuz I'll tell you one thing money means a fuck of a lot when you don't have it but my old man gave told me the only thing that ever made any sense about money he said life is like a shit sandwich the more bread you have less she have to eat but once you get it once you get that a-plus you just say fucking you know what I'd like to do I would like to buy 20 million acres and say no one's allowed to fuck with that you can't fucking do shit with that fucking land I'm just gonna fucking leave it because that's one of the only things you can do that's a pure good just leave the land don't fucking mine it don't fucking piss in it don't shit in it don't put Joe's tuna Birds and tequila boom-boom room in there just leave it fucking gorgeous because fucking that's that's that's Godhead to me is nature yeah and I'm telling you if you think your wife has been happy when you've called before/after fucking three days in the road not being able to call you've never heard you tell a girl oh I was wrong you don't have herpes they get elated overcome with joy now do you think maybe you should have just waited to the results came back but yeah sure I mean he just lied he wanted to fuck somebody else in the meantime and then while I'm waiting to decide some other guys life is ruined well I heard this is as well suck it up and take my lumps also on the other level I figured I could tell them I'm 90% sure is like a cop-out so I'm not like fully saying look I have it we fucked I thought that from what I understood when I got tested was that you can only test herpes while the outbreaks happen they actually actually spoon a little out of the the out birth that like you can't really it's really hard to test for herpes so a lot of times you can get tested during not an outbreak and be like oh yeah anyway that's just positive for herpes no I think I was an old test I think I was like 15 years ago test they need olympic-style or every stuff serious overcome this boy and like you could actually taste it yeah it's like a sweetness how many different fucking puss was you eyes before herpes is like I got it yeah you can't just taste it once how much ado that was Sauvignon Blanc this person's had it for a while and well I think that you know with civilization part of another inherent component of civilization is you have to be better than someone else you know and so I of the things that we do are are ways of delineating ourselves from sap like what we would call savages or more primitive people like you wore shoes you didn't want your skin to be too dark or tan you you know you wanted to show that you had more affluence that you weren't as barbaric you didn't have to poop on it you could just poop it and push it flusher and it went away and like it just just comes soft hands and a cultured demeanor yeah you were less less animal you were less animal when you're trying to be more animal the word is primitive I am a primate yeah what advancements a society make that you think has society made that you think are beneficial well gosh I mean I think medicine is benefit I mean I think everything is beneficial it's just that what I'm more concerned of about is what's what has been what is no longer needed that is still essential so it's it's my I don't have really an aversion against civilization and technology it's just that vitamin C is still necessary like we can't get around the fact that vitamin C is still necessary so I'm just trying to figure out diseases so when you're trying to figure out diseases you have to kind of boil down to could this disease be arising because some non input some essential input that we're not getting and so as people get more and more advanced the our our health again in the terms of biological sense isn't getting better with us and so what happens to a species that advances itself right out of being a species you know like that that's that's more what I'm I'm interested in so I like it all I like all technology Netflix Netflix might be my favorite technology
