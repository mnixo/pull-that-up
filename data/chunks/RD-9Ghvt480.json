they [Music] [Music] episode 13 13 ladies and gentlemen that's a it's a number it's a very important number very important tell me why why 1330 is important yes well we got two 13s back to back so it doubles the normal potency of 13 which is already a mystical number which terrifies people in the West it gets unlucky but in Tibetan Buddhism it's considered a very lucky and auspicious number yeah I was staying in a hotel in Vegas they have no 13th floor and I don't think they had a fourth floor either the fourth yeah there's something about some cultures the number four is unlucky how many cultures do we get to influence our buildings these days that's what's crazy and what's crazier is at some point someone convinced a person listen can we just not do a 13th floor and they listened to him oh my god I guess we'll just go from 12 to 14 Shooter Jennings has it in a song when I check into 1410 I know what room I'm really in yeah yeah well you know what that's what's so funny about it is because like that's the whole problem isn't it it's like people want to pretend they're not in the 13th floor when they fucking know they are just acknowledging this is where I'm at no no no we're in the 14 we're 14 14 called the 14th floor just call it and they'll be that dude I went when I was in college we had to do service for like to get the degree you had to go do you like service overseas so we went to India to Dharamsala and we taught the monks English and I was sitting with like listening over hearing a monk and a conversation with someone teaching him English and the person's trying to explain to him how there isn't a 13th floor in buildings in the West and the monk was like does it will have at 8 - how do they do he was genuinely perplexed it was like a magical thing yeah in a culture that forces its citizens if they want to run the country you have to believe in something that whether you're a Christian or whether you're a Baptist or Mormon whatever you whatever you are there's certain parts of your religion that if you just don't want to analyze them just want to put them out on paper and say okay did this really happen did this guy really die and come back to life is everybody agreeing on this and everyone's agreeing that a zombie a guy became a zombie and he came back three days later and we're cool with that this is a part of the doctrine so there's like a part of running the country you I don't think you can be an atheist in this country I don't think we would let you run it to be you have to I think you do have to have some affiliation with some religion or another problem yeah and it right now it seems to be like it needs to be Christianity like there needs to be like every president that has aligned himself so it's like we're trapped in this this thing that you are when you're young you know this thing you are when you're young where you're looking at the people that are older than you you're looking at society and you're like 16 you're just starting to think god damn I'll be graduating from high school soon what am I gonna do with my life you know it's you filled with so much angst yeah but you always think yeah this shit doesn't make any sense but one day it will and one day we'll be the grown-ups yeah and we'll be the ones that get to make the rules and we'll go hey this is we're doing things all wrong folks we're doing things out of momentum rather than out of logic but that time never comes and then all sudden you're like you or I were you're middle-aged we're middle-aged men I'm a 51 year old Manimal 52 we're middle-aged if we're lucky if we're super lucky reality we're closer to death yeah for sure sure so and we're still trapped by this thing where you you have to pretend you absolutely no look live your life like Jesus is real live your life like you want to follow those tenets and you'll probably live a better life if you really follow the actual true tenets of Christianity if you really want to believe that guy came back to life and it only happened once and that you have to follow this book yeah if you don't follow this book that was clearly written and rewritten and fucked with by people and you know that people are known liars yeah like why do we have court cuz people lie what really happened you have to fucking get a bunch of people to sit down and figure out what really happened this guy said I didn't do anything your honor yeah and they got prints and DNA and in in that world of known liars we believe a crazy story that was written when people had no science but we accept it because we think it makes the world a better place yeah man it's nuts and there's like so many levels of that where it's like yeah that's one obvious level that if you want to take Jesus literally which is you have to in certain forms of Christianity you're gonna have to deal with some pretty severe cognitive dissonance you'll be taught maybe to question your instincts but then go one step deeper and start thinking because the real question is what is real like I mean the author's obvious shit that's clearly bullshit yeah but wait then when you start going down you realize like you get to the point of the self mm-hmm and then you start realizing that the self and this Jesus that everyone believes and are very similar in the sense that like you know I don't say I believe in gravity you would think I was crazy if I said it would be a crazy thing to say look you know I believe there's gravity there is gravity it's testable it works but what do you always hear when people are like if you want to succeed what do you do you believe in yourself and it's like wait what do you mean believe in yourself I am myself why do I have to believe in it right so that's it it's a clunky way of saying self-doubt is crippling well the self doubt self you know rejection I hate myself I love myself all these things have within it this concept of the self and a lot of folks have not spent much time really exploring like well what is that what is the self like what is my particular self and I think it kind of IVF when we are Sasquatch hi me you know this self or that many people's self is very similar to Bigfoot yeah it's a thing that they imagine that there's signs of but they've never really quite seen the Bigfoot you know right but you know remember the feather in the trail it's a gift it means he likes you yeah they were thinking sasquatches were taking and leaving gifts taking their gifts and leaving their own gift swapping gifts yeah yeah and we relieved it they believed they believed it the same way people believe in a religion you know yeah I had a friend and she was a Mormon I've told the story before so forgive me if you've heard it she was a Mormon but I think it's important and she was a devout her whole life and then the family just fell out of it and then they started realizing like they started going into the history of it and they started thinking it was preposterous it was right around when Book of Mormon was coming out too you know that hilarious musical ends here it's great it's really good but she was really honest about she was like the problem is like growing up in that fundamentalist background it makes me very susceptible to like healers and like psychics and clairvoyance and bullshit are spiritual people she's like I get sucked in to bullsháá and she was like almost kind of upset yeah no not almost like she was kind of upset but like perplexed like how do you rewire yourself when you've been trained to believe that a fourteen-year-old boy in 1820 found golden tablets that contained a lost work of Jesus and all the Native Americans were The Lost Tribe of Israel oh my god I mean this is that's the story fourteen-year-old boy he had a magic Rock he was only one who could read it it's crazy she started looking into it and she she's out yeah gone and that's sad too man because like if you take you could take some like basic tenets which are true and not based on it kind of reminds me of like you know you hear someone he's taking ayahuasca and he comes to you and he's got a profound message that came to him from some mythological creature a dragon a butterfly has told him some kind of profound fucking thing and you realize oh the bubble machine of profundity got a bubble machine for thirteen thirteen oh yeah whenever we're talking about let's keep it rollin the yeah the so you know caught up in popping them though yeah when yeah I know that's a problem too high you're like John what do we do it was pop bubbles the bubbles fly it's like for them to really like take in the basic wisdom they got from the mythological creature they needed a mythological creature the mythological creature said something to them along the lines of you need to love yourself more you need to give more to your community whatever the message is but if you're a bird driver said that to you it wouldn't get through because it wasn't like phosphorescent do you have multiple heads so similarly with these religions what happens is you do get some real transcendent wisdom that's sort of timeless mixed in with it and then the people because they realize like oh my god it was kind of a fairy tale they also reject the good stuff inside of it and that to me is the big tragedy of any kind of fundamentalist literalist interpretation that's being forced on people is because within that is inevitably something great where it wouldn't be so viral like Christianity wouldn't be here right now if there wasn't a core thread in it that had a beautiful message in it it makes people nicer people I actually had a really big conversation this weekend with a very good friend about it about another very good friend who's very religious and we were saying like I think for some people it's an amazing framework and a guide to live your life I really do believe that I have several friends they're very devout Christians yeah it's beautiful and they they're the nicest people I know in Mormons by the way I have friends that are Mormons still to this day I have several friends that are Mormons and they're some of the nicest people yeah and I don't care if they believe something that I don't believe in it's okay it's okay it is okay but I mean the idea that everyone is supposed to buy into stuff without questioning it is the reason why we are 51 year old 16 year olds dude I agree and then there's the deeper symbolic shit it seems to be encoded in Christianity whether from people their own understanding on a pretty wild cymbal set or maybe it was intentional either way there's like a cool like you know the if we talked about this like if you take a cube and unfold it it makes a crucifix and like the cube represents pre-big bang conditions whoa and the crucifix represents past present and future intersecting with eternity and so if you have a square oh I get it so the length the height is twice as the width yeah okay make it unfolds into a crucifix for people that are annoyed with that sound it sounds like a pencil sharpening over and over and over again we're sorry sorry about that y'all but bubbles don't come free you need we could hire somebody hire some dude just blow bubbles what do you got blow bubbles on the JRE bro some like fucking manly wrestler dude yeah different people come in and blow bubbles and occasionally HR man hey I'm gonna be on the Jerry next week what are you doing I'm blowing bubbles oh cool you're the bubble blower for the week you could start something that became like that's just what people do it's like did you get your bubble man yet right yeah I'm a classic bubble man I know how to do it the new guys they're too loud when they blow well it did Johnny Carson was Ed McMahon the first sidekick what did Jack Paar have a sidekick I don't know yeah well how many options were before that Ed Sullivan and well there was the other guy Steve Allen I think Steve Allen might have been the first was he the first Tonight Show of the second Tonight Show yeah but I think that Ed McMahon was probably the first sidekick and once they had a psyche people like oh yeah yeah you need a sidekick yeah you need somebody to play that part because you can bounce stuff off of them it's so right the reaction yeah so much better than a laugh track yeah yeah yeah so Christianity it's on one level are you fucking kidding me it's like and I had this nerdy part of me man when your that Jesus is a zombie thing mm-hmm I really wanted evil technically not a zombie no a zombie I don't think so because he was buried right like it's not like he did come back to life but this is there's a move in jujitsu called the zombie yeah and what the zombie is is when you're in Mission Control and you're trying to get an underhook you push your hand through like a zombie rising through the ground so zombies get buried yeah but I guess you know I don't want to get into like why not let's break it up so what is is not like when when is it just a person who's like severely disabled and when it is a zombie well you know what I mean like is it well they're dead or dead they die their heart stops beating but the doctor says they're dead you would be like a complete asshole if you're like they have this they have the same intelligence as humans they're clearly there's some brain damage it's happened to a zombie right it's in most movies it's a person with brain damage is there any zombie movies were there smart I've met that just every movie yeah but I guarantee like there's there's zombies movies where they run fast that was an evolution of the zombie it started running the zombie became like kind of like hyper violent mm-hmm and then but still I guess what they all have in common is that they're technically they're dead in the sense they don't have a heartbeat they're not dead like a biologist would be like the zombie is alive right it's just like a fungus now it's running through a parasite inside of it essentially yeah it's some kind of fungus rabies yeah some new rabies or got biome problem but what's the the 28 days later is that it yeah that was the first one when they ran yeah now the scary is good fucking awesome running zombie was so good so good and cuz it was also shaky like when the zombies were chasing after you you'd fucking panic because the screen was shaking when it was running at you they were the first like Berserker zombies you know man all this gut biome stuff that we're hearing now like the this study I just read about the study today like they found out that what the gut biome what you're feeding your your baby affects their but like there seems to be a correlation between their gut biome and the way they act when they're like five or something there are two years old or something dude and the autism link you know where they're saying they think autism might be related to like well who's saying that Jamie would you mind pulling that out far if there's a guy named dr. Peter Hotez and he was on the podcast and he is an expert in autism and vaccines and diseases in foreign countries particularly tropical diseases and warm moist climate disease yeah and he was talking about how they've got it narrowed down to five environmental factors that happened during the womb that they think possibly contribute to autism yeah but they don't think that it comes from something that happens later huh this is current science according to him obviously I don't know what I'm talking about like for sure I'm not a biologist at all people looking at us are probably like how do these scientists not know this I should barely be able to say those words in order you can't pretend like I know what they mean but I listen to expert mothers microbiome the collection of microscopic organisms that lives inside of us is a key contributor to the risk of autism something that might be one of the factors so it's during the womb and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring well it would make sense that if your body's not getting the proper nutrition and your body's not healthy that whatever is going on inside of you is not going to be in the best environment for a baby to reach a hundred percent health it just makes sense if you're eating terrible yeah while you're pregnant it's not going to be good for the kid but if you're eating really well and you're relaxing and taking care of yourself it's probably better for the kid I mean this seems like obvious it doesn't seem to make any sense that it that wouldn't be the case I think the weird part of it to me it this runs in the like ideas of free will or like autonomy in the sense that how much is the gut and the neurons and the gut and the neurons and the heart and all the interactions they're having with things that have different DNA than ice mm-hmm affecting what we do and like they DeLong that's so weird he contributes a depression yeah yeah and it contributes to what else autism what other behaviors are in other words are we just essentially being driven around by some kind of strange microscopic hive of creatures living in our shit in some way yeah right you know Bryan Callen had a pretty bad case of like of psoriasis kept coming back nasty really bothered him tried a bunch of stuff couldn't get it fixed went to one doctor who's a specialist a specialist in gut biome its connection to autoimmune disorders I think I fixed him up just changed up his probiotics like what he's taking prebiotics and probiotics gave him some like heavy-duty shit I forget exactly what he said but it fixed it and it was basically something going on his gut biome and that can be affected by stress yeah could be affected by lack of sleep there's all sorts of stuff that goes on in your body like we have to think of ourselves as a suit like a super organism like essentially like an ecosystem we have to think of ourselves as like you you think of yourself as you hey it's me it's Jo it's Duncan we're talking we're friends hey what's up buddy but really what we are is the keepers of the realm okay we got a whole realm of things living inside of our body and we're feeding it Twinkies and it's freaking out it's like you fucking moron yeah but it like what it feels like when Twinkies go in my face your fucking knees hurt all the time yeah your back is killing you you have all these inflammation problems getting zits and you're 40 years old like what the fuck because you're eating dog shit man you're not giving your body thing anything good you're the keeper of the realm and also this is something I've been thinking about it's like how much data were eating which is equivalent to Twinkies it's like you eat a bunch of Twinkies your body starts hurting then you're just slurping up whatever the fuck on the phone right which I by the way I'm talking about me this is what I do you know my bouncing around from like Drudge Report to Huffington report to Reddit conspiracy to Reddit what the fuck zip poppy how long before you're looking at like a zip video and then that takes you down into a place of like oh let's just move to animal cysts and then boot and then you fall asleep you wake up screaming yeah and that's the equivalent of getting like gasps isn't it from eating like a huge Taco Bell meal instead of farting you're just just screaming in the middle of the night because you dreamed a cult was dragging you into the forest it's like this is to me we seem to have not quite acknowledged that data is as much of is like a food and that so much of the weirdness that is people are showing these like strange behaviors it's gotta be because of the crazy shit they're sucking into their optic nerves right is it's also the ability to affect people Vick very rapidly whether to get a reaction from someone positive or negative people are so addicted to that yeah I watch people getting these Twitter beefs back and forth and yeah fucking smart people man a smart friend of mine who I respect greatly tried to get me to retweet something mean that he was saying to someone else my kid that fucking out of here like wow what are you doing yeah like what are you doing with your time we get the one thing that I've done over the last week we did a podcast with Bert and Tom and Ari and we all looked at the amount of screen time we put on our phone because Ari was proposing no smart phones yeah um my fucking screen time was like four hours for a day I was like what and I'll lie to myself and almost let's email and taking care of business most of it is going through Google newsfeed looking for crazy stories of like animal attacks man I watched a video today of a guy riding his dirt bike in a bear's chasing them I'm like what in the fuck what is happening look man I don't want to try to like enable your addiction but honestly I think the Internet has come to depend on your wild animal attack videos like you have kind of become like a news outlet for the best wild animal attacks people need to know people need to see this shit man like we don't know I've never seen a vulture fighter rabid or out it people do have a very weird idea of what animals are and I think that of the average person I'm certainly no expert but amongst the average person I have much better understanding of wildlife because I'm out in the wild yeah several times a year hunting it's a different world it's a different world I'm no expert but my perception of it is as someone who sees wildlife in in the wild they see dead ones that other ones have killed we came across a calf that had been ripped apart by wolves I mean we see stuff and you realized what that is what that what that fucking forest really is it's this competing ecosystem of life and it's going on all the time and there's big things jacking smaller things and there's birds snatching things off the ground and snatching other birds out of trees and it's happening all the time and it's magic and you have to have it that way because otherwise the whole population the planet would be overrun you have to have your sorrow of watching the bear tear apart the fawn that has to happen because if it didn't happen you'd have too many fawns they'd be everywhere you'd have too many deer and you have to have someone who can take care of the Bears otherwise the Bears will overrun the city where the humans live and we need to think about that and people don't want to because they don't want to shoot yogi they don't want to shoot Yogi and boo-boo they're our friends this is a teddy bear I grew up with a bear you don't know what a bear is I've seen a bear in the wild when you see the bear in the wild you're like oh you're you don't give a fuck about me you're some weird heartless beast that is majestic looking who runs around eating moose and deer babies that's what your deal is you eat grass and berries and you like to lay around your fucking cool shit it's a cool ass animal yeah it doesn't mean you hate it but you got to understand what the fuck it is it's not like this ideally people don't want people to hunt bears in certain places like particularly like they're they're they're trying to regulate the size of the amount of grizzly bears in certain parts of the country they look hey we we need to keep a handle on this like a couple people get mauled you know people start walking through Yellowstone and get attacked it happens like a little bit more rapidly the numbers get to a certain and they're like these things have no fear of people like we can actually help the population if they hand out bear tags and people start freaking out you can't kill the bears you can't kill the bears don't you kill the bear there's a reason why there's no fucking bears in California Duncan only black bears without our fucking state flag has a grizzly bear on it you ever noticed that yeah the state flags agree they eradicated all the grizzly bears because they were eating people so in the fucking 1800s dude there's a town I think it's called Levesque I think it's called Levesque it's out near like on the way to Bakersfield yeah lebec Lebec I think it's called Lebec it's a town named after the last dude that got killed by a grizzly bear in California yeah and to investigate this thing exhumed his body and his legs were fucking ripped apart like his you know needs were snapped in half and shit you have to destroy this tape he got torn apart by a bear and they killed the bear and they buried him and that was the last bear there was the last bear attack they they killed all the bears the reason why they killed all the bears cuz that's what you have to do you fuck you want to be able to walk to your car yeah see you you don't want bears in Santa Monica okay shut up just shut up we're going into their territory man they'll come into yours too okay stop don't be silly we definitely shouldn't kill all the bears push to kill a few should definitely kill some should kill some wolves too I need you we have to keep everything alive I'm gonna bring back pterodactyls I wouldn't mind that snatching people right off of cars well come on they could be controlled come on they could be controlled put them in a some kind of domed I don't know another bullet dome we never knew there were bulletproof bring them back fuck it people shoot down a bullets just bounce them hitting people on the ground yeah well our skin it's that what you know I saw something you know your podcast it's like everywhere now it's like dandelions ever you can't anywhere I'm always getting suggested videos from your podcast and I saw one because I've been cutting down my meat consumption good for you and but that doesn't mean I don't eat meat I just want to cut it down a little bit and and I have been feeling a kind of enjoyable from time to time sense of you know that I don't know if you let yourself do you probably don't but that feeling of like kind of bullshit like I'm a little better now better person I know it's really like I wasn't like overt it wasn't like hyper obnoxious you know but just a kind of sense of like I did it I can cut down my beef consumption and I mean you know I mean you know a cheese here and there and anyway this video popped up and it's some guests I don't know who it was talking about the number of animals that died in a bean field like any bean field that you see you know so many animals just ground up and murdered and I it was great because I realized like oh of course yeah right you the trick I was trying to play myself is the same it's the 13th floor shit it's like I want the world to look like a Disney film but it's a bit of a cop-out even saying that my mind my saying that because the reality is there's another solution the solution is organic gardening right so you can organically garden if you get a plot of land and get some friends together you could all grow in a vegetable so you have to take place in LA which with large-scale agriculture or if you're dealing rather with large-scale agriculture that's the problem the problems we have to feed in just in LA alone the Greater Los Angeles area what is it like 20 million something people that's so many goddamn people you know one's growing anything other than weed so what do we have what we have we have someone has to grow these fucking food for us so they have to do it large-scale yeah I'm gonna do it large-scale it involves combines and those fucking things are indiscriminate they're just chewing up the ground and things get caught up in and that's why when they clean fields when they pick whatever they're growing you'll see vultures after they run the combine you see vultures circle in the fields cuz they know rabbits and rats Jesus man all kinds of bugs I mean any kind of I mean I don't know if you care about bugs which is that's a weird thing right it's like vegans will get to this some vegans we get to this like line or like yeah but that's a mosquito fuck mosquitoes yeah they they have malaria you know you get to like a life form ethical boundaries where you can't relate to a roach also the hilarious thing when it comes to assigning levels of sentience then based on that deciding if you should eat something or not you run into like a lot of weird problems which is like number one you're assuming oh just because they don't have this sort of nervous system you have I mean and who knows we project most of everything we are into the world and we don't really know what the phenomena is but I saw some like video of a little of an ant taking care of the ants baby and I don't know if you've probably heard about how trees communicate with the mossy Liam yes and like how they'll send nutrients to their children and then so then you start running into I think which is a really fascinating problem which is what if it's all alive and sentient and feeling for real what if the there is throughout the entire universe just a sentient field of consciousness that is interacting with matter in a way that it produces what we call life and that life is feeling terror love maybe in different ways then we would understand it but it's still there you know there's that's a really under consideration by legitimate scientists in fact sam Harris's wife just wrote a book about that at least one of the subjects it's called conscious and conscious or conscious Ness sorry I don't remember which I haven't read it yet but I heard them talked about on his podcast and the concept that used to be like super woowoo was what if everything has consciousness yeah what if everything had but it just can't move it can't express itself can't change its environment it's limited just like we can't fly and we can't swim underwater and breathe water like we we're limited in our physical ability right but we assume that whatever limitation so we have like this is where it ends this is where the buck stops here yeah like everything that doesn't moves got to be students that it might not be which is one of the reasons why nobody wants to buy a house after someone's been killed in it right like what if that house retains a memory that was something that Rupert Sheldrake proposed a long time ago you know he's got that was that's a very strange theory where everything is kinetic resonance of the theory of morphic resonance he's a fascinating guy and he's like a guy who's not afraid to take some chances and and say some really woo woo shit yeah I think he's a Christian as well yeah I love his I think you're the one you like was telling me some of the studies are not so great in it well it wasn't that I said that is that other people would complain I racked up and because there's some there's some studies that apparently people lean on that aren't super legit like the dog knowing you're coming home one yeah well you got to replicate that shit because first of all the guy might have a loud car dogs can hear shit way better than you can yeah how far away is the guy when the dog starts going towards the door or does the guy just come home every night and the dog has like an internal clock and he knows hey it's five o'clock Mike must be coming home like if you come if they've replicated this app for 11:30 what if Mike starts coming home in the Tesla where you can't hear shit who knows what if he comes over does a dog actually know he's coming or is it dog just hearing things dog hearing aid or a car I mean it's almost isn't always doesn't always kind of seem like the most boring possible solution is usually the right one it's like yeah what's the most boring thing the most boring thing is nothing's happening but you're imagining the dog is somehow yeah has a telepathic link to you Occam's razor right yeah talk is the simplest but it's also the most boring like you know these crazy fucking UFOs I'm sorry if you've talked about this a bunch on the podcast but the UFOs that we're seeing that the you know Navy is releasing these videos of these tic tacs zipping around and it's Navy pilots it's not the people we interviewed in that show it's Navy pilots who are like yeah I don't know what the fuck this is and I was i have great conversations with uber drivers and like we were talking about it and this guy was like in a lot of them are programmers and shit and this guy was like it's probably a technic it's a glitch and then in the type of radar they're using I think it must be a glitch I mean that's the most likely reality they're not seeing it with their own eyes they're not I don't think so I think they're just picking it up on radar and so he's like it maybe it's a glitch or maybe it's like we should find that out can you google if the pilots were picking it up on radar the pilot spotted UFO to see if they've because I know some guys have spotted things with their own eyes I know I know for sure some guys have I'm just I'm not sure if that dad is that I think it's probably relevant to the conversation though it's probably a thing that we know people listening going yeah with the book I get super skeptical yeah I feel like I feel like almost like it's a plot I don't wanna go full Eddie Bravo but I feel like when I see people talking about UFOs might okay what else is going on what are you distracting me from mm-hmm is this really a big issue I was like is it really happening well can I see it what do you got got nothing oh you got like some braids are you got radar from one two pilots three pilots okay I believe it but I want to see why do I want to see more like what am I and you'll get caught up in it it'll chew up hours of your day yeah man there's a lot how those guys have we ran into on that show I felt bad for them because they didn't understand what had happened to them they had gotten caught in this weird loop of looking for secrets and looking for mysteries to be solved and looking for hidden conspiracies and they get caught in that and some of that shit is real which is part of the problem some of it you can come across the gulf of tonkin in the Northwoods operation Northwoods you can come across a bunch of um the territorial Enron you can see how they put that together you like what you could see real crazy conspiring yeah and then you can get lost and think it's everywhere that's right yeah well I mean this is like dude I was just with this Jim OH according today the AAA v's what does that mean is that Ben do you see UFO yeah are you really gonna change UFO they're like they have their own little thing it were a V's we don't refer to us as UFOs these are my pronouns these appeared at an altitude greater than 80,000 feet far higher than commercial or military jets typically five fly initially the print Princeton's radar team at the radar really high pressure print story is what it's called it's like a really high processing radar system why is it spelled Prince ton it's pretty story not as for instance I'll processor freezing a weird spot oh okay the radar team didn't believe what they're seeing chalking up the anomalies to an equipment malfunction but after they determined that everything was operating as it should they began detecting instances which the aavso I wanna know come on that means dropped with astounding speed to lower busier airspace day approached the Princeton's commander about taking action he said I was chomping at the bit I really wanted to intercept these things what yeah that's we have the fucking craziest people in this country like there's a fucking there's an alien man I want to chase it aerial vehicles for whoever invented that new name isn't hat he's an asshole I was actually the one who decided to call them AAV come on you know technically it's not identified flying object taking our fucking UFOs man I'm gonna fight that what is it again was the exact phrase anomalous aerial view anomalous aerial view it's an AAV you're an asshole it's an anomaly the new name for UFOs anonymous aerial vehicle probably a part of a billion dollar study - two fighters were diverted to intercept one of the strange objects when they first arrived on the scene the pilots didn't see any flying objects but they did observe what the lead pilot commander david flavor later referred to as a disturbance in the ocean oh the water was churning with white waves breaking over what looked like a large object just under the surface yeah then they noticed one of the objects flying about fifty feet above the water Craver the commander of the elite black aces squadron the suck goddamn Nicholas Cage movie who is a Top Gun program graduate with more than 16 years of flying experience described it as about 40 feet long shaped like a tic-tac handy with no obvious means of propulsion it's white it has no wings it has no rotors I go holy shit what is that dude you know the guy whoever the company is that makes tick you're like they're calling them tic tacs it's free publicity totally tic tacs is the one sponsoring this whole deal you think it is yeah man people are buying tic tacs right now listen to this you just say tic tac enough you like remember those old subliminal things he's doing movie theaters when you're watching a movie and it's a hungry eat popcorn like every like 50 100 frame they would stick like a hungry eat popcorn they likes yeah put subliminal text on the show anybody damn I want some popcorn if you just say Tic Tac Tic Tacs goodbye in Tic Tacs right now well we do know that pilots got great breath right that mean Tic Tac man it's like the first time you saw a UFO the first thing that pops in your head is it looks like a mint that's nuts there had to be other ways to describe it guts talking Tic Tacs bro for sure I googled Tic Tac after he said that to her because I couldn't remember if they were square or if they were like take you know that they looked like I would expect a good UFO to look like yeah you know boring yeah yeah like super Apple like like if Apple made a UFO yeah it's like applique pretty sleek yeah but going into the ocean part that's the part I like the best because that kind of lines up with Hollow Earth theory and that and like that maybe like they're flying the base yeah in the in the center of the earth of course they have a base in the urban you have a base in the ocean we never go there do you have a flyover I was just no why you fly over five hours of water it's just water oh yeah well that's that Strava app thing I feel like we've talked about literally everything you know the Strava I don't worry about it okay good it's great man I love that I have to think if pretty sure we've talked about this the heat maps the Strava heat maps that seem to show people walking under the ocean and stuff walking yeah we haven't know it so yeah cuz like Strava you know it's like um I think was Strava right it was like a way for you to track your steps hmm and some people apparently weren't some bases in the Arctic or in the ocean walking around and it showed up before they could like turn that function off for top secret facilities like the places they blur out on Google Maps so do you think there's like a military base under the water somewhere where the submarines go god man you know I want to think that but I'm a boy the movie the Meg yeah I think it's probably a technical error but fuck maybe I mean I don't know it's like the the implication of these take tax and all of it if you really want to like the first to me the most obvious one - the churning water evidence is that it's some kind of equipment malfunction what's also that they have an unlimited budget for black ops we don't know what that number is that's right we don't get to know yeah right all that weird shit they do when they're making stealth bombers and all that area 51 stuff yeah how much money goes to that like what is the number let's Google this how much does the US spend on black ops I had I was gonna bring this up in the middle of whatever talking there's a program here that was going on the 8a a tip advanced aerospace threat identification program what's going on fuck you out of your money but I'm just gonna use the a a tip 22 million is what their budget was in 2012 and this said doesn't still go on but apparently it does Luis Elizondo says it's still operating and he is part of so they spent 22 million dollars to see if the UFOs were a threat a year and there's the two stars Academy yeah that's it's time to launch stuff yeah so well some of it's still going on it's all it's listen I am I'm fucking rooting for it I want it to be real I would love it if it was real but if you look at like the history of the great ideas a lot of them did come from like weird moments you know like Tesla like basically at a seizure and felt like it was being contacted by something like you do run into stories of at the very least inspiration but quite often innovation coming to people via like traditional most i transmission well I've been thinking this for a long time that maybe ideas are living things and these ideas even though they you think of them as something your brains creating and maybe brain is creating it yeah but maybe it uses your brain to create it so that it can manifest itself in the real world so when you have ideas whether ideas that turn out to be art or music like you know Jimi Hendrix comes out with voodoo child your you are inspired by that you see it it gives you a great feeling you exchange currency to listen to it I mean just that one song how much money has been generated by a voodoo child it's one of the greatest songs in the history of the known universe is the opening guitar riff I've listened to that a thousand times easy I listen to it all the time whenever I'm like I need a pick-me-up that I mean it's just it's a masterpiece it's a masterpiece of music and where'd that idea come from well it came from his brain right but where was it before it was in his brain well how does brain cook it up and what is it what are these things they're just floating around that you grab out of culture and how do you turn them into something that people go crazy for yeah because occasionally a guy will take one of those ideas and make voodoo child or you know make someone else a song or make someone else's painting or you know make a fucking building that's inspiring there's these things that come into your head that's right and you're at the end what they really do is they're like the eggs of objects because they they come to your mind you think about them and then you say I'm gonna make a fucking clock and you start making a clock where's that coming from with oh it's just your creativity and it's just your mind it's just your imagination well it's just your thought process your synapses firing yeah yeah yeah you're right you're right we're all you're absolutely right there's no real woowoo or is there what the fuck is a thought figure that out no one knows what one is especially where are they coming from I mean how many times you've read have written a joke and you're laughing yourself as you're writing like we're the fuck did that come from yeah well I mean or saying any sometimes like you're watching sentences come out of your mouth and you're sort of you don't feel like yeah every day all the time Yeah right now where's the you know who's articulating it there's a dis um I've been studying Buddhism and any Buddhist out there if I fuck this up I'm sorry if you if you're more advanced or know more about it so I'm pregnant say the words wrong and stuff it's really interesting so it's like there's like eight consciousnesses I think it's eight and the sixth one is your thought a continuum of thoughts right so that's like where most people hang out and they think that's who they are is the infinite cycle of repeating thoughts in their head so below that as your senses and then the one right above that is the seventh and that's what is considered your subconscious in the West but so that's where all your memories are that's where all your like just all the shit you can't remember that happened to you that that it's stuck back there that appears in people's ARP or appears in your neurosis or whatever and then above that is the 8th consciousness and that's the stored experience of all human beings and well it's happening it's like the global mind or its lyric records yeah we have the Akashic records yeah and and so basically that one drips down like like water and a cave it drips down into your subconscious which drips down into your thoughts so when you're having these thoughts according to this model it's not necessarily your thoughts you're getting a kind of distillate that's rolling down through the global mind being flavored by your subconscious and then being flavored by your identity or who you think you are and then so by the time it comes out of you it's got you wrapped up inside of it but it's a projection of some like shared mind it's pretty cool that makes that makes actual sense you know that sounds like crazy voodoo hippie talk but it actually makes sense yeah that we all know that there's something that we share the Sun and we we all feed off of each other I mean you know I've said this many times and I am a different person with you yeah like we're different together and we're different with other people as well I mean that's how human beings are then we when we interact with each other we have this a bonding thing there's a there's an interaction thing yeah and that's why some people are toxic for you I mean the idea that you're supposed to stay with everyone it's like crazy like some people are just not good for you it's not a good mix you know you're not good for them they're not good for you get out yeah but that there's something that's going on it's not you just as an individual and then we're talking about gut biome and and that as well yeah you're you're you're also sharing gut biome with each other sharing DNA with each other and you're sharing the skin there's there's little organisms living on your body you hug people with no shirt on you sharing organisms yeah it's one of the reasons why it feels good I bet yeah yeah man I mean it's probably a great way to swap organisms to keep them spreading I mean yeah it benefits your biome I feel like he wants to like pollinate or get out into the world for sure I was reading about I was listening or actually listening to a podcast the Stephen Rinella podcast meat-eater and there was a guy on who was an expert in moving wildlife around how they like sometimes I move wolves into certain particular areas they had too many moose in this one island and so they moved wolves in but the wolves there wasn't enough of them and they were on an island so they all start fucking each other and they were fucking their kids and their did their DNA just was a mess huh yeah just all sorts of inbreeding and it was just terrible which is also fascinating it's like nature's like nothing you can't just stand around and fuck each other you gotta get out there like nature even with animals nature's like done and this is not the game we're playing the game were playing is not male and female the game we're paying is male that doesn't know female that's the game because you can't fuck your sister and you can't fuck your mom you stop if you do it a few times but after a while your kids are just not gonna come out good which is weird right like how come if you're good and your sisters good how come if you have sex there's a high likelihood that the kid won't be good there's something wrong with the child and if the child fucks the sister and then they have a child it's even more likely if that you know I mean this is what inbreeding is and this is one of the reasons why I have a lot of problems with certain dog species yeah yeah and it's a weird little thing that nature's got built into it yeah just like keep moving bitch keep touching each other keep spreading the biome kind of move yeah well no matter what you all swap and spit that keep it moving have you see that planet Earth with that poor sloth that poor horny lonely sloth is Horning pretty sure it was a sloth it was some kind of slow-moving tree creature and they set it up you know I don't know how much of it is real like how much of it is they're just filming animals and telling a story about them but this sloth is horny like bullet howls out into the forest like and it hears like a shriek of an of a woman a female like and it's like I'll fuck you know it's they yet this poor guy look out fuck can you get it from where he's in the tree or we lied to show he doesn't own it but you don't show it so he he doesn't have a girlfriend that's what's up yeah so he's a Class L of the sloths world this is in its in cell sloths it's not because this one's actually woody this sloth is going for it it's like it's not staying in his apartment on the Internet it's it's leaving his tree swimming across an ocean climbing up another tree but what a dirty trick nature played on this motherfucker to have a move so slow everyone can catch you yeah it's like nature's like listen you guys are too fucking stupid there's too many of you we're gonna have to have it so Eagles pick you off so they have them so slow literally no one can miss them what a goddamn dirty trick you ever see a bear run they run fastest you ever see a fucking wolf or a coyote run the ridiculous this poor bastard this poor bastard is going so slow it looks like he's on slo-mo like we're looking at the leaves yeah leaves are moving in a normal speed but he looks like he's on fucking slow-mo he looks like he's been eating benzos for the last nine months like just fucked up he's got an infinite xanax prescription but yeah yeah what do we must look so fast to them like to them we must seem terrifying and how quickly we're moving about Eagles you know what is that eagle that that gets them in South America the harpy eagle is that what it is the biggest eagle on earth I didn't know harpies a sloth all they eat is monkeys and sloths that's their favorite shit they snatch the sloths out of the tree bitch what is it a fight for yeah yeah whoa laughs fights back oh my god let's go you guys oh that's a real young Eagle although the sloth is actually swinging at the eagle imagine sorta you'd be like what are you doing now it's more like when someone's trying to wake you up it's like you know it's like a drunk guy at a barn you're trying not to fuck him up yeah please don't make me hit you that is exactly it and the Eagle seems perplexed by it yeah but you see the harpy eagle killed one because it's crazy man they just swooped down there so enormous and one of these guys first of all kudos to all these wildlife biologists that actually go down there and risk their ass look at that boom hold on back that up again motherfucker boom Jesus that is a big killer bird and he just snatches that poor little guy but somebody had to be there to film that and there was one of them that I watched on the harpy eagle which is a beautiful animal where this guy who was a photographer who was one of the scientists who studying him got attacked the eagle swooped in and fucking took a swing at him she was he okay yeah barely but I mean that gets sketchy when a 25-pound flying bird with knives coming out of its feet he's trying to snatch you I'm something that can literally carry a fish can you imagine how strong your hand would be if you could shove your hand into the river snatch a salmon and pull it out with one hand I'm gonna be honest it's that strong I do that that's how I fished amazing I love the fish you make a YouTube video I don't want to film myself out in nature you know how it is I just heard it that's my private time in the wild they just snatch them and then they fly with them they're so fucking strong yeah that thing was coming after you and I think the harpy eagle is probably even bigger than 20 five pounds I think 25 pounds like a big bald eagle yeah I don't think the harpy eagle is even larger than that dude one of my friends told me something that has always kind of creeped me out it's obviously probably not true but like you know things yeah my two University of bro science is 11 pounds that's it what's the heaviest Eagle wow I'm off big-time I guess that makes sense though because like a Turkey's the giant turkey is like a 20 pound Turkish that the Steller's sea eagle is average weight 15 pounds oh wow vilify an eagle 14 pounds harpy eagle 13.1 no shit why don't I feel like we've done this before I feel like you were I thought you were right though but maybe it's just I guess I was in Vegas and I had to bet whether or not you looked at the weight of the biggest eagle I would bet a million dollars they know what it definitely looked I know exactly what it is it's got to confuse with an with an extinct eagle in New Zealand that was enormous that they think hunted people and that one was 25 pounds and I was shocked that that's it was only 25 pounds called the haast Eagle H a ast show a picture with that fucking thing was none of them verified to exceed 20 pounds but yeah I think they're bigger yeah see that's it that's where I fucked up I was looking at this thing and I was like why it's only 20 pounds or 25 pounds because you look at the size of it it was fucking huge and they really think they might have hunted humans they think that's that might be why the people I think it was New Zealand why the people in New Zealand wiped him out and this was like before the white man came and fucked everything up did you see that documentary on Falcon earring know which one is up it's this woman he's like I wish I could remember her name but she like goes up to I think like Tibet and state like took her in and taught her how to like hunt because it's the way they hunt with birds and like it's a whole relationship you have you sort of have to raise the Falcon from a baby and they're like connected to it but it's the most insane thing to witness because it's such a remote place and it's such a like traditional people they don't watch TV they don't know you know they're not like absorbed shit like we are they're just out there hunting with giant birds and you know they figured out how to do that you know that's to me all the stuff like horse right any any human animal relationship when you think back to the first person who saw a falcon I was like I'm gonna catch it and I'm gonna train it to catch rabbits so we can eat yeah how how how how that shit is I don't know if this is the exact documentary but this is one on it called the challenge where that's not it but that's it's these are like in the looks like Saudi Arabia these are like some sharpening their claws which doesn't sharpen the beak here in a second what are they using them to hunt it seems like they're having an event here so I don't know oh they're sharpening their beak oh fuck yeah this wasn't it this is another version they're watching soccer they're riding on sand dunes these guys are driving Land Cruisers in the middle of the desert somewhere yeah a pro's anuman shit they're in land they're lettin go pitch the pigeons are gonna get jacked oh my god oh my god they had a room filled with pigeons yeah or those Falcons a Falcons well no there's a I can't which one of the pigeons don't of them have to be pigeons right those are pigeons so what is the challenge like who Jack's the most pigeons the fuck is that wait a minute that's called the challenge movie is called a challenge it's a documentary that came out won awards a couple years ago really yeah and it's just about falcons Jack and pigeons I thought this was the one he was talking about but apparently it's not I want my sharpening the P the beaks and the sharpen in the claws this is gonna be your next thing you're gonna get in a falcon earring the next time I come here you're gonna have a skin some kind of like when they're Mongolian dudes with the fur hat with the ring yeah the fucking spike on the top of it that is the one that's it one guy's driving around with a gun no about the about this movie oh wow no shit yeah yeah dudes have crazy money man they just have to figure out some way to ball so they to get killer birds look at those Aires seabirds are an amazing thing if you if you really watch them and see them in the wild like do their thing like snatch a fish out of the water it what it is is a raptor it's a flying Raptor that just we tolerated it because it's small but we probably killed all the ones that could kill us well yeah right they were like giant giant Eagles at some point get your eyes on that thing man look at that look at the eyes on that thing it has a giant if that was a big thing like the size of you coming at you and trying to kill you and eat you first of all you'd be totally helpless if that thing was your size you would be 100% every human being would be 100% helpless they those things are so strong it would grab a hold you with its feet it would start ripping you apart with that fucking bolt cutter it has grown out of its face yeah fuck man it would just just that fucking thing would be the size of a sword like a samurai sword that would just be smashing in ripping your guts out you'd be surprised still be alive for a second to watch it take a like taste of your guts probably be like the size of one of Shaq's shoes right that would be his beak size 22 yeah I got beak right you look this beak big-ass shoe huge knife big fucking head this big big-ass shoe for a phone carrying you to feed its babies right that's what they do they eat you first and puke you into the baby's mouth yeah and they eat other birds to eat whatever the fuck they want those things are always fun you know I used to find them headless in my backyard there was like a little bit of a war between the the Hawks in my yard yeah we put in this glass fence in the back of the yard and the Hawks can figure out the fence and they fucking dank and they a couple of them got Kayode one of them one of them we managed to save we brought him to like a wildlife rescue place and they rehabilitated him and saved him another couple of them died and then we would find dead ha so I think that one of them like the dominant hawk and he died and then other ones just started moving into the area like they were flying around my chicken coop and like little juvenile hawks yeah kind of assholes almost like teenagers I was like what the fuck is going on here then I'd find one of them with his head missing she's so like some other hawk killed it and ripped its fucking head off and a bigger Hawk left it in my yard dead with no head like a mess a try figure out what the fuck eats something's head but apparently that's something that a hawk will do they'll do to each other so it's like the equivalent of like the Mad Max putting your enemy's head on a spike in front of your area yes you claim you own like all his friends get to see his headless body when you shit on it when you fly over find out that's true that might be a lie but I want to find out if Hawks cuz I'm almost we're very high right now ladies and gentlemen but I'm pretty sure that I read that when I found the headless bird in my yard have you seen the tibetan sky burial shit yes yeah that's that's cool man that breeze yeah it's amazing that's when you basically instead of cremation your friends hack your body up into pieces and take it to where they're vultures buzzards I'm not sure which vultures scatter your body they descend on it they eat it and all that's left is bones so you can smash the head so that the vultures can get inside get your brain all your memories and then I just saw this incredible documentary on the history I think was the Himalayas there's a civilizations there because like they're genetically they it's why the Sherpas are able to help people like they are able to take oxygen and more there's some kind of split that happen and that that high in altitude but like these fucking crazy scientists were rappelling down the side of these cliff faces and going into tombs and the side of cliffs and looking at these bones of these people where they're not sure of what their history is and like they'd been pecked by Birds you know so they were like okay they were doing the sky burial even now but some of them had spikes nailed into their tires or something like maybe there was like a zombie like oh who knows what the fuck happened but back then they thought that you know I mean even in western graveyards you'll find spikes through what part of the wallet I think their chests or their heads somebody killed them post death as part of their ritual yeah yeah pretty sure not for sure but pretty sure but that was not uncommon I mean we there's so many examples of finding like graves that have spikes hammered in them because people thought that the body was a vampire that didn't come from nowhere you think that there was a time when bodies used to come back to life and that parasites dead now no no I think there was a fuckin time where people's neocortex hadn't formed enough to separate their subconscious from their conscious so they were like hallucinating more and also they were like they had a kind of they were projecting a lot of crazy shit into the world also imagine when you found out you could lie like the first Liars yeah this is like there were people that would have language and then people once they started communicating like hey who fucking ate the tomatoes tsunami yeah and you realize you can get away with that yeah you could line so you didn't eat tomatoes when you did who's the first liar is before language there was no liars there's no Liars in the Lion Kingdom it's not even a concept because you can't have a lie until you have communication well you could say there's day I guess you could say lying is the equivalent of camouflage in the sense that when you see a some of these insane like animals but bugs in particular that look like flowers that look like or you know it's yeah that's a lot it's a form of deception it's a form of evolutionary deception so yeah I think that like it's a linguistic it's a linguistic camouflage that people use to try to like navigate through society not just people monkeys and monkeys monkeys use language and they lie to each other yeah they found out that monkeys have a very specific sound they make when it's an eagle and they have an other sound that they make when it's a cat like something on the ground so they have something for up high and something on the ground and so one monkey will yell out something like Eagles coming the other monkeys scatter and then he gets the fruit yeah ha ha that's crazy and then they'll they'll yell that something's on the ground they'll run up to the trees they lie to each other to meet what the funniest fucking thing is how much we lie to ourselves that's where it gets amazing it's like you know you were talking about and I've done the exact same thing with screen time when you're presented that humiliating number of hours and you've been telling friends you're busy and you're fucking looking at that just thinking like dude I've been like you know looking at bullshit but then before you do that you look but it's my job you know I've got to kind of be online it's like no you're addicted to technology and because you can't stand the fact that you don't have the discipline to stop using it you would rather make up a story involving some absolutely verifiable bullshit so that you don't have to deal with the fact that you aren't in full control of yourself and it's a non rewarding addition which is really strange it's like when you're looking at stories on like the Apple newsfeed or something you're scrolling looking for something that's gonna captivate you yeah what is it Apple having problems with keyboards yeah you start reading this and just like oh you can't huawei can't sell laptops you know anymore like how much of that am i like you were saying earlier how much that is junk thoughts yeah these are junk thoughts like junk food junk food you just consuming consuming and I don't think it's useless I think it serves a purpose I love it those if I mean in the sense of maybe not a purpose and the way you're gonna be as a human but a purpose in the sense of like if you apply a little bit of like mindfulness when you're losing your phone how do I feel right now you know I'm talking about like how do I fucking feel you'll realize you feel a specific way it's a kind of like numbness there's a quality of like a kind of like sedated numbness to the notic state you've been lulled into by the algorithms and there's some Pleasant kind of like I guess you could compare it to some like low-level euphoric painkiller but not very euphoric mostly just a mild numbness that is pretty good at turning off anxiety and they say or you could at least displace your own personal anxiety like if I'm scanning through my phone and I find the inevitable bad news whatever formats in I could pretend that my anxiety is related to that news you know and then that's when you get people who are very anxious and they've seen it I mean sighs who was a famous some person tweeted I'm here in this beautiful place and I can't enjoy it because of our president you know what I mean it's like whoa I don't I'm not sure that's the real reason why you can't enjoy that place I think it might be actually that you haven't dealt with the fact that you're a vet you're freaking the fuck out right yeah that to me is like this the purpose of a phone it's very good at tricking yourself into thinking that the reason you feel like shit is because of something happening in the world it's a band with either two and here's what the problem with that is sometimes you have like these legitimate thoughts and when you have these legitimate thoughts meaning like meaning like something you're working on something you're like whether it's an idea you're trying to do on stage or something else another project that you're doing these things they require your bandwidth right and when you're always looking at your phone it chips away percentages of your bandwidth ten here five there there seven there and you don't think about it because nope I'm still concentrating on the project I'm still on the project project the project the project yeah but really no really you're in two rivers at the same time you're in this wacky River of nonsense and wondering who got this and how much they're getting in this divorce and who died in the Dominican Republic oh my god another person another terrorist oh my god yeah you know and you're just you if you want to look at all the bad stuff that happens among seven billion people you have to think of all the interactions that humans have all the literally billions of interactions everyday people constantly and occasionally one goes fucking Western yeah one goes sideways and that's the one you see on YouTube Jesus Christ this world's going to shit yeah and then you watch another one and you watch another one and you watch infectious diseases and snake bites and what happens when you get nuttin and necropsy when your fucking flesh starts falling off so I'm cheating bacteria say how'd they get that snorkelling the next thing you know you're fucking just numb numb to your real life because you're taking in data from yeah everywhere yeah that's it fuck man and it's like then that gets inside of you and now you're just a turbulent you have a turbulent self that is digested a version of the world that's only half true and so because of that you're gonna be half a person because you're not looking into like your own whatever the fuck you are you know what are you what are you like how much do you even think about what are you yeah how much time of you spent to me it's like the craziest shit that like you're you're we were talking about the sex drive being this insane compulsory engine inside every sentient being that way that I know of course there's exceptions but like this is if you're writing a computer code right this would be a line of code right it keeps you going keeps you going keeps you going so to me something is fucking astounding weird is why the fuck can people not sit still and be quiet for periods exceeding 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes literally the least metabolically outside of sleeping right you're what you're not really exerting energy when you're sitting still and being quiet you're not really doing much and yet if you ask I can ask a person if they wanted to go for a walk that was sure I'll go for a walk but if you're like do you want to sit with me for like ten minutes quietly it's I get it felt like now I don't want to I'm not into that no I don't wanna do that what the fuck is that to me that if not that I believe in simulation theory but if I wanted to prove it or like play around with it the idea that we're like non player characters in some super advanced simulator one of the ways I would experiment would be like Oh sit still why the fuck can't you sit still why is it that suddenly your mind goes insane why is it suddenly that you gotta get out why do you feel bored or crazy or fucking like overheated or anxious or nervous the productive Duncan yeah that's why that's why everybody wants stimulants yeah yeah that would it be more productive yeah I want to contribute more yeah people I mean I think it's that's what someone might say is an explanation but I think the fucking real reason is like people are carrying a disordered universe inside of them and when they sit down and there's nothing to look at except what's around them they're forced to deal with the fact that actually a lot of the disturbance in their life is more related to an interior like maelstrom of thoughts and unexplored feelings and then this is just basically shaping their entire existence they're like in every single moment recreating a universe of disorder and then getting really upset because if you see disorder in the world and it keeps reappearing like your friend he's like why do I get taken in by these people all the time it's like well you get taken in by these people all the time because inside of you is a behavior pattern that is replicating this phenomena and you're pretending that it's not in you to the point where it's a mystery it's like why did you know when I Drive somewhere I'm not like why did my car drive me here you know unless I'm like fucking high out of my mind it shouldn't be driving but pull over and find a Starbucks a person will legitimately be like I don't know why I did that and it's like well what is what are you what are you yeah right okay are you something different if you have sugar and your yeah are you yeah what when your Candida level hits a certain number yeah and it starts telling you you need sugar Duncan how about a nice cold coca-cola Duncan yeah mmm Duncan just crack oh and one coke it's not gonna hurt you to have one cuz you're right I need a cake to go along with water who wants to go and buy water right now coke nasty fucking waters not so flavorless heir alive stayin alive here with my water no I want fuckin sewage brown sugar death poured into my fuckin guts or a nice IPA oh yeah he's better yellow liquid it taste like wheat yeah having an addictive personality man I like it because it's like it's fun to play around with it meaning that when I am reaching for the thing whatever it may be that I know I shouldn't be doing is in the sense of fun well I like watching the rationalization that my mind starts spitting out for it you know like oh I'm doing this because it's like you know I'm relaxing you know it's a celebratory moment I feel a little bummed out and you look at like the instant way your mind tries to come up with a bullshit story to write off the fact that you are riding around in a vehicle that you can't control and that is not a very appealing way to be no one wants to hear the pilot say guys taking my hands off the wheel once you see what happens for the next ten minutes up here and yet their whole lives are like that they've just taken their hands off the wheel but then they're trying to make sense of it you know like how many times do you mean an alcoholic who hasn't accepted yet they're an alcoholic and they're like telling you all these reasons full you'd see my childhood man you just got to understand my childhood or you know it helps my riding I said I'm a better rider when I'm drunk or on and on and on and on and it's like no the reality is you're fucking hooked you're addicted you can't stop your hand from bringing something into your fucking mouth and you can't deal with that because who wants to deal with that shit and I want to be in control so I'll make up a story I'll make up a story I love watching your shit man that Goggins what's-his-name he's great I love more fording laziness globally this guy's galloping down the road yelling into the camera and I love it bad especially as a person who's really good at telling stories you know so like I'll fucking wake up in the morning I'll be like yeah there's time to go for a jog but you know I probably should fill in the fucking blank and it's always very important you know there's always a real good reason for it like it but regardless the truth is I have yet to achieve the ability to grab that particular part of the steering mechanism of the my identity you know and so rather than just deal with yeah you can't control yourself I'll tell myself a story I love that it's a tricky one yeah it is that one the comfort one is a tricky one Comfort is the siren come on come back to the couch done come and done can you learn how about a nice cup of tea he has no vice it's actually good for you verbal just relax a little tea soda me won't be the New York Times if I know what the intellectuals think about the way the world is yeah right man it's amazing I love fine things to do man I don't you know I don't sit down and listen to music I'm gonna sit down listen to some albums well I need to because you know I'm just interested in music and I'm thinking of like making some songs and I want to become inspired hmm I think a lot when I'm running and it's one of the main reasons why I really like to do it first thing in the morning kind of gets my head going like it gets me ramped up real early I like to do it like first thing in the morning cuz it gets your head thinking yeah like it gets you like you're out there breathe in and running up the hill and you pushed yourself you're tired and then the thought will come into your head you know just out of nowhere you get a strange idea just pop in your head and then you start dancing around with that idea or wondering why even thinking about that now and you start thinking about shit you need to fix about how gotta clean my fucking office and you just thinking about oh why didn't I gotta call that guy back fuck and all these like it's like brain maintenance like your brains like shaking from all the pounding it's like AAA we got a loose screw over here in Aisle 4 oh yeah I forgot I gotta call that round tighten that bitch down yeah man that this this is what I love about meditating and that's something i am i ant finally have figured out how to do regularly and i love it oh well from doing everyday that's awesome every day how much time 20 minutes how much time you jerk off during the meditation oh god man you know it varies based on the weather it's rain made you horny good said I don't wanna be tough it's just yeah when it's raining it's just like I come faster but then like if it's windy I can get it out if there was a movie about someone who just became fucking nymphomaniac when it rained out I'm sure that happened like as soon as it rains out it's like fuck who go to book if there was if that's how I mean you think about humans teared how we're affected by things I went depressed when it rains up or you know we don't like it now again definitely I just feel like same as shit cuz you get attacked by scientists or smart people are like you don't know what you're talking about I know I don't know what I'm talking about don't know that we're talking about a hypothetical world people get horny when it rains well yeah but I want to take it into the Sun man I want to move into the next level which is like weird a solar minimum now apparently which is the Sun is not very active and so the Sun you telling me this it's the craziest shit bed the Sun freaks me out not just like the fact there is a Sun but the solar observatory observatory I'm high I can't even say Observatory what's happening in the solar observatory well you heard about this shit the app and there's this solar observatory that just got fucking shut down all of a sudden I'm like the black helicopters came in and like anyway I don't know what happened there let down the Sun is it a solar minimum we have to fucking get through a paywall you see m8 ditches what is this oh you need to iron guys come on continue what do they want right apt fucks UFO sightings NASA Soho space probe spot giant alien disk shoot out of hollow Sun what that's not a roof what's that Express Duncan that's like that's the hard core scientific stuff take me to like something last time yeah who is a is the Express like the Daily Mail do they make who makes stuff up like the acquirer someone was it was a newspaper wind alien his moto next match total solar eclipse will pass right over a space observatory oh wow Joe have you really not heard about the solar observatory that got shut down I'm surprised pretty that picture is when you look that up just solar observatory shut down black hello go back to that photo real quick before we do that we'll do that real quick sorry I just no no it's okay be I'm very sorry but look at that goddamn photo this is photo of the solar eclipse and you see all the Rays of the Sun by the way imagine these are little multiverses each we had a juice does this thing just devour bubble teas yeah run out of fucking bubbles we ran out of bubbles right when you're about to talk about the multiverse look at the Rays coming off that thing I mean what is that is that what that is that all those solar rays is that what the fuck is that coming off of that thing those are called sight gar spirals those like they'll fuck you up man yeah they're deadly they're like definitely one of the most dangerous thing in space no that's what Robert Schoch the geologist from Boston University thinks and did the Ice Age his theory is that it was a mass coronal ejections lightning storms like rain coming down but lightning all over the earth it's a very common fear and Preppers do you watch Preppers I've watched a couple times but it freaks me out the guy everybody's got a reason like I'm building this shelter because I'm afraid or Akane's but yeah you hear like the Liberals the Hurricanes the Sun comes up a lot like I should well I mean look we can only exist in a very narrow temperature band that's what you have to think is strange you know we have a temperature band what is it it's from like fucking 20 below zero to like a hundred and fifty that's all we got yeah and this we got this weird little spot this is a piece of shit died already god damn it that's how much juice does it use what's got a little observatory in here Solar Observatory and it's getting shut down it's some you know the the narrow band that we can live in we're so fragile as an organism yeah that we should be terrified of this giant nuclear explosion that's a million times bigger than the earth sure that we need to stay stable and you need to keep I mean imagine relying on that thing to make sure the temperature is in like a range of plus or minus a hundred degrees like what the fuck are you talking about it's crazy crazy crazy request well this is like you know I don't believe it man but I love Hollow Earth theory and like bubbles if I if aliens were watching us like terrestrial aliens not interdimensional aliens important to make the distinction if terrestrial aliens are watching us I think they would be like what the fuck is wrong with you y'all live on the outside of the thing you got to go in like don't cuz mountains fall out of the sky you're gonna build your whole inside collapses well I'm saying like if you dig deep enough maybe there's a way no hair donor well that's you got to get air down there I mean when you think about it it's like we've built this fragile civilization using this super advanced brand-new interconnective technological matrix that is dependent on satellites giving GPS coordinates to keep everything running and we're right next to a ball of fire that has historically from time to time blasted so much fucking crazy shit at our planet there was a time that it cause like telegram wires to spark it's like if that shit hits the satellites they're gonna go out all the power grid goes down and everything goes down it's not conspiracy theory it's happened yeah and sometimes it cools down and it enters into a thing called a grand solar minimum I think is what it's called and that sometimes starts ice ages like there was a mini ice age that happened not that long ago where the Sun theoretically just I don't know it stopped being so active and then 1790 1790 yeah yeah and that so this is like a reality that nobody seems to really like think about I'm not to me is the funniest thing when everyone's fighting each other we're all like furious at whoever the fuck is like nobody wants to except like mountains fall out of the sky the Sun from time to time burps fire so bright that it causes fires to break out on the planet and then all the other shit we don't know about you know just this stuff we don't know about like that if we could talk to it yeah 1200 foot asteroid could crash into Earth because NASA missed this small detail oh geez less than a week old story Jesus Christ I don't need to see this NASA fucked up yeah yeah well they haven't been getting any money Jamie you think that's why yes Trump has diverted all the funds to the space force no the truth is they yes yeah I mean would they even tell us I mean I know no you don't think no let it hit you don't think that your life no what are you gonna do they wouldn't warn it's gonna hit it's gonna hit you know Neil deGrasse Tyson says weird like decades away from being able to divert it decades decades yeah yeah if something's coming our way some civilization ender were fucked and eat this is not conspiracy theory folks there was an article today that I put on my Twitter that I read about hyenas they used to have hyenas in Canada up until the last ice age there's hyenas in fucking Canada like this whole thing changes all the time time there was a mile-high sheet of ice up there here two miles high in some places that's right I was just in Chicago man and you look out at the lake Lake Michigan yeah it's just amazing you look at it from Chicago whoa whoa whoa that was a fuckin glacier that was a there was an ice I didn't even melted that's how it got there that's the room the remnants of the melted ice sheets the whole fucking thing was under ice yeah dude there's a place in Wisconsin where my friend Doug has a farm Cazenovia Wisconsin that's a part of what they called the Driftless area and the Driftless areas the places where the the these glaciers didn't come down and crush flat everything in front of them that's why you go to the Midwest it's fuckin flat yeah flat as this table why is that because the fucking glaciers came down just smoosh that motherfucker just that's how it came down like this giant mile-high wall of ice just destroys everything in front of her as it rolls across the landscape but it didn't hit this one area of Wisconsin and it's or didn't hit it as hard cuz you got all these beautiful hills and valleys it's pretty dope wow that's beautiful holy shit isn't that crazy man crazy that that happened 12,000 years ago right yeah this is we're not talking about something that's a long time ago and then BOOM that shit melts and becomes an an interior freshwater ocean and it's essentially what it is it's like our entire civilization is living the way like a middle-aged alcoholic who's starting to realize all the trouble they caused yeah lives but still debt is gonna keep drinking kind of like it's like if you look at like our old species as one thing it's like right now we're dealing with like the same thing maybe smokers deal with after a lifetime of smoking like suddenly health effects are starting to happen right we've had like a nice run but now we're starting to get a little bit of payback for all the decisions past generations have made we got fucking radiation pouring into the ocean the ice caps are fucking melting and then on top of that the majority of us can't just can't deal with that we either say fake news or we say nothing I'm gonna be dead anyway bad yeah yeah that those are the two things because the react that to me like this fucking amazing thing about being a human is that we are like a technological hive that has built itself around a planet using the materials of the planet to make technology and we're still at the point of hive life where we're pretending there's different bees when we're all the same fucking beat you know it's just some of some of us are running weird operating systems and we can't accept the fact that it's like listen we're a fucking hive of super vance primates that are all living together in a hive because that's the overview effect man where astronauts talk about flying over and looking down it's like it's all the same the cities are mostly all the same and all the structures all look pretty much the same of course it's a fucking hive schizophrenic I've where pieces of the hive are like yeah over there we got a bomb that part of the hive because that part of the hive is different than us so that part of the hive wants to hurt us you know it pheromones being released you know not by queen bees but by influences you know like the news the media blasting out this data pheromone that gets us ready for the wars gets us ready for the violence tries to justify or rationalize it and then there's other weird new like little mini queen bees popping up releasing weird pheromones the influencers you know they're like some of them are making people dress a certain way fashion or whatever some of them are making people freak out some of them are making people more calm but we're dealing with the fact that we're all starting to wake up right we're all gonna have to wake up to the fact that we're all the same thing living in a hive and that if we don't come to that epiphany is an individual I mean we're probably fucked like we figure out to split the atom and we've got that the technology as it's come is making the ability it's like I'm sorry please go ahead collectively we kind of know but it's very difficult for everybody to act yeah right collectively we kind of know that we can't do things the way we're doing but they're gonna do it what are we gonna do oh he's gonna drive that truck with the smoke coming out of the back well fuck it I don't want to fix that what am I gonna do about this what do I do what do we do whose intro who's in charge and what do we do you're asking me no anybody nobody nobody has the answer to that yeah I think you gotta like get pragmatic I mean III that there's that thing John Paul Sartre said and I'm not throwing poles for thought one said but has stuck with me ever since I heard it which is whatever you do you give the planet permission to do you give everyone permission to do so to me what's helped me like live a little less in a in a crazy like asshole way I mean aside from having a baby is realizing that oh if I can't stop you know using as much plastic as I do the world's fucked if I can't stop any kind of activity that I look into the world and think man why are people doing that then the world is fucked because if you you know that fuck I'm sorry man can I ran about this quick story do you mind sorry you know that Gandhi's story which one which one the one about like this and this who knows could be fake news I don't care as a parable it's cool but this woman brings her kid to Gandhi and says I can't get him to stop eating sugar and Gandhi says come back in a month and she's like all right comes back in a month and Gandhi looks at the kid and goes stop eating sugar and she's like why did you wait a month for this and Gandhi's like well I wanted to see if I could stop eating sugar first and you know before yeah so it's like to me cool right there's a listlessness in the world because everyone wants to be heroic but people are wanting to act on the global stage while neglecting the their their home their family themselves and it's frustrating because you I wouldn't you think that because it seems like we're being like you're seeing the big big scale of things but it's like personally yeah when I fucking finally clicked man I can't change anybody out it's like I'm not gonna make anyone do anything I'm not gonna make anyone meditate I'm not gonna make anyone do this or that or do anything because everyone's doing their own trip anyway man who the fuck am I to say what a relief but that's part of the problem right is it people trying to get people to behave a certain way that's what we're experienced a lot of that right now yes yes man and it's like the thing is that's the impulse is Noble but it's unfortunately it's like trying to build a fucking second-story house when you haven't built the first storey which is like you need to like get your own house in order and then maybe there's some teaching but usually by the time that happens you don't you're not you know not a talker you know and so to me that has been like a real exciting a thing to realize this jack Kornfield says this I'm sorry if I've said this before tend to the part of the garden you can touch and that's it so it's like to me it's just a big relief number one you can't do shit for anybody else but yourself number two you don't need no one none of us know we don't have to impose some moral thing on you but there is a one actionable thing an action anyone can take which is a moral which is find out who you are that's it find out who you are who are you really what are you explore that shit right and then see how you start changing I think that's a real pragmatic solution to all this stuff and it actionable to and it's like you want to find out who you are by you know rubbing mayonnaise all over your dick and letting your dog lick it off that's a true exploration go ahead work for me the enlightening just kidding speaking of its Jose OJ's on Twitter I saw that shit do you see that one guy who made a parody video of his welcome Twitter world he made this weird dad video it's so strangely what's the word apocalyptic no disingenuous strangely disingenuous I thought it was like he's fake like he's acting again but he hasn't acted and forever and also maybe he's suffering a little bit from the football injuries because there's a struggle I'm I am very sensitive to people that have been hitting ahead a lot of times struggling to talk yeah because I look for it I seen in people I don't want to see it and it's scary and we all talk about it like people that work for the UFC fighters trainers people do kickboxing we everyone talks about seeing certain folks yeah starting to slip and some folks will start to talk about it about themselves you know they're having a problem yeah that's what I got I was listening to that soak a little Twitter world all right and take that OJ Simpson yeah I'm gonna but I can dispel some of the BS the people have been saying about about me with no accountability yeah possible to talk about sports and politics it's like this weird acting job that he did it's creepy man oh it was weird all that yeah it so it was a weird moment man I that's a cool that that that thing that happens to people who have like done shitty things where instead of just saying like yeah I fucked up I can't say that you can't say yeah I killed somebody right well you can but if you do that you're going to suddenly a nobody I think for anybody who's done she thinks the one we just say it you get to be standing again on the real ground like the real terrain is that it like the bullshit world you've been living in but when you decide not to do that then you do have this like well it's like the uncanny like you have this like Android quality to you because you're not reflecting reality you're reflecting reality after you put lipstick on it and sunglasses and combed its hair yeah put some perfume on account of the nose job got its ass got ass implants and that's your fucking realities this super plastic like someone who's been getting plastic surgery for years and so you're pretending that that's your existence you see it man when like people are getting sentenced for killing people and they're like the look on their fucking face is like so confused because they have created this valley in between that person the person they are and in you know it's they've split in half essentially and they can't deal with that's why so many people have murdered people will say I wasn't there I don't remember it was a dream I didn't know I didn't do it and Gacy I should be I should be sentenced for running a funeral home without a license he was saying when he was out of town people were bearing kid dead kid bodies under his fucking house you know any minute minute he tricked himself enough really absolutely because otherwise you have to deal with the fact that you are a murderer that you killed fucking you strangled fucking kids that you dress like a fucking clown you know and like killed kids like it's so unpalatable to deal with that shit because you're just a crazy lunatic who is out of control so you'd rather make up a story usually it's conspiratorial somebody was like somebody's like hey man you know where you could bury those kid bodies I think Casey's out of town yeah man it's not fucking crazy it's fucking crazy yeah Jesus Christ I know and that's the thing with the Oh people have always said about oh joy that it's almost like he doesn't even believe he did it now but the problem with that is there was a fucking emoji that he tweeted at this guy you know or he had a direct message with this guy and he had like 16 knives and he said he's gonna cut him like if that's true if he really did send that if it's not Photoshop that's not bullshit you imagine getting a DM from og because you made a parody video he's this guy cuz like while I can't guess what he did was he put o J's video where he was talking and in the background he had someone screaming help call the police help help and so then AJ sends him this direct message allegedly who knows what really happened who knows what if it did dude I would fucking I would like find a cave somewhere I'd want to move to the Hamas I can't I couldn't deal with it man hello Twitter world I'm just you know cuz he could get you like he could get you if he wanted to I bet hey B yeah I mean how much times he have left 71 years old after he DMZ he disappears you know people like we don't know where he is Norma Donald tweeted out him hilarious Norman hey juice I just wanted to tell you that through that video I know the golf course that's behind you so I could figure out where your house is and I wouldn't do that but somebody else might yeah that was hilarious Norma Curran is so funny he's the best I'm trying to get him to do a podcast I was trying to get him an atom you get to do a podcast I don't know what he can do though while he's got this his Netflix deal shows I don't know where is that I don't know if he has a contract but he should do a podcast it's a goddamn national travesty that he doesn't have a podcast he's so fucking funny well isn't his show kite it's kind of like a podcast like it has that he hasn't been doing it uh and they don't want him doing interviews and stuff it's like it's a little tricky cuz he said some crazy shit you know norm says crazy shit and they said some crazy shit like like if you about someone saying something will you believe that you'd have to be you'd have to have down syndrom huh like you thought that would be better than saying you'd have to be retarded people like what the fuck dammit and people got real mad at him I think it was on the stern show he's just he's just a treasure their car Joe I'm sorry too like I want her like I thought I had all these questions for you man I was like guess lame to ask my questions on their show and it's not in the moment like we often do but I really do I know you probably talking about it but I wanted to hear your take on deep fake cuz like that fucking deep fake 'you really bothered me like it's set off like a whole series of thoughts in my head that like of all the futuristic shit that freaks me out the most like well for some like you or someone like me it's easy for them to do it because they basically got a library of all the sounds that we can make with our mouths and so they put it in a database and then they can get you to say words you've never said before in an order that you've never said them before in a way that you can kind of distinguish for now I kind of can hear that it's fake but it was me talking about sponsoring a hockey team filled with all chimpanzees yeah and teaching chimps to play sounds exactly like something I would do and it's it's close you know I mean they had one a few years ago that they did with Ronald Reagan where they had a fake speech and this was way way before the internet and someone had pieced together fake collaboration of a bunch of different Ronald Reagan speeches and then used them with sound editing and turned it into a whole statement that he never gave before and then the White House went on television and showed how they did it and showed on the news all the different speeches that they pulled from and this the actual sentence is where they pulled from they showed it to you so there could be no denying someone I forget what it was it was the Russians was it the Russians of course someone had done that but I don't know I don't know who did it millions but it was interesting because I was like oh wow they can do that but I thought you know think about how many times Ronald Reagan is giving speeches you just take listen someone with painstaking detail mark down all the words in those speeches put them all in some sort of a multi loop because it's you know you have to go like to Phil Spector's house they have though oh yeah reel-to-reel sound recorders piece that shit together splice it up and then release it pretend that Ronald Reagan is trying to start a war with Iran or something yeah man I forget what it was do you remember the premise no I don't remember the prim to that but I you know that the recording I don't I kind of remember it but it's a foggy memory man it's pretty wild but this is like to me of fuck the Sun and all the things to worry about this shit is really intense man like you know about the hostage the fucking weird hostage phone thing people are doing or they're like you get a phone call from the phone number of your wife and you answer it and it's like we've kidnapped your wife you know it's someone freaking out in the background they're like send us money or she's fucked and like they've been right now what they've been doing is they've been you know someone will say let me talk to her and they just hand it to some lady who's like do you think oh my god it's her I'll give you whatever you want people have been sending the money you know and like when you consider like what happens when deep fake technology intersects with just the ability to like call people from spoofed numbers and that suddenly if someone gets your phone number list they're gonna be able to call your friends as you and record conversations whereas they sort of dredge up you know who knows whatever they want maybe they want to blackmail you maybe they want to get money maybe they want to embarrass you that to me is like so spectacularly fucking weird that we're gonna end up having to have passwords that we tell each other away from her Alexis which is like listen if I call you and I'm seeming strange you know the password is like go for 69 otherwise it's not me you know because that's gonna that's a reality I mean just look what people are already fucking doing with spoofing numbers mm-hmm that's fucked up man and like that that aspect of it and also just like supply and demand in other words there's one Joe Rogan right right now but if an AI starts duplicating you and improving on you like and I'm saying you know five or ten years no offense man but maybe an AI could like turn you twice as smart you know make you like whatever who knows what and then suddenly you're no longer in demand since that once the Joe Rogan AI package goes on the dark web or makes its way into wherever people are gonna just be able to download you and have conversations with you and make video you don't know that to be is the what are the most bizarre realities that we are entering into is one where you're gonna go on YouTube there's gonna be a video of you looks like you sounds like you but it's like 50 times funnier than you 50 times cooler than you 50 times smarter than you because it's an AI pulling from the internet it's just you but better than no one's gonna want to watch you anymore they're like I want to watch I love the railroading but I want to watch the Rogen whose brain is functioning 50 times the speed of a normal human brain because that guy wow that's so they're gonna take over well that's all obsolete where you're versions of all of us they're gonna be like invasion of the Body Snatchers yeah that's right that's right man and that's not I mean I'm say even let's say it's 20 years away that's still to fucking season hundred let's go crazy yeah we're gonna be basically like sort of drowned out by multiple versions of ourselves with exponential intelligence well that was my concern when I was talking to Kurzweil about downloading your consciousness into a computer I'm like what's to stop you from making multiple copies if you can make one copy yeah like which what's to stop you from being like tell me some fat guy with a little dick who's a real asshole wouldn't hack into the system and infest it with copies of him yeah that just overwhelms everyone else's data where he is omnipotent and he is literally the ruler of the realm that he exists in yeah yeah cuz he's figured out how to hack into the grid and take over imagine you think you're gonna be in heaven you're gonna enter into this virtual reality but look you're gonna get to what fly dragons and have sex with beautiful women and eat fruit and this fat guy with a little dick he hacks the system and then everybody's gonna suck his dick and everywhere you go as a version of him is trying to eat you suck his dick come on ya fuckin people's ears and he's up holding people down five six of them on a person just fucking you from every angle by that's what he created and this I mean that's what the computer virus is sure it's fucking everybody right if you think about that that most there's a lot of viruses I don't know what what percentage of virus is Jamie you'd notice are not financially motivated there's got to be some viruses that people create just to fuck people right in the old days for sure man I mean I think no yeah they were just there to fuck up your computer fuck up you they didn't they weren't worm they weren't grabbing data they use it against you they're just like you know shutting your computer down it'd be a dick yeah or making it say weird things like you know real basic the old viruses in the days of AOL remember those man they're cool they were like scary but not like today where they like shut down the power grid until you send somebody a million dollars worth a Bitcoin all you have to completely remap your hard drive completely re-upload your operating system it just kills every only way you're gonna kill the operating systems swipe it clean start from scratch sorry it's all cooked yeah all your work fuck off gone gone man just like this fat guy with a little everybody hundreds of them a sea of them running at you pulling on their half hard dick well there's a story going around this weekend about Samsung TVs having viruses in them and you're being able to scan it for a virus there's like a program on it that allows you to scan for viruses and then I guess today Samsung deleted that tweet oh these was pointing back to this being an active weeping angel program where the CIA can use your TV to listen to your conversations and they are doing that and they're recording it leapin angel what a great name why doesn't the CIA start dating the fucking Navy UFOs weeping angel why do they call it that why do they call what is that that's why why do they have to bring angels is that Satan is Satan a weeping angel is that what they're saying like what the fuck is that and weeping angel that's weird man that's fucking weird but like you know the implication that they in your deep fake they sent out that the world was it already happened you know they're like how do you know this hasn't already happened in other words like how do we know we're not duplicates how do we know we're not one of an infinite number and array of like you know versions of us that are being populated all over some server somewhere could be well that's the thing about the simulation theories that one day we if things keep going the way they are like then I was gonna bring this up when we're talking about people like looking at cities and looking at the grids and looking at the hive like what is what are these cities doing well they're spreading and they're being productive they're making things and they make me better things all the time well if they're making better things all the time like what what are they interested in well they're interested in computers and CGI and artificial intelligence and artificial life and and they're all definitely moving in some sort of a greater technological dependency like we're pretty dependent now but it's gonna get greater and greater right yeah we'll get more and more well one one day they're going to have a reality that isn't tangible in the sense that without this system you wouldn't be able to experience it but it will be a reality once you're in the system once you're in the system you will feel your elbows on the oak desk you will feel the sweat on your palms you'll feel the sunglasses on your nose you'll feel all those things yeah so who's to say that that's not real well that can happen one day if they can create an artificial reality that you cannot discern from the reality that you're currently experiencing how do you know it hasn't already happened right you don't you don't and you know some super fucking smart people think that we should keep open the possibility that that is what we're operating under or that the stability and the rigidity of the dimension that we exist in is not nearly as firm and not nearly as permanent as we like to think it is right which is one of the reasons why psychedelics is so exciting and so there's there so there's hope they're transformative but they're also they're valuable but they're also they illuminate the possibility of others of other things other dimensions other life-forms other other levels of consciousness of other ways of interacting with each other especially mushroom well I kind of all of them all of them that when you take the transformative dose you experience some weird thing we like oh this is possible to like this is like a whole nother way of existing like who's to say that if human neural chemistry right if that's what's causing depression and elation and dopamine and serotonin and all these different wonderful things it's what caused melatonin it's all these different things that happen when you're sleeping and then the psychedelic ones like the DMT who's to say that we have to exist with this mixture right who's to say that life with a thicker mixture isn't also possible and might be going on around us all the time like there might be these porous sort of entry ways into these other dimensions that are consistently open and closed and they're constantly around us all the time but when we're when we're just in straight normal consciousness that we experience without perturbing it with alcohol or pot or psychedelics we want to think that this is reality this is rigid this is it but maybe it's a reality yeah there's a fuckload of them maybe when you make decisions you enter into different ones maybe you're constantly shifting the one that's around you and how you interact with people you mean like your decisions are the way you navigate through the multiverse it's entirely possible yeah yeah man I don't say that too many times well we it is a thing if you if you if you just think about how little we understand about consciousness about what happens when you die what happens when you sleep well how little we know about what what is going on when you're communicating with people what is going on when you're interacting with what we are these fucking ideas coming from yeah are these ideas little life-form in an anon observed state yeah man bro you take off the glasses I just realized I don't get to look at your beautiful eyes Joey I was enjoying this we did it for hours um stop right here that but that you know man like the when you start the thing you're saying about psychedelics kind of like showing you a different way and that when you're in a base reality state you people spend a lot of energy trying to imagine a solidity that isn't really there and like you know as I've been taught by some people that you know you if you start breaking it down just logically for exactly you know your past for example you know you ever do that spend any time with your memories and you realize like well no your most vivid memory whatever it may be mm-hmm you can't really taste what you're eating or feel the euphoria that you were feeling or the fear you were feeling or whatever because if you did then you the memory would not work for a person who was trying to like stay alive because you if you just remember the last time you got punched in the face you would feel it you know and also if you could remember tastes you wouldn't be so inclined to eat because you could just go back and think to the last chocolate bar you a and you would taste it or obviously if you could remember orgasms as they are you wouldn't really need to fuck you would just think about having sex whenever you had it and you would come you would feel like you're coming so if we look at memories experientially there's a lot of like senses that aren't gratified by memory and also if you look at them from the visual field even the most profoundly quote photographic memory is wavery at best it's not HD it certainly wouldn't be a 4k TV it's got it kind of like quality to it that it's just you know it flow it's just a little transparent so then when we think about the future obviously that doesn't exist like it's there's no future that's nothing is outside of this point in time and so then now you've basically just from a simple analysis of your memories which a lot of people imagine that's who they are like they're a snake in the present moments the head in the back is the past with all their memories sort of intertwine but you realize like no that's really foggy approximation of what happened at best and you really don't remember most of the shit you did anyway like you don't remember what you ate three days ago ten days ago so then you realize your whole past the thing you've been using to define yourself as a person you barely remember in the parts you do remember it they're not really clear so that's gone now that's death you're dead anything that happened before this moment that's death it's gone there's just this for real that's not now there might be some neurological encoding but there's no past forget it that's why people like to get really good at things you know well you mean it gives them a sense of stability that's why if you have a physical skill like say you could do gymnastics like yeah you know Chapelle Lacey no funny up-and-coming new comic but he was a world champion cheerleader like like crazy skills and he's jacked built like a linebacker well don't like oh I don't know football defensive back running back anyway stud could do a backflip just jump through the air and land you're like wow like what the fuck yeah right when he does that he knows that he had those experiences yeah learned how to do that he has a skill he has a very unusual skill yeah like like a breakdancer they know they can do that crazy shit where they can hop around on one arm yeah their feet up in the air crisscross and going into the lotus position that how many people can do that they can do that make it do it that defines their existence in a way yeah because now they're not just living in the moment they also have knowledge I spell crazy yeah fucking nuts dude there's one that he sent me I'll send it to you Jamie where he flips a girl through the air look at that shit you do flips a girl through the air and then catches her on one hand and presses her above his head crazy dude it's fucking bananas bananas banana so he knows that he can do those things he knows he can do those things he learned those things yeah those things carry him they defined you they give you extra value yeah you can hold on to them as a support like a security blanket in this crazy world hey I can play the piano motherfucker let me get on the piano I'm gonna show everybody at the party I'm deep and I think I exist I'm real trying to give something but trying to spray something out in the world that people like to smell so they come closer to my flower that's right man you deserve more Duncan you can sing and I should sing all the time everywhere oh thank you just sing you shouldn't even talk you're an angel I know the way you sing is amazing well I trained for five years I just like to sit around and listen to you have you ever been in a party where somebody breaks out a guitar and actually sings a song like Animal House style that scene is amazing yeah I have I'm trying to I think that if that has happened it's one of the memories my brains like we're not gonna remember that we're not carrying that with us cuz it would look because it's totally a hostage situation let's face it like once they sit down start strumming that shit if you're the guy who walks out look at that fucking hater he can't play guitar as egos being challenged when the reality is you're like I don't want to deal with it man I don't want to deal with all the levels of having to face the fact that you fired a neuron that made it seem okay that in the middle of a party where nobody was playing music or maybe music was playing you turned it off dude I know of a guy who in the middle of a football game pause the game to show his acting reel what well that's just lunacy that's it no that's someone who's like sick paused the games just a broken man a woman paused the game to show an act shambling is my new real man you guys got to check yourself the game can wait seriously guys the game cool he did a great job you're gonna get a great pleasure out of watching me fake watch me fake now I'm a detective look at me we gotta go dude it's it's it's a hunger because it's this is this is the I mean it's like you're talking about backflips it's like imagine the self is so the self is so imaginary that we have to exert to the point of doing backflips to give us a sense that the self must be as we think it is it's that's right like you don't have to exert to be sitting in a chair gravity does it for you there's no energy that needs to be exerted but how often do you hear someone saying what a great day that's a great day it's a great day amazing but why are you saying it like why do you feel the need to exert this much energy to announce to me it's a great day hmm could it be that you're not quite certain it's a great day could it be that there's a feeling in you that something's a little amiss so you got a like paint reality with words to make it okay this isn't a ghost story he's not gonna die isn't or is by saying it's a great day are you putting out this hope that I'm gonna go Wow Duncan such a positive guy he's amazing yeah when he says it's a great day I feel it is a great day he puts me in a better mood thanks Duncan yeah I mean I think if you look at like any time I've done that shit I'm too high I'm getting paranoid and I'm trying to get some affirmation from a friend you know that's usually the feeling is one of mede like you know like when you're around someone you realize like they want me to compliment them right now they and you feel that like when they were they open the fucking doors and a spaceship you faves temporarily open the doors of the infinite vacuum about worse when they get upset and you don't compromise yeah wow that's the craziness Duncan I've known you for a long time you've never come my art I said castles are my life and I know you know you know you don't even say they're cool they're fucking great man okay you sank castles on credit I mean you know just weird that I have to tell you yeah I know I'm sorry man you're great you're great you're ill we worship you will worship you forever you'll be known forever as the great sand castle maker that's a fuddy fig it can also add to that that the very same sort of person who is intent on getting you to acknowledge their fucking sandcastles which is a great description of it because no matter what you're doing it's a fucking sand castle look at those glaciers whatever you're doing forget it but then you have these people who on top of this sick need for a person to affirm their existence by complementing their ridiculous sandcastle art they also want to leave a legacy it's like they it's not enough that we worship you now you want generations of people to worship you that's a big one for people leaving a legacy it's a big one for artists big one for athletes athletes want to leave records that no one will break that's right leave a legacy behind man this to me this is like being a dream and wanting to leave a memory of yourself in a dream you know like you want your I want my two people I met in that dream I want their kids to be talking about me after I wake up it's like when you die you know it's done we don't know exactly what's after this but you're pretty much recycled man there might be some karmic momentum there might be some kind of wing some residue and trace all over again repeat them scratch I often got one cells two cells three and then you just keep doing infinity to get it right keep that loop going keep that loop going like where we're essentially in some kind of like karmic sanding mechanism but if you like life why wouldn't you want to do it again there's enlighten it wasn't if you like life do you like life yes if you found out that this was what you were going to do forever and ever and ever and it's gonna repeat itself over and over and over again would you know it's pointless it's pointless now and it's finite is it different if it's pointless that's infinite is it different it's different don't you just enjoy life is that the key the key to just enjoy life that's where it's ironic when you pick up a skill like learn to play the piano or learn to do back flips or in my case learn to do martial arts is that you actually become a better person through learning how to do something because it's hard so you learn about yourself you learn who you are you learn the bullshit that you tell yourself like to really get good at something like if you want to get that good it's doing backflips man you got to fucking actually practice you can't bullshit yourself well it really don't need to come in to do with that guy can do you got a fucking practice and by practicing you put yourself through this rigid exercise routine and you do it correctly and you exert yourself and you have it requires 100% of your focus and in doing so whether it's playing piano or throwing kicks or whatever the fuck it is in doing so you understand yourself better yeah so even though ironically you're kind of defining you who you are as a person and you're giving yourself like extra clout because you're a you're the fucking man at dunking a ball into a net I'm the fucking man everybody watch and watch that swoosh but by doing that you actually learn how to become a better person too because it's hard because it's hard to do and then if you can figure it out the puzzle will help you get a better hold of all your human skills because it would be a difficult thing if you really want to get good at something if you really want to leave behind a legacy like you have to achieve a level of focus and a level of intense thinking and concentration that most people are just gonna peter out before they get to that spot sure I mean that's what I love about what you're talking about is it's a force field in between you and an elite like fuck the Illuminati the force field of the learning curve separates every single person from a terrain that cannot be reached with money like I don't care how rich you are if you want to learn how to do a backflip you might be able to pay for great trainers but you still got to do the fucking bet work you've got to do the work hundred percent so this is cool because now you enter into a realm that is inaccessible by money is inaccessible by power but is weirdly generally accessible by anybody in other words the only thing keeping you from whatever the fucking thing is you want to get good at to show yourself that it is possible to leave the reality that you're in and enter a completely different reality because for me if suddenly I was in a world where I could do fucking backflips might as well be an alternate dimension like if I got at home and did a backflip in front of my wife she would it would be that she would probably be more amazing if I like levitated you know what I mean she'd be like what the fuck have you done well you've you've reality must be fragmenting so it's like in other words the you wherever you're at whatever the thing is that you you are there's always this interesting mountainous rugged terrain separating you from a completely different universe where you can do backflips play the piano play the guitar whatever the fucking specific thing it is you want to pick up that's kind of cool to me it's like the only thing keeping you from it is consistency it's not money usually unless it's like you want to be a falconeer or some shit you got to get a falcon but in general you know you could like that's why I love about that Goggins man I like that guy like you it's weird how much he impacts me even though I'm at one point I thought someone was running next to him filming him before I realized it was a car and I'm like I want to know he's filming God study yeah I see I realized I was disappointed cuz I thought there was an anonymous an anonymous guys running getting no credit it's probably Zeon say but you know that's that to me that's kind of why I love that because it's like it's equal access no one is being barred from the learning curve now the specific learning curve you might be getting barred from you know what I mean like you want a mug one it's eight thousand fucking dollars okay like you're not gonna get now you're not gonna learn to play that if you don't have that kind of money what's a mug one it's like something that fell out of a spaceship that I'm obsessed with the like it's just this beautiful synthesizer man Oh like it's yeah fell out of a spaceship dude I have to piss so bad can you talk to Jamie and then I'll let you piss yeah no you have to pee too right how did you know man cuz I could tell shared mine cuz I'm wriggling you're moving a little funny yeah yeah who wants to pee first you wanna pee first what a fucking gentleman you peed first because if you announced it you gotta go I think I can wait okay I'll be right back okay great as I looked us up the mug one yeah forget it what do you what MOOC you have a mug right now though right I got a sub 37 but um the you know the mug one is polyphonic and the sub 37 is monophonic so you can't really play chords on it but it's not just that it's like the whole I mean it's a cult around these scents because they did figure out a way to dial in this perfect specific beautiful sound that once you even I mean if you like playing music which you know I just do is that you play because I feel like I asked you this is like a year ago what you just play for yourself most like you just like to sit in a room yeah and turn off the lighter put on mood lights yeah ever and just make your own music instead of listening to what people are making for you to listen yeah well I mean I like both but I just I like the with cyntha use achill synthesis I really look there's like a weird kind of philosophy behind it which is not only do you not have to worry about making you know whatever it is um an album or something but it kind of like allow yourself a break from imagining you even need to be musical just like you know you give kids pots and pans and they fucking bang it together it's just fun a friend of mine Billy Mays the third yeah he's actually the son of Billy Mays he travels around playing music as a an under name called infinite third and he does a thing called mouth counsel it just sounds like almost what you're doing where he takes a loop pedal has a microphone he starts and makes a sound and then he passes it around to the next person it's like you have it you make a sound yeah and Joe would make a sound and then by the end of the eighth person nine person thing he knows how to use the pedal enough that it becomes basically a song almost like a song it's just a droning Lou so it's not really ya know musical but it's it's almost like this and he does very similar things with by himself it gets real cool but it's just like like what you're saying though it's it's not music to listen to necessarily got structure yeah it is it's to have on and like the background sort of and like yeah whatever you're doing really okay it's like yeah I think it's just like you know you could be whoever this is is clearly a great what up musician but also you can just enjoy dialing in these like insane howling alien noises for no reason other than you just are trying to make sounds and that's it I mean it really is like you take that and combine it with most any psychedelic marijuana and what you have there is the ultimate fucking spaceship essentially that you're just like it you don't need we're just talking about how it's not idea behind this as you can get good at it and these things are so precisely dialed in that if you wanted to be like the you know they teach you music just from interacting with it but also there's just this visceral like pleasure of making noises through sense you know oh yes I have to think what would happen if you got sucked into this world like his only deal it's me don't drill what my evil on me Ricky Bobby I would like to put that evil on you that'd be fucking cool if you start playing off playing quake how to swear off of it was playing it again again I now it's hours a day hours when you ask me you texted do I play quake and I got the same feeling you get when you have a friend he's like gone sober and they're like asking you go get a drink yeah man I had a problem playing hours a day and I just went cold turkey might stop what are you doing I'm gonna go take nur I'm gonna piss so how long does it take you to piss with that suit on this is depends on where I'm at like in a combat situation first but in general it takes like 30 minutes or so and I'll be back great this whole episode 1313 was 100% Duncan's idea I get this text message from hey man can I do episode 13 13 just do the finger at the window I'm like fuck yeah you can I need I need to do that with universe that I wasn't asked if you guys have planned it yeah well we planned episode 666 that was also his idea those the last time he wore a Pope outfit and I wore my white NASA outfit I have a white NASA outfit and an orange one that was awesome um but yeah 1313 is a real thing but we aren't really on 1313 because just like podcasts on planes in there out 70mm a shows my companion's yeah yeah that's a crazy number what you guys are talking about anyone an interrupted conversation but this has sort of just come out to help with the deep fake stuff adobe's announced that they've got a tool that they've I don't know how well it works right now they just show a picture so they don't show it an action or anything but it's a way to de tell if a photo has been manipulated with Photoshop oh I'm wearing keep that off those Instagram hoes nobody knows that anybody looks like you know I mean do those this some Instagram people literally look like cartoons like you look at their photos you're like what are you what you're not that's not a picture yeah I've never fucked with the abbath face-to-face toon I think is a lot of people use really you can just draw some guys where you do it yeah for sure they do their whole face is blurry it's like what's happening yeah I put my glasses on closer out I'm like what are you you're spray paint weirdly rosy cheeks yeah your spray person well spray what we're talking about Instagram filters like AI Dobies new AI tool can spot when a face has been Photoshop yeah so saying that keep that off to Instagram hose yeah you got like a knowing that one Instagram person who is actually a CGI she's like oh her that yeah people didn't know her name yeah well they're saying they gonna do that the models now you know they do that with houses like sometimes you look at a picture and you're like what it's wait a minute is this real and like under construction currently will be completed summer of 2020 like so this is not a picture of a house he's a CGI house yeah this you got shadows and the floor has texture I mean it looks fucking real man yeah I've seen some real ass looking houses and that's you know real estate agents using that shit why wouldn't like a clothing designer have like the perfect body to complement their perfect clothes you know yeah that uh I'm sure you've shown this on your billion times but yeah that you're talking about the AI that just generates people yeah that sheiks fake models beautiful perfect people yeah every way mm-hmm yeah in every way I agree every way perfect in fact it's funny that some people trip out about people that look really good on Instagram and they say they're they're giving off unrealistic body images hmm and that this is something we should stay away from unreal it's like that guy from Vox was doing that about he's got everybody's hating on him because he's saying that about gay thirst traps that they they put out unrealistic body images and that you should think about them the same way you think about cigarette ads or or liquor hats yeah exactly what no they're in shape unrealistic is such a crazy thing to say when you're actually looking at a real person yeah unrealistic body expectations um no that guy goes to the gym and that's what you look like when you go to the gym that is real that's really not just realistic that's real it's not unrealistic some people don't want to look at other people that look good I read this article by a therapist who is saying like that was the other one till you posted that dad bods are more attractive to women than rock-hard abs survey said the that survey said was in front of their fucking fat husbands 100% said used millionaires you know did they well it's the Chris Pratt and Leonardo DiCaprio as well Chris Pratt is not have a dad bod he's sticking his stomach guys been silly huh that guy's jacked media I meet him in real life he's he's a stud who's the other guy you know Caprio yeah yeah do you think that dad bod you know like you hear this like you usually find out this way down the line but like some phenomenon society was like cooked up in a boardroom right like for example let's say I don't know you made Twinkies and you realize like shit man people like really getting of this ketogenic diet and working out and there could be a potential you probably have some AI saying like hey we've got like a health craze predicted for 2021 meaning Twinkie sales are gonna drop by like 50% cuz guys don't want to they don't want to be fat right and so then you start disseminating into the world like alright let's come up with this thing what so what's a way to call somebody out of shape but like to connect it to their virility because they're a dad bod yeah dad bod so then you start getting it out there like you know it helps if any product that is like bad for you kind of depends on two things one that it tastes fucking good and two that you can trick yourself into believing it's worth eating right like it needs those two things like in other words if there was like delicious uranium like some lunatic created like the sweetest most flavorful uranium biscuit you're not gonna eat that shit you know you're gonna go Chernobyl the fucking oh your stomach's gonna melt at the dinner table but if you could come up with like you know a nice IPA like you were saying or some kind of thing that's oh it's just poison basically it's gonna destroy your liver over time it'll be a slow progression and you could like sinking alcoholism you know your personality will change and it'll look nobody would do that yeah don't even know what you're saying right now they go no one's gonna do that such a stupid premise no-one's gonna drink poison slowly toxified your liver shut who would even do that shit man I would never do that I mean I drink as I'm sophisticated and then like you did you by the way read that shit about how like hangovers or brain damage like when you have a hangover and you get better your brain hasn't recovered yet just a part that you could sense has gotten better but the you have like physiological damage that's happening of course like it's weather when you read it you're like wait you die of course so it's fun it's fun to be drunk to beat your heart of the problem it's fun to be drunk oh my god it's fun to be lit if it was joke ah I mean that's one of the realities of any great thing is like it is a delight and it is a beautiful part of life for many people but we at some point you just start tricking yourself I mean that's one of the things McKenna I love these said it's like how history has survived alcohol like we managed to have that as our sacrament and still we have civilization Wow it's incredible because it didn't like it does turn people into fucking 28 days later doesn't it well in some flow some people it does but it's really interesting when you consider his idea that at one point in time there were psychedelic cultures that really didn't have our standard intoxicants right so they didn't have antidepressants they didn't have stimulants yes it was something like coca leaves that they were eating right they didn't have processed cocaine but what they did have was copious amounts of psilocybin yeah lysergic acid then different plant forms there was like a bunch of different things Mayans used ayahuasca DMT there was that uh that shaman where they found his bag they found it was like 2,000 years and how many thousand years old 2500 years old DMT in his bag yeah it's like any fanny pack you find at Burning Man yeah that's hilarious I love when they fly that shit out well you got the the DMT was in that rabbit nose thing right yeah the Fox knows yeah there's only a thousand years old I thought our leading done to that twenty five hundred year old marijuana that just oh yeah that's true - there's a new one yeah so people have been just getting blasted forever the best of course they have been as soon as they found it they're like why would I just go with regular life yeah it's the best but it's it's so wonderful that that's being disseminated in a culture right now it's also people are decriminalizing it all over the place left and right it's slowly starting to happen Colorado first always boom they're on track and now Oakland Oakland decriminalized it as a city they put it as the lowest priority all plant medicines including ayahuasca you saw a Aussies tweet mm-hmm yeah it's amazing but she can't get traction other in Congress like what whoa it's hard it's hard to sell that bill it's hard to sell yeah they'll research and you know maps has been doing amazing stuff with soldiers and you've been to the actual Maps conference yeah I have yeah who's a it was wonderful because it's like these you know it's as much as I love hanging out with you and like my friends you take psychedelics it's really inspiring to be around scientists who are sort of figuring out a way to translate that experience into a data set that can convince legislators to change draconian laws because they're doing the hard work you know you and I we get to go on and on and on about the multiverse and the dmt entities we can make things up we can make things up they can't it doesn't matter if they've taken it and had a real experience where some advanced whatever you want to call it is appeared to them whether a part of their subconscious or an alien and said listen here's what's going on we do this with every planet the first step is we've got to like undercut the hierarchical centralized power structure and we know the only way to really do that is by teaching people that their identity is they think it is isn't quite right if we can expand the human identity selfishness goes away if we can get rid of the problem of trauma and people dealing with trauma by being aggressive to the outside world then over time the circumference of the human identity expands beyond the perimeters of me and into us and if that happens then we can like enter into like a type a civilization or whatever they call it the beginning of a global civilization but first we've got to get the fucking monkeys to climb down from the tree of their selfishness yeah and if we can do that and get it we can lure a few people out of themselves just like getting a buggy out of the tree so that we like people are like wait a minute I don't think I'm just a me I think I'm an I'm connected everything purely interconnected in fact I don't think I'm anything I think what I really AM is the connection between me and others that's where I exist not in this but you are something right because you're very unique like you personally are very unique but you're one of my favorite friends but you're also one my weirdest friends call me they're always tough dude you gotta read this book it's like dude you gotta watch this documentary and we will talk for hours about the crazy shit over but yeah you are very specific like you're very I don't get the same conversation with Joey Diaz I don't get the same conversation if I call Ari yeah everybody has a different thing that they're a so there's something going on that's uniquely you right oh yeah I mean to say yeah cuz otherwise you seek it in nihilism and you like a man to the point right that's not it at all it's that you don't exist in a vacuum it's like that's the main thing and to me like the fundamental problem right now is selfishness it's like when you're mad at someone on the interstate what do they do something selfish when you're mad at someone in your life what did they do something selfish when someone's mad at you what did you do something selfish almost always and like this is the reality is that selfishness is an innate quality of being a human we are a self there is a sense of a self rather and we feel mixed up in it but the what you realize is like you know those fucking times were you authentically not because you're filming it for your Instagram or whatever help somebody and you don't talk about it you just suddenly do it you're not like giving someone money either but you get engaged with a person and you're there and then it's one of my favorite mushroom trips was when I started coming back and I before I really came down I started thinking like what was I doing I was doing something I was being something I was being a human I was being a fuck oh fuck I'm a human but for a second I wasn't a me I had merged into something bigger than me similarly if you just get really engaged in helping people you'll notice that for that amount of time you don't feel quite as shitty and it's not just because you're doing something good and there's some like angel casting blessings on you it's because you got out of yourself for a second in the sense that you became more than just you you are you and the person you were helping and that to me is like a really interesting aspect of where we're as a species is that the reality is man yeah we're all special and beautiful and wonderful but also you're not happening in a vacuum you're completely inexorably interconnected with everything and you can't get out of that you're in it for real and the boundaries you've constructed around you and whatever you think the rest of the world is they're just in your head it's not real you made it up you told yourself a story and you believe that story so much like the poor motherfuckers are getting like the most psychotic cults you know where at the end of ten years they reveal to use some crazy crazy shit beyond crazy you spent like nine hundred thousand dollars in this fucking thing and they're like yeah we all got shit out by woolly mammoths and now you have to be like I could either believe this and dive in or I'm like fuck I was wrong all this time similarly most people have constructed this ridiculous armoring boundary around them based on you know this is bad and this is good and that's not good and that's good and here I am in the midst of it and that's a real painful situation to be in because it's you have to fucking constantly exert that forcefield situation and it's really I think why so many people are depressed and exhausted and can't really relax because how can you relax if you're constantly in a state of creating an imaginary barrier between you and infinity called yourself it's a really exhausting probably practice to be engaged in and there's some people who impose themselves on other people they make their life and their problems 100 percent of the focus of this other person so that person becomes an enabler you see that with husbands and wives and times or even with friends like one person is the active asshole then the other person is the fixer-upper man Mike fucked up again I gotta go get them active yeah asshole centralization man and it's like our whole from like our family structures usually to like the entire way we run our government is usually centralized around one key identity and that we in you know we've had this conversation many times on the show which I like the preposterous nature of a king a president a Pope a bishop a world leader a teacher whatever the fuck it is it's preposterous and it's also quite dangerous you know because it's like not only do we have the situation of the parasitic friend but even worse you can get into the situation of the CRA's matic friend who's tricking you into doing so into the idea that you could do something called cosmic hitchhiking that's what chögyam trungpa calls it which is basically the idea that like I'm gonna use you because you are so great and you will be the thing that helps me become a real person it's an illusion one yeah you are our teacher we worship you Oh show us the way imagine being born the Dalai Lama so from the jump you're something special you have the chosen one and the one you're the reincarnation of who were they supposed to be are there a Tulku is what it's called so it's the toll ku system and the way it would work would be you know because you have like if you look at the history of Tibet it was called the Hermit Kingdom and it was closed off from the rest of the world it's very hard to get in there seven years in Tibet is about somebody you made it through and became friends with the Dalai Lama as a kid anyway so within this system there is this idea that beings reincarnate and that if you're awakened enough if you're like really liked it the sort of last phase of this sort of what would you call it the cycle you were talking about earlier then you stop losing at least some of the amnesia that happens when you get processed through the liminal in between period called the Bardo between this incarnation and the next so anyway they go to children they put in front of them the particular items that belong to the previous incarnation that they think they are Oracle's Vision visionaries bring the monks to a particular village and then the kid picks it and then that pick kid becomes the next this or that it's called a Tulku how many kids they looked at I don't know man I don't know the depths of it it turns out to be an asshole I think his powers away well I think it has happened where toll coos are like it's similar to like what the fuck is the what is the thing where those kids get one summer to go like the summer of fucking what is that religion yeah that's Amish that's uh Rumple spring uh Rob Springer yeah what does that there's a great documentary on that yeah something The Devil's something Devils it's like a great name The Devil's summer but it's just like the devil's playground fuck in the smoke and then a lot of them come back whoa what feel empty I believe that was one of the ways they studied the impact of MDMA it wasn't it by like because like these like if you find someone who's taking MDMA but no other drug it's pretty rare so you need to find a person who's only taking MDMA otherwise you can't it's like assess there's some cognitive damage because it could have been acid it could have been the mushrooms it could have been the time you fell on your ass when you're hammered who the fuck knows but these kids some of them have only taken him DMA and so I believe that they use them as a sample to like determine if there was any kind of neurological damage caused by the the drug itself but so I think it's simpler phenomena happens within that system where some kids are like I'm not a reincarnated being I'm a musician I wanna go play music and they leave do you know who's a musician who's also reincarnated being Jimi Hendrix Steven Seagal what yep when did that happen I didn't know they had told him I think the Dalai Lama might have hooked him up told him why one of those guys over there told them that he was the reincarnation of someone super special Jesus God it's a big deal over there well then they had a ceremony and everything for my seven this is the long written thing about about it well that's a lot of work I know the recognition of Steven Seagal as a reincarnation of the treasure revealer chung dragged dorje Wow of that pile you'll monastery yeah so he's a reincarnation well that's comforting to know he's always been with us you know because it's like one of the things that does bother me is to imagine a world without Seagal you know so it's cool to know he's always been here coming back again and again how come nobody was ever a loser in a past life oh that it was always a fucking no awesome oh you mean oh right yeah when I win a little full of shit you know what it if you're making money as a fucking psychic and you're like whoa you're basically like a gutter rat you were you've only been a rat you've known filth you weren't even you're a mucus thing like I'm not sure what you call it a kindness jellyfish that killed babies you're a tapeworm you're one of those long worms that went into someone's brain and trichinosis motherfucker you're uncooked pork you are a moth you were yeah yeah the whole like to me like the whole reincarnation is a toku yeah I told you it's a statement from the guy I'm recognized my student Steven Seagal as reincarnation toku of the treasure revealer chung dragged or jays this has been some confusion uncertainty as to what this means I'm writing to clarify the situation no clarifying necessary I'll see you later man I gotta go bullshit girls got five hookers going this guy's house right now as we speak well also the other so there's talk of like ending the Tulku system and the Dalai Lama has even said that and recognizing that because what school among many things is that he said you know if sign is very rational and he said if science proves something in Buddhism is off will change Buddhism to fit the rational mind that's the beauty of Buddhism there's pageantry in it there's ceremony there's ritual in it just like any other religion it's beautiful personally I think that there is a sort of area of experience accessible through their practices that I guess could best be compared to psychedelics or something like that but to me what I love about it is all the pageantry aside and all of it aside is not faith-based it's a very basic series of ideas that you have to digest you have to think about you have to look into you don't just get to be it it's like you know maybe some forms of it there could be an example of that but in general it's more along the lines of here's the basic fundamental principles behind this knot and the cup in the cording of a human life then we've discovered here's where some suffering is coming from all the suffering in fact and here's how to fix it that's the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism and that just hearing it who gives a fuck you could hear a life is suffering the cause of sufferings attachment get rid of attachment suffering ends here's the system to get rid of attachment and you know whatever life is suffering was I didn't fucking mean what is life is even mean what does it even mean by suffering this this first noble truth it gets completely mistranslated anyway dukkha it means wobbly wheel it's more akin to like if you're riding a bike that's got not enough air in it it's gonna be a rough ride but it's gonna be even more of a rough ride if you have somehow tricked yourself into thinking there's enough air in the tire so that anytime you hit some bumps you're like what the fuck is wrong with the world that's it that's it it's like wobbly wheel the things wonky you think you're not gonna get disconnected when you've been on the line with Verizon for an hour you're gonna get disconnected it tends to happen you're gonna get cut off in traffic you're gonna fail you're gonna be disappointed this is reality but somehow you've imagined that it doesn't work like that and every single time you're met with the truth you're like ah oh god this sucks and you know so that's gonna that creates a lot of problems and it creates too some ways to deal with it which is desire and aversion so you're somewhere and you want to be somewhere else basically you know you're you're somewhere and you're like I don't want to be in this place or you know you're imagining that if you get this thing or that thing the pain you're feeling is of the wobbly wheel go away do the experiment see if it's true see if it's true that's all you can do is like really look at the shit that you want like I could come home and mogh could have pulled up and given me seven mug ones right and I'm gonna sit and play those fucking mug ones for weeks and weeks and tell them sweaty and smell like fucking just someone shoved a salami under the balls of an ape you know I'm not gonna probably weeping into the mug and sneezing into it anyway the point is eventually after ice the distraction has gone away I'm going to return to my fundamental self you know the the fundamental condition of existence as it is regardless and so this is sort of the print some of the principles as I understand it which are really quite intelligent you know it's really and what I love about it most of all is there's always this invitation which is go see go see it's not because I'm telling you this believe it right it's like go see maybe it's different for you and and but you need to go check like every time you're doing the thing that you've been repeating over and over again is it making you happy for a row is it really working is it working and if it's working great but if it's not and you're trying to pretend it is because you've been doing it so long well who are you who's winning this game of self-deception what what there's no winning if the game is tricking yourself you can only what and what do you do it how do you feel about life if you're always tricking yourself hey Twitter world yeah man that's right you will only feel that the everyone is trying to trick you and you'll feel like there's a grand conspiracy and you'll feel like the world's out to get you and there is a great conspiracy which is that you are running a game on yourself yeah like we should end with that yeah I think that's very important for people to hear yeah I true and thinking resonates with all of us we've all done that the lowest points of consciousness in your life you've run a little trick on yourself or to get past things where you know and I think in some of that trick is run because you don't totally understand who you are you want to so yeah baby I'm this guy maybe I'm maybe I'm a hardcore Republican yeah you know what those fucking Democrats they tricked me for far too long I'm over here now yeah I found my home found my home over here and that's one of the things that people do they really do they hop remind you I used to be a vegan but now I'm a fucking car to this I just eat all steaks ribeye steaks all day long you know what I couldn't believe what a pussy I was when I was just eating vegetables Congrats that's a lot of it right yeah man and it's and it's almost exactly like what we're talking about with religions that you look down these grids and these grids are run by different operating systems that require different behavior from their women this operating system you can't walk drive dressed like a beekeeper and you have to do this and you have to do that this operating system you put a plate through your lip and you got a bone in your nose and this is this operating system everybody gets face tattoos and this operating system you know and no one eats Peak pork it's oh no no God does not in our operating system you get the same thing I think with right and left with vegan and meat-eater with pick your poison like whatever the fuck it is yeah whatever thing it is that you're into especially ideological especially lifestyle based there's always an opposing one like the people that don't want people to be gay are the people that even a lot of the abortion stuff a lot of the abortion stuff it's like how much of that is how much of this really well-thought-out behavior and how much of it is how does your tribe respond to this and one of the ways you can tell especially we're talking to a hardcore lefty or a Republican for that matter we can offer two examples but one of the ways you could tell is hardcore lefties do not like to discuss late term abortion you say well what if it's a fetus what if it's a baby what if what if we're talking like eight months and like what it's a woman's right to choose it's a woman's right no it's a it's a baby in this person's body like when is it a baby look I'm a hundred percent Pro woman's right to choose I'm 100 percent pro-choice but late term abortions are fucking weird it's dark it's strange and everybody knows that everybody knows that but if you Hardcore left you won't say it and then the hardcore righties what if you were raped whatever what what if you're a little girl a 13 year old girl and she was raped you want that girl to carry her fucking baby are you crazy she was raped four weeks ago we found out she's pregnant what do you want me to do you want me to pray how about fuck you right how about fuck you might raped little girl is not gonna have to carry someone's baby fucking asshole and the idea that your invisible man in the sky that watches over everything you do but allows rape to occur allows little kids to get raped you want that little kid to carry a baby I'll fucking kill you right you're goddamn crazy right there's people that feel like that - well this is if you want to find the comic commonality the common thread it's just the way you were describing which is a natural reaction to someone saying that to you or controlling your life in that way it's aggression so like on both sides it's not that there's an articulation of a point of view it's at the point of view is being flavored with anger with aggression pushing pushing pushing it's a woman's right to choose yeah and it's or it's not or whatever both sides have within a quality of aggression so this is like this is you know not to oversimplify things the reality is man we won we gotta cut ourselves a break and you know this and you've articulated this better than anybody we weren't we were monkeys not that long ago real reason go look at monkeys see how they act crazy right so give a number one give yourself a fucking break you an evolutionary like from the evolutionary perspective you're just barely waking up but because you've been a monkey inside of you there's some serious serious aggression because that was the way to deal with the eagle that was bigger than you that carried your wife away to feed to its chicks you were gonna fuckin have a sit-down with the eagle and be like listen I know you need to live and my wife I imagine she was delicious we've I've been you know farming for the last several years and feeding her every day and you know the baby's gonna die because he was drinking her milk and all eagle but listen I wonder if maybe you could just spare the rest of my family what you're gonna do is kill that fucking eagle any way you can or Spears whatever so now to think that that has gone away is very similar to a person who takes a vacation and suddenly realizes I can't relax well you can't relax because for the last fucking year you've been going nonstop in a state of constant stress freaking out you're on vacation you think that momentum is going to go away no it's just gonna be more apparent so you're gonna pull it down and try to fuck it away but yeah and then you're on the airplane hungover and it's like you know you're fucking and it's like what happened that what the vacation is already over that's what has happened to us which is like listen well I don't we've got it good right now but it wasn't that long ago the saber-tooth Tigers were dragging our children into the fucking jungle and eating them and we find feet that were our kids feet in a bush somewhere and this trauma is in a separate genetically so anyway the point is give yourself a fucking break but the other point is that being said recognize you're being aggressive your approach using anger and intolerance is not working it is as much as Noble as your purpose maybe you want a global civilization of joy whatever the fuck it is it's not working if you're using the exact same momentum that causes the wars that you're hoping to stop right so the first step has to be I think an internal personal exploration to create some not to even get rid of the aggression or be like I'm bad because I'm angrier I'm all that bullshit but to create some to find out what is the circumference of the self and then within that you realize the thing you thought was all of you that coiled up fucking anger is in fact a tiny piece of you it's still there and it's still useful at times but it's not all of you and because the circumference is widened the next time the angry part of you starts bubbling it's just like it's the difference between somebody throwing a brick and a bathtub and a brick in the ocean it's like a brick in the ocean no big deal a brick in the bathtub fuck you to twice [Music] so that's that's the ideas like we're not trying to annihilate the self or say this this person this human being you are it's irrelevant or it's not worth this or that it's just what is the circumference of your identity and and that's the exploration I think that gets that Buddhism invites people to do or any religion that is real and good it's inviting people like find out what you are and then as a natural byproduct of that exploration you become a little more gentle and because you're gentle you're more effective that's where it gets really weird gentleness seems to be quite often the what was my friend saying he's like you know if my dogs are outside I'm like get that fuck at that fucking house they're not coming in but if I'm like come on come on I love you and you really mean it they come running into the house so this is the thing is like the aggression stuff it worked man because of the Eagles and the Tigers and all that shit but you know what I mean now maybe there's a new way yeah we and we're stuck we're stuck with the DNA that sir got us through how to survive yes and the Tigers that we needed it yeah we needed it don't fucking bitch you know don't like or a violet or something like in fact love it I think that's part of the appeal of the dadbod part of the appeal of like you know someone talking about unrealistic body expectations you you're really talking about like less reliance on the the flesh the the the the virility the athletic ability the ability to conquer you know the ability to to breed and spread your genes and fight off predators and enemies and invaders it's not nearly as necessary as it used to be but necessary but necessary and but the people who are not capable of it despise it because they think it's the problem they think the ability to conquer is the problem yeah this the the strong and if everyone was weak it's essentially the argument for socialism you know what's that well you don't have it if you don't have it you see other people have it like I don't mean anybody should have it how about that oh yeah and it's also part of it yeah I did I mean people have encountered the thing is is like take a person who has some chip on their shoulder about dudes with muscles right if you look at it that didn't happen by itself they weren't it didn't wake up one day like I fucking hate biceps what happened is like people with muscles who were traditionally like ideally like meant to be warriors and protectors in a noble way they've gotten really aggressive like you see and it's not all of them but how many videos have popped up of you know a police officer sure cuz the kid took a doll you know yeah like that video we were talking about yes so it's like so it's so similarly like sometimes what's coinciding with the muscular thing is also a dominant aggressive attitude so the two have become mixed together yes you conflate them yes and it's there's there they're there if you've ever been around people are real fighters usually they're like the most gentle people you've ever super nice people and it's unnerving because you know like Eddie Bravo he's nice man you when I'm around him like I forget that I could just suddenly be dead you know I mean if you didn't forget he'd be nervous around them all the time like you know you're in a great conversation with him enjoying his company and then like you could just that's it yeah so similarly like that this is what happened that so the idea is like you've got a continuum of possible ways that humans express themselves on one side you have the condition of like the noble warrior which is a trained disciplined person who's literally putting themselves in front of others the samurai you talk about it a bunch you know who's fading into the background who doesn't even give a fuck if anybody knows they did anything heroic because they've given up on that it's a very spiritual way of being well then there's also the concern about the warmonger like why does the war monger exists is the war monger like the fire fighter that starts their own fires a lot of the times yes they live for that they live for that experience because that's what they desire yeah yeah if you if you if you want to sell umbrellas you need it to rain yeah yeah well yeah but this is again corruption of of a potential ideal which is like regardless of the fact that we've all kind of like witnessed various examples and pretty much every profession of what it looks like when things aren't so great and imbalanced there's also examples of people who are the opposite of that who are like completely you know in service who like you know how many firemen got fucking incinerated in September 11th man you know and the truth is I can't name unfortunately embarrassingly enough I couldn't name one of them if you paid me to these are people who literally gave their entire life up who went up that fucking thing they didn't think they were coming back down they're firemen they looked at that and they were probably like yeah I'm gonna die I bet I die today but they're like if I don't do it well no one does it so that's an example of how good it can be and why we need it and what it can really be that's a sacred way to be and the exact same is true for pretty much every profession and yet when aggression gets in there it fucks it up it sours it it imbalances it and it's like ultimately completely ineffective you know and it's also another version of selfishness yeah right alright what we're talking about before being the problem the real problem with a naked aggressive behavior naked aggression meaning unprovoked aggression is that it's entirely selfish like I want what you have I take I conquer yeah that that is selfishness in its worse most primal form that's right and on that note we're gonna wrap this bitch up Duncan Trussell you're the fucking man say this and let's do a shrimp raid - where's Chris Ryan's driving that fucking van around the world Chris Ryan is gonna come back here enlighten every really let look at his paycheck every picture he's getting further and further out in the woods I love you buddy love you too bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
