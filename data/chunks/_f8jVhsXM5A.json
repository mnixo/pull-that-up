rose' because then we won't get shit-faced no I told Joe and also it occurred to me there's Joe probably has all this other shit he's not gonna have my thing but I'm not an anti Rosie drink a fucking peanut colada moment presented it go in there you just enjoyed it right yeah it was good I like it's a good summertime beverage would everybody like some Jack Daniels it's single malt Tommy chug this rose a first what does that even mean it's just in one of those barrels you move it around a bunch yeah Yuri barrel that shit a fucking shotgun oh my god I've listened to Jimi Hendrix live machine gun you know that's not goddamn that's that's one of those songs where sometimes you hear it and you just go oh wow like I've maybe maybe been missing out on how good this fucking song is he was conjuring shit up it's just so good that band of gypsies record exactly yes yes yeah I almost just stopped myself insane fucking then I realized where we were that one up on the real radio on the censored radio I don't know but there's this song called yeah that's fucking insane yeah I mean all the stuffs in st. but there's just tone that he hits that just like carves a piece out of your soul when I used to work with Phil Hartman he told me a story about when he was at the whiskey and I think he was a teenager still I think Phil was like 18 or 19 or something then he was working as like a stagehand and his job was to hold up the speaker while Jimi Hendrix was on stage because the stage was so small and the speaker was kind of rocking so he had to stand there stand there and hold up a speaker I said Jimi Hendrix was that his brave little feet in front of me he said it was fucking incredible this is Jesus when Hendrix was just sort of becoming Hendrix I'd be like 1962 let go back over when he died and when you know he would have been like 18 or 19 but I don't she done 1970 okay really appreciate ya damn look at you and cyclop√¶dia aunt Annika Hartman died in like I think 98 so whatever that was those 20 years before that there's a sort of in liked in their early 70s I guess yeah that doesn't make sense actually I wish we can go back in time and experience music like in the 60s and 70s but it was just like everything was new you'd never heard anything like that before right got real drugs weights worse we're the demonic cords been we were talking about this the other day like long but back in like the is just like Renaissance 1600s where it was chords they thought - yeah they're evil like we say they've heard the shit we played today it would be like you'd be burned at the stake fuck that he would have been toast well just the beginning of Voodoo Child right yeah okay well you really stop and think about like there was there was a clear evolution right there was a bunch of shit going on there was Chuck Berry and there was Little Richard and then there was Elvis and there was all these rock and roll guys and then all of a sudden there's a seer up ssin of that and it's Led Zeppelin yeah and it's the WHO and it's Hendrix and it's like people that were just thought to a completely different level Queen yeah Queen in their prime but it's interesting like they all were driven like well Zeppelin was all blues music they just custo lost shit they soul wash it oh yeah that's fucked up isn't it it's fucked up that they are dicks about him but it's not out of the ordinary cuz all those dudes were just playing each other's songs anyway dad is a giant problem with you the guy who created the opening riff to stairway to heaven that's what your song and then you try to do it the other side of that spectrum is really fucked up though too because now you're in this game where like if you play anything remotely sounds like that you'll get sued right and every at this point like I mean I don't rip off songs from other people we don't do that but like you could make us you could write a song and then not know that it had a similar thing right similar melody and somebody could come after you and that fucking was we were just talking about that bitter sweet symphony' song from the verb how they gave all their money to the Rolling Stones yeah because the opening riff was too similar which is it's a sample isn't it yeah it's kind of Andrew Loog Oldham produced the stones and did all this orchestrations for them and they just oh they just sang how does that work though that seems kind of crazy that you give it all the money I don't I don't mind you giving the money I'm sure they didn't give all of it I mean they had publishing on their actual song is that different no the fact is it different like as a musician do you feel like that feels different if someone just uses like or like if someone heard Ice Ice Baby they knew it was under pressure Nick right I mean it's almost like it's not hurting collaboration at that point because your song was inspired by another song and obviously there's credit due for that but it's just an interesting way that the pie gets cut up right and the way people just tenaciously hold on to their piece in this way that I don't know it really bums me out to be I mean obviously you need to get paid and make a living but inspirationally speaking it just the barometer is just so like people just go so far off the course in order to get credit and money for things that it's just bullshit but I think it's so dim you're just talking about that in there it's so difficult to have a career that keeps paying you right yeah if anybody has something that's close to the Sun that's it because that's the only way I'm gonna be in the music business in particular or the I shouldn't say the music business because I never really say the comedy business I would say the comedy world because I think you guys are like the closest to big business in the way like your contracts are you always hear like these nightmare contracts real Jesus like for us we've never made money doing anything but performing so no one ever like got a grip of the other stuff right right like with musicians you guys all made a lot of money selling actual albums back we de musicians could do right but I guess they always went through record labels there's no money in it there's no I mean I should say like a few guys made money like Dane Cook probably made a ton of money because he had the biggest-selling comedy album of all time his was like he's at least platinum it might have went double platinum oh do you paid as an actor at that point or is it is it he meant he must have had a deal with the record company unless he released it himself some people can release their stuff themselves but I don't know okay no but as soon as it gets to be a live DVD there's two options mm-hmm one is you could pay for it all yourself pay for the filming and then sell it to whatever organization whether it's Netflix or what have your common central you could do it that way okay what is this the wolf went platinum yeah see that's uh that's that's huge sales 1 million two hundred fifteen thousand and 1 million two hundred or two hundred and sixty four thousand for the second one that's incredible like for like a stand-up comedian to sell that many albums he was a really know I actually bought them to pay for that oh yeah that's funny I wonder what was number one well it's good question but us comedy number one and oh look he's right there number one oh yeah but at the time the second one yes that's the highest that ever got was number two Oh someone out peak told me positions do live he didn't know records so that was number one on the comedy charts it was number one period oh okay what the fuck would be number two if this was number one this one made it number four and the whole US chart overall wow that's crazy that's huge that's giant um so that's it like I didn't make shit I mean I made some money when I had a record on Warner Brothers in 1999 there's like a space monkey thing no that was called I'm gonna be dead someday my first thing and and then the next one was shiny happy jihad that was ooh and then talking monkeys in space we need to get our collection for the road travel yeah how many albums you guys have no albums true but we just we're releasing solo records this year so it's been like a really interesting like we're working together and separately it's crazy you guys keeping it together you get weird with each other all the time I feel like as long as everyone's kind it's unavoidable and it's like part of the process of dealing with people we act like shitheads and then we have these moments of great communication well that's the end goal but I think I can say that our relationship has made my other relationships in my life so much better because you have to administer patience and listen and really just have you know it's hard for people right yeah well you gotta learn how to be wrong you know and say you're sorry when you fuck up like I'm sorry I was I was wrong I was stupid of me I shouldn't have said that it's also there's a balancing act that some people never achieve of listening to someone and thinking about what they're saying and then responding because of that or just saying what's on your mind like there's like this balancing act or sometimes you just want to say what's on your mind and sometimes you have to like absorb what this person is saying to you and then you have to respect it and address it and try to figure out how as a person that cares about them what's really best way to get out what you're thinking sometimes you don't do and then you have to deal with emotions happening at the same time which completely changed the way you could speak yeah I got a I got a great therapist I love her so much and she you know accepting people is a huge deal and just saying hey you and I have very different truths or like you know not you and I but ever you know anyone and when you're arguing with somebody or you're in disagreement what is true to them could be completely different to you but you you know them if you just fight that and keep fighting that you're gonna be so fucked yeah and and like there's no there's no peace involved in in that scenario so just like accepting your differences is half the battle how do we relay your message to the rest of the conflict sorry we're not to be wrong first and then listen to each other for crying out loud and I think that's so important I feel like people want to be right when you politics right now are just such a shit show and if I try to stay on board I just get so exhausted because it's never-ending there's no there's no moment of peace it's like okay now I'm gonna I'm gonna piss now you're gonna piss now I'm gonna piss and we're just gonna keep pissing and it just doesn't like I don't know I'm really annoyed with all that I can't stand it did you see what that shit shit poster guy Baked Alaska did what he passed he posted a tweet that uh somehow he was proud that the president was shitposting cuz you know you know what the President did with Trump did he took that me slamming the guy with a CNN head mm-hmm and this Baked Alaska guy who's like a famous shit poster do you know a shit posters they say like ridiculous shit and their memes and they fuck with people and they get upset yeah it's pretty funny straight yeah it really makes the world a better place hilarious piece it's fucking funny man he had the funniest meme about Alex Jones and I didn't know it was his and I posted it on my Instagram somebody said it to me I didn't know who it was and I posted it and then he got mad at me and he said it was stealing jokes but if I had known it was his it definitely would have given him credit but the meme is lares it's hot it's him in the hot tub that's the one with alex jones in a hot tub when everybody wants to chill but you're so walk you can't help drop truth bombs it's alex jones in a hot tub with sunglasses on it's just such a perfect meme for Alex that's a real art form the funny meme yeah it really is and it's not there they're getting fucked you want to talk about people getting fucked yeah the creators of the funny meme meme ists yeah feel like there it is people are trying to relax what used to work you just have to drop another truth palm read oh yeah well that might be a filter Mr Graham uses a lot of filters to make you look unhealthy it's not a lot of shaming with the meme stuff though now it's like if you start stealing people's memes you're your target you become but yeah but the problem is a lot of people are still not aware there's a lot of people that have become famous because they have websites and their pages get millions and millions and millions of flowers and all they're doing is stealing people's meetings and some of them have been forced to credit people and some of them just sort of like that fat Jewish guy he just sort of writes the person who created its name in the your big trouble yeah yeah he got caught I mean this would West you don't in my book but it's the Wild West I mean that's what it is yeah it's like no one knew how I mean if you send me something it's really hilarious you know and then like Eddie Eddie Bravo just sent me one on Bill Cosby I don't think I could share it it's fucked up enough I could show it to you but he sends it to me and I'm like ah I don't know the fuck came up with it you know it says you when you realize building a wall fucks you're quaalude supply no I have no idea Eddie does a lot of funny shit he might have made that himself but I don't know who made that you know I mean so like when something like that happens he sends it to me I might send it to Jamie Jamie my senator Brendon well when you make it he might have made my dreams but the point is like how dare you how does someone I mean so easy to make one of those but it's a really funny joke or kind of someone like claim that you put your stamp like you're like a watermark your iconic yes like that seems annoying all the citizens yeah but if you like if you like if you been had a Instagram page and you started putting those memes let's steal them but if you made your own if you just decided you know what between as an exercise in between writing songs I want to write some fucking joke damn it for a little bit Instagram yeah you know I guess I just let it I think I'd struggle with that mmm that's a tough one be an issue right you like these motherfuckers already co-opting other people's images anyway and a lot of the time you phrases and stuff like that it's almost like collage when you got in that little battle with Marc Maron he said I don't know why he said memes are the cancer of our country's imagination I was also reading straight retort though use me I don't think you know exactly what it means sorry I jumped in do it what did you say no he said I sent back kind of like a similarly bitchy thing because I was reading about memes in a different context I was like it is actually that what memes means all the time mark and he was like I knew exactly what it means and I was like that's a really funny thing but then he went on it kind of like drove it home he called me a poetry assassin because you don't agree with his assessment of memes cuz I went back at him I don't know that was a great moment cuz Vernon Reid in living color chimed in and stood out who's my daddy I think we as human beings resist memes of the cancer cells the cultural Oh God and by the way you know what I hate about it the most no capital letter no period no can't do that we were on tour cool man but sorry but you rock like I definitely can't claim any victory pull over we had to pull over so we could figure out what to do just have a black turtleneck and a cigarette holder you should be listening to jazz if you write that nothing yeah it's great but just some people that listen to jazz just so people know they're listening jazz so I just remembered there's this great you said Little Richard and Jimi Hendrix before yeah is this good Jimi Hendrix was in Little Richard's band do you know that oh yeah I forgot about before he was you know what he was thinking and there's this great fucking interview maybe with a little Richard talking about Jimi Hendrix just high as a kite it's amazing and also how about Jerry Lee Lewis Jerry Lee Lewis fucking killed how many wives he said he made my toe go up my boot yes [Music] which is amazing you got to be placed into the dipper and then we'll see your good works and glorify God Jehovah to please that rock and roll I used to be singing rocking getting away be gone just romping and chopping all up on my toes that time he used to make my big toe shoot up in my boobs pause this right here little riches when every gay man should aspire to just be so fucking fabulous that you are undeniable oh good and Freddie Mercury were talking about him earlier you seen those is like mid-seventies shit into bulls my haven't seen any because the do doesn't know he looks like Lord Farquaad if that means anything to anybody buddy but he's tall and he's got the skin tight white suit and his mid-70s and he's gay and his dick is just like like you could just see if you did that now you'd be done you can't do that yes you can is up on stage with their dick hanging out he was in actually hanging out literally you're just like oh there's no like outside of his pants you're saying no yeah it doesn't need to be outside it's a transparent material stuck if if Justin Timberlake did that it would be just it was so different that people were somehow except you know just those a pantyhose like what is he got this like skin-tight bodysuit Ryan what color is it white but how did it make you feel your wife so you're looking at his dick like as if he was wearing like tight underwear right it's beyond like what about stuff like that like what that's a movie about people stripping people anybody could fucking go and then do just like BAM takeout yeah it just shocked me I saw record released this fall pictures were hog tucked up on side of his leg you can't lie about that you can't fake that everybody would know yeah but when you wear underwear he doesn't show like that he probably got hard before the photo that's in and of itself let alone boys of an angel well he does mean put a rubber band around your cock and balls go that's insane that looks like that looks uncomfortable like walk with that definitely was you walk cock out yeah you can't look at the one right there imagine that but if you could see like the outline there you know there's a well if ready no then you know what's real may be a problem let's dick to the right thing that you hang one way you can't really change it right what like I'm right-handed is offensive you don't even have a penis if you were a girl and we were talking about your vagina it would be really gross right every Robert Plant one is dick swinging to the left yeah maybe it's fits that big he's got to like talk it in a leg he's got to choose a leg and he's just gotten comfortable he's got like a groove on the left side what tok-san I mean if you if you position yourself on stage a certain way and I mean you guys all have dicks right so you don't allegedly but you don't wear pants is tithing Robert Plant so let me check me yeah look at this what is going on here he's guys pants down is that a scrotum it says Roberts last stand what is that a real photo I don't think so that's a real and then there was the real one was attached to it Encyclopaedia Britannica is that a real car oh so now when you actually see his dick is that what the implication is I have these moments when we're podcasting around like I hope my parents never listen to this they do if they might they might really be into it I don't know what do you think Ben well here's the brain calf I've been going through the thing with my mom we don't really know each other that well okay it's the truth and I feel like this she would learn a lot about me in my life oh my god that's heavy that's a lot should we send it to her definitely not no that would be I think she we freaked out yeah my mom it's okay she's a delicate person well I never did I mean especially in this day and age whenever do you have a chance to sit and talk to someone for three hours straight like this it's rare that's it's sort of the cue for what ails us when it comes to communicating like podcast because this it's so informal and it's really just like sitting down talking which is what a lot of us don't ever have the chance to do anymore everyone is always doing a million things you're always looking at your phone you always about to go somewhere you got a meeting you gotta this yeah that when the fuck do you ever get three hours just sit to just sit a special thing it is very excited to be here isn't it crazy that just talking is a special thing like that shows you how weird we are right now right as human beings like as an organism that grew up in a social environment I mean every every person that survives that's alive today comes from a history of people that were in tribes right we're in these little groups of people and social interaction was everything you had a know it was being alone and that doesn't happen very often either when people well I mean but it's true like I we know you're right we're always so busy there's always shit going on and like III definitely these moments were like I wasn't just sitting not talking to someone or looking at my phone like I can't remember when I wasn't just moving you know and not even meditating just like sitting I've become super aware at least over the last year that there's a lot of wasted time in looking at devices and computers like I've been real aware of it to the point where I had to weigh my been the benefits of it or the benefits are pretty numerous like I get a lot of really interesting articles off of social media and really interesting articles that I find online and really interesting up-to-date information about space and science that's very very valuable to me but then there's also a lot of scrolling through non so it's equally as fruitful as it is beguiling because you get fucked up and lost in it and like I wanted to invent this app that I think someone probably already did it but that puts a lock on your social media so you only get like 20 minutes a day yeah I mean you don't want it you just want to develop some but it's also crucial for our careers like it's crucial to your yes it's the thing is though you need time alone where you're bored this is what I believe read a book I think you need time to just be able to sit and think about something or do something like practice something when you're like I'm sure you guys are like this with music right where you great practice or I'm really envious of his discipline he practices guitar every day it's like meditation it's the same thing yeah I think that is there's something to that for sure that some people don't experience yeah put your phone over there or shut it off or put an airplane mode and just do your thing you know we know what's crazy about the practices when you can separate because it's tough because I'll have devices on my phone that help me practice I'll metronomes know I'm seeing being this stuff's going up and the difference between you can put it on I don't have my phone when I'm not communicating with the social media world of texting whatever and when I do is insane in 20 minutes it's like working out if you focus for 20 minutes it's gonna replace three hours of shitty working out am i right about that yeah for sure yeah it's all about how much how deep you can go in you know just cognitively but and I think in general people were like coming to grips with this now as I can etiquette because we didn't fucking 10 years ago now this stuff existed this is like fresh out the gate so we're trying to figure this out and there's this dude you just see people paying more and more attention exactly what you're saying there's this guy that wrote a book called deep work and every it's like going viral people are paying attention this guy's ideas that are exactly what we're talking about you need to shut off social media advice you know stuff input and allow your brain to sink down deep and that's where real value comes from right that's the only that simple real value where people don't even realize how it'll take over your life in your relationships what's new it's too new and 18 what is it like 1994 is the Internet okay that's like the main spread of the Internet 93 remember we had nothing you know and it was like it was like electron I wasn't email yet you know it was just like but do you understand that this is only like 10 years old with the iPhones what didn't they just go through the 10th anniversary iPhone that's why it started yeah before that there were no apps ok so if there's no apps on your phone the snake game where it goes it like you you just had arrows and this you had to get the snake through this maze thing Joe you really missed out ok I'm sorry no yeah Jamie if you find that I swear to god you're like oh my god it was it was a thing oh my god when we did our first thing with us with us puzzle farter you take character and you propel him with his own farts with your spacebar and your arrows and you think it sounds stupid but you play your first game and you're just laughing seems like you got to get some sound ok Jamie's gonna operate the controls one day challenge yourself a lot of fun I just don't think people are used to the idea of being alone anymore without these devices and that's only been around for 10 years mm-hmm it's a lot of false comfort movies but I think there's also like there's all these different disorders and things that they're coming up with like you know young kids and their identity with Instagram and how it reflects their self-worth and how many likes they get and who like their photos and like it's really scary today we were saying that girls as early as nine years old and surgery to make their vaginas look better oh that's not true yes really they might be making it up just I'll talk about it I don't de leeuw male so it might be questionable but parents but I know that vagina surgeries like like aesthetic vagina surgeries are on the rise really yeah I mean they didn't exist like it was a trend when you would dye your pubes blue and put same this is the BBC guys come on thank you know that's that headline vagina surgery sought by girls as young as nine I mean vaginas are crazy-looking okay but I'm okay here's the thing you're right but it's a lot harder to discriminate sorry to interrupt you I beg to differ to operate on a dick than a vagina I don't fucking what I'm talking about are we really making judgment calls how do you know like this here's the thing man like CNN just got busted for the yet they fired a bunch of people for writing some story about Trump and Russia that wasn't true you hear about that and people get like super overzealous trying to make a story real and they didn't do like all the background work that was necessary and people get I think that's why Trump can get away with calling CNN fake news right sure cuz they're doing choose whether they're doing desperado shit they're getting into that blurry area where they're doing things that are there's a little bit sensational a little sensationalism and they're trying to get people to pay attention yeah how do we know that's not the case here like when you see super I'm sure women are getting vagina surgeries we've heard of it we know it's a real thing so but when you see as early as nine like May if that's not instant clickbait like that probably saying as young as nine that might be worth fuckin hundreds of thousands of dollars sure I mean I don't know there's one case of this they could point to that as a reference inside the absurdity of a young child someone anyone like looking at their vagina in any kind of pleasurable way is totally fucked up so why would a kid care about the appearance of their vagina you know I mean like that none of this makes sense well exactly I mean what's even creepier as you cut babies angry to make them look better for Jesus I did that for Jesus dude I choose not to be too vulnerable here but the other day I for the first time in my life saw my circumcision scars I was like holy shit that's what that is how did it make you feel it was intense I was like someone cut my dick off is doing it right now out of it as we're talking yeah they're cutting babies all over this country 2017 there's a slice in baby dicks for no reason so many things I want to say and I just want to keep them to myself at this point because I should well if you want to say them I feel like you don't want to keep them to yourself oh I'm gonna is it about baby dicks okay what else is going on guys I know are you going you don't have to say a word okay yeah turns out it's over it's an aesthetic thing yeah but this is being broadcast and we're not just hanging out of here stop talking Joe action figure I mean how many how much if a BBC news article like that probably gets like a million hits right am i being maybe a lot of hits right so how much is what that worth like if you can guarantee 50% more hits it worth thousands of dollars like how much do they get they get paid by the ads that are on their website right when I'm on the computer and I'm like you know looking at something and then there's those you know distract if I kind of things oh yeah and I I click on them because I'm curious I just feel so bad about myself I just feel like such a piece of shit like you should be doing something better with your time Suzanne then looking at you know that I don't know you know it after pictures of you know those articles like having phone sex with a robot yeah it's like you never get anything out of it you're getting weird like there's no there's no real it's not a real article like like if you read like you know the 18 hot women from the 80s you should see the net right and you know and you go through them and it's like who's writing this like no one what who benefits from I'm curious like just beyond the veil like what is the point they get does someone get paid for you clicking that button yeah I hate that but it's the same she I mean like why do people buy fucking Doritos it's the same thing isn't it yeah what do you hate about it though because I want to use my time and energy wisely and and not waste it on things like that because I'd rather like sit with my phone off and my computer off or or learn something that is beneficial right I know I think that's just wasteful that's junk food it is but those Doritos but Doritos taste good yeah but they have healthy Doritos Doritos they have that one my favorite chip at 365 slash Whole Foods is like it's like a bean chip and it tastes like Doritos and it's it's not wait a minute what's 365 slash hole it's there's in Glendale in California 365 so it's like it's like achievers Whole Foods it's like the brand 365 when you go to Whole Foods oh yeah started out like an outlet it's an outlet oh for the poor kids I didn't know what that was it's for everybody yeah it's out there okay it's out there yeah check it out give it you know take it for a spin so what we're saying about it no but they have like these they have these chips like Doritos subs they taste like Doritos and I fucking love them they're delicious you know I think's adorable trans fats are fucking terrible for you right they're horrible and the government has decided to outlaw trans fats right in two years diarrhea and just shallow we're gonna die because of obesity cuz you're addicted to sucking down these things the trans-canada they have their Heinz ketchup and we have our Heinz ketchup and the Canadian Heinz ketchup does not have high fructose corn syrup what does it have sugar I don't know but it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup because it's in its grand it was it tasted differently and I liked it I'm not kidding I just think that's interesting that like right on the other side of this border they have better ketchup well they have better coca-cola in Mexico they do use cane sugar that's right I mean I don't I don't really drink Coca Cola but it's toasted it's just interesting what the FDA approves in our country for the food that we eat fuck all those government agencies are a bunch of puppets when it comes to diet and exercise and what you're allowed to put in cigarettes and what you're allowed to put in all sorts of different drugs that get passed it is fucking bananas that there we were talking about Nevada just became legal for marijuana it's fucking bananas how it took until 2017 where States finally started making weed legal while people are dropping off left and right right from opiate pills like there was a study that that dr. Hart is that his name it's on my mic direct I tweeted it earlier today or last night but it is 93% of patients that have pain preferred cannabis over opioids sure opioids or opioids yes I can attest to that they course I mean menstrual cramps are debilitating for some ladies I'll be honest and we that's why I got my weed license because it's it like is night and day what the thing well they have that you put in your in your twinkle with that just get your eyes fuck no they don't get you I mean they they get your they make this warm a wonderful feeling in your belly that is the antithesis of writhing in pain and being out of commission for a day which happens every month I get one or two days where I'm just I'm in so much pain I can't I can't do anything and it's awful but but weed has been the best thing that's happened for that ailment or as you take motrin and you can take motrin but it can give you a terrible son Kay because it's really bad it's really it's really bad for your liver and you know and you're taking like just handfuls of motor advil like all those things yeah it's the same thing non-steroidal anti-inflammatories those things are super bad for your body but it's interesting that that's what you would you would take as opposed to having weed legal in all of its different medicinal facets that can help you well the difference is obviously there's a psychoactive effect it's probably unwanted for a lot of people that take Advil they just want to get rid of the headache they don't want to trip their fucking balls off right now that's where like CBDs come in yeah they're great they're great but apparently some people take CBDs and they experience some sort of a psychoactive effect I've talked to quite a few people that say that I don't understand that maybe they're getting stuff that's like weird it's got probably got pods I think that's you I think some of the recipes like I've definitely gotten edibles that were duds and you have to it's just like I think they they miss something you know it's still sort of like a primitive market so I think a lot of the companies and you see some of them like come in and come out just like boom boom boom like new restaurants didn't make it I think there's definitely a search for more reliable product in that regard but and we're all so so different like I'm you know you react to weed so different I feel like last time we talked you told me not to blow up your spine but you at one point you took a thousand milligrams is that true yeah yeah insane if I take ten milligrams I'm fucked yeah but I can't hang with Joey Diaz Joey Diaz would take a thousand and then only 250 more in front of and laughs Coachella and I accidentally took a 25 milligram Jolly Rancher cuz it was a hard candy you don't just bite it and my friends were like you took the whole thing and I was like yeah and I lost my mind watching Radiohead this is years ago and coincidentally ran into Carrie Clark jr. and I was like oh I was like just losing I thought he was super helping but I told you that story Joe and you're like fuck that take 25 milligrams go to the movies and I was like okay well you are very tough well this is the point it's not there's no consistency like you get your 25 milligrams and it's also a matter of how much take and how often you take it yeah I definitely didn't say like that no you're you're so cool people do like to brag about how much they could take me included Joey Diaz is a horrible person though Joey will take these cheap shoes and he'll take the ones that have 500 milligrams no no no I swap the package for 175 somebody he doesn't give a fuck he'll laugh edible in and slept for two for 24 hours I'm not gonna say who yeah we had a friend right I don't remember what she's talking about it was okay well a friend of yours had never had weed before and someone gave him an edible and he slept for like 24 hours and woke up like an entire day later that totally happens if you don't do it all the time if you're not used to it yeah I felt more high on edibles than I have like taking mushrooms I shouldn't take that many mushrooms but it's a very intense psychoactive experience when you take an edible it is yeah I've said this so many times I apologize in advance but your body produces something called eleven hydroxy metabolite it's processed when th sees processed by your liver it's five times more psychoactive than THC it's way different drug and it's not psychoactive when you smoke it so like when you're smoking pot your your body's not producing the eleven hydroxy metabolite but when you process it with your liver your body produces this intense psychedelic drug like you can have when you eat weed and then close your eyes you have some of the craziest fucking visuals that match up there as long as you have enough they go up right up to everything they go right up to mushrooms they go you can have like these many DMT trips if you know I smoked DMT with weed once it was insane it changed my life what did you there's a couple years ago and a good friend of mine and I took one hit and it was like zero to a hundred it was just like you exhaled and then you just take off and I mean I'd never smoked DMT before and I'm very sensitive to weed so I was high for like two three hours I was so and at one point I was watching we were sitting on a balcony and I was watching the street and it flipped into like negative like a photograph like the colors changed wait man this is like you smoke the DMT and how many minutes later is this happening this this is in ten minutes okay so intense yes so you kept your eyes open oh yeah should I close my eyes oh yeah oh tell me how to do it you took a small dose if you took one hit no I took a couple hit dude but my first hit it was just like you know like it was like Star Wars when it just goes into warp speed yeah you're like sure like it was insane dee antes got a weird threshold thing that happens and it's like tell me every hits in what happened to something about three three hits in is when reality dissolves for most people that's what they say three heads okay and if you took like one or two you get crazy visuals you get weird freaky stuff oh yeah but you don't go to the alien dimension I saw no I yes I did you did I totally did what you took enough so did you close your eyes while you were there or did you no I think I well it was nighttime so I could see the stars Wow and at one point I went completely deaf all the sounds just went Shh and I was watching a moving Street and I couldn't hear anything it was intense how high up were you uh just a couple stories you're worried about freaking out and trying to fly No oh no I was I was on the on the ride wait tell me more I think fear right the big fear it's like someone taking a psychedelic balcony like Bill Hicks used to have a bit about that okay young man on acid thought he could fly you know left to tragically to his death oh that's what a tragedy he goes what a dick still here he goes why if you thought he could fly why did he take off from the ground first we just lost a moron and then he had a positive drug story yeah what you never do here yeah it is interesting you know I don't like to say that the news is fake because it's not fake it's like they're they're doing the best they can they vet themselves the best they can and they definitely fuck up and definitely people get ambitious but it is kind of interesting that they only tell you like sanction things like you're never gonna see like a whole fox news article on the benefits of psychedelic drugs and how it could change your consciousness how Suzanne smoked pot with Duncan Trussell with DMT laced in it and they take mushrooms with Duncan once though I'm sure it was amazing it was like the first time I'd ever like really been high on mushrooms oh yeah yeah I saw my grandfather but sometimes yeah we should talk about that another time I saw my grandfather once on weed I ate him that abundant had a dream and the dream was really intense and I was talking to my grandfather it was really weird like I hadn't seen him in forever you know he died when I was who I was in my 20s and it feel real oh yeah do you guys spend a lot of time together yeah yeah we did yeah he was he used to take me fishing and stuff like that he was a really nice guy and it just took care of my grandmother for a little house like 12 years of her life she had a stroke and you know take care of her Oh long time she had an aneurysm oh my god yeah and I lived with them at that time because I'd moved from Boston to New York I didn't have a place to stay so I live with my grandfather and my grandmother in New Jersey and it was a super dark time but oh we um 24 oh wow someone run then and it made me realize like really intensely that this life does not last like and then you have to really be appreciative of health and your movement your ability to move and your ability experience things and it just seems so it seems like such a given and because it's such a given and we get wrapped up at so many different things it's it's super easy to lose touch with that you know to be happy like I was talking to a really good friend of mine who's going through a divorce and he started getting all bummed out about it and it's not and I was like look man you are so lucky you're happy you're healthy you're alive you have a bunch of great friends like you're gonna be fine like if this is all gonna be fine like it's this is like a little journey you gonna go through that's all I'm like how you look at it how you approach this journey how you gonna come out of it on the other end but being a young guy and living with my grandmother when she was dying and my grandfather we needed to take care of her and seeing the both of them like struggle it was it was intense can I ask you a question sure when you feel like you when you have this psychedelic experience where you saw your grandfather like does that to you is that like a real experience of him being somewhere else and communicating with you or it's probably just an ego trip it's probably just me thinking that I can recreate my memory but it was what was interesting about as the memories were so intense they were so realistic they were like my grandfather like he used to talk and like he used to behave he was always a very very gentle man a very gentle guy with a very like easy way about him like he was it was a really interesting guy when he was like that in the dream it was he was that guy in a dream what makes sense to if you go through a really impactful time it just digs those grooves deep I'm sure on your brain yeah I'm sure I'm sure around and I had it once with Phil Hartman to super-intense the Phil Hartman woman was super intense it was years after he died like maybe more than ten and in the dream he was sitting in a lawn chair and somehow or another he was telling me what life was like after his wife had killed himself or killed him and they killed herself it was really intense and I was like and I somehow or another I was talking to him from this like next stage of existence but the next stage of existence it wasn't heaven and wasn't the DMT dimension it was like a picnic it was like there was a lawn and it was like it was like bunch of people hanging out and he had a he was laughing and joking around and being jovial about things and he was just talking about oh yeah we talked about that like about him and the wife after she shot him and killed him he was like joking around in my dream correct yeah we had a conversation about that Wow it was like wow it was so crazy it was so intense because it was so real it was him and he fell backwards in his chair like laughing he fell backwards his chair almost like a pratfall and then he was gone right and then the dream was gone and then it just it all went away and I woke up because it was so intense I woke up and I was like whoa that that really felt like I was talking to Phil like it didn't feel like just a memory it really felt like I was talking to Phil but again what is that is that an ego trips at your imagination are you all in I am I'm in I mean because the problems I've experienced a lot of bullshit with you need to be skeptical from the external people that try to tell you stuff but I've definitely had people help me understand what all that shit means when I've had dreams like that yeah with my deceased relatives and they told me things and then they happened and yeah it could be your ego but I like I don't think that makes it less real though if it's your ego or your mind you know creating a scenario with your loved one or whatever that's this I don't think that's less real than the idea of this spirit reom buddy you know I don't know some sort of physical thing whatever I think it's both they're both kind of valid and it's it's it's energy I think it's an exchange of energy and I we've definitely been in places where we felt like not alone you know we and we weren't high we were you know you you have those moments where like your instincts and your intuition are like aware of external things that you can't see but you can feel and maybe maybe you can see him we've seen a ghost which I just address what you just said though but there is a difference right there is a difference because one of them is your imagination and one of them is you talking to a ghost there's a huge difference because one of them it means ghosts are real and the other one it just means your imagination is real which are absolutely a hundred percent aware of right so we know people have ridiculous imaginations they dream and imagine things constantly right so there is a big difference sharing two of them because one of them one of them gives you a view into a mystical world that doesn't doesn't in the eyes of science it doesn't seem to make sense right it doesn't seem to want to exist if there's another world where people come back from the dead and talk to you and then conversations with you but one of the arguments that I've always used with psychedelic drugs is that if you feel like in a psychedelic experience you went to heaven and had a conversation with God or you went to another dimension and talked to the infinite wisdom that controls the the the cells of the universe if you did do that or if you took the drugs and felt like you did that it's the same experience like that's the difference it's like I don't know if God's real and I don't know what the fuck happens when you take psychedelic drugs but god damn it feels similar like it there's there's moments where you you have intense psychedelic trips where you really do believe you're in the presence of like this pure wisdom and pure love it sees you in a way that is undeniable he can argue it wait I don't know I think sometimes it's your ego sometimes it's some weird shit in your brain and sometimes I think it's real I think it's it's very complicated it is complicated my point is they're the same experience if you're talking to God or if you're talking to your imagination and it creates this god it's for that brief moment in those 15 minutes it's the same experience and I don't know if that's enough but that's something like I don't know like what your your old time on earth is just time right your time on earth is just you have a limited finite amount you got a hundred years if you're fucking super lucky and you got good genes and that's a wrap right so this is we have this little time thing but during those 15 minutes which is a small amount of time but the whole life small during those 15 minutes you are absolutely experiencing something divine now is that your imagination is that you finding some portal to another dimension is that the reason why your brain produces these chemicals in the first place is because we transition during the time of death into this new realm is that it but if your concept of what divinity is includes all of that stuff it gets to be both right we sure but I mean like that there's a real problem with defining something that you just can't define like the whole problem with psychedelic trips I don't know like free I don't know if you guys feel this way but for me it's always like whenever I tell somebody about I'm like like why even use words like the words don't work right they're not enough not enough you can scramble them together and say imperfect screaming - it can almost like demean the experience language yeah you know and that's why I think there's such a wide array of people's theories and beliefs and thoughts and they're all valid because we don't have there's no agreed-upon language to say okay this is how we all feel this is how we're doing it right you know it's similar it's just I always go back to music with this stuff but this is a similar pathway and trend in music where people are constantly redefining the language of it and you know there's a kind of a mainstream openness to that or there isn't but the idea that the point is the language is dynamic you know and it goes on to continuously try and express something that's kind of inexpressible yeah and that's why it acts as a magnet for people's thought because they say okay this this is kind of our pathway of experiment to understand these phenomenons in streams like the fast food of music a little bit and then there's some more obscure like restaurants off the beaten path that you've never tasted anything like that and they're developing the vocabulary the most people like that fucking taste gross I'm not eating a cricket you know what I mean but but in 50 years you know that that vocabulary kind of seeps its way in if it's if it has value I always felt like I mean you guys are the musicians but I always felt like what music sort of is is almost like a vessel that the artist fills with emotion and with like passion and it's almost like doesn't even matter what the words are sometimes sometimes it does because those words and the feeling behind them enhance the song but like voodoo child perfect example like there's like a lot of the lyrics aren't particularly profound like Madonna was born say the moon turn don't even know the feeling I just feel the song yeah it's just about being a bad motherfucker I was born a bad motherfucker bitch that's not profound right but when you hear him say it with that guitar behind it with those emotions it carries that song it's like yeah that's what's profound is is the it's part of a lineage you know what I mean that's a proclamation and that's part of blues music and that's part of African music that's part of all this stuff you're just like I'm a fucking man or woman or whatever I'm a human boom here it is so I think yeah but it's more than that with him what he's saying is he's a voodoo child he's basically claiming some Robert Johnson type shit mm-hmm the night I was born the moon turned a fire red you know yeah did he write that song are we certain didn't like along the watchtower right that's about it yeah but this unit because he he there's a grandmother was a Native American so he has almost like there's a two versions two there's a one version that's like the real bluesy version a voodoo child you know there's the voodoo child slight return and that other version which is like much more acoustic or much more guitar-driven like he like guitar sounds a perfect example like Gary Clark jr. is perfect example like when he came and played with you guys on stage I saw you guys downtown a few months back dude when he gets on stage his sound is Gary Clark jr. you know I'm saying like like you guys were singing Midnight Rider which was we just plug in dude but that sound is like a sound that you instantly like of Stevie Ray Vaughan had it Hendrix a sound you instantly recognize yeah like one of his riffs talking about as far as cab you Larry do you know you say and maybe this happens in fighting I imagine it does you know people have techniques or whatever they slowly turn into their own oh sure thing yeah and that's what makes them well they're derivative of a lot of things of a lot of different techniques so then you kind of have this like you know well at least for music I'll speak for myself I just feel like I have this like Garbo love stuff that just people are like what are what you describe your sound it's so awkward because you're not like I sound just like that you can't what do you sound like what kind of what kind of comedy are you Joe Rogan I did a radio show last week where a guy asked me to make him laugh oh fuck did you do Joe I said well that's not good you tickle him are you a child week someone calls out on the phone they're saying are you like seeing me a song oh yeah let's hear you sing it's humbling it's super humbling because it's like sometimes we've why is it humbling you're talking to a twat well no you're talking to someone who doesn't understand well they're being a twat and sure but like I don't know I feel like the need to like even connect with the twat sometimes and just say yeah I'll sing for you if you don't like it that's fine I'll sing for you that's fine I'm not above that that's why the twats is deep it that was my chair I would tell you that's weird that's that no well you know it's just lazy entertaining it's also that job of being like the radio host is a tough fucking job it's you get three minutes to talk to someone you never talk to you before and maybe not so good at it and Rudy Jays on radio stations nowadays they're not even really deejays anymore they don't get the pick the fucking songs who the fuck lets you pick the songs one dude fuck that there's some big there's like ten stations across the nation that are still public radio like heaven and BW like doesn't Jason Bentley like pick pick his shit yeah but that's a unique thing yeah but that's what I'm saying like there's still some some people that are holding court it's like Game of Thrones whoa just knocking bitches out I think it has to be small stations we're not a lot of people are paying attention exactly because the big ones they need the money yeah that's gonna dictate the playlist but that doesn't mean you still can't if if that part of your job is the DJ's even taken away then what is your fucking job to be interesting on the air they can't do that yeah and do you do you know how they get ratings this is most hilarious thing or they did at least until recently they still do the Arbitron shit is that how they do the radio ratings the way they do it is they they hand out books and they ask people to fill out the books tell us what you were listening to and when you were listening to it so what you what do you get you get the opinion of assholes that it will like looks who's gonna fill out that book they're gonna give you that book and you know what to do I'm not filling up this fucking radio sorry no you it's like our first record had a single called little toy gun yeah they loved that they were testing that I guess maybe it's different now I don't know they were calling people like potential listeners kind of like a nielsen vibe a little and they would play them a bunch of songs and be like well we do you like it like literally over the phone you'd hear like 20 seconds of the song and you give it a thumbs-up or thumbs-down and that's how you getting the ratings that's what defines whether our song was successful it's so different now though there's like it now now you've got internet radio that's free so people don't have to pay for it they don't have to call in they just have to listen and that is monitored through you know you can you can measure that through Spotify or Pandora or Apple music and like I I have a single out right now that came out a month ago and it's called ghost in my bed and it's doing better than I thought it would I had no idea that it would be like jumping from playlist to playlist I this is our you know we're doing solo projects just you know how much of a fucking bad but I I looked at I it came out June 1st I had like a couple hundred followers on Spotify and like that week I got like 10,000 and then like like the other week it was at like 37 thousand followers I it blew my mind and I I call I have a PR team that's you have a team I've got a team I got a team yeah because I want to own my music so I heard I heard a publicist a distributor and you get your manufacturing and that's really all you need is is doing the fucking work there's not crazy to own your own shit you got to hire a bunch of people well because record companies make you think that you need them and you don't some of them are great what do they do now like what's a--what's a record company good for today if what depends if they're actually good at the job they're good at it's a fucking selling music right that's very rare and that's hard to do okay for everybody it's a it's a combination though because obviously like if the music's not good enough it's not gonna work and if it is great but there's there's so many different you know it's a labyrinth of oh no we're gonna lose them here we go here you go Ben's gonna be awesome cool it was great he's gonna be fine you're so funny when you test I just think we have it on the internet you said it did you say you're not funny so it's cool no we have a lot of but I also love you and want you to be happy that means a lot to me yeah you know this is live right no but in terms of the record companies and releasing music they have I mean every artist is different every approach is different but I think what's interesting is their jobs are becoming more and more obsolete because of the evolution of the industry but don't they trying to take a piece of your music sales concert sales they try to common right to take a piece of your concert sales which it seems kind of crazy the lot of music it depends on your position your situation so was it that we had in what musician was Everlast was explaining it was surely no surely from garbage and it was incredible and she she had a lot of really interesting cool she so cool she might be like one of the coolest garbage and is it hole at the bowl did you see that hole the documentary that said that Courtney Love killed Kurt Cobain yeah I started to was like I bought the book because I was such a huge fan I felt like shit I was like I should not be doing this I don't want to read this dude's channels that dude changed the word that was another one like that guy had a sound there was something going on you know when the lights out it's less dangerous I mean come on man it's not the words there's something to the words but it's the way he's expressing those words there Joe so what's interesting about the icons of the decades hmm you know you get the sixties like okay so the 50s were like everything's perfect we have the cleanest music and every we have a cookie cutter home and this is the wife and this is the husband and this was like the generation after World War two of like everything's fine we're cool we just came back from war we're gonna make a lot of babies right okay the 50s and there's this like total disillusionment of no it was more survival I think but then the 60s there are like people trying to feel more and that was when psychedelics were coming in the Elvis and all that stuff that was up ending all those pioneering that though that was late 50s right and then and then going into the 60s of people like there's this dichotomy of like you know the the people kind of experiencing other areas of life that aren't this like sanitized version of society and blossoming more into the 70s of just like harder rock you know think you know sonically speaking you know you're going into Zeppelin and and Pink Floyd I was Cooper Alice Cooper I can't the 80s are interesting that the glam of the 80s I can't really help me out with the significance of like what that meant to people I think it was it it kind of went back to a little more of this like pristine version of people in society I feel like well let me give you the clean version of what a lot of people believe happened okay drugs became illegal Oh 1970 sweeping drug legislations Act a special one act from Richard Nixon as soon as it became illegal to possess anything well they marijuana which is illegal for a long time mushrooms it was really hard to do drugs and you just got this massive drop-off for the creative music in the eighties that was you know the product of that disillusionment well they grew up with Reagan on TV and then everyone plastic they just wanted everything to be like flannel and he wanted to rain every day people needed that truth they needed that reality and that like expression of what you know I don't I think we need so many different things but I think right now we're so complicated and and in our individual rights but all you know I don't know people need so many different things now you can't really say that it's I mean like I mean I'm saying like tell me what I'm not saying you can't really say that I'm saying like it's so hard to say people need love or people need this or people need education and people need because it's you can't really say that there's any one group of people right there's so many groups of people but I do think people need to get pulled out of the just the spiraling of the phones and the stoves or social media and I think the only things that get them out of that are real inspiration and I think real inspiration has is the spectrum of that is very wide whether it's just a folk song or it's like you're at a club and it's got that whole rhythm of electronic music and you're just with a group of people and you're having this like tribal collective thing cool hmm I think thanks to that that's why I feel like you ask what people need I don't know everyone needs something different I know you're told you know and whatever that is I think it just needs to inspire them well this we just need to you know as a group recognize that we're all so fucking different and we got to stop trying to fit everybody into these little packs right well that's like the pronouns of oh god your friend from Canada he was just on the podcast Jordan Peterson yes yeah very interesting stuff yeah very interesting he's a fascinating guy well you know he's dealing with a lot of like really weird political correct weirdness those guys a very thoughtful guy very well-spoken guy but people want you to follow their guidelines for how you should think and communicate and what you should accept and what you should argue against or not argue against and it becomes this weird sort of control game that goes on and that's what's happening with a lot of people in this in this nation this fine nation right now people are realizing that they have control over people so they're exerting that control almost the same way a person in power does like like one of the things Abraham Lincoln said that was really brilliant he said most men can overcome adversity I'm paraphrasing he said most men can overcome adversity you really want to test him and give him success right which I thought was really fascinating you know it's like for a lot of people like that are in big positions of power like like the president United States for a perfect example like the the idea of him getting through that and not falling apart is way like you realize like what a bad motherfucker Obama was holy shit look people have zero idea at how good Obama's composure was to get through that entire eight years in the White House without one like really gross misstep socially right yeah you didn't have one well use that's that's I think there's a lot of people that would probably disagree with that and I wouldn't agree with them but that's I think that kind of just a psychological thing though they would think that you know there's one thing that he said he was joking around that white horse White House press Correspondents Dinner about the Jonas Brothers and about has two words for them I don't know it was something about drones what's the word was the big name for the drone there's like a name another name for the drone there's like a type of drone isn't there r2d2 did he say that to them to the Jonas Brothers yeah he's got like a name there's a name for one of the drones it's one of the things that he said it was like come on man you've killed like 84% civilians with drones well the United States has like to say to joke around roll with someone who wants to date your daughter come on like what was the look at how so young 2010 boys don't get any ideas I have two words for you Predator drones it's bad you'll never see it coming that he's joking around about killing people you know many people lost their children to Predator drones while he was in office a lot well a lot those things they take to look the people that are trying to kill those terrorists out there and the Isis members and all the different people that are doing horrible things like blowing up ariana grande concerts and all that kind of shit I mean the people that are trying to stop those people have an insanely difficult job don't get me wrong but when you're shooting missiles out of robots when you're killing mostly innocent people it's much it's not like close it's not like half and half like they kill half bad guys good guys no they killed mostly good people but it's ok ok it speaks more to the position the President as being a tough fucking job because you can't be a comedian and a comedian can say whatever the fuck and it's fine because you're a comedian or whatever that would have better delivery but sure I know two words for you are there gonna be funny words he's you know it's just joking around about something that's it's dark you know it's like you'll never see it coming hahaha like a lot of those people that died thousands that's kind of fucked up if you were living in a country where Obama was the guy who made the call and the missiles came from the drones and killed your dad and you have to watch him joke around about shooting missiles at some kids who want to fuck you're pretty good daughters mm-hmm whoa you know that's uh we don't look at it that way because if we're over here but how can we like how can you process that level of I don't know variety that's the shitty word for it but like there's so much shit going on this is why all the social media is happening because along with being a distraction and a problem it's also helping us cope with the degree of the world you know I mean there's so many fucking people how how could you ever be sensitive to the entire situation Wow being an authentic person does that make sense yeah but I think this is what we were talking about earlier of like trying to I mean that the fucking smallest level of like learn how to apologize but learn learn how to be different from each other and also work together and know that like we have different speeds and different beliefs and you know have compassion and I think that's where it's really crazy to have so much exposure to the global events and become desensitized to them because there's so much stuff that eventually like you can't compute you can't process it but it doesn't I mean obviously there's there's no excuse for making jokes about drones realize it he had to make some jokes he's somebody for him but no you're totally right there's too much information you're getting news from 7 billion and we're putting it on one man when he is not just one man but he is a group of people working together but he has to speak for everyone and and so does Trump and so does whoever is president and and that's what's really interesting is that I think what has happened now with the election of Trump is that people are becoming so much more aware that there's an entire cabinet and Congress and the people that we elect that we choose are going to be part of that entire team and it's it's really it's it's focusing people on politics in a way it never has before that's a good thing yeah I didn't get to see corruption in a weird way like a real transparent way they think of corruption and I talk to you about this guy about represent us and it's this organization that I went to this meeting and was really informed for the first time I'd never really understood how people in Congress kind of came to be these you know runners in these elections whereas it costs forty to sixty thousand dollars a day to run for Congress that's insane and that is legal that's not illegal that's so crazy and Josh silver I till I talk to you bout him a little bit started this organization and they're they're working on along the anti-corruption bill so that anybody can run so you know any incredibly / accomplished you know koala overqualified person from say Columbia or Harvard or wherever in the world or in the States who we elected whereas like these people that cost that much money to run they're they're controlled by the Koch brothers and all the major oil industries what do they spend the money on it because that much a day that's just the game that's just transportation advertisement promotion if you don't play that game but here's the thing you can qualify like if you ran for Senate or something you would be spending six president you know what I mean like that's what's interesting right I mean I well because you have a platform already and people have platforms in the world that's Donald Trump well did you know that when you have a platforms you're running for something like Stanhope was running for president while he was running for president is that he couldn't do stand-up shows anymore because if he was going to do something on stage he would have if it was like a public forum where people were coming to see him he would have to a lot time for his opponents right I was like what he's like yeah he goes it's a crazy scam she candles of the game yeah there's a lot of like weird freaky old school rules back when people would stand on a soapbox and scream out to a large group of people those rules still apply but but the thing is you can do you can still if you have ten million people being like that's a stupid rule or however many it takes it'll change maybe look it's still federally illegal to smoke marijuana there's no reason why we did but it's state legal but federally it's still illegal so it's not so much driving it's not as simple as like ten million people can say they don't want more totally right again that's the same thing but what's gonna go on with our political system it's like yeah it needs an overhaul yeah it needs to be changed needs to be updated from the internet in the 2017 world that we live in and we need to figure out a better way to do it we don't need the same sort of representative government that we always needed when you had to take a message from a fucking horse you know the thing is it's like if you want it if you want that to change from the ground up you're asking the people that are currently in office to bet against themselves to say hey let's make it behave as citizens right right and thinking that they're better or different than us and that's where it becomes unfathomable well they have to they have to just like everybody else we all have to realize that we were all the same thing and every there's there's no kings anymore and there should I mean Edward Snowden tweeted this the other day that people couldn't at one point in time couldn't imagine the idea that one day there'd be no kings and they're gonna say that the same thing about presidents one day and it's for sure gonna happen the presidents or whoever runs for Congress or senator they have to come to an understanding that they are no different than us just because they're in positions of power they're not different they we were all just people and that if you have extra power over people and you utilize it you should be ashamed of yourself you should feel horrible did you guys hear what chris christie did in the peach thing he closed down the beaches in Jersey and then vacationed on the beaches with his family they closed him down due to budget put a shirt on they asked him did you get any Sun he said no I didn't get any Sun and the pictures came out and he's like I had they said Oh mr. Christie had a baseball hat on so he did me son no that's not a loophole you were lying you're still in the Sun you're not in the house right if you're not in a house you're getting Sun you play on words bullshit that's happening in the media where it's like people are you know it you don't they just you know circumvent around the truth or whatever they're trying to say with just just stupid rhetoric it's so annoying but I can hate it it's changing it's got and I don't know how is it changing Ben it's changing because if this was 60 years ago that news wouldn't have gotten out or they've been ways to just like crush that and they're still are I'm so true though you're right but it's definitely changing yeah there's a kind of to hide that stuff not just I mean look what you're doing right now you're talking to millions of people I guess a new Serena well you're saying it to millions of people and then millions of people gonna have similar conversations because of that when you hear something interesting that someone talks about you start talking about hair this interesting conversation really made me think about something and then that just wasn't even available 10 years ago it wasn't available 20 years ago like all the social media stuff all the whether it's YouTube videos that people can make or podcasts that people can make or whatever the fuck it is blogs and people can write all of it is just information and that flow of information has never been greater it is an unstoppable River now you know to the point where that's why that Baked Alaska dude was laughing like the fucking president jumped into the river like he's in the crazy river putting up memes and talking shit about people joking around about some lady having a fucking plastic surgery she had like a facelift he said she was a leader I do believe that you believe that the president is saying that well this is like that movie Luke Wilson and yeah Chrissy idiocracy it's it's happening it is really happening well it's for sure a bad system that no one wants to join in like if you're Elon Musk why the fuck would you want to be President bang supermodels and build rocket ships you know about our car do you know the funny story about our touring vehicle I dunno oh it's great drop it so oh my god Ben is it three years ago yeah 2015 2015 so in spring of 2015 we thought it would be this is when we put pump kit up for donations so we could buy a car so we could tour and we didn't to buy a van because that's annoying who wants a van and we ended up we were looking at SUVs and we found a cadillac escalade 2007 Sue's design the same cars yes ford expeditions Escalades navigators whatever the year they're the same same structure just different clothes and there was a great deal on a Cadillac Escalade and we had like good a lot of touring in front of us and we bought it and we were we bought it with 60,000 miles on it it was in mint condition which was really strange and like the you know used car salesman's like it though there's clearly no kids in the backseat there's no cheerio stuck between the seats and so we ended up buying this car and we were looking through the user manual to like what does this button do and the former owner registration fell out swear to God Elon Musk and Ben had this great ideas that come and this great idea to get him to design at Escalade for better but to put it into perspective though we did we bought it with 60,000 miles and now it has like a hundred and sixty thousand miles on it now it was just about a little over two years ago have you seen that shit he's gonna do in California way bores holes under Los Angeles and makes tunnels and you ride us led through the tunnel briefly actually yeah you you drop down into this tunnel and go she far so watch what happens TV so you pull up to this you pull up to this thing and it drops you down drops your car yeah it drops you down you get you glut get in the queue and you drop down and then you get on a sled your cars on a sled so you're not driving anymore well and your car could be on a solar power to sled to by the way with all the power we have in LA from the Sun we never stops being sunny out if they wanted to make these giant solar banks to power this thing but they could but there's a video of it like the idea of it the animated version of it so of course everyone in the street is having a Tesla there's nothing but Tesla's and an old rotten shitty cars from the sea you have to pay more to get on the sled yeah otherwise you're one of those twice traffic lights so watch this you drop down and then once you drop down you are in these tunnels that he's building that are totally earthquake proof don't worry when they fill up with water and kill you and your family don't sweat it [Laughter] and your oxygen mask I just need everybody to understand that when the 1000 foot waves come you will not survive in these fucking tubes they will fill up with water and you will drown Joe I'm so scared most likely that that tsunamis not common but if and when this is insane that's a wrap a lot of thumbs down so yeah because people are freaking out about the ocean well right next to the fucking ocean in the ground moves these flying cars that have batteries in the front so they can't hit each other so they like repel well I well repel you don't want to bump dude sorry repel like two magnets vise last night that scared the bejesus out of me it was they were showing just you know technological intelligence to overtake cars and control the computers in the cars and just and it was crazy it was just like just hacking hacking into any kind of car and I'm gonna I'm gonna shut you down and run you off this cliff or I'm gonna you know fuck with you make your mine does go up and down and it's crazy I I mean I don't want to be scared I don't want to live with like oh god and I try not to but that's fucking crazy fucking crazy you know that journalists they think the big conspiracy theory is that he was killed because they overtook the controls of his car and slammed him into a tree made him go 120 miles an hour here was his name Michael he was a feint he was a famous journalist who wrote a story in The Rolling Stones about a general and it was he was embedded with them I believe it was in Iraq within Afghanistan and he was no no it wasn't about Petraeus was another general no no there's different general michael hastings thing yeah so he wrote this article about this general the general had a step down because the general was joking around about obama or something like that and there was just like some he got a little loose what is this there's a close sitting dude this is the right no i don't think i want so this apparently they tried to say that he committed suicide and some people believe he did commit suicide and some people believe so he just lying down and just slams into a tree and his fucking car blows up here's the thing though and this is like in the interest of full disclosure they apparently said that they found amphetamines on him on his body right so that could mean that he was under the influence of n feta means what it happened or it could mean that he takes adderall because a lot of journalists take adderall so they found it in his system it doesn't necessarily mean he was speed it up when he was driving like a fucking maniac because he was off the rails it could just easily have meant that he uses adderall to get his work load done which a shitload of journalists do so it might not have meant anything can we talk to people that are experts boy people that are experts that weigh in on conspiracy car crash evidence they're weirdos it's hard to find like who's right and who's wrong but some people said that the way the car had separated the way the engine had exploded and launched itself from the car indicates some sort of explosion more it doesn't impact hmm you know because it's just all you know hit that hit the tree and blew up all at once but again could be bullshit but it is fucked up because the guy wrote a very he wrote a very scathing article about this general and made the general retire and I know that guy got a shit ton of death threats and he was telling everybody that if somebody kills me like be be sure that I didn't kill myself they can take over your car cuz your car's a computer your car a lot of cars today are connected to the Internet through Wi-Fi a lot of cars I see they have their own Wi-Fi hub like you buy a new Escalade it comes with a Wi-Fi hub so all the people in the car can play on their iPads or whatever while you drive it and you link up to the Internet that's on the on the actual car itself well that's a computer it's computer it's connected to the net drives around you know somebody just gets in there I mean there there's no there's no bounds at this point how can you keep things organized probably's in the right way but how do you keep us all alive without sir during personal freedom like boom-boom but like we can't we kind of a crazy what's going on good question this is lighter stop work what you you know you don't you don't really have an answer to that question because we don't even know what they could really do right now one especially if part of the important thing we need to accept is that we're all the same thing then we have to accept that we all have to start acting like the same thing at the same time right that's a that's a very good point but it gets lost when you start talking about people that are in the military and that are dealing with national emergencies or national security situations well you you make a general retire because you you chose to write an article about some things you heard him say that gets him fired and then somehow or another the military becomes compromised because it's very important leader is no longer in a position of power that's a very tricky situation it's very tricky you did you did get the scoop and you did get to say how this guy was communicating you know candidly but things things are happening they're happening interdependently and also completely in mesh like you can't a mesh the way that all these things technology bobble buzz is is developing but there it is there's no way this dude they can control that much there's no way people can control where this is going and by this I mean everything to that degree so you just have to right deal with all these new phenomena they're happening oh yeah for sure look at this is the article the runaway general the profile that brought down McChrystal rollingstone profile of Stanley McChrystal that changed history that's crazy that one article can get a general fire change history and it's crazy the guy who wrote it is dead dead as fuck and they think dead from a crazy conspiracy michael hastings you know who the fuck knows it's but Boyd is it Wow so he's playing the general in this movie he's playing run a runaway general there's a Netflix movie movie based on Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings while they're doing a movie based on that thing happening that's crazy not thirty out is it get the fuck out that's what it was about it's a Netflix movie yeah dude I don't Netflix almost has too much content it's overwhelming its overweight and it's funny because there's so much content than that it's the quality's not that great so you you get some shows and and like I like this weekend I had this like 25 minutes and now and I just couldn't fucking land on anything well you know trying to land on something something with substance and and just more thought and I ended up watching Harry Potter on fire and I was so happy with my choice okay are you fine with you a little bit let me tell you something anyway there's a lot of parallels to the Wizarding World and our fucking weird world and politics there's politics in the Wizarding World word do you do man can you guys ever go to the Harry Potter ride a universal I've won I'm a book and a half from finishing so I don't know what happened to me I'm talking about the ride at Universal yeah but I don't want to entertain do you really think I know the plot any of those so then it's not decided who's driving more in the back oh I'll Drive I don't give do you have any protein bars yes yes plenty of protein bars is always uber with worry not my friends get through this with a steady hand there is no concern but the Harry Potter ride at Universal is the shit it's really fun it's fucking crazy oh yeah yeah just one yeah does it feel I was telling you about this maybe it's the same thing don't you get on a broom and like you're flying it's not a broom you're sitting in a chair but you're flying around good yeah like you kind of would be if you're in a broom has a lot of stuff going on just dragons and shit it's fun it's really good ride it's like it's really well-made okay I was all Lord of the Rings I read dune love dune you know I'm just like I'm a total nerd and I didn't read Harry Potter and been really encouraged me this past year and he got me the Sorcerer's Stone which is the first book and and we don't have to it's amazing like I can't I can't tell you how much joy it's brought me as an adult yeah it's just here's the thing I think um I feel like I have an affinity for like fighting darkness just in myself cuz I'm fucking dark but I'm also very light so you know as such as life and it's yeah here we go I'm going in but all right folks listening at home the last book was the order of the Phoenix which is very political because there's there's you know a political presence there's the government excuse me within the Wizarding community and it was just really interesting to be reading that while also like watching our local news and our global news and just it's it's all part of the same story in terms of manipulation and what we interpret as truth and it was it it was just an interesting experience to read that book and then to listen to like my favorite podcasts and and news outlets and be like this isn't any different than Harry Potter so it's all based on the familiarity of problems in human nature right sure it's all based on good and evil and fuck-ups and ego and power laterals yeah I read that value of JK Rowling's Harry Potter business is worth 25 billion whoa cool that seems a lot she's rolling how does that work I should save the joke why I got a joke no I'm gonna save the juice see no no you guys know this is live right don't argue over saving jokes just say the fucking joke how walking JK rowling solid I didn't come up with it but the joke and also the walking JK stupid jokes [Laughter] hey tell me about this fucking crazy guitar you guys have that Sony gave you what happened outside what what happened with that guitar that thing's insane it's a beautiful guitar there's a company called national and the thing is they gave us one because well I think they like us but they also like you that was a part of it we have to admit that thank you Joe yes I didn't do anything Thank You them mmm-hmm they mate that's a crazy-looking guitar that's not a normal resonator so it has I can't actually remember it I think it has tricone resonator so anything you want to hear some music is that what you're no no I want to see that guitar that's it closer to it no that's not it but it's hard isn't it been now I a guitar had to be made out of wood no I mean well this is technically well it's a different kind of guitar some call them dobro I'm definitely not claiming a cone inside I feel like I want been here so I don't look this up but there's a resonator inside like a speaker inside of see how there's all this kind of mesh look at that one yeah okay that's like a built-in speaker and you can plug them in so they're electric so it's a speaker like a car speaker like a stereo speaker I mean it's without electronics it there's a cone inside that that the the sound resonates louder like a banjo kind of a little okay so it's not like a like a stereo snatcher I'm really sorry I put some power the pitch well Jamie's a actual audio but it has a specific tone to it that isn't like your your regular acoustic or electric guitar and when you plug it in it sounds amazing and it has sort of like a Down homey vibe and it's beautiful and homey vibe yeah interesting mm-hmm yeah down homey vibe like down homey music like acoustic music is like down homey music right well yeah I mean folk music yeah in soul music our down-home resonator for guitar cover cover plate for this bed I might have butchered the whole explanation of what a national can help me she nailed it okay so is there any wood on that as the back I think I'm gonna pee but the body's no that thing's insane looking man and so what kind of a different sound does this thing make than a regular guitar [Music] Wow so it's it's just like a ma'idah louder it cuts a lot more it's more resonant it's got a metal sound to it yeah sure so one now if I had a slide these things are great for playing slide with because James what do you got lighter probably fucked that up but you can kind of you want to round one or a flat one it's around but you can kind of hear maybe [Music] yeah but you know what I mean like some oh that's cool blue shit what is that there exactly Cohiba whenever I hear that kind of shit I think of like Oh blues yeah because all that Robert Johnson stuff like all that he probably never resonated Wow yeah I I can play inside but it's [Music] he would John Lee Hooker fan oh yeah goddamn exact I'm half motherfucker is he still around no he - when did he pass ah maybe 10 years ago like it cuz he was old he was playing when he's in his 90s oh I didn't discover him til he was probably in his 80s boom boom boom boom he could you know what this is this would be big up sign I'm Gary when I thought we said Gary for the first time he was just acoustic we played this show with him this is like 2011 or something and he made me feel like John Lee Hooker cuz it was just him and there's this hypnosis that he can kind of set over you yeah you know that's like a real blues and that's what can't you get deeper into it these guys can really play that music it's the same thing John Lee Hooker you listen to it be kind of like in trance Jamie find my Instagram where honey honey had Gary Clark together on stage you guys are doing Midnight Rider I filmed a little bit of it and put it up on Instagram it was just so crazy I did everything that I hate people doing a common clubs oh listen to that that's so Gary Carr as we planned [Music] [Music] [Music] I got a lot of crackers so much crap didn't know the words to this song the only impromptu song live on stage in front of all these people and she had a check her phone for the lyrics I had to block some dude who was being such a fucking cock and I was like I'm just watching don't mention I'm not going to use attention screw that dude but you know whatever shit happens you know it was such a fun night we did a song I didn't know and I wanted to sing the words properly and I had to look him up with my phone I was texting some dude and that wasn't the case thousands of people enjoyed that one or two were cunts and you're focusing on the wrong one thank you Joe thank you it means you've always been a social media yourself get the fuck out of Dodge and chick it's weird just get away you can't control it you definitely can't argue well and you're right and it's it is an effort to not care because I but you do care we should all care well I just like love people I really do in a restaurant person it's its heart and I want to love that person too I think but it's not about Karen it's cuz you're gonna care it's about like recognizing what that person is and then not letting him into your house agreed great you know what that is it's a dummy they just want to get mad about stuff especially if he found out what it was that you were just checking the lyrics to a song you'd never sang before when he was singing live with Gary Clark jr. funny fuck and it was like midnight in downtown LA in some weird ass bar oh man that was yeah that was badass makes me want to move to downtown LA does it like Batman warehouse English dude wash your shit over for me he's been happy to hang from the outside you don't know him man like all the movies are going into how bummed out he is all the time cuz he can't share what he's doing because he has a woman's secret yeah exactly good friends he can't get the validation he's got one old British dude friend and funny he just needs more friends yep like like if I was Batman I feel like I could tell you and you wouldn't tell anybody did you ever see that there was a oh I could say I was actually a comic book it was a forgetful professor who's a professor and in the comic book this guy was he was forgetful about all these different things but he was like the super genius professor and at the end of the comic book he recognized that he was actually an alien from another planet come that came down to earth to help us innovate he Franchitti Joe for you're also an alien from another planet you guys should do more of those weird little Downton shows though we should should those were fun those are so strange it was really fun night night and it was so great cause you were there that's why it was great with a great time was awesome it was fun it's pretty fuckin badass yeah that was amazing intimate shows are so big they're so different you know like you almost kind of have to do them like if you just JLo the whole thing and you're on these giant stages for the rest yeah she's doing she's gonna be like separated from everybody right bring everything cuz I mean I think that one day Ben hold on is the counterpoint yeah you don't just trying to death as that thought seems like that's like the worst thing that could ever happen to you because it gets so separated for everybody that you're like up with some giant a stage and everywhere you go you can interact with people we just both saw Roger Waters last or two weeks ago and it was incredible Tony went he said it was insane oh my god and and I think I think there's a well I mean it's it's a reason that he's doing what he's doing and people are coming to see him because yeah incredible when it's authentic and it's raw and like that man has obviously he has teams around him that helped build that show he doesn't do that by himself but it was oh man it wasn't white rose petals it was but that's a different thing that's a different thing well that's that fast-food thing we were kind of talking about earlier yeah and I think there's a place for that too sometimes you're fucking starving and you need something right now there's also like a lot of money in being that icon that diva that thing you know it's like it's a very attractive position to try to attain it's almost like you just too close to the Sun burn the wax off you're right some of its authentic and some of it is totally you are a machine you are part of the manufactured idealism that you represent and that is a heavy burden I don't but you know that on anybody what's probably not inauthentic its people's ambition to get there oh I think the people in those positions are so fucking ravenous for that kind of attention and that's the only way you would possibly climb to the top of that mountain yeah you have to be fucking focused I think some people are are manipulated I don't know I think so Michael Jackson I think some people have an idea of the art and they're also exploited within that realm because there are some parts of the record industry are fucking insidious right you know and they take like remember you were talking about that documentary with these like 15 year old kids that were so talented but they were like clearly just getting just sucked into the thing way too young you're too young to know what you're doing there's just no if ands or buts about it in order to make the decision to be a giant like Michael Jackson we were talking about Jackson 5 earlier like when you sing in ABC I mean he was a fucking baby yeah he was a baby and he was on TV you know he was on he was a huge star but also like his family running the show and it was like a really fucked up dynamic and so it was almost like his I mean don't get me wrong his talent was undeniable but like his family were the record industry and that respect dude his talent was so undeniable that he was the youngest one he got to sing could you imagine you grew up with four bad motherfuckers as brothers your dad as a professional musician and you are so good they're like okay let him saying yeah everybody else must have won on the saying they all did their solo projects afterwards yeah they didn't say shit well Michael had the microphone I'm saying yeah and people react to that real way right I mean that's what you know there's the exploitative aspect and then it's like everybody want to fucking see him saying I wish I saw him saying it was two things all right it was this emergence of this incredible sound that came out of this one person and all the different projects that he was involved in and then it was also the tragic almost like decimating of a potential life because his life only existed so strongly in the public eye that it didn't exist anywhere else in a normal form outside it was just a chaos a mess of hanging out with kids and weird relationships with women that didn't seem real and living in an amusement park it was just a mess it was just a total disaster like everything outside of the magic that he did in the public eye was just hell it was really weird because what he did in the public eye like thriller and beated and all those different things I mean they were so so intense like I was in high school when all that stuff was going on and I remember just just watching like thriller on television you know when they had the premiere the music video and everybody sat around and watched thriller when it came out there's nothing like that ever oh yeah ever that's crazy like sort of like when Hendrix came along there was nothing like that before well when Michael Jackson came along there was nothing like that before either like what the fuck like someone had taken the whole thing and put it in this totally new package where was like this feminine guy and he had one glove on and he was dancing everybody wanted to move like what the fuck back to your like Freddie Mercury kind of dick out thing it's like he did what he wanted to do and he wasn't he was iconic because of it I think that's that's part of it it's like you just have to own it well but he did it on a level that was undeniable just like he talked about before because because of his ambition it wasn't just I'm gonna be me it was like I am gonna be me to the farthest extent that I possibly fucking can this is what happened you know me I have a friend who went to his house up in Los Olivos and they went they toured his dance studio and he had this private dance studio and his mirrors against the wall and there's this groove in the floor and this is you know he was later in his life at this point but he had worn out a part of the floor from just practicing his shit wow this is way beyond his teens and 20s that's just like who he was all the time you know what people don't respect a song dragon attack I know the troll and quiver song ogre battle it's not about it's one of those songs that people forgot and you can play but the people on YouTube can hear and we'll probably have to we could play it for us though right we have to do some fancy editing everything we show a video of a caterpillar we get yanked off YouTube we can't use the last time we did we get yanked off YouTube for stuff like when when we put things on the air and that are on YouTube that someone else has listened to this this is this is dragon attack people don't do you don't remember this just think about give me some volume like come on that dicks just out oh my god come on it's forgotten classic you have to have Brian mate gets better on your podcast who the guitar dicks out dicks out what come on all right good feels so good all right we'll have to fade out he'll have to forget it come on Dragon attack people slept on dragon attack that's what he needs best songs it's just occurred to me right now I did this is the security little feds it's the building oh no I was there fire one hmm oh it's probably next doors getting robbed intervene guys what kind of weapons do you have in this place oh you are a human weapon definitely not this bullets though it's are super hard to defend against okay driver last night baby driver yeah oh my god everyone needs to see it that's why you can't have incredible music and just a great story it's it's Lipton's you guys hear that sound that's how the background is preventing us from playing you beautiful harmonious music what do you want to ask if you have got to get Brian me on your podcast I would love to yeah what's going on young Jamie nobody's next door and the alarms going off so this will be going on forever and this is why we're mean it's kind of cool we should turn it into a rap song like like NWA you know it was like you know we can kind of just I would imagine that things have a time limit where they're allowed to stay on I don't know I think I don't know about that the alert needs would be gonna find out fervent and yeah but what happens they knew we were in here so it goes back on I think the security people after coming what's next door is it worth checking out boom no it's not anything exciting to a bunch of shit I don't know what happened you might have to wrap this bitch up oh we just can we talk through that sure [Music] what's that maybe like a minute or two and I'll see if there's someone out there that's gonna unlock hmm yeah one oh what's gonna happen this could be one of our shortest pot oh I don't know we've been going we've been going for a while 30 for 30 well we've been going since 2 right Shh oh I figured that there's um there's probably not a lot of people working today because today's Monday the third tomorrow's the fourth people just say fuck fuck Monday then yeah there's no I didn't get that extra day Independence Day mm-hmm tomorrow's the day were people gonna do some stupid shit with some firework what are you doing tomorrow tonight we're gonna grill some axis deer fresh from Hawaii oh my god yeah how did you get you just ship it with you on the plane is it special you just freeze it freeze it before you take it back you know put in the cooler Wow yeah just one I do have you permitted for a certain number of deer that you can not in lanai and lanai they don't have any predators so you could really only shot one of them they're really hard to get with a bow and arrow it's hard to get close to them they're super well they they evolved with Tigers this is they're so fast this happened more than once I shot at one and it ran away from the arrow that the arrow is going 200 that's why I switch arrows because I have heavier arrows that go 245 feet a second and in the mid hunt we had to switch to these other arrows that go 275 feet a second I had to gain an extra 30 feet a second because the the deer would even then they still ducked it they would look at the arrow coming their way and get the fuck out of Dodge yeah I mean you're fast that is that's so fast the because they literally evolved running away from Tigers crazy man that there's any chance that's going off anytime soon yeah we got issues folks or we could play with the sound right we don't have to play we could or we could we could definitely just keep doing it does it bother you that this thing is gonna fade into the background no it's I mean I've had a few drinks at this point I feel pretty warm I started Russian it was a little funky shapes we want to play some songs I was at this very time for Putin yeah in New York it had a tiger help whoo famous tiger real one real one well named New York it's called the Explorers Club this place is crazy is like some S&M shit Ben tell us the next one S&M face so it's like a safari type deal like one of those clubs what it would start through like maybe late 1800s Teddy Roosevelt started this place of the country with a bunch of Bros and they have all this taxidermy in this room and one of them is this Pelt of a tiger tigress that killed 48 people what like in India yeah this it kind of like it was a phenomenon it got a taste for blood and started hunting men or people I don't know if it was just just men but um they had this thing on the wall which was insane you know that's a real issue in in India in India there's one part of this river that's very brackish and the Tigers drink this salt water and because of the Typhoon's a lot of times they wind up having a bunch of people wash up in the river and the Tigers want up beating people so they developed a pen chest yeah they have a taste for humans to the point where in there there's one section of India over the past 200 years Tigers have killed over 300,000 people well the focus people still go in there it was a bit from one of my specials it was a bit from talking monkeys in space okay Ben you can yell it's weird it really is true there's a hundred thousand you're like we should leave there's nothing really they could do about it it's not just it's like they've evolved in that way it's not just like one main you know predatory Tiger that's all no no no there's many many many many Tigers over hundreds of years the Tigers are gotten used to eating people like tigers are particularly ruthless it's that funny story when you're like I'm afraid attraction like sharks so many people they don't like the way we taste how the fuck do you know yeah they just don't they don't thank you actually I took a bite and that was fuckin delicious it's like if you expected you're gonna get cottage cheese but instead you got a cantaloupe you kind of freak out look you might really get into cantaloupes after why I fucking love divers in the wetsuit dude I don't give a fuck you know well you know that's not a seal right yeah it's a diver you fuck exactly worst nightmare yeah this one section of this river in India I did this whole bit about it in my 2009 comedy special because it was a real story about a boat of people there was five guys in this boat and three of them were killed by Tigers so the tiger swam out to the boat and jumped in killed a guy dragged him into the water swam to the shore dropped his body off drunk back in the water swim out to the boat again got the next guy sweating his horse or he just killed it Tiger hoarders killing spree that's fucked up god damn three guys this is real why did he make friends with him like I feel like everything you say is really real I would lie about something so important that's crazy yeah thank you just stop and think about what that must have been like my apartment in Silver Lake I got the terror that's what we needed Tigers roaming the streets of silver legs wait let you understand we have Cougars okay coyotes I got this Park they do stay you guys are close at a pamphlet then I should have brought the pamphlets oh yeah that means that the crooks have found the bolts and feels weird now or soon alone their thoughts that's so awkward there was a guy that I had on there was a wildlife biologist it was telling him about the Cougar that lives in Griffith Park hey just just Jack's deer that's all he does in the occasional dog they just and they've monitor this cat everything cool yeah cougar big cat this is a cat they have a photo of him with the Hollywood sign that by the way we have coming we have a print of that coming the for the new studio it has a collar on but it's a wild cougar and they have to capture it every couple of years it's because it's its collar runs out of GPS so the battery dies on the collar so they have to find this fucker and then they have to dart them there it is right there whoa see it has his collar and look in the background with the Hollywood sign that's not planned that was just a camera trap photograph a random flag that collar he was look at his forearms it's like Franco Columbu that's insane Hollywood sign is actually ten feet but do you think he can lift you think he looks like the rock he's built like the rock no he's feel like a powerlifter almost like his front arm look on his face that guy's all the same one yeah he eats a lot of edibles you know I think he's just donors I think if he eats donors my worst nightmare cheese they have to capture this cat every two years his cat's been captured like four times pretty cute too though I figure you had mange there right it's not why they captured him that he had some sort of a disease they had to work with a month but it's so what are they I think his name is p22 Frye is that his name that's what they call him I got no toad he was severely infected with mange yeah that blows sorry dude that sucks it's an intense life and it's a male uh-huh and he's out there running free that's what's really interesting they just let him do what he does running free he's running the show he's like free money he's like King shit he's definitely King shit if you're a jogger he's like Simba you just don't want to catch California if he has a limp and he can't take out deer anymore that's when you're fucked she gotta be packing he's in these are the things that are we were in like Yellowstone and and we were driving through but did not want to get out of the car Mayers Yellowstone is is pretty fascinating it's beautiful I mean we went and saw geysers and all the beautiful stuff but like a week later there was some hiker that just got killed there yeah bye-bye grizzly and it was like there was footage of it it was there was a there was a not a sheriff the Ranger Ranger mobile vehicle went by and the man like literally like seconds after the Ranger drove by it this just huge grizzly goes across the path and there was a hiker who had his headphones on just got mugged did you hear about that kid 11 year old kid that saved a fishing party yesterday no a charging grizzly bear at a fishing party and this 11 year old kid down in Alaska what down it's not a grizzly technically it's a brown bear but they're really the same bear what grizzly is is a coastal brown bear and what a coastal bear is called as a brown bear 11 year old kid charging grizzly with one well-placed shot where is he exactly sighs they tell you if it that's the right designations young Harry Potter that's what that hat says where does it say it was Hoonah Alaska go to go to the map and find out where the fuck who knows 11 Kona Alaska the kid lives in Hoonah Alaska that's amazing it's like equally as sad as it is like way up yonder you don't want the season people died from the bear but then you feel bad for the bear that's that's actually a brown bear they're calling it a grizzly but it's on the coast do you know I think that's I think that's detect that might be wrong aunt Diana lived in Juneau look how fucking bit Alaska's go back you look how much it is do you I've been there a bunch I've been there a few times for fishing I did a show there once to fish Joe salmon what they're fun like us sure I love to fish let's do it yeah so does Ben what sorry let's do a family vacation I would love planets about it or cook out but Alaska's is you know what's really crazy the that I didn't anticipate how fucking aggressive the mosquitoes are because they only live for like a week where the stuff like yeah another move is thermos l if you you know what thermos L is I don't press a but it's an ingenious device that my friends the rivets up in Alberta told me friends called the rivet rivets John gen John gen rivet their hunting guides in Alberta but you press this button and it lights this okay a little tiny element inside of it and it heats up that blue pad go back to that thing that blue pad you change those out after a while they become white and that blue pad puts out this a mist no it burns it burns off a fine mist that you can't detect but fucking mosquitoes don't want no part of it amazing yeah and it makes your dick grow what is that thermos L are those heated is that heated or is that goes in your shoe this is a thermos elf foot pad that somehow another report keeps mosquitoes out maybe not maybe didn't have any color other coast when we lived in Nashville I would have to wear off for sensitive skin during the day because I would get bit up by mosquitos all day and people would always tell me that I smelled amazing mmm and I'd say oh it's off sir just I write all of my test of magic marker I did [Music] know why you like it but you love that smell it again right thermos cell being so covered myself and I just make it dark red myself stop it thermos smell makes lon like those little things that you stick in the ground like a little lawn lantern but they keep mosquitoes away it's the same they did they do that - this is not a firm sell commercial guys we have a pretty easy in California with the mosquitoes with everything yeah fucking everything except earthquakes we get it easy we don't have weather no I killed a spider in my bedroom in the middle of the night last week my curtain window imagine if you were living in Hoonah last grizzly bear you caught him out there oh wow right I live here for a reason but like if you were like screaming from the spider and you broke the Kurt and then you looked out the window as the bear was in full charge it would put it all in perspective wouldn't it sure what Jamie I goddamn it really didn't have a big deal 11-year old hunter so he's fucking owned in that shit yeah bitches around planes gone but visit this kid there's older women that tend towards pedophilia that are right now grooming oh yeah that's what they do know they don't wanna go to jail so the older girls they just become your friend and then they mentor you for a few years and then when you hit 18 they just just sucking that's what is more gym that's what I hear because a lot of women are realizing wrongly so they get arrested for having sexual these young boys I think just let it go but once these women do realize that there's real consequences to it what they do is just did befriend them they become friends with these long being of the hanger it's not dark it's only darkness girl trust us right bend my right sure Oh usually way around the woman's hot you have an issue that she's 25 she really likes you she teaches you art and crafts and Susy I get it I mean I mean that no why do we go from here Oh home into a fetal position it's um Mary Kay Letourneau the girl that she's still with that boy there's still and they they had a fake divorce they had to get a divorce because he's going into the wheat business really mm-hmm they only got divorced so that she wouldn't be like legally it wouldn't be like a legal issue with him selling weed something with him and her he was protecting her so they got a divorce but they're still together and happy apparently story like that coming out like every week right now but like a young teacher substitute teacher 24 accused of sex in two counties with her 17 year old student okay it's only seven years difference folks okay they gotta let that go my parents have a huge age gap between them q yeah how many years a team how old is Ben's dad 70 78 now is you're not planning you get three tries that was to try look up you're playing this game I would tell you three things one okay I'm 31 years old I'm about to turn 30 to next week second thing is my dad is crazy fucking old crazy and the third thing is one person my entire life has ever guessed old enough I mean you can go crazy you okay all right so hard free pass they're the oldest guy ever okay I think your dad is 95 years old okay you actually spot-on really yeah it's turning 96 or 17 that disturbs me 95 you want to just take a shot in the dark but obviously no you gave me a lot of parameters to work in that's true but still with the Frazee old if it was your first guess people on the parameters never guess up I love that Joe just guessed your dad's proper age yeah and he'll be 96 in November that's Croley shake it yeah dude what are you what the fuck is going me that was just a lucky guess if I guessed when you didn't tell me he was crazy old Dan it would be impressive I feel like you give people yeah yeah but you hear what I'm saying nobody has ever done it yeah yeah but that matter but you just said it I got lucky listen but if you if you like that this is why I like psychics are a problem they start leading you mental and then they give you a bunch of information you get a bunch of information first then they take a guess like if I told you that I was a psychic and then we went through this whole thing I sense your dad is he's getting he's getting on but maybe not maybe he is I mean he's doing well you're right you're sure yes my dad's really older he is I feel like he's older am I on to something yes yes I feel like I feel like it's a big issue I feel like he's older than you admit it's it's definitely beneficial so I feel like he's I want to see he's 95 right see my god you know that seems like that's what psychics do those fucks bitches I got a friend of mine and he went to psyches like dude it's gotten you all about my grandmother I'm like don't you know about Grandma you know about your grandma right so this guy knew some shed that you already know tell this guy to tell you some shit that you don't know you want someone to tell you things you already know that is fucking ridiculous you're gonna set her off no not a bad way but and I've only I've never experienced it first hand I've never had a psychic or someone with that kind of energy tell me something that I was like wait what the fuck did you just say but there's people like you in my life who I trust who have had experiences that are unexplainable I am yeah I've had psychics tell me family secrets that I've bent over backwards to try to understand how they could possibly know what they knew and I'm always skeptical but I definitely had people that told me things that there's fucking no way they could know here's the question though did you give them any answers to other questions before that no none so they just told you right away your uncle's gay and he has a boy that he lives with he pretends his son but it's really just Joe what's right I mean without without your interpretation yes yeah about that but something that ridiculous that outrageous that they could only guess and you didn't give him any answers to any questions below that no I thought I heard on your podcast maybe not but there there's a documented history of the military experimenting yes so I mean if severe amending but for years and years and years if there's no actual question no that's not necessarily true because they wanted to find out if there was an answer and the only way you find out is if you have you have to run some tests and they're called remote viewing and we actually had some remote viewing experts on that TV show that I did for a while called Joe Rogan questions everything we sat down with them and I had all these reluctant these remote viewing guys who at the end of days it seems a lot like psychics it's like there's no like they claim to have seen some things and pointed out some things that helped some operations and this and that but it's all top secret whether or not it's true you're never gonna know you're never gonna know whether they're bullshitting you or something really did go down mm-hmm but I've never seen anybody do it we had two guys tried to do it they were supposedly experts in it they couldn't do shit and I think there's a lot of people that aren't authentic but that's true there's a lot of money in shenanigans there's a lot of money in palm-reading the people that aren't gonna charge you the money are probably the people that are actually doing something that is meaningful maybe or it might be like a Stephen King book where you drive no streets see that neon light and it says fortune teller and you go in and some lady who sees through your soul and he does and she really does know things and it's just like this is how she gets by with this magic gift you just pay her twenty bucks a pop and she just tells you crazy shit and you do what you do with that but she knows and no one ever believed she knows it doesn't make any sense this fucking lady on Ventura and victory like her own father fuck the show's margin how does she know how does she know all this she knows but she does Ventura doesn't intersect with victory oh oh wow there's the catch so when you're in them in the police office why are you telling him no I'm telling you the police was there it was real she was a real person I murdered them the Wilsons have been living on Ventura and victory for 37 years and they've never moved you get back to the house that's the house where weird where the Rudy fortune-teller shot go are you making fun but I know I want to believe you right because we're gonna talk about the barbecue my buddy so you really believe you believe in psychic I've had too many things that I can't explain that I I'm always gonna question but I have has anybody ever told you something was gonna happen then it happened I don't like that shit and I don't I don't subscribe to that so you shut your mouth I don't subscribe to that because I don't want someone to tell me my future I don't think that's unfair and I think that's as disrespectful weird word to use the experiences I've had with these people were with people that have died that I I've communicated with whether through dreams or psychedelics and I had questions but I didn't ask them and I waited to see if they would tell me and it's just kind of that sort of setup here's the thing it might be real and it might be that real what real is is so ridiculous that it's almost like you can't bottle it you can't measure it you can't put it on the scale and it only exists in these brief moments and it comes and it goes you'll never be able to prove it and it just comes and goes and it makes you think like god I think I really believe there really that really did happen and no one really knows and everybody just goes about their business but it really did you really did tap in he really did talk to someone who's not there anymore I I think whether you did or didn't is is up to your acceptance of the experience and whether it's your ego or something you can't explain and if it brings you comfort that's great pressure if it brings you comfort right I mean that's the same argument for religion you know people say the religion is bullshit you go and well okay but it's bullshit that makes people happy if it makes people happy then it's not bullshit it's bullshit that makes people happy and also controls people does really terrible things so it's all does it have to have to do all those things but really I mean there's a lot of it's it's very multifaceted like sugar but sure sugar kills a lot of people but it also tastes delicious yeah but you know what's funny like I found out recently that Scientology religion is the one of the main backers for an art Narcotics Anonymous they are look it up I believe that tell me I'm wrong gauntlet thrown well they definitely don't like psychiatric medicine and and so that's a really interesting window into manipulation and trying to get people to subscribe to something and here's the thing there's a lot of fucking shit out there and I don't I don't know what's right I can just speak to my own experiences and things that I absolutely question with with so much thought and and continue to do so from things that have happened years ago and I just I I can't deny how I felt and what I've experienced and I want to keep living and understanding whatever it is if you know there's a reason why we're here or there isn't and we're just here but I I I'm not religious I feel really I feel interested in religion and and some of the things I've experienced over the years being raised Catholic and and you're kind of talking about a religious experience sure sure I mean when you say that word you think that everyone's gonna think of specific sorry it doesn't need is did we are we are because it's not really a religion to me it's not like some organized what's what's not a religion the like spiritual energetic exchange of information because I I guess I equate religion and this is where we can all talk about this and like I am so I don't know if I'm right I'm not like preaching little ways and no one knows if you're wrong either but but religion to me is like the Catholicism I was raised on that and that requires guilt and wrongfulness and sin and money because you go to church and you put your money in the basket every Sunday and I I don't I've seen enough and I know enough about pedophilia within the Catholic Church that's undeniable you can't organization organization sure but I think two different different people it's not the exact same that nark on and on it's not synonymous is so Narconon is what the scientology beat okay it's an organization that promises promotes rather the theories of Scientology founder l ron Hubbard right regarding substance abuse okay I appreciate that and his you know all of l ron Hubbard stuff a lot of it came from other psychology right textures and lectures rather in texts and books and stuff if you read the rudimentary levels of l ron Hubbard's teachings they're like amazing and then they start getting weirder and weirder and you're like wait a minute wait a minute it's it's really interesting and I think that's even he didn't believe in psychics I know what are you saying I don't really believe in psychics either I just believe in my experiences I think that there's a there's a difference I think there's a lot of I think you should question everything and then try to understand yourself the best that you can I think unique moments can be unique I think there's these things that happen when you think about someone on the phone rings and they can tell you all day long that's a coincidence man how often do you think about them and the phone doesn't ring they might be you might be right you might be right but there are some pretty unique moments and I'm not convinced are measurable I don't know if they're measurable right I think those unique moments we think about someone they text you I don't I don't necessarily think that there's been adequate studies doing done on that and I think there's a lot of people that have these contrarian ideologies that they really love to dismiss things like this and they really love to dismiss the potential connections that people have between each other but we know we have connections when we're near each other we know you know like some people can just look at you and you look at them we have like people have weird connections with others you also know when someone's upset at you and they're not being honest about it you know like this weird we have weird sort of ways of feeling each other out that don't necessarily fit on a scale but not quantifiable but they're right there there you can't measure them but you feel them that's funny I was reading this article about that kind of ties it in music to that just talking about you know though you're talking about our ability to read each other's facial expressions emotional expressions and that's a successful trait you know that's something that's part of the development is stuff right and basically this I'm just getting into it but this articles just talking about how those it's just a lot of scientists trying to understand our people like why the fuck is music important like this doesn't you know you know why is this such an obsession the human obsession well do you think is a drug to that I mean it certainly is like even like the other day I was watching rocky for rocky for came on just out of nowhere I was flipping to and songs that I don't even think are good anymore you know but I recognized the drug-like effect that like you know one of those Rocky songs the survivor Rocky songs but it's a combination of the movie and the music yes it's not just the music there's a visual but sometimes not like sometimes just the music you know like when I run yeah when I run and if I listen to music I can go longer oh sure yeah what's that what the fuck's going on there how come you know is tired when you listen in to an emotional response and you're inspired you're layered though you're inspired by something that was that was taught to you at a different time the the rhythm of the music was was ingrained in you at some point I can listen to Motley Crue at my heart and I can get up any fucking hell I would imagine it took an indigenous tribe and played like rock music they'd be like what the fuck yeah they had no idea what it was but maybe they wouldn't because there's there's rhythm and there's a lot of there's a lot of musical tribal contributions to that area of your life I don't know [Laughter] we're not off the rails right we're good we're so good I feel like this is our best one yet maybe we've said that before it's been over two years almost two years oh well you guys are still the only band I've ever worked with come on never worked with a band for shows never did shows we did a couple shows those were fun such a blast they were so much fun you are so you you they were like people were trying to count down and you weren't done with your bit and you're like fuck you I'm not done and then you said okay now we can celebrate the new year it was amazing it was so great Welles in the middle of a bit people look what I missed it by ten seconds folks great well we did the end of the world pod early December 21st 2012 was the big one that was the first one we did we did the end of the world one which Stanhope and Joey yeah that's right yeah we planned that one they're still here yes in advance yeah yeah we knew we were gonna do stand open I talked about doing that like cuz he got tired of me talking about the Mayan calendar let's fuckin promise we're gonna do a show December 21st let's do it let's get Diaz on board then you know I met you guys like let's hop music cuz I'm a fucking crazy into the world December 24 and then the life went on for five more years like everything was okay thanks for bringing us on that was fun it was fun for us too it's fun how did you get so how did you get the Alex Jones one to be 9/11 do I to fit some podcasts in I had to do like extra ones the week before just so I could get to number 911 with Alex yeah that sounds like a long see that's why I could've had him on earlier and I would have definitely had him on again for 9/11 but having one the first time for 9/11 and to this day that's our biggest podcasts by really far by maybe five million downloads fuck yeah but here's the conspiracy right is that right am i saying correctly what is the actual number it was like said prior 16 now I didn't check in the last two or three days but okay so it's 16 million dot here's what's crazy it never charted on iTunes the iTunes charts magically went down while the Alex Jones podcast was in the queue and they stayed down for over a week conspiracy theory and then when it came back up podcast that got way less downloads than Alex's were r-rated much higher than his and they had happened before and after I do remember his was the only podcast that was left out of the ratings loop like for sure whatever the number one podcast in the country it was the number one podcast we did by a mile and I had the number one podcast before it's like number one podcast episode that was more than five million downloads more than any other podcast I had before so it sure for sure probably would have been number one if it was a lot of downloads unless they had like one of those serial episodes or something that came out that week OS town mmm so there you go and that's it's it's very likely that someone's trying to hold Alex Jones back and that's just Stokes his fucking fact they don't understand it's a Streisand effect can still fire of Alex Jones even Megyn Kelly's fuck now her show is going down the toilet is it like what happened in the aftermath she hears that here's the problem here's the problem megyn kelly was a fox news person she left fox news to go to NBC NBC is thought of as CNBC which is thought of as fake news by these right-wing Trump Trump bands what would you call them Trump a British Trump errs so as soon as she goes over there they're not gonna listen to her and then to the Liberals she's Fox News right so they're not interested in her either and then she does this podcast with Alex Jones or this interview rather with Alex Jones and the interview with Alex Jones she says I'm not gonna paint you out as a monster I'm gonna give you a fairy she's saying all these things like she's gonna throw softballs this way I want people to get to know you and he releases all that he's like hey this is that person and the ratings just keep falling you got it if you want to be an ice princess yeah go box news full life if you want you want to sell guns you want to be a second Amendment for pronet with cold blue steel eyes and then smooth shiny legs and nice shoes and tiny skirts SquarePants are the oil them up - yeah of illegal immigrants sure you do it then it's just kind of natural thing for me oh really your hairless and the legs somebody's gotta be like that I gotta be somebody out there with no leg hair huh I'm sure it happens it's called purity yeah she always called sure has been you brought it up one day we're all gonna have no hair and they're gonna look back at pictures of us think of her what the fuck were they doing facial hair and show everyone that dream no eyebrows eyelashes I really think that's the future I think the future is those aliens for Close Encounters I think the reason why we have those archetypal images in our head is since we know that's where we're going you ever talk to Paul Hellyer or looked at his stuff I'm sad he's like the Canadian alien dude but he was he specifically talks about the like different types of aliens come on Joe sure with no evidence he definitely would tell us all about these all unfortunately I don't know him but I know them but the whole is it because you're an alien and you don't want people to know I think there's a business it's okay you know you for who you are the problem is there's a business and telling people the aliens would give us more tech if we'd stop wars all right let's play this I'm gonna hear this what's that oh it's not but it's on Artie but why is he the ones unit he was on Artie that's what it says on Artie that's just a picture of it that's just a screenshot oh it was on right so he's got to be it's got to be a video of it no there's many videos of Paul and do you buy it when you listen to him talk makes me question I had to hear I'm interested I like to hear his voice to see if my crazy radar goes off just give me a little pairwise morale to tell us wise when what you feel you got to different shit plan Jamie's at a bar because I know that they are okay they've been as a matter of fact they've been visiting our planet for thousands of years and one of the cases that would interest you most if you give me two or three minutes to answer Cold War 1961 there were about 50 UFOs in formation flying south from Russia to the across Europe and the supreme Allied commander was very concerned and about ready to press the panic button when they turned around and went back over the North Pole so they decided to do an investigation would investigated for three years and they decided that with absolute certainty that four species four different species at least had been visiting this planet for thousands of years so that's we have a long history of UFOs and of course there's been a lot more activity in the last few decades since we invented the atomic bomb and they're very concerned about about that and the fact that we might use it again and because the whole cosmos is a unity and it affects not just us but other people in the cosmos they're very much afraid that we might be stupid enough to start using atomic weapons again and this would be very bad for us and for them as well so no serious scientist has ever publicly confirmed evidence of an encounter with extraterrestrials why would scientists not confirm the fact if they exist I'm afraid they must go out of their weight and not to find out because if they did you know even ten percent of the amount of research I've done in the last eight years they would be as convinced as I am I mean they could do it even faster might take them a little longer when they didn't have a military background but there are so many wonderful books that tell these these stories and and they've been authenticated the the sightings have been authenticated by more than one witness and also by radar okay this is the same horseshit they've been authenticated by witnesses that doesn't mean anything there's no real video there's no real photographs nothing looks good a lot of people were talking about it but when you think about how many human beings there are there's 320 million plus in America how many of them are crazy at least 1% that's three million two hundred thousand crazy people how many of them really believe what they're saying at least half so you got a hundred you got a lot of fucking crazy people well this is one video so I watched a couple of his and it's just it's interesting to think about in terms of like we're here it's all interesting to think about but as soon as someone starts talking like that he says they've been authenticated there was more than one witness that means nothing sure people are full shit you just I saw something doesn't mean anything you might have you might not have but if he's a hundred percent all in and he hasn't had the UFO experience himself he's talking about well then he's then he seems gullible I talked to a lot of those people I talked to those people that had been I talked to people did implants pulled out of their body I talked to people that were experts I have seen what I seen one well it's something that gives me light a lot I don't know I haven't seen one but I'm kidding but what he just said there did not impress me because he said that multiple people had seen it like more than one person that confirmed it that doesn't mean anything like you could have five guys alive that doesn't tell the truth I don't think so Italians comb UFOs my people do that folks yeah I've never heard that Oh how'd I do Harry Potter was a fail but I came back around it was a new phone it's not to dismiss the possibility of UFOs it's just that you got to really be careful with how people talk about stuff sure you got to be you know if someone starts talking that they know something and they well that's that's one video I watched a few of his videos and they were really interesting he was he was speaking before Canadian Congress talking about this and I've watched a lot of it and its entirety it's just worth thinking about that's all I don't know what the truth is I just sure please always just the fact that he has a lot of videos out there makes me wonder because that means that he's making a living doing this so this is a this is a gig this is a thing you're you're speaking before the Canadian Congress of course if he does a bunch of these other interviews as well that allows him to infer that's his thing sure his thing is I'm the guy who knows everything about UFOs right but if you were talking to scientists they would say show us their evidence right oh there's nothing that's the thing about these guys they all have stories and so one has any evidence yeah I mean I don't have any evidence but it feels good to think that they're out there right yeah I want to know I want to know stuff I mean like look at all the shit that we have and we're here and all the things that we all the resources that we use and we're one planet in a universe full of other planets that's all there it is way up there I'm not afraid to say that I'm curious I think people generally it feels like a normal thing to be like yeah they're fucking out there i but what I think is hard to accept we have evidence what's hard to accept is that they're communicating with us and only certain people like Paul Hellyer know know maybe he does know and maybe he has seen something but maybe he's full of shit the problem is if you haven't seen it and I haven't or at least I don't think I have and you're talking about these things how much time you spend thinking and talking about him like it gets to become almost like a pathology why are you so invested in something that you don't even know is real but it becomes a thing that people are into like they're into baseball scores are they're into bowling they get into UFOs they get into it and then they start I mean this dude's obviously making a career out of it he's out there traveling don't know that I mean I've got something to investigate upon this conversation but it makes it's made me think for years like I've seen some Paul Hellyer videos and I'm just like wow okay it makes me think that's all maybe and I'm sure I will always be curious about that about aliens and psychics and all the shit it's so in that way where it's like yes or no I just don't know I don't know I'd love to keep learning I would too but I think that with guys like this when you're talking about a subject that this mercurial this is such a difficult subject I think it's very important to only talk about the actual facts like what we know we don't know if you want to talk about his own personal experience that's one thing but when you start talking about stories that you heard like okay people are full of shit from the beginning of time when telling stupid stories about werewolves and fucking vampires a lot of damage is done - it's like it's all derivative passed down like oh I heard this from this and this and this but you weren't there so you don't know you know it's I'm reading this book about our brains and how our recollection of a member of memories and like eyewitnesses are usually inaccurate and accurate because you're you don't really remember like you think you did and your brain lies to you and tells you that you saw something a certain way right and and even that like I don't know it is that's very important for people and absolutely absolutely a lot of people out there think their memories are super accurate when this ties in to being wrong just ties in to being like I didn't see it the the way that I think I did and I might have made a mistake and I'm sorry you know like that's okay that's important too because I think a lot of times when you have some big statement about something that you believe in or like if you want to get down to having some sort of trial of this or that and you say I remember it just like this right it's a nigga traumatic and emotional which I sell it it's just selling it like you're running for Congress it's it's $40,000 a day Oh frightening really yeah it is people that are trying to convince people I mean that's one of the reasons why being a president so crazy because you're basically like trying to trick people into liking you trying to be charismatic and ever say I made a mistake today every day I'm sorry I messed up I'm sure somebody must have publicly I don't know I think there's there's moments I think it's just like a probably nice she's really interesting he's gonna happen to happen it's gonna have to happen someday so seeing it Joe I don't know which one that is insanely fortunately I think you sound great no you guys sound great what come on why don't you guys sing us a song you

make that convention okay I'd love to I like that guy he's a great so what happened so they just they needed a band I guess they were looking at kind of like a spur-of-the-moment thing Greg's like okay I'm thinking there's gonna be a band that closes out every episode kind of transitions between strip club two episodes and a friend of ours oh poor Jaime Pressly this is crazy did you guys work with Jaime yeah one theme we got to do a scene at AAA with her I did a terrible movie never went anywhere they call I don't remember but she was super nice Oh Danny Pudi the guest book premieres August 3rd and it's on TV look he's got all the things I want weirdos in a log cabin boom alright play a song that didn't make it on the show hey what the fuck happened that song punk kid like where is that at what's the status honey honey fourth record when we're ready to make and that song like the riff from that song was on my Denver comedy special Rocky Mountain High I love that song that song was fuckin great like what happened it did well on our last record there was a snafu I think label politics a little bit like it was a little more rock and roll and it wasn't as Americana and it just it was our choice to keep it off eventually but we got a song that we this was a couple years ago we came out here to work with a great dude and keifa's chauncey or ciencia and we just did a set and there was that and a couple other songs that we did that that were ours we own this music with things where we owned it and they didn't want to pay for it they didn't want it so we were on a record they would have owned it and not have right so we were like fuck we put all this effort into this song and we love this song but it was just that that thing were like we had to fight for it and it's a great song it's not going anywhere it'll it'll come it'll come out eventually people don't know about that song though back in the day so it never made it on anything else other than that YouTube video is it on anything else where people can listen to it um what we put it out people downloaded it we used it to raise money for this vehicle only you guys own it yeah so if we played it it wouldn't it wouldn't like trip any alarms or anything no you can play it anytime play that shit right now go cook can you find it but if see the not the version they played here let's see if there's another version of it they can find like the pure studio version because it's so good that was love that song that was like one of my favorites I know when your new album came out I was like where's the song where's punk kid it was a big debate it was a real thing in the Fockers well that's okay you know you just got to keep forging ahead and figuring out how to maintain your integrity and also like what you've worked for and that was we just didn't want to give it up we didn't want someone else to be like yeah we own this well I'm glad you didn't but I can't imagine how you guys do it because if that was me and I like I found out that my jokes like a bit that I did that I worked really long and hard on all of a sudden if I wanted to put it on a special someone else was gonna own it without even paying me or I'd be like really fuck you man that's crazy this is why I'm making my own furniture for my apartment or this computer to another computer what is it is it on Spotify is that what you guys said man I think I've got it in my iTunes you could plug it in there you got an aux no it's one of those yeah stupid-ass god damn fucking iPhones Android phones have an ox yep okay okay okay I've seriously considered enjoyed several times there's a new one this new Google pixel 2 is coming out and then also the new Galaxy s8 it doesn't set on fire no okay yes the one the note 7 was the one that went on fire ok galaxy 7 never went on it's all over the airport's - it's like oh just so you know yeah so the Galaxy s8 is dope I've thought about that one and then the Galaxy Note 8 which is coming out soon this is pretty killer - they're they're just as good as iPhones now it's just getting off the Apple is the issue you know apple the Apple tip that connects you to iTunes it's all makes your life more convenient but I'm on the Google tattoo I love Google it's good I use it all the time it's a juicy like at least a decaf there's so much information yeah I mean one I mean if I had to choose between a company that I rely on more if I could just use a Google phone but I could still use Google right we got to go with Google right that's that's giant I use that way more than I use anything it was like googling things I mean who doesn't you need to know shit I need like what is my shoe size in European size very big that's a good answer very big if you want to order some shoes from overseas feet as well I do yeah I'm so sweet really big ass why well I'm fucking I could probably output you as my feeders lend to him yeah I've been on this trail running kick I run with those feet choose those five finger shoes people I've never seen a foot product generates so much hate room five finger shoes but I don't like the way it looks how do you feel about it I don't give a fuck how do you any pack the grocery store the other Lumia with him make me get rid of my temper skin he had a fanny pack sorry a lot of people wearing him out he gave me the stink eye a little bit because he knew you didn't know that you knew how do I feel what I wear I'm saying I feel it's hard because I'm running rocky hills and I'm running a lot of miles so like three miles on these great porn through name guys go with ridiculous tits but it's tricky like today I ran them in like Under Armour trail shoes which I got to be honest I kind of liked better because you were honest full-on they have a lot of great shit oh my they're they're one of the most eco athletic lines that's really yeah well they're also one of the very few big companies that support hunting they have a whole hunting line and that that means that's a choice you want to endorse honey honey we are willing and ready big fan big fan underarm where the gallons been thrown for rock and roll are you ready to expand stage where holy shit stage where I've always wanted to have tracksuits for the whole band like when we're loading in like do a lot of work but let me be honest if you get attracts food don't you have to get adidas some velour I bet you play pool real good right now though right we played pool earlier and I did not play my back but you know what was bizarre because I beat Joe so badly

like organize our social media because our honey-honey website looks like our records just coming out and it came out three years ago but we're working on that this is part of the DIY conundrum well

teams around do you like when they get obsessed with you and they get weird it's you have an assign your thing thank you my pleasure I hit this game change it you guys could figure out how to get one
