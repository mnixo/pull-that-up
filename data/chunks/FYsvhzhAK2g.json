then we're live all right sir what's going on man very well thank you first of all thank you very much for the coffee machine and this all that it's turmeric I used to say tumeric I used to not even think there was an R in there for some strange reason well in Hawaii it's Olenna so it just depends on which country you're in yeah it's a what it what is it's a root right yeah to the ginger family and is it why they call it Elena is that up that's just why in name I mean the Indians probably have another you know in India it's probably one of the most use you know our roots they it's in every air air all Indian foods it's full of it yeah that's really healthy for you right it's great for inflammation yeah it will gut health - mm-hmm so you gave me this layer superfoods coffee machine and I'm addicted to this now this coffee with turmeric I've never had it before well there's some other minerals and stuff in there too so if you're addicted to it it's because there's things that are good for you yeah I got crave it yeah like it seems like something well your body wants it yeah you know I think sometimes people think cravings are based on negative like oh I just it's bad because I crave it but I think cravings are natural I think it went but it's you know we abuse it when we use garbage but when you're craving something like that I mean there's you know a bunch of minerals and a bunch of good fats and there's a bunch of good stuff in there yeah it's hard to tell though right like sometimes you crave sugar sometimes you crave ice cream yes there's some cravings that are not good exactly other ones are exactly but the system of craving I believe what is part of a natural human thing that we have that was meant to crave good things but we abuse it with what because sugar and nature is meant to be safe means it's safe to eat right right right so so yeah so that we so that but then we abuse it by disguising a bunch of garbage with sugar and then people think oh that's great to eat that makes sense yeah cuz whenever I lift weights I crave protein ya crave like fish or chicken or steak or something yeah well you're yeah you're beating up muscles you want protein yeah but it's an instantaneous craving yeah it's like right away I'm like ah gotta eat something so you've got me cranking the sauna up your wife told me the you crank yours up to 220 degrees is that real that's real god damn man I get to 210 I'm like this is how long do you do it to 20 well it depends on how how cold you go into it oh so if you're if your body if your core temperature is way down you can you know it if you if you got off a stationary bike and your core was nice and hot and you went in there you you know you'd be lucky to get 10 or 10 or 15 minutes out if you come out of a ice tub or you've been outside with minimal clothing you could go in there and for 20 minutes at 220 so it just depends on you know where your what your court you know where your core is is that how you do it you do from a nice path I will do it from a nice path that just you know I think you just break it up it's just like anything any kind of training you just want to constantly stress the system and if you're used to a certain pattern you know go into it hot like if you go into a sauna hot coming off of some cardio that it's twice as hot if you go in cold then you can go for a longer period of time and same with the ice I mean if you go into the ice cold the ice will tap you if you go in hot you can be there so they're doing some studies now on hot yoga out of Harvard they're trying to figure out if hot yoga mimics the positive health effects of sauna and so the idea is that you know because you're straining and resisting it's much it feels much hotter than 104 degrees yes Donna there was one hundred four hundred five degrees would be nothing for sure but yoga at 105 degrees is pretty rough rough well because again core temperatures so we do some stationary bikes in the sauna and that I mean that's just it's like you can always up the ante you know it's like a weight stack just slap more LED on there and we'll do we'll do we'll go in this with an assault bike I have an assault bike in one of the saunas and we'll tranq that thing up and you know I mean you're lucky if we might be five or ten minutes and you're you're but I think you know we're such good adapters or our you know our adaptation is amazing and you do some stuff for a while I think you do it pretty soon you're like oh I can handle a you know an assault by again at a survivable pace you know you survive that's a rough machine rough machine I have the rogue version yeah echo bike yeah that thing is fantastic I love it for sure that's all for limps yeah all four of them's it's one of my all-time fit too Tabata I got Tabata specs on it my all-time favorite method of cardio pressure for sure well low impact on the system you're not beating everything the joints mm every all four things are working you can throw in some nose breathing in there or something and breath holding intervals or something just to you know we're heat and suffering you were explaining nose breathing to me out there yeah how nose breathing is better better for you because of well first of all you were designed to breathe your sinuses and your nose were designed for breathing and so you actually admit a gas in your sinuses from my understanding a gas called nitric oxide which is a vasodilator it helps you absorb oxygen so by breathing through your nose plus you reduce the amount of intake that you have and that gets you co2 tolerance so all of a sudden you're breathing less volume I mean you know from the fight game as soon as a guy goes to mouth breathing you're like this is toast you know that right that's your first giveaway so your ability to deal with stress and breathe through your nose I mean everybody should be breathing through their nose in their sleep walking around I mean we somehow we became mouth breathers in the last 200 years and they're not sure why there's a great book called the oxygen advantage by Patrick MacDougall that he actually is on our board of xpt but he he you know kind of realized that our issues really stem from mouth breathing chronic mouth breathing which is scrubbing our co2 and keeping our co2 levels down which is the marker to absorb oxygen so when your co2 levels are down you don't absorb the oxygen from your bloodstream the cells don't take it as soon as the co2 goes up then the then the body starts to pull it out of the blood interesting so smaller amounts by breathing through the nose actually makes you absorb more oxygen well it keeps your tolerance yeah but definitely gets your co2 tolerant up but the smaller volume helps your body become more tolerant of higher levels of co2 but the note the sinuses themselves emit that helps the lung absorb the oxygen is and that's you know that's what I've been led to understand I had a broken nose and tell us 40 my nose was useless I couldn't get anything out of it it had been broken like who knows how many times yeah it was all the inside was all caked up with scar tissue and calcified and when I got it fixed it was like the world changed it was like I couldn't do that I just couldn't breathe out of my nose yeah I would go to yoga class he'd tell me to breathe out oh I knows I'm like I don't have one yeah I could smell farts yeah that's it I could smell gas and gasoline like it has to be rough yeah for me to smell it yeah now I have a real nose yeah I always encourage people pull it if you have a broken nose please get that deviated septum fixed well you know surprising if you start to nose breathe even if you have struggle because of the that gas helps you open up a lot of people I mean you know I'm not saying that you have that but a lot of people actually will gain volume after a few weeks of forcing themselves in nose breathe they'll actually start to open up all of that that system does that make sense so it's your body just adapt and try it forces it to open but ya know it's all about nose breathing you know I didn't think I just thought it was just more difficult so it's probably a good thing to do for discipline absolutely and if you can do your cardio and and retain a nose breath you're you're you have another gear because any when you go to mouth it's like you got a it's like having a you know blower in your car or something you open up they you know you open up the air and it's a whole new game so by being able to sustain a high-output up with nose breathing then and like I said it's all about the tolerance for co2 it's how much co2 you can handle in your system you know like that's why altitudes screws people up because the co2 jacks up and they don't have a tolerance and then you get all wonky and you feel like crap yeah it's it's interesting you're talking about cravings because one of the things that I've noticed since I've been I cranked up the to the the temperature in the sauna for the first week to 200 degrees that I've been doing 210 for the last few days and you crave it now I crave it like when I'm at home I'm like can't wait to get back to that goddamn song again meanwhile when I'm in there I can't wait to get out it's weird there what then lies the struggle yeah I mean the ice is the same way like I an addiction to ice and I you know recently I've been just came back from Hawaii and I'm like dealing with this ice machines broken down I'm waiting for the new one I keep calling the guy and go hey what are you gonna put the thing in and he's thinking it's like a luxury like yeah you know you got it what do you mean an ice machine at your house for him because I have a to like restaurant sized ones of them yeah well I have a lot of friends but buddy he's like what do you need that for and I'm like I'd like just just get you know I got the tubs I'm like I'm but my body craves you get it listen your body is just craving the things that are bringing the hormones and do it I mean it's like why you crave exercise you know I have a theory that the reason why people are hooked to cardio activity is because it's forced breathing that people because you wouldn't willingly just sit on your floor and breathe heavy for an hour so your body's like okay let's go for rent like let's go you need to run you better run you better run and then you go run and then the body gets that absorption of all gets a tox again then it really wants the feel I feel like there's probably several factors because also I feel like when I'm really consistent with my workouts I know that I'm gaining momentum and I know like I you know I'm consistent everything's going great I mean great shape right now I got to keep pushing this yeah that feels like it's it feels like a like just just positive results are being achieved and you can sort of get addicted to success well and but also to the body the adaptation if you ever put yourself under some real severe stress in multiple days the first day you feel like you're not gonna be able to make it the second day you're feeling you know like you can't really can't make it the third pretty soon the fourth day the body is like oh this is the new house we're living in like this is where we're at okay well we're gonna adapt and modify and then pretty soon you're doing even more your than you were doing the first couple days and you're not even feeling it yeah and so it's like we're that we're an amazing an amazing machine you know we're an amazing creature just the way we can handle the load and especially in this in our new world where we you know don't have to do much you know Eddie Izzard is yeah the comedian yeah yeah yeah he he ran a series of marathons all around the UK yeah I did one in South Africa and he was on the two weeks ago and he was telling me that when you first started doing it like the first few were really hard but then your body's like well this is what we do we run marathons and then like day three day four things started picking up day five and by the time day ten came along he's just running for sure yeah for sure I got a friend ran 125 in a row and then he ran the Boston after that and then he had a fight in Vegas and he ran a marathon in the morning and then he like knocked the guy out in the third round and after I mean he says he made a marathon in the morning and then fought that day holy shit that's a cool this Tom Jones yeah muy Thai seven-time white dye world champion Jesus Christ Tony Jones yeah yeah fuck man you run a marathon today fight magic dude knocked you out yeah fuck yeah muy Thai fuck this Tom Joe that's crazy so he got 125 marathons in a row so 125 days of marathons to Boston and then he ran the Boston when he got there he ran across the country what he ran across the country that's how he got there so he did a marathon I took a nap yeah eat some food ran a marathon taken a piece of what the fuck just shows you that you know that ability to adapt and what we can you know what we can do it's amazing how the body will just when you push it and you keep it'll just be like it'll ramp I mean and I think for us in this in our new world that we live in that seems so crazy but probably in the past you were like oh yeah well we went all the way down to South America and we did some hunting down there and then we you know Trek a marathon or two per day and we came all the way back to Alaska you know like right you know that was just our life yeah well especially when they used to persistence hunt you know when they would just run an animal down yeah animals yeah are great for Sprint's yeah especially like gazelles and things along those lines but you know what you know what the real technique really is based on is that are breathing that breathing is what gives us we have an ability to adjust our breath so we can actually adjust how many times we breathe per motion where a lot of these animals are breathing for a rep every rep is a breath so every step is and we can do multiple steps in one breath and so that why our that's why we can outrun a horse at the end of the day you always see the in the cowboy movies the horse is laying dead in the desert and the guys still going along but because the those mammals are breathing every breath is a rep and you imagine how tiring that is like you're a horse right right they're breathing every and we're we running full speed but we can just do a breath and then do five or six or eight reps and that gives us that endurance that's why we can run those gazelles down because those guys are just breathe they're their breath down that's interesting well I'm always very appreciative of guys like you that are in my age range your speed limit yeah yeah limit your but you're also very fit and very active and you keep going whereas a lot of guys around 55 like it's a wrap turn off the car yeah there's not much in the tank and so I'd like to see guys that are in my age bracket a little bit ahead of me like oh he's going go I can keep going to go full spin I think a lot of that is just thinking and knowing that you can because I think so many people feel like hey I'm 45 it's time to settle down it's time to relax you know and wind down this exercise you know you know I think but daily I think people use that as just a disclaimer do not do the work it's like now I'm 45 so now I don't now I don't I'm too old yeah I thought just said that's for me I think that's a way out right that's a way to go hey I don't want to do the work anymore and you know I have my one of my best friends just passed this last year and he was 85 when he passed and and he was crying he did the Ironman 10 times the first time was when he was 50 and then he's done the race across America three times I mean does just he was just an animal bang iron everyday ride the bike just just a 85 he was doing all that still an animal an animal tell the day died I was like and his name was and this is the irony was his name was Don Wildman and so like that's his given name no I'm serious that's amazing has given me I go anybody name the wild man's got to keep it up but he was you know like you're talking about when you can see it right when you can what does it look like when I see I mean you look at it's interesting to see in sports right now we have a lot of athletes right now that are operating they're the oldest that you know that they that we've seen and I believe a lot of it has to do with the fact that that you know that they have some examples but they're also not take accepting that hey now you're too old like that is because that's a decision like hey oh now you're too old oh yeah you know you're gonna keep doing that it's like yeah you're gonna do it all the way until they throw the dirt on the box you know like we're going all the way full speed until we're not and then when we're not we're not wooded mr. wild man died oh it was eventually it was a cancer that he couldn't get fight through chemo and so but anybody was within like a couple weeks like he just was like shut it down he was at one point he was like the he was a little bit like they ever ready bunny and and humpty-dumpty like he would just like double knee surgery like within like you had a broken leg and he'd be on a stationary bike with a crutch on one of the pedals and he'd be pedaling and crutching well on the other leg I mean he was just absolutely out of his mind again and the doctors be like oh you're healing faster than a 30 year old I'm like yeah why he's because he's just a car deal monster and so he's getting that blood flow and and he we were helicopter snowboarding in Chile this last summer not this one but the one before and I was with the run with the guide and the guy goes hey you know I was your buddy and I'm like he's 84 and he looked at me and he's like yeah I know I know me but how old is he and I'm like he's 84 and he's like yeah he's 84 like check it out buddy he's going fakie and like I mean you know he was but he was our you know he was our poster child he's our guy we look like we go I mean and I've had a few of those I think Menino that I've been exposed to in my life were those guys that just those are the guys that I always admired I always admired the guys that just were always going full-speed and never never circuit you know they didn't sir come all that all that pressure from society like hey you're old now you can still do that what do you think you're a kid just all the bullshit that you can feed into and and be a victim of yeah we have these preconceived notions of what it's like to be 30 what it's like to be 50 what it's like to be 85 and some people like yeah you can fuck that I'm not interested yeah because they're never looking at age as some as some like feeling like they're like they're never going all 35 you feel like this at 40 all you're slowing down no you know you just you lay down it's like you know I always say if people stop doing something like they go I'm gonna retire now man I'm getting old in the sport it's really not that they're getting old it's just that they've made a decision that they don't want to do anymore and they just used an age as a like a disclaimer like hey I'm good you know yes for some folks I think it's a mental tiredness keeping up their enthusiasm is probably the difficult thing and that's why I think a lot of people look forward to retirement right they look forward to those golden years where they just holding hands and walking towards the sunset just jump on a sword I mean it's like at that point you're just so then you're just alive dead you know you're just you're you're dead but you're alive like but I think where some people look forward to some day where they don't have to struggle then they can't be on earth yeah you can't believe you can't I mean like I'm sorry the system is a little bit designed to struggle everything that we do that's good for us as has a certain amount of stress it's like you want to get that sauna you want to get on that salt bike you want to jump in that ring you want to hike that mountain it's all stress driven and the fact is that's our universe that's the universe we live in and and so if you got some other and and you know and I appreciate let's hack our way through it and then I think there's waste that hacking supports us we can hack our way to but only support the things that we're doing yeah but thinking that you can just hack your way through and not actually suffer it's impossible you just think you don't appreciate the good times unless you suffer absolutely outside I think I appreciate food more when I work out I appreciate life more I like doing things more at when I struggle absolutely I can tell you I know sitting down is an incredible thing like when you go wow this feels so good yeah because you're straight yeah for sure but a lot of people don't recognize that that's a lesson I think people really need to get drilled into their head it's it's not that tricky right this isn't rocket science this isn't right elaborate it's available for everybody doesn't move yah-tchi move just keep going drive it hard yeah and I can promise you you'll you'll you'll sleep better like everybody we have a lot of sleeping issues right now and I I'm just like well people aren't tired enough yet my daughter was like oh yeah you know having a hard time sleeping and now she's been banging tennis balls seven hours a day and I'm tasty and I don't problem sleeping now right it's just been real well I'm like yeah it and I you know I think there's a lot of it's this lack of movement we're just we just stopped moving yeah and then your brain races because your body's not getting exhausted so you develop all this anxiety and all this weirdness hunter-gatherers did not have the need for ambien I guarantee it yeah there was the other day there was no melatonin yeah the melatonin was was you know created in their retina from staring at the Sun in the early morning light I mean that's they were up they were moving and they're up early and they were and they were and they were going until dark and that dark it was time to lay down and then you just did that and you were not sleep issues weren't a problem back then it's it's interesting I'm learning from my dog because my dog is up first thing in the morning when he signs up and then when when there's it starts getting dark out and once he eats man he's just laying down he's like oh shit over here oh yeah well I'm constantly studying my dog would have brought him but he's getting his nails done today yeah well because he's just ripping up the floor he's got some hooks but but I watch him never leaves his bed without stretching first in the morning first thing down up dog down done full up down dog and then hit full speed 80 miles an hour like little rocket and then just right to the couch in lay down and then just be totally sleeping and then just up full speed to the Kachin lady hi I'm gonna I go there's something to be said about that thing a little stretch full speed lay down full speed lay down like but no warm-up no warmup that's no warmup but people need warmup do you agree I don't know why I don't know I don't know but I don't know about warm up I think warm up is being alive I think you know I mean I mean thing what's that what about if you can only lift something heavy do you think that you should warm the muscles up first well I think if you set the thing up and you put everything on and you set it all up you're already starting to warm up and if you're psyching up and getting your brain ready to do something aggressive I think that you've already the Adrenaline's already going and you got a lot of stuff I mean I know if you just get up off a chair and walk over and try to grab a giant bar with a bunch of weight on it and lift it that might be a problem but that wouldn't be you would never do that in nature when you were gonna lift something heavy it usually there'd be some lead up to it whether you walk to the place that you were gonna and you got the thing and you know I mean you know I don't know I don't know about about because I think there's mixed opinions about you know people say don't stretch before you workout and that's been the most recent thing before it used to be oh yeah I'll loosen up before you workout I'm like I mean my dog does down dog you know up dog down dog and that's only after he's laying down mm-hmm and then he just goes full speed I mean well I know that if I do Muay Thai if I'm hitting the bag or something like that I don't go hard at first yeah break a sweat yeah I do the first two rounds I'm just shadow boxing yeah I'm just putting I mean I don't fully full blast the bag until I'm sweaty yeah but that's just your thoughts I mean I just I feel like that's the way you're supposed to do that's what I've always been told yeah what I mean I think that I think I would connect that more to part of is because of what we are now mm-hmm because my sedentary and because we're not we're not what we you know we are not fully in our in our nature essence we're not we're not wild you know if we were wild I think we wouldn't need as much any warm-up we were in your wild you don't need a warm-up but I think because we're not moving as much because if you're moving all the time you'd already be warmed up they would like to see a human from like 5,000 years ago I'd love to be around like a hunter-gatherer and see what they look like their pain threshold was crazy first of all their what they could endure you know their pain threshold was just open arm and like we'd still be operating with broken stuff no problem yeah what did they do they just kind of like tied it up or something I don't know what that was that was when they advanced into medical right yeah a lot of them probably just hobbled around until it didn't hurt well that's where inflammation came in mm-hmm everything got inflamed so they would hold it you know naturally the body would hold it in position so that you I mean inflammation is designed to kind of immobilize it cast it would you know if it was your ankle it just gets so swollen it couldn't move but they'd still be on it they'd still be rolling it just they wouldn't be moving it around because the body would naturally do that the future of humans does not look so rosy when you really think about how we're slowly deteriorating becoming these gelatinous balls of meat and what issue and the bodies are connected to the brains and so that's why we have some mind issues too because at the end of the day the bodies aren't functioning correctly so that's not feeding the brain correctly and so the brain that's why we I mean I think that when you're really physically well then your thoughts are physically well I think it's definitely it definitely helps but people do not like to hear that do you notice that yeah absolutely Dave you don't I don't even like you like you seem like a happy guy you don't you're on any medication but some people who are yeah want to think like no no I have a medical problem and I need this even if they don't exercise think oh no no you don't understand and then what if I say okay but do you ever exercise they get mad at you absolutely they get mad but absolutely here oh you're suggesting I'm lazy you're suggesting I brought this upon myself because of my behavior no I have a disease no way again I think that's a disclaimer that's a way out to not have to take be accountable be accountable like hey that if I was out doing moving and doing things that it would actually make this go away you know I mean I I think that you know I think a lot of a lot of depress is connected to the you know I believe ice-t Ising could cure a big portion of depression just because of the hormonal response to the system and that you know I mean normally when people are depressed is connected to some sort of hormone imbalance yes and to have a doctor try to figure out what that is it's pretty elaborate it's very tricky well they've shown in studies that regular exercise is as effective at the SSRIs more more exactly yeah exactly I think also diet because of inflammation like the inflammation for sure leads to all sorts of different ailments which could lead to a depressed feeling a feeling of unwellness well just eat a bunch of garbage for a week and see how you feel yeah I can I'd be depressed or just drink some so the sauna thing what is the benefit of getting it that hot honestly my problem is is that you know if if a lot is good then even more is better than you know that's a little bit no I'm just saying like you know if ten is good then 20 is got to be better even better but you know I think part of it is the natural evolution if you're sitting there doing time at you know 180 degrees and you and you can go in there and you're you know you're hanging out and then just 20 minutes it's 30 minutes so you might as well just try to turn it up and and and my understanding is that the Europeans I mean I'd you know you look at a sweat lodge and you I mean it ain't 180 you know if you go into any kind of sweat lodge if you go to Europe all the saunas are a much hotter like it's like you go into a rush and you know steam thing it's not like those things are you know III think that they're pretty conservative with it I think I think you just listen to your body if you go in there and you start hallucinating you might want to step out you know you might be like hey you know maybe I eat something wrong or maybe I need to just give my body a break but I think you just use your you know use your you're your own feeling as your guide and and you know I know that if I if I'm hide properly hydrated before I go my tolerance is substantially greater like I can really measure it I can be hydrated go in and be like oh yeah no problem and I can go and dehydrate it and feel wonky and be like yeah I'm not as good so it makes sense yeah I definitely have adapted I've definitely adapted at 200° because when I go to yoga now it does not seem nearly as hot 105 degrees even at the end of the class might this is interesting I was thinking to the last class was like this doesn't feel that bad exactly yeah well that shows you right there that you're abducting and then all of a sudden your tolerance you know the thing I really like about the sauna is I think it really plays into into overheating as an athlete mm-hmm it over you know you're over heat and that's usually when you have issues right now as you overheat menu and then you your performances is encumbered right you just it and so the more your tolerance is for the heat the less the more you can handle overheating pretty soon you don't overheat and then you just don't have that because that that's one of the factors it gets an athlete I think is in any performances you overheat if whether you're fighting or marathon running or basketball any any sport when you start to overheat your that's usually when you're you're toast you know you're done you start losing your motor skills and you're tall if you can build that tolerance up and I think like you said hey are you going 200 and 220 and then all of a sudden you're at Yoga you know you're at hot yoga and it's a hundred and five and you're just like you know Sam's a mouthing yeah it really does make a giant different has only been doing it at 200 for a couple months now yeah really in 210 like four I just said the last few days yeah but you have been doing it this hot for how long well I've been doing it for a while like I've been doing it's been out over the last couple years you know I did one I did a protocol that I heard on dr. Rhonda Patrick's show and she and it was holding a one hour a one hour straight at somewhere between 170 to 180 whoa so that's another and you if you do that ten days in a row I was doing it twice a day for ten days in a row and you're supposed to get like some six 900% hormonal boost like your whole body just goes into this radical hormones 170 to 180 someone that interesting 171 say one hour straight and I was doing that and I did it twice a day for ten days in a row and and and uh and and and at the end of that you got a different gear it's like all of a sudden you got OD and you're in your in your gearbox interesting well it definitely increases the red blood cell count correct absolutely yeah I mean I don't know all the science I just usually go off of you know I usually go off of instinct and then and then I and then sometimes it gets validated by by science and and so at the end you know you I mean I I I think and I and there really isn't any any Studies on it but I truly believe that that that he is better after performance for recovery than ice I mean I think ice is comfortable I had my uh I don't have the whole thing about paying a relationship with pain and and I was doing a thing with I had a hip hip replacement and I was set up to do all this icing before and and then I learned that icing suppress the the healing hormone igf-1 there's a healing hormone that helps your body heal and pain is kicks that hormone off that's how the body knows so when you suppress pain you stop that healing so you go a nice you suppress that hormonal release of igf-1 it's the healing hormone and all of a sudden it's gonna slow your healing down so if you do it because it makes you comfortable like hey if you've been you know running around and you're overheating and you go an ice tub because it feels good that's one thing but if you think that it's gonna benefit you I'm not sure I don't know yet I think he could be the better benefit because you've got heat shock proteins which deal with damage cells and for all that stuff and I'm not listen I this is just stuff that I hear that I'm feeling and then disclaimer we're both yeah yeah yeah oh yeah Dennis Miller this is my opinion I could be wrong of course so hey you know the but you know so that that that and and and then they talk about growth hormone that your body produces growth hormone in the heat right as another one of the side effects and so from again from my understanding and I'm not a doctor so I when I hear that I go well then heat should be the thing you do coz after every game every football every basketball player every athlete goes right to the ice town yeah I don't know if you're going there for comfort okay cool that's great but if you think that that's actually the thing that's really benefiting you know really gonna bring you the best recovery maybe it maybe heats gonna bring you the best recovery but it's gonna be miserable cuz last thing you want to do after you finish a workout is go sit in the hot box right just not ya gonna be happy but these but for injuries though for injuries they say you should reduce the inflammation but if what you're saying that that's interesting right well the more pain the more you know you know the old say no pain no gain mmm-hmm no further no pain no gain no pain no gain I mean everything's painful like if you go in the heat it's just comfortable you're gonna work out you get sore I mean no pain no gain so if we go with the old that old you know no pain no gain I believe that the pain is associated with the healing because of that hormonal response that pain brings into you so I would attribute like I had a fast recovery but I I attribute some of it is because that I I was not suppressing any of the pain so if I think if you take pain meds mmm-hmm that's suppressing healing so so if you say hey I'm so uncomfortable I got a pop pain pills to endure this because it's so hard well then just extend the healing that you're just gonna and and the more you suppress the pain no matter what's way you do it with it's ice pain pills whatever it is I believe the longer you extend the healing the more pain you can take I mean inflammation is the marker for that healing hormone so again reduce information I don't know if that's that's again I I would like to a doctor and somebody to tell me that really has a study that's that they know that they've really looked at to tell me that that's really working that that the icing I mean if you do it immediately right when you get you know you snap your ankle and you go right in an ice tub bucket and keep it from fully uh you know in flaming may be in in that instantaneous but doing it over days and I think that's just pain I think that's just comfortable make you more comfortable that's interesting because you always see basketball players with ice and their shoulders ice on their knees like right after games is they offer clay humph guru yeah I was just thinking they have to play so many games in a row though yeah but it's also comfort right comfort like I mean I think it's because it feels good if your shoulders all jacked up and you numb it you know just like a pain pill would do and this is just a topical numbing icing just creating a the you know the guy that that created rice which is like rest ice compression elevation he came out last year and said I was all wrong so no he did that guy came out in just here well then the last two couple years he should he feel really bad well so he came out and said you know that he he was you know that he he takes it all back so you know I don't know I mean I just think well I think there's no absolutes III don't I but I I'd be interested I've been trying to learn about it like hey can you really tell me what really is the best thing or maybe its heat nice combo you know that that heat nice combo because that does so much flushing to the system you know squeeze down the ice squeezes everything and then all of a sudden the heat expand so you're contraction expansion and that I know that that is a you know but that takes energy to that tires you down more then you know then then the heat but the you you do do ice bath heat ice baths Heath back to back yeah I'll do like sometimes I'll take I'll do it on a Sunday I'll do like seven rounds of that stuff you know no main rally just get you get you know your well that's why we want the intensity right so the colder it is the shorter you have to be there and the hotter it is the shorter you have to be there right so if you're hanging out so if you could get it down to 15 minutes and you know three to five minutes in let's say three minutes in the ice and 15 minutes in the in the sauna then all of a sudden you know let's say 20 minutes around then you're talking on then here you here you go you got you know two and a half three hours you know that's why one seven into 180 you do a whole hour yeah yeah that's a different protocol that was just a when I heard about and then I just try I tried it but part of it is cuz hard to stay in that thing for an hour straight at 170 I mean it's that's not an easy task are you listening to anything in there are you you just just the beat of my heart music yeah I'll listen to music or something like that or a podcast or get somebody else to suffer with me yeah just said get some try to try to suck hard try to get somebody else and maybe they come in for half and then they're back out and then they come in for the other part or something when I'm on the road I try to get comedians to come in the song with me at a hotel and it's only like 150 160 like I'm out like you're out 15 minutes see shit it's all but it's all what year it's it's in your brain it's in your mind it's it's we're so you know comforts masticated words oh it's hot it's cold it's this and you know we're just we're as this something that's you or is this the the whole surfing community are the end of this kind of stuff no I mean I I you know it's interesting is is that because I'm a surfer obviously everybody thinks oh you know all the surfers and you're friends with the surfers I'm really actually I'm not I really am kind of outside of the community itself I have sir friends at surf but I'm so not part of you know and in my career I haven't been part of the industry of surfing and yeah really so in a way I'm I mean I have friends that surf that come and do it and we've definitely there's been some influence in - I mean surfers in general at least the the good ones are you know training and and and using these ice heat protocols and so they're they're they're uh you know they're they're aware and and motivated but but surfing in general is you know I mean I don't even know what half those guys are doing well I would think they would be looking to you I mean if if I was a young surfer and I said man I fucking love surfing I'd like to be doing this when I'm 55 what's Laird Hamilton doing yeah but I don't know I think sometimes the you know I mean I think for a lot of obviously it's changed now but in the past I mean you know and it happens a lot with the younger people in general is this like don't tell me what to do I can eat whatever I want a new whenever you know I can go to Taco Bell and Burger King and and still and stay up all night and still you know rip you know or do or do my thing and and it's true probably in every sport and then and then you know I always say there's a thousand you know 20 year-olds and then there's five hundred thirty years olds and then there's two hundred fifty forty year olds and then there's like you know and then you just go as you go and there's less and less and you know I always love that the term the victory through attrition you know when using the last guy if you're this the last guy and you're standing you don't have to be any good you just win you're like the winner like you won you're the only guy left yeah just you you've been following this just to improve your physical performance just for life absolutely absolutely and and you know I think I really cherish feeling good I cherish feeling good like I really enjoy feeling good and so that drives me towards you know wanting and like I said either whether I had Paul checked years ago I went and did an assessment with him and you know interesting guy very yeah and it watching his stuff a lot online yeah and and uh him and I had an instant connection and and but you know I love the philosophical approach to certain things like he said and this had a huge impact on me you know 25 years ago or he was like you know the three white devils are white flour white sugar and white milk and I'm like hmm okay drink that yeah yeah yeah yeah just put cacao in it but if you put in raw cacao and raw milk together that's a powerful drink yeah that's for real but if you put dead milk homogenized pasteurized yeah just abused and then you and then you take some really bad cacao if there's any at all in it with a bunch of who knows you can't pronounce it you know he said if it wasn't here ten thousand years ago don't eat it if you can't pronounce it don't eat it you know and then the three white Devils I mean that's a philosophical hard time with turmeric though yeah why let's just say the word oh struggle pronounce yeah yeah yeah but it was your 10,000 years ago so you got some fine yeah that's a good piece of vice though yeah but just to look at food that way it's like people go what your diet I go plants and animals you know plants and animals like what you don't like don't make it difficult don't be like well I eat this and I think that the stress around that stuff is crazy but IIIi really believe that to truly be to have optimum performance and to be and to be optimum that you have to have the whole every spoke in the tire that you need every single spoke that you have to have a good relations with your family you got to have love and you got to have good things with the kids and you got to have friends and you got to have your health and you got to sleep well and you got to be hydrated and you got to work out and you got it and you got to have a you know your business thing and you got to have I think you just have to have all these things to really have balance and I think if you if one of the spokes isn't tight that there's a bump in the wheel and then you're just not gonna I don't truly believe that that you you're performing at your optimum because you need your head needs to be clear when you go into your performance whatever that looks like I think that's excellent advice I think that makes a lot of sense and it definitely keeps your mind clear you know you have your bases covered covered you're not just you're not here but there but somewhere else I mean and I know I've dealt with not being having all the spokes good and I know that the how that feels and I know when it's good you're clear you're good you're you're you're and it's how we're meant to be I mean we're meant to have that be real clean we're meant to have that there be some sense balance not to have it yeah that's why I mean even overworking me people think that you know they think that's a badge of honor yeah yeah like oh yeah I work my thing and I don't sleep and do them like yeah well then you're compromising yourself I told the Elan must that did you yeah I was I went to SpaceX one time and I pulled him aside he was standing on to go hey you know you got to take care of this I put my hand on his chest I just go you take care of this but you got to take care of you what do you say he just yeah I think I don't know if he understood he's about yeah I don't think you barely a person I'm just saying I don't think he was all due respect and yeah but I don't think he understood what I meant I didn't I felt like you know someone like that if they were really taking good care of themselves getting the right sleep getting in the right food getting a workout all those things imagine right imagine like if they can do what they're doing you know burning it on both ends imagine what they could do fully balanced well I don't think he wants to do any more than what he's doing I just think he's so obsessed with getting Tesla to run correctly when he was sleeping on the floor of the Tesla factory and working 17 hours a day I mean that's that is that's an insane person I mean he was just there all day long trying to make work and obviously it does work they're amazing cars yeah everything's yeah it's it's beneficial yeah that this drive that he has but I agree with you like for overall enjoyment of life that's not the way to go but I think you have a blockage there though - I think if you don't can't pull back and look at it from a distance you and you're in it I think you get too detailed and then you can't you know you you can't be I think you I think it could be better because of that I think maybe maybe I'd be profitable I mean you're you're competing against you know the big boys yeah but what's interesting is oil even though they are doing that they've managed to he's managed to make something that's so different than anything else yeah I have one that no I don't fuck man they're crazy yeah III was reluctant I told him I buy when he did the podcast yeah but I was like god damn and I like muscle cars all hearing engines but I drove that thing I was like oh other cars are stupid they're all stupid they are their archaic they are compared to that thing they are when you see all the companies going that way now you can see I mean we were because my buddy Waldman and I were into electric stuff and and we went and there was a guy that has an electric dragster and we went down and with this electric geyser and it just smoked any top fuel dragster like beyond and but it didn't make noise so no one wanted to watch it so I mean and you're like what happened no no no smell no noise no flames right no don't know it's no burning gasps no no no pollution yeah no pollution so people were like oh that's not fun so yeah but when you drive a Tesla like I have the Model S yeah P 100 D I think it's called when you drive it it's effortless like everything just you just go where you want to go I'd like to be over there it's like a video yeah like all sudden you're over there you have to get used to it cuz I've been in them and driven driven them and it's interesting how the body has to acclimate to the acceleration because you're used to that jerk oh that's shifting you know first gear second gear third gear all that delay like it's like AC versus DC where normal cars are like AC a little gap between the power and when you get that you know it's it's the body has to get used to the I'm still not totally okay with not looking where you're going and just flip it in on autopilot but yeah I guess that's yeah the next generation well that's fun on the highway but yeah you know I look where I'm going they keep my hand on the wheel but it is fun to like shut 10% of your brain off and just let the car kind of handle the speed one it does it well does it well does it well yeah why I'd like I said I think you need a person who's as obsessed as Elon Musk is to make something like that but I agree with you if if he wants to enjoy his life well just live longer yeah you have more ideas more influence like just beyond I am only speaking that way I just mean in the way of optimizing him right on demising him for because of his he's so amazing you know that okay let's optimize your amazingness by by making you like be healthier let me take care of yourself so you can be around longer and maybe do more great things right so it's again I you know I'm just speaking personally about when you try to look at optimization right like you're here you only get so long you know what are you doing and and are you really optimizing it by by you know burn it by by taxing the system and not not getting all of it out of it that you you know but I guess in a way it's kind of like unhappiness you know people use that as a workout so that's a load that makes you tired and your get hungry and you know well it's the choices you make right like sometimes you just get stuck in the momentum of the choice that you made and it's very difficult to like take that pause and go okay am i doing this the right way maybe I need a reset and we need to just take some time a really consider if this is making me happy and how many years I'm gonna be able to do this and sustain it yeah well that's a tricky thing you know that's a that's a that's a self self you know analyzing yourself and putting that up is I think it's easier just to keep going the directional or going just take some adderall and go full-speed how long have you been living in Hawaii uh well my mom took me from San Francisco and I was six months old whoa pretty much it was only a technicality what that I wasn't born there which actually worked against me it's cuz you know when you're not born then when you're not born there then you're not from there right there law you're not warning right and you're like oh yeah but I've been here since I was you know since I can remember so let's just put it that way right but I'm every actually worked they still hold it against you the six months that you were oh yeah oh yeah we missed you bro oh yes months where were ya I'm out of your mother here is in the state but now but yeah since I was a little kid I mean I my mom took me I was born in San Francisco and she took me when I was a few months old I have a theory about people from Hawaii there's a groundedness that they seem to exhibit that is universal it's almost you very rarely find completely frivolous dopey people that live in Hawaii they do not them yeah sure you find some people they're not that smart but yeah there's a groundedness there that's so many of them have because they're on a volcano yeah why an ocean and you know it's interesting that you talk about that because yesterday we were having a conversation about what is that right and we have a couple terms one of them is mana which is the power from the land another one is Aloha which is our kind of a spirit of how people act from Hawaii but I believe it has a lot to do with Islanders I think Islanders have that and I and it has a lot to do with it has a lot to do with the ocean being around the ocean that the oceans surrounding you and the ocean is the most conductive substance on earth so elec electrically and there's all this thing so you get influenced by this you know and I think energetically the nature is so powerful I think it puts us into there's a certain kind of humility that you have when you're in that you're next to a volcano that's 14,000 foot and you got a 2,000 foot waterfall and you got a giant wave I mean this is stuff that kind of goes oh yeah we're just little ants you're this little specks and we don't it's humbling but it's also inspiring and energizing yeah gives you power right the montemagno yeah I've always wondered what people that live in beach communities they're so chill like I've wondered is that because of just the humility that you get we just look in the ocean welcome to Marin have you ever seen that book no it's called the blue mind the guy's pretty interesting and he does a study of why we gravitate towards being on the beach why all the most expensive real estate is beachfront and that's something about when we stare at the ocean they did all these studies where them it just totally lights the brain up that our whole something about the horizon and about the ocean itself that that affects our whole well-being hmm and and part of it we don't even know why but we're just drawing like white you know why is why are we drawn there why do we you know and and it has it has a you know an effect on our system I wonder if that's because we evolved to be close to the water because that's where the bounty is we can get fish and while we evolved from the water that true - so here we follow that the the whole aquatic ape theory here yeah no I haven't really you know I haven't I haven't I haven't really studied that I I mean you know I know that I know that when you're around all fence and when you're around whales how and like you know it's interesting today I was in the ocean and I and I felt something was around and I could feel it I just knew something was around and then it just did five ten minutes later big sea lion kind of popped its head up and went but I could feel before but but you know when you're around those animals that are in the ocean you definitely feel like a kindred spirit with them unlike you do with land animals you know you don't really have that mean I mean okay maybe a wolf for dogs because we were connected with them for thirty thousand years we have that relationship you feel something with a dog but but with this sea animals like I say when the Dolphins come around and you're you just feel kind of there's just some there you know and they they've done some studies with you know dolphin how they affect kids that have you know different disabilities and stuff and how it totally helps them and and so there's some healing ability and actually dolphins are capable of having a collective consciousness that's why they when they get surrounded the big ones don't just jump out of the net they everybody stays together hmm so they but but again you know they aquatic ape but the that were from the ocean I mean listen that we call it the super life right the ocean is the is the reason why this why were we were here and why would they be here because if it wasn't for that we would it be Mars and it'd be hard to live there yeah this this something that attracts you to it it's very strange it's it's very true when you stand there just you could it's peaceful just to sit down at the beach and just stare out at the blue it is yeah well the blue mind is a great book mmm that's a beautiful book about talks about that and the science behind that and the effect it has on our system but you know it's in a way watching the ocean move is a little bit like watching a fire you know how fire is mesmerizing you have a fireplace and you just watch the flames move well the ocean has that movement and and and and all sometimes I'll go to the beach and I'll do a headstand and stand and look at the ocean upside down which is crazy because now it's the ocean is this is the sky and the waves are moving opposite to what your brains used to so it did it's you know it's something when I'm doing when I'm bored at the beach do you think you could ever live in a city I've stayed in a city for a little while before I mean I moved to Manhattan at one point didn't yeah I lived in Manhattan when I was about 17 or 18 I had some friends that used to come to Hawaii they lived in Manhattan and they invited me back for this summer and I lived there for a summer and uh you know it was dangerous for me to be there that was how's it dangerous cuz you're kind of more settled while you're a little more wild you know you're a little more like an animal and then you're like you're in confinement you know and there's just not enough nature like I go to Central Park and swing off trees and stuff but that you know that's the only that only did so much will be the time like 17 or something like you felt like a real urge to be around nature always yeah always pulled pulled too I mean I would just go to Central Park all the time yeah that's interesting yeah I was just me I needed that and you know people don't realize when they lived there but when you when you're in a place with giant cement buildings you know that they're tall you're in fight or flight the whole time because they're big yeah because you're you're threatened by these big masses that could fall over and yeah absolutely and you intuitively you're living in that and then the noise and all of the all the people cuz I you know I grew up sitting in the back of the class right I go to restaurant I find a chair against the wall like I go look for a chair and go where's you know I'll sit in the corner I want to see what's coming I like to see what's coming so and you go you know you go to New York and there's just you're bombarded from every single angle right and so you're in fight or flight you're just you're constantly on guard to you know you don't know what's gonna you know I'll take my chances in the ocean yeah I love visiting yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah as far as living there man I just don't and my friend Jeff lives there and he's like the energy of the city who talks about the energy it's amazing I'm like okay well it's retail therapy - yeah retail therapy some retail Mecca it's why every woman in the world moves there the auto shop shop and then your friend goes there's a lot of energy here is all the people people are yeah and they're doing things it makes me want to do things yeah yeah but I want to do things anyway I don't need that yeah yeah well we weren't meant to live stacked on top of each other that's not in our nature that's not in our biology now these are an abundance of everything yeah there's a lot of things that make it attractive right it's editors editor I mean there's beautiful women that make it attractive there's all the food you ever wanted to make that attractive you know there's all there's an abundance of stuff and there's always something you do you go to the theater you don't have to be self-motivated you don't be self driven breathing just there's always three you know ten parties and a bunch of things and speakers and Sian just anything you can think of there's every aspect of it right so I think that's has an attractiveness about it but Minh our essence do we belong in these these metropolis mmm they don't really have any in nature there were so we wouldn't actually that wouldn't be a place that you know and we can only handle so many people at once anyway like we can only have real intimate relationships with like a hundred and Gatineau and thirty people or something something crazy yeah that's like 150 yeah yeah yeah I'm but I'm fascinated by though is that these things exist everywhere and that cities exists in almost every single country there's a place like a Manhattan or like in LA where everybody's just jammed in together like what is it about people that makes us want to live like this that's an interesting thing that's an interesting question why are we attracted to that to that well the abundance you know that we're all and we're we're drawn to go where everybody wants to go a little bit like sheep you know we all go where everybody wants to go opportunity I mean there's all these things that you know why does every why why does every city draw every young person from the countryside right because of opportunity that I didn't possibility the possibilities my friend Michael Mouse was on the show yesterday and he was telling me that he was choking he swallowed a piece of food he got it stuck in his throat and he went to a table in Manhattan he was in Manhattan and he was like I'm choking and he said this to this table people and he said this woman just stared at him with no reaction like didn't smile anything and he coughed and the food came up he goes I was choking to death and she said well you should take smaller bites like just the harshness the harshness of New York Irishman the the value of a human being is so so much less because there's so many of them yeah that's a problem in the earth yeah right now our value for and we become such a voyeur mmm we become such voyeurs of like well I'll just watch you die yeah I'll just I'll get a video of it and put it you know post this shoot stuff my hands I mean instead of like wow that guy's needs help he's hurting let's let me help him right now it's like wow let's see you know you see it's just it's a strange phenomenon you'll get more help when there's less people around then you will when there's all the people around yeah thank you they'll divvy thousand people no I'll just sit there and stare at a guy that's bleeding to death you know where when there's two people there one of the people will tourniquet the guy's leg right right right like if you've met if you saw someone in the woods fall and break their leg and was just you two you'd feel totally connected to that person whereas if you saw someone as 100 people around the guy falls or gets hit by a car you like well I mean my problem that ain't my problem yeah and everybody goes that's not my problem just everything you had a diffusion of responsibility yeah it happens in large groups of people we feel like somebody's gonna handle this and Sue me and no one does yeah no one does they yeah there was a video that I watched recently of this guy there was I don't know what was happening but it was outside at night some sort of a nightclub sort of a situation this woman hit this guy and this guy knocked out this one woman that another girl came out I mean knocked her out too and the guys filming it someone's filming it they're not doing anything about it no one's no one's tackling this guy no one's grabbing the guy runs away successfully and then the LAPD put a thing out looking for this guy I'm like how the fuck does the guy with the camera live with himself how did you just he tell him exact type unch to women exactly yeah exactly unless you're a woman - and you're like I don't want this guy fucking me up - I don't know why you just hit him with a brick then if I mean you know whatever I'm just saying just you know are you drive your car on them yes I just would you know but it's it is strange how we lose our humanity and these job we're doing it more - now just with all of the there's a bunch of factors that are playing in into into that right into into us kind of separating ourselves from the person next door they're right there but we're we're over here you know we're on our right we're on our device looking down and they're right next to us and we're lie it's almost like we put we think that that's an invisible screen yeah there's also the thing about Hawaii that I've always found interesting see and kind of know everybody so you can't be an asshole that's a beautiful thing yeah you have to build accountability cuz you're gonna see him at that you're gonna see him at the store in five minutes so either you work it out and you agree that you don't like each other and it's just like an accepted thing and or you work it out and you get through yeah yeah I love that why I love that about small towns mm-hmm small towns have the same thing but the thing about an island it's a small town with an ocean around it so there's really nowhere to go you live on Kauai yeah I grew up on Kauai how many people live there about 60-something now 65,000 that's hilarious yeah that's less than the Big Island which yeah pretty yeah but it's big yeah giant and Giants like a hundred something right yeah yeah I mean I looked at Maui for a while as well but I grew up on kowai kowai zmei is my you know that's my that's got my heart right it only is my heart so gorgeous they're gorgeous and then you've got Honolulu which might as well be Chicago or something absolutely it's like city problem absolutely there are little city problems well and and and heavy military hmm so they have a huge military you know and the military influences a city like any city that has it another tear next to it there's an effect that the military has on the city and when Honolulu has that Honolulu is connected to the military it's got Pearl Harbor and all of that stuff so and then a million people which is insane that's a million people it's the gathering place Honolulu means The Gathering Place so it's like where everybody goes to you know that's where the state capitol is that's our whole that's our that's Waikiki that's ya know how does that one place become so populated it's I tend to I don't know why it's it's you know I think it has to do with if you look at most places that cities have been created it's usually some geographical design some shape like a harbor and obviously Honolulu is an incredible Harbor so great Harbor great protection so that probably has a lot to do with with the fact that it was developed like it was is because of the the nature of and it was you know I used to say it like if you went to Rio de Janeiro and no one was there and you showed up one day with a boat and there was no one had built anything it would be amazing if you showed up in Manhattan and you went up there you know Hudson and you pulled up onto that Island you'd be like wow this place is amazing so most of these places you know if you're in Paris and when the sin went around it you'd be like wow this so most most of the places where cities have been developed our amazing geographical locations and then they out of necessity they were easy to get to with boat you know that that has a big factor to it there's always some sort of you know strategic there's something to a stretch you know being a strategic part location as well but yeah I don't know why Honolulu other than great for mooring and harbors and it protected it real protected all that Pearl Harbor stuff is very protected and so that made it very easy to develop if you didn't live there what do you think you'd live get another planet I love Alaska you know I but I don't think I honestly you know both Gabby and I have been splitting the years for since we met and I realized that I'm I'm nomadic like I'm are I'm that I really like like the animals I like to move in Aziz and it feels more natural actually and I've we I kind of with my daughter's we kind of influence them that way but I don't want to be anywhere all the time that's what I really realized I realized that I'm not good then I just there's well you'll get caught up in a domestic with your neighbor and you're just they're just there's something about being in one location all year round and it feels more natural to move according to the seasons right like hey it's summertime energize you go to you know we come to California in the summer the surface down in Hawaii in the summertime that's when the waves are flat so there's they don't I don't have the sea which means I would shift into other land stuff it brings a whole set of opportunities it's like why would we go north I mean why would we go you know in North in the summer because it'd be a more abundant and I'm then but in the winter you wouldn't go because it'd be too harsh so it's a little bit like that mentality where you move more like if you're hunting and gathering you'd definitely be moving according to the seasons like you know where the fruit was when the fruit was you know good and you'd go where the hunting was great when the hunting was good and all of those things and that feels natural for me to just be you know to be back and forth but see like six months need to play yeah see you Malibu and Kauai yeah yeah that's nice well then you get to see both things to both things and open your mind it open your mind open your mind and and energetically Malibu is very powerful like where we are you know it's like Indian mountains and the mountains meet the sea and there's some you know people don't realize how abundant that sea life is to they always all Malibu they have like a preconceived idea about what Malibu is but Malibu's has a you know Malibu means gateway to the sea and Chu gosh that's a that's an Indian word Malibu is the gate which is a in a way as the valley that opened from the plains where the Buffalo were to the fishing and the and the and the ocean so there's there's some you know something to that place that that we feel comfortable and if you're gonna be here for us it's a I can still be in the ocean I can still have that nature part by that I can run into you know LA and try to expand my brain a little bit yeah it is really a weird spot right like Malibu has got a weird combination of really rich people that are completely detached and they're on pills and they're like that PCH is a terrifying place to drive one of the most dangerous so many fucking drunk drivers and it's windy yeah any of the ocean so good houses alright and cliff on the other side of narrow winding and bad drivers yeah just all our drivers in America well it's even there's something about that range - there's so many bars and there are people drink there is yeah there is I said that's a wickedly dangerous road but these this detached people and then all I've had friends that had their kids go to Malibu high and like Jesus Christ everyone's doing drugs it's all fucked up yeah and the children of these rich people are often neglected raised by their nannies oh yeah parents aren't home and yeah they're just so you have that contrasted by some of the coolest people ever and so you and you have some of the people that don't want to live in town that work in the industry highly successful that want this true they want nature and they want to be in there and they'll they're willing to drive that coast highway every day and go to work in town to have the balance of being in the sanctuary so you know it's it's it's what we always say bright light dark shadow I mean it's the nature it's it's what you get with it you know with the with the greatness you get is the you know the destruction that attracts weirdos yeah it does yeah there's so many strange it's eclectic people eclectic yeah which kind of makes it but it makes it great to like if you're for the good group you got guys you know you go to the store and you got guys that are that are you know that lived in Malibu for their whole life since they were kids they don't you know they live up up one of the canyons and they're totally grounded and and and you know and then you got right next to him some you know giant and mansion and with like you said you know kids that are neglected and yeah but there's some good ocean there and there's some good mountains so for like mountain bikes and and ocean activities it's pretty you know the land stuff's always gonna be tricky with the humans you know you get the humans there on land through the place on the water for like three months when we're getting our kitchen done and it was crazy like you just sit there wake up eat breakfast you're on the water yeah it's just what yeah and the place we were at yeah it was the water would literally come under the edge of the house so it looks like you're sitting on the water looks like being on a boat and you're watching do sea otters and yeah all this wildlife and birds yeah yeah yeah yeah you don't want to own one of those houses but they're nice to stay in well if you own it you really don't own it for long no not in this day and age now especially if we get it we never know we're gonna get a big wave I'm always gunshot but being on the water you know living on the water I think I when I was a kid we had to evacuate and so I for tsunami for giant surf huge huge surf so we had to leave our house in our house but your house got pushed across the road and one 1969 Jesus your eyes yeah so I've always been I think I've had a thing in the back of my head like and one besides highly expensive but just living on the beach it's like no I'll go to the beach I'll be at the beach all day but then I want to be away and like I want to go home and be away right and not have sand in my bed and not have on my TV and you know not have like everything gets corroded corroded well you have to build a boat yeah you should if you build a house there just pretend it's a boat and that you don't have to worried about sinking maybe it might some might sink slowly how far away do you live from the water I'm about a mile as a crow flies but I'm up a hill so I overlook I overlook the ocean and I can see and then I don't have any neighbors I have only one neighbor on the front and back and then both sides no neighbors so it's I've always liked being on hills and being back I just seems that's where I end up I just sort of use I think view you're really good for your brain good for your brain to be up mm-hmm and and let everything fall below good for the brain so soothing on the mind what is this this physical training company that you're doing you're doing something xpt yeah what is that xpt is I would describe it as a kind of a it's a lifestyle program that evolved out of what how I live like what we what we do and so we started an experiential thing where people can come for like two and a half days and go through this you know get exposed to speakers and they do heat nice and we do pool training and breath work and mobility conferences and stuff there I'm supposed to speakers like what do you mean well I all invite you know I would invite you to come and speak for an hour I'd invite Paul check or we'd have somebody speak on longevity or somebody's week on you know just have during that during the the experience we'll have a couple speakers talk on you know nutrition fitness wellness career whatever just as something as another piece of the of the element and then and then like I said we have pool training and then we true and we've been certifying trainers now to kind of help people go through the the process as well and so it's you know it's it's really about rest and recovery and breathing it's more based on on that part it's not just another training thing of like hey how we you know how we can hammer you I mean I think that's overplayed I think the ways we can train and and how we're training is really overplayed I think we're we're not creating enough things that nurture the system you know and really look at trying to support people in there in there in there already you know hammering life they're already just beating them down it's like let's get off the red-eye and then we'll go to the gym and we'll hammer ourselves there and then we'll stay up all day and you know and I think we they need some support so breath work is a big part of it knowing how to move correctly I think that's a big part of it cuz plenty of people hurt themselves especially in the gym meet without you know without some knowledge of movement in form mm-hmm and then I have a pool training system I developed which is the Gabi was telling them yeah that sounds a crazy yeah that's the most proprietary thing I think we have is it's a marriage between the gym and the in the pool because I despise swimming that's you yeah well I know I do I just watch if you said go do laps in the pool I'd be like Shamu and I get the floppy fin and really oh yeah I just said I I just that's crazy you're fucking surf no but I'm saying but but if you said hey we're gonna take these masks in this fins and we're gonna swim this coastline where the waves are breaking on the rocks and we're gonna go for five miles I'm in like I but if you said hey go down there and and and and wear some swim goggles where you can't even see and swim in some murky water where you don't know what's in it and we're gonna swim a mile down there and you're gonna do that every day that D I'd rather step on a you know rusty nail then do that I mean it's like that's so because of my my disdain for swimming that kind of swimming I mean if there's its if it's in the surf and the waves that's a different that's a different game that's a whole different we don't want to do laps in the pool you'd kill me yeah I'm gonna die I just I would rather yeah I just I'd rather get my hand with it it's so weird enjoy moving in the water but I do with some dumbbells okay so carrying a dumbbell and jumping within dumbbells well why did you start xpt like what was the motivation because you're obviously into doing these stuff yourself yeah why create a foundation or well the reason why we started it was because an opportunity to expose this stuff and share with more people we were doing in ourselves naturally and then we have friends come and they were like this stuff's awesome and then can I invite my friend and then we were we realized that that if we really wanted to expose it to more people and share it we were gonna it was gonna be a limitation if everybody had to come to my house to have like a website and every young yeah what is the XP t like XP t life comm and XP T stands for well my my concept is is it exploration and performance training ah there's a high performance fuels a limitless life dumbbells in the pool there oh yeah so this is all you are you you I need to yeah you should come well I'm just in it kyle Kingsbury yeah i love that guy yeah the we'll have some beautiful guys come like i'll give you a great thing that you'd appreciate is i have this hole well first of all there's a bunch of things that happen in the water right which one of the things that happens is when you're underwater the compression of the water allows the blood to flow through your lymphatic system which normally takes about a 24 hour period it happens in one hour so imagine compression tights like you know if you wear compression it really helps the blood flow right well this is the ultimate compression the water is right so then you deal with the psychology so it's good for fighters like III fighters because of the psychology of what we can do because you deal a lot with stress so we're able to implement stress in a very controlled environment and then and then and then like for example and grant hill at one point in his career but i have love friend Joakim Noah who's a basketball player and we were doing these we're doing these in the water we're doing these dunking drills last summer so he trained with him and get a bunch of stuff because you can do a lot of highly explosive heavy loaded movement with protection because now you don't have to worry about momentum which is what's gonna pull your shoulder out it's gonna be hip that's gonna hurt your knee where I can take a basketball player and I can run him through thousands of jumps thousands which at the end of if I did that on land he would be broken he's already jumping too much in his season he doesn't need to jump more right so I could load him up and make him do these dynamic movements but now he's protected because he's because we've taken gravity out so we're had so it's it's like it's like saying hey we get to go trade in outer space but it's in my backyard right now what what kind of results of these athletes well experience well Joakim in his career and I don't know how many years he's been in the NBA he came back after doing this dunking job just using this as an example and uh and had the most dunks per minute that he's had in his entire career whoa he was like Duncan on it was slamming on everybody I mean it helps that he's seven feet tall but the fact is is that he he he noticed now you know Grant Hill was talking about he gained three inches in the last year of his career after playing in the NBA for 20 years I've said he's jumping 3 inches higher look yeah yeah so I mean we're getting well I'm that's the kind of tangible stuff that I'm that I that I'm getting just that there's a lot more things a lot of it has to do with breath because in the water it's all controlled breathing patterns so everything is controlled because you can't breathe in till you get to the top so if you're doing a drill where you're jumping and most of the things we do are leg driven swimming is mostly arms part of the reason why people only use their arms is because you use five times the oxygen with your legs as you do with your arms so the legs are very inefficient for swimming but yet they create a lot of load on your heart which that can boost your breath holding and so there's a bunch of other other things that happen but a lot of it is just that environment is very protective so for recovery too for like what somebody's got a hurt knee hurt hip hurt ankle you can go in there and start moving dynamically early before you would ever do it on land and be protected so there's a bunch of you know and then we could just Ratchet it up I can make you know if I I truly believe if you gave if you said you know I'll get you Phelps is gonna come to your house and you're gonna have Phelps for three months I could make Phelps faster yeah this is this is this I'm so I'm he's doing a dunking drill and he's using a medicine ball but he's having to jump out of three feet of water right mm-hmm so when he gets on land when he gets on land it's like it's like a he it's like a whole other game yeah it imagine a whole nother game now did you invent this protocol this whole thing of jumping and doing in the water what what motivated you well I came the original concept came out of the drilled not a drill a thing we used to do in the summer when we were kids it's a Hawaiian kind of Waterman drill where you run on the bottom of stones docena BJ Penn does that so you get a stone you run along the bottom then you put it down then your friend swims along the surface and then when he when you go up he swims down and grabs it and then he goes along as far as he can and you swim and you just go back and forth until neither one of you can do it so his base kind of on that concept and then but I wanted to expand that because that's kind of limiting you just swim and you run and you can't isolate movements and you're not working it like you can with dumbbells so now I shift dumbbells into the water and and I have all different weights so depending on your skill level you know everything we do and that's one thing about everything that I'm involved in is is it usually has to have a spec to be able to be you know for everybody to do it it has to be old people and kids too in my mind that it's not viable unless it's it you can appeal to everybody that you need you need to a kids need to be able to do it an old person to be able to really be valid that really have legitimacy you know it's like okay the coffee it has to be there has to be things that the kids can can have that creamer the old people can have it it's gotta be can't just be specialized I think the specialization of some of this stuff is creates the lack of validity I don't think that it's valid if it's specialized and so I could take a little kid like my daughter does a bunch of the pool training stuff right I have an older older guys that come and do a bunch of the pool training stuff you know I got Pat Riley comes in there and he trains in the summer time with us and stuff yeah yeah so we get a really broad spectrum of people and that and that confirms to me that it's really legitimate right because then it's like now this is real like the kids can do it the whole people can do it the top guys can do it the bottom guys can do it everybody can do it that you know that that's something that's that's I just think that that's the you know what what what is real so how many years even doing this xpt well I mean the pull training I've been I developed over the last probably ten to twelve years about twelve years now in the pool with any you've evolved it so you talked off with a couple ideas why before I had like a Velcro weight jacket velcroed like uh yeah we yeah jump in the deep end it was a little scary I get the jacket off and how can you get up so that wasn't that was that wasn't viable that was so then we moved of dumbbells where you can drop them and but we you know there's probably 20 exercises that we asked way to use and it depends sometimes we're doing we have a move called the gorilla where we're using you know sixty to seventy seventy pound dumbbells where you're doing a curl press jump so ugiy and you're jumping on the slope so your curl pressing and jumping with with with you know sixty seventy pound dumbbells depending on your size we're swimming with 50 pounds sixty pound dumbbells we're jumping off the bottom with fifteen pound dumbbells it depends on the exercise so it's all depends on the person's skill what the drill is but we I have a whole I have all the weights next to the pool so we have everything from seventies to to five pound dumbbells I love that idea of the jump press like doing some sort of a oh yeah it's all you'd love it it's crazy I call it the gorilla curl so it's a squat curl press jump and then when you come out of the water you just let the weights drop and then the water catches it you could never do that and how do you rip your shoulder out right right how do you do this in the water well you vary on your height mm-hmm so I have I have a about a 11 foot deep end and then I have a slope so you can choose every depth all the way and then I have what you saw in that last video it's about a three and a half foot shallow end hmm so this is the first pool I'm trying to build a couple I'm trying to build one in Hawaii right now that's that's gonna evolve from what I learned from this pool so this pool I just kind of built it with you know with the hopes of designing a program and then out of it came all the all this stuff what are you gonna alter I'm gonna create multiple depths so I'm gonna do like an area that has 12 foot then we're gonna shift back 2 feet and have a 10 foot and then another flat area of 8 foot and then another flat area 6 foot mm-hmm and then I have the magic width is about somewhere between 35 to 40 feet wide and that's like if you're trying to swim a heavy dumbbell you know we do a lot of individual limbs stuff so that you isolate each limb so we'll do pistol squats at Russian lunge squats and a bunch of other you know and and movements that you can you'd be very vulnerable if you did that in the gym you can chance or you could hurt yourself but because you have that stability in that environment it totally supports you so you can you can be and go into ranges of motions that you don't have like you you know you might not be able to go sink all the way down into a deep lunge on one leg and press out with dumbbells in your hand on land but in the water you can and and the water actually makes it lighter so you have to boost the weight and stuff so there's a bunch of great stuff that comes out of it that sounds very attractive to people that have had injuries beautiful and what but the irony is is it kind of it's a little bit like what comes out of rehab where you actually get better performance - like you're like you know a lot of a lot of rehab exercises become performance driving exercises you know it's like you don't do that shit only when you get hurt start doing that and get strong that way so then you maybe you won't get hurt yes you know so it comes that way too it goes both directions hmm and do you have workouts that people can follow online if someone goes to the SBT life is xpt live yes vt life website yeah well actually the thing that we have the thing we have right now that's probably the most the most kind of prevalent one the thing that's happening the soonest is we have a breathing app coming out so we have a breathing app that has almost every different modality of breath work and so there's some pretty cool stuff in there where you can go choose hey before I go to sleep or before my workout after my workout you know during my thing so we have a bunch of we have a pretty cool breathing app that that we're working on as well so you ever talked to wim HOF I don't win do you know where yeah yeah I'm doesn't he doesn't give a fuck if you breathe out of your nose your mouth I know I know he's comedy no I have I've had a few I've had women I've had a few we've had a few experiences let's just put it that way but we've had him at it we've had him at a couple of experiences and I've done some stuff with wim I've done win for I don't know like four or five years now maybe maybe a little longer so he'll kick usually when he was in town I think the last time maybe when you when you saw him he came he comes to visit so I get him I if I usually when I go with women easily translate for him when he goes to one of his classes I'm usually like trying to people don't understand so I have to say sometimes I'll be with somebody they'll be like what do you say I'll be like what he means is take a deep breath yeah he's such a character guy went to fucking the top of Everest barefoot oh yeah like well yeah I almost lost his toes - yeah yeah yeah no he goes yeah well he's he is his art actually is - mo is is AB is a derivative of - mo and I'm not sure if you know what Nomo is but - mo is a Himalayan breathing technique that the that the the monks have that they were they they have this one thing where they dry sheets so they have this thing the ceremony where they go at night in the Himalayas when it's frozen and snow and the guy sits there and they put wet sheets wet blankets on them and they breathe and get their bodies so hot that they dry the blankets and then the guy that can dry the most blankets at the end of the night is the is like the guy you know but it's a yeah yeah and it's called - mo and it's a you can go online and look it up but - mo is a is a Himalayan breathing technique that that that was never exposed to Westerners big until just as of recently but the whims whims work is a derivative of of - mo but knows breathe it's all about nose breathing it's all about nose breathing and when you understand the science of it but he's right about getting people to just breathe because people are not breathing then we just had in fact we had another belissa what's her I want to say it's a Russian name but but she has a great book she trains fire fire and police and military breathing we just had her we did an ex PT in Miami about a week two weeks ago and and she came as a guest speaker and we and was working on really trying to create more volume and then a lot of people's rib cages aren't moving and so they have a whole you know there's ways to try to increase your movement of your rib cage your rib cage you'd actually open like you you can take a tape and measure your rib cage when you're fully exhaled and then when you inhale it should expand like you know three inches or more for you to be really optimum ly breathing and a lot of people I mean part of it has to do with the whole six-pack abs and what's aesthetically pleasing but meanwhile when you have a real nice set of six-pack abs your you don't you're not able to diaphragmatic ly breathe you're not able to use your diaphragm you're not using your diaphragm without that yeah because you're you hear the tightness isn't allowing the diaphragm to push down the diaphragm and the pel and the pelvic floor actually squeeze your organs together and and that is actually massaging the organs which influences your digestion and everything and it deals with a bunch of acid reflux and a bunch of other things but when the when the when that's the ABS are so tight that that the that the stomach can expand the organs can't push this belly out then you then then you have a limitation in your in your brand then the ribs aren't moving I mean it's just the guys are gonna hear this and go good I'm gonna stay fat I don't need a six-pack well but but no but but I actually if you're really using your lungs you you can you know strengthen your core in a way that you'll get core you could have six-pack abs and not have core stability like so you know I mean and you know this I mean when you look at a lot of not every single great fighter is just ripped know some of the best ones ever not ripped at all or Fedor exactly so let's talk about that for a you know that aesthetic isn't always function right right and oh and of course we you know the mind is always ahead of everything I don't care what the car looks like if the got no motor doesn't do anything so it's the body only goes where the brain tells it but the fact is is that that you see some of the best athletes when you look at certain athletes you're not like they're not the physical specimens that you've ever seen you're like that that guy is the most ripped and shredded a lot of times those guys get knocked out you know you see you just call this guy's gonna kill this guy and then he just gets you know annihilated by the guy that looks maybe not quite sure that's hard right right part of his genetics max Holloway is perfect sample Hawaiian guy yeah he's not like shredded I mean he's strong yeah obviously but he looks more like a swimmer yeah yeah WA and you you might find that his breathing he might he might have better air volume because at the end of the day a lot of its about oxygen cardio yeah and Max's cardio is off the charts exactly so he's getting more movement out of there I mean you know again we've created these you know aesthetic things in our culture like Oh six-pack abs a sign of this and done it up but when you look at real breath work and how the diaphragm works and how the ribs expand you realize is like we're none of us are really doing it right you know and you can actually create more volume you know you said you like cordyceps mushrooms yes well those are actually a vasodilator those helps help you absorb oxygen you those can up your vo2 max right there's only a couple things that you can how to increase your vo2 max but cordyceps is one of them pieces beats is another one you can create more volume by expanding your lungs so by opening the ribcage in creating more room that can create um promote your vo2 max now when people are hearing this and they're hearing breath work folks who have never done anything like that they don't they really don't understand what you're saying like what do you mean by breath work like give us an example of like a protocol well I mean a real simple I mean they do it in pranayama they have it in apnea there's a thing called holotropic breathwork really is is when you isolate the breathing system and you know the simplest way and that's why wim says hey I don't give a shit how you breathe just breathe that's right yeah yeah so you know like will do a breath routine and we'll sit somebody down and we'll say okay breathe like you're running breathe like you're running and we'll tell the guy breathe like he's running another i go thats a slowrun buddy like breathe like you're running like you know like like anytime you need any movement in any air in and out is gonna is a form of breath work right and especially when you isolate the system and you're not doing it because of an activity the the fact is that when you use that system and you work it and you're not detracting from it by doing an exercise if you're doing the assault bike where your arms are working and your legs are working so all the oxygen that you're absorbing is going into your arms and legs when you're isolating you just do the breathing alone now the oxygens going into that system and that system is gonna develop and get better then when you do your assault bike after you develop that system so will isolate breath work and we'll just do it alone well whether we're doing you know whether we're doing breath holes we're doing some kind of apnea breath work which is you know we can do a pattern where you're doing like you you hold for 30 seconds and then you breathe in for 15 and then you breathe out for 15 then you hold again then you go in and out and hold in and out and hold that's one pattern another pattern is in hold out hold in hold out hold in hold out like you know again those are theirs you know and then there's pranayama apnea holotropic there's just some where you're oxygenating the system where you know like Wims would be where you just get that rhythm going and do that for five minutes and people know about I feel lighted and I go yeah because you haven't had oxygen like on your head do you haven't had oxygen in your system like that right so again a conscious bringing consciousness to your breath we're not just walking along in life like not thinking about breathing mm-hmm that's the beginning of breath work just awareness of hey I need [Music] you know I need to need to breathe in and out I stay conscious yeah and that's a big one with martial arts you see in jiu-jitsu with beginners when they first start sparring for the first time they panic and they have shallow breath and you got to tell us okay stop right now just breathe oh yes Bri oh yeah well my to fight yeah fighter flight but it's interesting how they can't get a deep breath yeah they hyperventilate yeah well you put somebody in the ice for the first time that has oh yeah that's the craziest want to see it that's an instantaneous I can't breathe oh yeah but you eventually learn well the system the system turned that's actually an involuntary response to get out mm-hmm right strike you you have the option so you should exercise that option that's a response that's your that's your subconscious mind protecting the organ organism like yeah this in your body intuitively knows this is dangerous right environment get out and so that reaction is to get you to get out when you when you make a conscious effort to not leave that environment then the body goes okay you're not gonna get out okay well now organize I'll bring the blood to the organs I'll adjust everything I'll boost your hormones and so and then pretty soon you don't get that response anymore once you do it on regular basis the body just goes oh we're here we are again back to that ice thing bring the buddy you know boost the hormones bring all the blood in the organs you know that so but that cut that's that's a similar thing to the way you're talking about in jujitsu where people are the stress on the system they're stressed and so they're involuntarily you know and that's fight-or-flight one thing you can really do to calm like comic kids down this is the way you get yourself into parasympathetic where you bring your thing down is when you extend your breath for seven seconds on the inhale and the exhale that reduced that'll bring everything down like if you want to calm down and your or your kids stret your little kids just all and you get them to just breathe in for seven seconds yeah and I tell people think about a sigh my youngest daughter when she would get upset she would do that should I try you gotta breathe you gotta breathe mom dad seven seconds is a magic number if they if you can extend the breath for seven seconds and the body goes into paracin that again and totally let's that's what you do to like go to sleep at night like if you're having a hard time so there's a bunch of stuff to learn about the breath which is amazing I think the reason why the the breath has always been so important to me is this because of the ocean because you know growing up when you almost drown you know a thousand times you you you what air is important you you get to know if you just get to appreciate like there's none down there and it's all up there and so be cool down there and so when you say you can get back well I learned breath work because of Hicks and Gracie I'm watching Hicks and Gracie practice yoga is your friend you know yeah you know it does that well that's that's the pranayama yes yeah there's a name for yeah this way you twist it yeah yeah he really sucks his organs Yap in his son can do it amazingly Kron can do it amazing yeah yeah it's super good for you well that for the organs yeah and that the ability to control your breath like that is so critical when you're sparring so critical to get oxygen these long training sessions well for your life yeah for your life anytime you're in the stress if you can control your breath that controls your heartrate yeah do you ever do 30 seconds in 30 seconds out you ever do that yeah just slow deep breaths in just low depress oh that's an amazing exercise yes well that's the extension of that that's parasympathetic that's bringing it seven just the minimum amount but whenever you go into any of those long extended stuff and then and then those breath holds anytime you hold the breath then you get that co2 level and that's what gives you the angst you know what's interesting because you know Wims done like some record breaking stuff and you have that free diving stuff where where they scrub oxygen you know where they hyperventilate and scrub the co2 and get that real low but you have to be careful about shallow water blackout so we don't really practice any of that stuff we do more like a salt bike jump in the pool and see how long you can hold your breath and then it's and then and then you know five 10 10 seconds is like that's big-time 15 seconds you're like wow that was amazing I'm maximum heart rate how long can you hold your heart I mean how long can you hold your breath that's some that's a challenge so you keeping us all but right next to the pool yeah yeah roll you roll it into the oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah wow yeah wow there's always another you know twist to the pretzel now what other I mean because of your hip do you have any limitations on other kind of stuff that you can do umm not imagine running would be a real key yeah no I I like deep deep texture running so soft sand because of the foot and the articulation of the feet and not shoot and none not wearing shoes so I'll do beach I'll do sand running and like if I'm in the snow like Alaska or something like that but I love barefoot and deep stuff I don't like running out on hard ground I just first of all as soon as you're you know if you're 215 or two you know whatever anything over 200 pounds I mean you shouldn't be running more than a couple miles a week if you're over a buck 20 I mean it's just it oh yeah it's so hard on your sis on the hard ground absolutely that stuff is just pounding you yeah I mean it's one thing to go in a soft something that has absorption you know like if you're running in the sand or you're running or you're running in the snow or you're running in some deep thick grass or something that's got absorption but yeah you go run your you know your 180 200 pounds and you run and you just pound everything's just you know seven times your body weight on the download and then you're wearing a shoe that's you know that's kind of deceiving you it's a little bit like a sunglass you know it's you think you're blocking the light but it's letting the bad light in you know you think it's a block and the absorption but you just get pounded I mean your and your feet or you know I mean barefoot is so important grounding so important I mean these are these are things but I have a new but I have a cool bike that I just somebody just gave me recently called a stand up bike which the company called elliptical but it's a standing bike it's position so for standing alone and so the posture is unbelievable and you want to grind on a hill I mean you don't need running and then you have zero impact it's like you know and so I think running is hard I mean I understand the high of running and but you know if you want to you want a real for me real running is barefoot and some soft sand I had this one beach in Hawaii that I run on that that that's a little bit like quicksand probably you'll sink in like mid you know lower lower lower calf like yeah you know you'll sink in a foot into it oh you don't need to go far like you you don't need to go and you know a taro patches no so I grew up we got grew up farming like around on a pig farm and then with taro patches and fishing and so I kind of grew up in uh but there's a taro taro patches a as a rice paddy pretty much mud right and so you we grew up working in that stuff and walking and carrying buckets and being in that mud which is washing the mud like a foot deep mud but what I'm saying an environment like that where you have to pull your foot out and then sink in where it's absorbing the impact I mean that's where work you know I always question the damage versus the work right like the pounding that you and most I mean you know once you're a certain size the war the pounding that you get I think you can get all the cardio you want do jump rope jump ropes great you landed on your toe you're doing the thing about when you're running every neva bleep people go to heel striking they're landing on their heels because they have a shoe that they so they think they're getting you know they think they're getting protected because they're landing on something kind of soft but it's still sending the you know that impact up your spine and inevitably anything you do and you and you come back and your back hurts I have to question like is that optimum right you know and that wasn't deadlift either it was you know right right yeah but your what about your friend the Muay Thai fighter well he's but he runs he runs like on the very super short short step mmm balls of his feet like you like and I would I wouldn't even call it more like I don't even know how to describe the pace but it's a soilless slow a slow pace that you're landing on the toes the whole time so it's not like a run you know a hard run where you're pounding so so he's probably doing like 10-minute miles or something I don't know I don't even know what is his ranges you don't that that's mr. Tom Jones well I think I think running off your toe is great yeah I mean there's some as the who chose the running who does who does it I do I run with minimal issues yeah for standing bike that is ridiculous I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing well that for me that that there that's the elliptical they have the new a new one that's just a pedal I'm just kidding it looks awesome knows like you know I think I made that silly because the guy was a runner and couldn't run anymore got injured and then he said he started the bike and he said biking's not running and so then he developed that thing because it's simulates running without the impact that's unlike I said that's why I like the pool that's why and and I think too it's like if you think about doing things forever mmm we're talking about doing things forever yeah right yes so we're talking about doing things forever so how are we gonna do them so we can do them forever no impact well so reducing impact and if you actually started doing that initially then you might not have to worry about trying to recover from all that stuff that you so it's like we don't want to Train in a way that we're gonna have to change our training to try to make up because all the damage we've done let's try to avoid the damage from the beginning and I'm it's already too late for me I got seven you know I got six broken ankles I got broken what the hell did you just do your ankle isn't what's been programming six or seven times broke the arch broke all the Medicus from surfing all different motorbike surfing snowboarding how did you mess up your hip probably cuz my broke walking on a broken ankle for all those years because each time I broke it I had five or six different breaks and then I would keep going so I would keep walking on it and but I'd means I had to carry the load on my right hip so I think I just wore the cartilage out from offsetting and carrying the load of the broken Lake Jesus so that was but so I mean it's so wasn't like one injury where you hurt your hip it was just slowing I just wore it out I just I I said I lived a couple lives with that one now is that that was only a one life hip and I had three lives in a what does it like having a fake hip insane incredible bionic the things not even in my in my in my brain not even how so it doesn't I doesn't I I don't ever even bring it into consciousness it's an its slicker it's like a mercedes-benz ball joint I mean it's absolutely perfect Wow it's a and and you know I mean I had a CL I had some nice stuff before that was harder to recover from than the hip the hip was I just felt like I got kicked by a horse for a couple months and then after that it was like no brainer jump off a cliff go stand up paddle run I mean I'd tell you to not do certain things no really no you could like you could just start don't do anything you should do with your real one oh really that's don't do anything you shouldn't do with your real one yeah absolutely that was the only thing I mean the guide the doctor Penenberg who did mine he did it to a contortionist I guess some contortionist had some blown hips and he did it to the girls still performing and stuff so I don't I think it's I mean this stuff is the technology is amazing and the thing that I the thing that I would consider if I ever had to do it again is that the atrophy from the the the the initial problem is harder to recover from then you just go in and get in the new one and I think when people push it you know they used to try to push that stuff because they want to wait for the technology got better and they only last 15 years and all that stuff but the atrophy that you try to recover from is harder to recover from than if you would have gone in and gotten it done when you need when as soon as you needed to have it so the one you have now you have to get it swapped out every 15 years no no no but but in the back in the early well they do they they don't know how long this new stuff lasts they had some they had some material that that wore out after like that because there's a like a some kind of polyurethane some kind of psychic outer layers well like a cart lit like like a man-made cartilage between the ball joint in the socket and so that stuff wore out in the past but they out and they have this new stuff that that has been in for ten years and a lot of people are already and they've seen zero wear on it so you know you don't know it could be 30 could be you know could be 10 I mean I I was actually uh I stayed conscious in in I was able to stay awake for my hip surgery that because I didn't want to have to recover from the from the yeah really yeah it takes people a month to get the anesthesia out of their system really oh yeah to try to get the anesthesia I mean anesthesia controlled death there just put you right to the edge of dying and keep you alive I mean anesthesia some hard stuff on your system to get that stuff out of your organs you got to do like a full detox cleanse it's not just like oh yeah anesthesia I've never heard that before I didn't I didn't know that oh yeah I thought you'd feel like shit for a day or two but I didn't know it that shit's in your organs and stuff there's no way that stuff's Tascosa they can't they can't doshi out and knock you out like that without that stuff lingering I mean you know how long does it take to when you got a hangover I mean he so did they do like an epidural block on your epidural block yeah and they had it so good that they could just isolate the left the left hip they did that to me when I had my first ACL surgery yeah I wanted to see it yeah cuz I was like oh yeah I want to watch I felt like I'm only gonna do this once in my life I want to see this turns out add three of them yeah surgeries but yeah but I wanted to see it I wanted I wanted to be there Sheriff it was pretty freaky yeah I was ACL yeah I had ACL - yeah all the right leg yeah yeah gabber I had a cadaver my right leg and left leg out of patellar tendon oh yeah yeah so now your hip doesn't even you don't feel it you don't feel anything not even in the wheel not even a thought Wow not even like like amazing and it was I was it was debilitating I could barely walk I mean I could still surf but I get to land I was hobbling around like you know my friend Maynard from tool you know the band tool yeah Maynard is a he's a jujitsu enthusiast and he had to get his hip done and he fucked his hip up from stompin on stage you know because he's always stompin with young leg yeah he blew his hip out yeah well I think mines attributed a lot to my back leg and surfing so I'm on that back leg and that Mac leg is loaded so I think that but but I know the brakes the brakes and the other in the left ankle and left foot and how many I had and that I was always on it I know that attributed to lot cuz this this this right leg carried the load for that thing for to get your left leg fixed my ankle ankle yeah I just let it so every time I listen I went I went to my knee to get my knee worked on in the he goes he saw my ink on he goes and then he saw about how much mobility I had and he called in some foot specialist and they had to take x-ray they just wanted to see cuz I have no metal in there there's no screws there's no nothing I just let it you know it just so every time do you just let it sort of heal itself up yeah so it snapped you just walk around on it yeah pretty much cut the cast off the first time was I was sixteen cut the cast off and you know and I went a tree broke it the first time and then and then I had broken other ways it got a little smarter a fairy broke him but yeah that's and then orange dark I broke the arch because the ankle was so calloused so bonded that when I broke it I actually broke my arch that was the probably the most painful that was the most painful breakdown in that area when I talked to Kelly Slater he broke his foot yeah that too yes his was just recently yeah yeah and his was fucked up for a long time he said that's a painful thing to snap your toes like you're the molded metatarsal crazy well yeah you have 75% of the bones in your body or below your ankles what really 75 percent like lines of numbers yeah numbers above but your feet your feet have like half the bones of your entire body god I never thought of that that's crazy but it make there's a lot of shit down there a lot going on a lot little little ones in there little nubs and weird little ankle see that's why kickboxing so stupid you throwing those things that people and slamming them in the elbows knees and stuff fuck the quads big guaranteed yeah nothing like kicking something and breaking your feet yeah you know it's a little embarrassing if it's a wall though would you kicked no I'm just saying I know mine was I like I said I broke mine broke mostly sports related motorbike windsurfing you know towing yeah yeah well I guess with as many injuries as you had though you do understand like what's good and what's bad for you for sure yeah you hope but you know it's interesting it's a little bit like in karate where you know you you know how to heal you know how to wound mmm interesting you know that the more the more you understand it's like I think them I think my injuries first of all it's a form of failure I think that is taught I've learned a few things from and and and you learn how also how to recover and how to heal and so I think that feeds into how to train and perform I can think that's all interrelated see because you start to have a more intimate relationship with your body and know how it responds so I think there's something I mean you don't learn a lot from winning you know and succeeding that doesn't teach you anything compared to losing you know losing teaches you and in any way injuries are forms of loss you know unsuccess yeah yeah yeah yeah when you lose your and then you lose your ability to do stuff and then you wonder why you're doing it and if you're gonna be able to do it again yeah oh that's tough do you float at all no but I saw your float tank you've never done it I haven't oh man I'll be right up you're out I know I just haven't I just I've been invited my friend has one in Malibu I just haven't ever use it every time you want yeah I should try to get it to float that I'm on down and anytime you want it's like I can tell there's salt in there by the way the everything's crusting up and over guaranteed yeah a thousand pounds of epson salts oh yeah tank yeah yeah if you're anytime I have an ocean so I float there and a lot of noise and you don't know it's true it's just fur but that's what you love about the pool because you're floating already as soon as you go under actually have speakers underwater so it'd be like oh really oh you play music wow so you can get you can get lost over there it's pretty cool so what other things do you do besides the curl press jump thing like what other other types of exercise are you doing in the pool we're doing we're doing yeah you know like single dumbbell so single easy clean single arm dumbbell and then stroke get a breath freefall so you're doing single arm jumping okay and then we're doing swap single arm swimming single arm swimming carrying dumbbell I called an animal box how much weight he doing that was we knew like 50 60 pounds Wow doing ham it's called an ammo box he'd be like if he had an ammo box yeah just over cross the river like that's the concept we have cellphone we have the Yuki we have a phone do you keep one end out of the water yeah yeah hoping to swim with your hand out oh wow and then and then a but just like I said single leg stuff so a lot a lot of like Russians pistol squat jump lunges what else a bunch of a bunch of old fast breaks where we're doing this one where we drop down you run along the bottom of two dumbbells to the other side you set one dumbbell up you jump up you bring one dumbbell out you go back down grab the other one bring that one out and then pull both of them out then run back down and run back out we go that one fast break kind of mimicking like it was a basketball court you'd run down you jump up twice run back jump up twice yeah and then we have spire man so we have I mean we they just spider-man's one where you swim you carry a dumbbell and you descend into one end you jump up you grab you get a breath you descend into the other end and then and then all these exercises we're able to we to make them harder we'll do them on an exhale so you can do so we've ramped up you know we can either increase weight we can create increased distance or we can do a neck do it on an exhale so when you developed all the stuff did you run all this down from your own practice from all trial and error like how did you develop this well some of them came from failure so you know you try to do one move and then you'd fail some of them came from friends that I was working out what they would hold well it's tried this and then we'd modify it some some of them came from my daughter I watched my daughter my one daughter swim down one day and grab a weight and then try to swim up with it I'm like oh that's a great move and well you know so we we we some of it came out of necessity for movement like certain dynamic movements that the basketball guy you know one of my friends needed or and then so it naturally all the movements kind of naturally evolved I think that's why they're all so great and there's an isolation to each limb so we have an isolation so you can really see if the dexterity of your right arm versus your left arm and how strong it is versus the other one mmm how strong one leg is to next to the other one hub the muck the ranges of motion and the mobile we're doing we can do front back flips and front flips multiple so you jump up and get a breath and then do multiple flips and and and extend work time so that you extend breath work where you'll do you know like three or four moves in one on one breath so we have a bunch of ways to to ramp it up as we evolve because you know how it is it's like in any exercise you get proficient and then you're like well how did I make it harder well you make it longer you make it faster you make it heavier I mean these but because you're in the water we always have the breath-holding element and then we have the distance element and then we have the weight because we have weights so we have the weight element so those are different ways that we can ramp it you know ramp it up so when you're developing this program are you writing all this stuff down are you doing these workouts yourself and saying okay I really started to fatigue after thirty of these so we'll try to well I have a group of four I have a group of guys at Train that come to my house to Train in six days a week so there's like days a week yeah in Malibu and yeah oh so because this is show Bob loses summertime right and summertime is when is really like the season for training because there's no surf in the wintertime you're not going to Train and then have a giant swell and be tired that would be just stupid so you never want to let the problem with it is is that you get you know I I tell people I go listening probably in any sport you're get the most out of shape during the season you're in a certain kind of shape game shape but you're really not in shape because you can't you can't have a regimented workout routine if you're competing no right and so and so and in my case the oceans dictating the performance right so you can be all there's going to be twenty feet next you know in three days and then all of a sudden you show that it's not there's no surf it's only half the size or the wind screws it up or something so you get all that build-up so we have to do things to kind of exhaust the energy but you can't be in a nice Monday Wednesday Friday pool training with Tuesday Thursday Saturday you know lifting mobility and yoga and whatever you know it's like you can't get into that kind of a rhythm and and Hawaii's not conducive for that anyway it's part of the beauty of it is like I always so beautiful let's go to the thing we're gonna go down the coast because it's a nice it's a good day for fishing go to the mountain there's just so much more other activities to be done we're in this environment you're in the desert and it's kind of like okay it's a June gloom no problem that bang iron or you know ride the mountain or do whatever you're going to do so that's then but in that summer time routine I have a group of guys and that we bounce everything off of each other so I'll do we'll do 10 and he'll do 10 and he'll do 10 I'll be like yeah that was good okay up the way okay all 20s too many are that weights too much or that way it's enough and so we just kind of it's evolved naturally that way and then and then I got some other friends that are a little bit more professional we have a my friend of mine PJ who's been involved with all of the stuff around xbt to write programming and do that kind of stuff that chain he trains a lot of fighters and straight and mobility and and and uh and some other training stuff so he he'll come in and they start to really break it down and make it you know into a real program but we have routines that we do we have circuits that we do that we know you know how you know when we're taxed and you know it's an interesting thing about what the pool really teaches you is it you know you have a volume of energy available we go okay well you know you got a 50 gallon tank and I can do three or four drills in ten or fifteen minutes that you just there's none left you didn't blew all 50 gallons right you do extended breath holds with super hard work where I can you know make the give you some things that are a little lighter and now we can take that 50 gallon tank we can drag it out and make it make it last two hours right because we do these we're doing higher volume less weight and so we're you know breathing more often we can expand that thing so everything in between just blow on that whole tank up at once right through real intense breath hole with maximum weight is you know max breath hold max wait max wrap okay we're good we're I mean it's and I think lifting is the same way you know it's like how many max lifts do you have in a certain day and how many per week do you have it's real tangible in the pool the pools real you know the thing about the pose it doesn't get you don't get muscle soreness because of that compression so you don't get that like wow I'm sorry you getting you go almost every single person that comes and it's one of the well I always say you know you got to call me and tell me if you fell asleep at lunch and every guy every every guy every person you know I was in the thing I'm just in their desk at the work or whatever just fall asleep like guaranteed and some guys you know all I fell asleep for an hour I said 20 minutes 10 min you know but everybody why is 99 you know I don't know I think it has a lot to do with the oxygen and that and and and and the taxation of that environment but it exhausts you in in a in and like a terminal way like it's it's it's a complete exhaustion and I and I don't know why part of it is the threat of being underwater part of it is though that the water is sucking the the calories out of you you know because it's like when they we're talking to Phelps about burning all those calories well you know three-quarters of the calories he was burning is because he was in a 70 degree pool and people go let's our 75 degree pool and I go yeah but the body is 98.6 so for the body to keep itself warm over in three hours it's it's at 75 that's 20 degree differentiation you got to keep the body's just working to keep itself warm in that and that and because the water affects you more than the air it's and you know it's it's more intense on your system they just you just get tapped so the the water temperature the the the oxygen load the the psychology of being underwater with weights you know the workload that it's taking all those things play into just full thorough exhaustion and nothing nothing I do exhaust me more thoroughly and yet more kind of comfortably than that because I'm not you know how explain well you're not whoo get you don't come if I train that hard in the gym I'll feel hurt I'll be I'll be wounded I'll be a little like and if I move wrong or something of you at all you know you feel like something you tweak something so this allows you to do this six days a week that's one of the reasons why well it actually helps flush the other when you're doing other land training so he actually helps support your but no I mean we're not doing we're doing pool training probably every other day it's just I end up turning the kind of I love being in the pool so much that we have we do a thing called surf and turf so so we have surf and turf where you're doing like some sort of some sort of Burpee press it's some kind of lifting on the deck into the water and then a routine in the water and then back on the deck and back in the water you might be doing we have one a move called a seahorse where you hold a dumbbell between your legs and then you hold your feet up in front of you and you swim like this with a dumbbell in your lap oh wow and then when you get to the other side then you do push-ups so you do push-ups on that side you you seahorse over you do push up that side seahorse back you do that I mean you just blow up right so we well I I think I enjoy that that part of it just just being creative making it fun making it interesting that's the part that really is enticing just the dredger II and the monotony like when you said oh yeah swimming laps I go that's just like drudgery just like which there's a mentality for that I'm good I can be good at that like I can get on a I can get on my board and you know I've done some endurance stuff I paddled 22 hours one time I've done some uh new hours yeah oh yeah so I've done I did I actually did a thing on Hawaii called the Hawaii five we call it the y500 we started in the South Point of Big Island and we biked across the Big Island so 125 miles then we paddled to Maui 38 miles and then we biked across Maui and then we paddled to Molokai then we biked across Molokai then we paddled to Oahu then we biked across Oahu then we paddled to Kauai then we biked across Hawaii we did that in five days so that's what's day six like that's when you start coming good it's the end but you're but you're good no it's late it's what you said about you know about ready yeah Eddie about Eddie when you know you all of a sudden you're the body's like oh is this our new house or is this is this what we do what we just what we do yeah once we once the body makes that decision all of a sudden you're good like okay I'm I'm good I mean the hands had blisters everywhere but the the body felt like oh this is where we you know I did the three Scots America with on with wild then he talked me and doing I didn't want to do it and he suckered me into into it and he said because I was like he had other plans he was because he was an operator and he's like he wanted me to go in this race and there's four it's a four-man team you know Ram is called the Race Across America it's a bicycle race across America you start in Oceanside Ninh and Delaware and so you biked across and each guy just goes like 45 45 45 45 and then you chase the other guy when he's riding and you get out and then you just go full-bore as hard as you can for 45 minutes the next guy gets on he goes but you're riding in the car chase and the other guy and you do this day and night right all you're doing a day and night and he you know we the first couple days we felt pretty sick like you felt you don't even you don't even want water like water you look at water and you're like that's when I really learned to appreciate kombucha but but we don't even want water and then day two day three all of a sudden day three you're like wow I'm summing thing goes away I'm ready to go I feel good let's go and but it was that thing about the body being comfortable with that that kind of drudgery but I don't mind the the monotony of that of that kind of like hey I'm gonna go that on it and just you're gonna paddle for but if I do it in my in a routine like something that's a little more not out of a mission right then I'm like then you just you know I don't want to go in and do the same lifting routine did day and and and it's just not I prefer creating new stuff and making it interesting and and having that that the distraction of the of the challenge of something new and keep me interested mmm I did it make sense do you what about massage yeah love that live for it what kind of yet only good ones like deep tissue I've done it kind of almost every single new dolly you can think it's usually about the person as about the person that gives it and and and how if they're healers are not so I just try to find healers and when you say healers what do you mean the people that that do it because they're into taking care of people then they're not doing it as a profession like they don't do it to make money they make money as a side product but they're healers that they that they just have a gift that they you know you go you you know you can you can get ten massages right and and and then and they're all can be good but there's just one of the people that they just have a skill they know how to touch they know what it is they know where they know how to feel it they know how to that they know how to use the system you know I've done that might the thing that I'm crazy about right now is I'm crazy about dry needling that's the thing that has been the the most profound I mean I've done you know I've done Oh shiatsu and acupuncture and the thing and just I mean I you know and and Rolfing and I've done the ten series three times and I mean I've had all those different modalities but dry needling has been you know and then I have another person that that just does that I don't even know what cart it is it's just massage and she just she just is able to understand the tissue know out and she's relentless and yen and and won't won't leave and won't leave it and tell everything releases and she knows how to release in dry needling to people dry needling is a technique where they use acupuncture needles on soft tissue and they touch the trigger point and get the system the stuff to release like it's a it's not acupuncture it's it's a it's a different modality that that that I'm not sure if it's what states it's legal or not in I know most of the athletes that I know that you do it a lot in Australia they do it in Europe oh she's on some places huh some places it's not legal yeah why I have no idea probably cuz it worked and somebody's threatened by it really I mean isn't that usually the case well I guess where someone doesn't understand it and they think someone's a quack and those needles all these people you don't know what you're doing there's no science here yeah well there's some science behind it and and it but it absolutely is the most functional I mean I got friends with giant knots and their traps in this you know one session the thing goes away extremely really intense yeah intense intense but it but but dry needling is you know if I ever have my friend who's really good at it comes through I'll stare her your way cuz it's it's it's it's it's the most effective I mean I I've you know I think as someone that you're always looking right we're always looking like what what you know hey we need the heat we need the ice we need the thing we need the food we need the thing where's the tumor where is it you know we always are looking and so when I run into things that are effective I'm I cherish them because I know that you know and the problem is you have a high bar because when you've experienced great work you just you can't you go get somebody who does a little mushy mushy and you're just like don't have time for that well lay all lay still for three hours if I know somebody knows what they're doing but I won't be there for twenty minutes if somebody if I feel like it's like your half-assed night yeah which is a lot of it you know a lot of that stuff's out there and and no fault to the people I think part of it is just they probably just don't know and their intentions it's got to be your intentions why why do you do it yeah it's interesting how some people can just find those problem areas they just so it's right here and you're like how do you know they know yeah and they and they feel it with their hands they see with their hands and they know right where it's like connecting where to dig in and how to release it yeah that's an art that's my same facial release it's real it's real when you're good and you and somebody really knows what they're doing that's why I say more about the people than the technique because there's that I can yeah yeah yeah but but give me the person and but that dry needling is is it's the most effective of any of the of the stuff that I've used it and this person is in California they use the girl that helps me is in Hawaii and then they but they teach in Colorado it's actually a it's actually a technique that they developed some guys that were studying pain is from my understanding they were studying pain and so what they did is they had all these people that were injured in different areas and then they injected them with different solutions and they injected and with like a placebo and like saline and novocaine and all kinds of different things and everybody got better and what they realized is that it was the needle and the acuteness of the needles themselves in the areas that were painful that were causing that was causing this release and so they developed the whole pain referral chart and and then they developed this this technique and it's it's because everybody always can miss confuse you know confuse it with acupuncture they all yeah keep on trying that's not I can puncture this is in the soft tissue when I get punctures on the meridians and on the electrical system right this is soft tissue this is this is to get the soft tissue to release but they'll take stuff that you've had that's just like a cable somewhere are not or something that just won't release and but it's you know in its back to that no pain no gain there's always that I got a lady that does trigger point massage and it's the most painful shit I've ever experienced in my life like it's like you just want to quit absolutely when I get out of there the next day everything's like loose and pliable and and I've had things that I've like I've really injured myself and she fixed it yeah and then like a day later like it doesn't hurt anymore I'm like this is strange for and it's been her like four months yes so there was something in there that was not enough yeah and I always assumed that that's an injury and sometimes it's not a knee it's not yeah yeah it's just the tissue it's just not ready stop yeah yeah well and this has two dozen would do with the fascia and some other stuff going on that that that they have to know how to release it and sauna seems to help that quite a bit too and ice crazy the combination of those two are I mean that's that's what I found is that sauna and ice kind of eliminate the need really to get worked on unless it's super acute like if it's not if it's super cute then there you you you know you need you need somebody to go in there and you know put the jackhammer on it but but if it's not a cute like that just the normal maintenance and and and actually preventing the stuff from getting to a point where you really need to get the work the song ends magic that's that is crazy good and it seems to me that when I've been ramping up the temperature like into 200s and now in the - - it seems more effective more effective yeah more effective well it's more intense yeah not torture yeah more torture more results but I'm a little bit you know and I don't know maybe something you can find out but I this thing with I'm a little rocky right now with the with the infrared I was gonna ask you that I'm a little rocky with the infrared right now only because of just some of the something that happened to me with my skin and then and then met I met a dermatologist that was pretty educated and he was saying that you know that that that he says is it damages the collagen and infrared does damages the collagen in your body he's way affects the structure of the skin because of the penetration of it and that the most you should ever do is this is done these are my words but the the most you should ever do is is is you know three times a week for 15 minutes at the most for infrared for yeah and and he was saying that and you should never look at it as well Jesus like it's harmful to the eyes yeah so so I got a regular solid just because the protocol that the dr. Rhonda Patrick was talking about for those I guess it was a was it Norway those days yeah that was all regular songs yeah I'm like well if they're getting these results from regular song I'll just do regular sauna well I like regular anyway because it just seems like it's natural it's kind of like ice like people go and cry oh hey you want to go cry oh I go I have a nice tub I don't need crown and by the way if if you want to do a real ice going on ice tub cuz cryos cakewalk compared to a real ice tub you know we do cry out for a couple minutes yeah and you don't have heat next to it in it I mean you can don't only do ice for a couple minutes till it's like the thing about cryo though is you can do cryo and then work out yeah before you can do I some work out too and you know yeah I do that all the time got we incorporate ice into training and so one of the things that we do is we'll three quarters into the training we'll just pull out right when you start to kind of lose some of your juice and you'll go do like three minutes and come out and then try and you have another gear so that's another little thing to incorporate ice within that within that system or we'll do ice as we as we train as one of the station's imagine doing a circuit and one of the stations is you know we are doing a we're doing a horse a couple months ago on the last season maybe buddy we were doing uh like an Iron Horse we're standing in a horse position with your arms and we'd stand in that position for 10 or 15 when it's a horse position when you're on your horse stance yeah yes yeah okay so we're in a horse stance what are you doing with arms with the arms are straight out okay you're holding okay so called the iron horse whatever just standing in the horse so you stand in the horse position ten minutes going the ice three minutes oh come back outs and they won't send another thing going like in the ice stand in the thing blow you up explode you like crazy so I mean there's always like I said there's always a little you know a little hook to give it but the ice to incorporate it within your training I think it's phenomenal like people that's why I question warming up because people go warm um how about do three to five minutes ice and then go start all your cardio and start to train right now your body just be freaked out freaked out but it's but you the ice makes you stimulated like when you feel the system it's it's cold but you're not cold like it's trying to heat up yeah Michael Phelps in the pool heat up its revving so there's all that that's like the science of the fun you know the the for me I I look at it like a laboratory it's a little bit like being an artist in playing with all that stuff I that brings makes that keeps me interested it keeps me excited about about learning learning because I think it's about learning it's all about learning yeah learning about your body and talking about what's effective yeah well that's why I'm glad this guy's like you're out there the guinea pigs yeah well the guinea pigs an awesome guinea pigs again or in my age yeah yeah I know that it's pop yeah it's darkness 1:55 absolute long after that well listen man thank you thanks for coming here thanks for doing that I want to do your workout too yeah well your you have an open invitation all right I'm happen I got a I got a stove after the fires I'm still cleaning so I got this weekend I should we're doing a cert so we're training some people this weekend but after this weekend I'm open for the summer so if you you want to come and you know beautiful I will do that bin let's make it happen brother I relish it Aloha to you too is thank you thank you hi everybody [Music]
