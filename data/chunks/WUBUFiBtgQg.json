you uh play the music okay the Joe Rogan experience train my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day all the way from how many miles above the Arctic Circle uh they are saying it's 197 miles north of the Arctic Circle I say it's a few more yeah so somewhere around 200 miles yeah Jesus fuckin Christ what what led you folks who just tuning in right now sooo Bacon's from life below zero which is one of my favorite shows love that show it's the realest at all those shows it seems to be the realest there's so many of these shows that they'll do like these subsistence living shows but you know that they're setting up fake scenarios you know that there's some producer fuckery involved yeah they're there are some things that some shows out there that are I would say very heavily scripted yeah you know you're told what you're going to be doing not but this show and it's it's one of my things in my contract I don't do scripted anything I never want to hear how wouldn't that look great if you fell through the river because I'll be like jump fucker see how it feels I'm not doing it you know there's enough interesting stuff that happens naturally that you don't have to script a lot of action yeah I would imagine I mean where you're living is one of the most bizarre remote places on earth for folks who have never seen the show it follows a series of people that live in some pretty incredibly remote locations in Alaska but you are the most remote you're the gangster of the gangsters yeah I'm the queen of the badassery when it comes to remote you know my closest city where you could find a Walmart is 500 miles south and when you take a plane from Fairbanks to camp once you hit the air that's it you don't see another building until you get to my camp one led you this spot even when I you know I say in in preschool and kindergarten in the early to mid 60's when they ask you what do you want to be when you grow up you know for a girl at that time period you know it was pretty standard you know wife and mother for me it was a lighthouse keeper I've always craved extreme isolation this is just an extension of that why with them what's the attraction I am really happy I like myself I crack myself up all the time I'm really comfortable in my own skin I like challenges if it's if there's no challenge in the way that you're living you're not really living you're just kind of you're doing a script so it's just this attraction to isolation there's almost like a natural part of your personality it is it is um I really bond with the animals around me you know and I I don't feel that just because it's brown it has to go down I do hunt for the meat that I eat but you know I find where else are you going to go my main pack of wolves has twenty two in it they're not always out to eat me so I get to see some pretty amazing things two three winners in a row you always have a couple of bears that wake up out of season they either didn't store enough fat they woke up for some reason but once they wake up they're straight-up killers in the past couple of years I've been able to watch a pack of wolves take down and grizzly whoa and you know like this last year they just have to get him running because within a mile or two he's used up all of his calories and there's no way he's going to survive someone that came running through camp crashing into my building as they go I'm sitting there on the inside you know with my gun going yeah come through the wall fucker I'll get you you know but not until they do and they went right past and boom they took them down on the end of the airstrip and ate him so those are things that I get to experience that for an adrenaline junkie somebody that's always pushing the limits that's that's pretty Skookum that's pretty good what what was that like that had to be insane watching a pack of wolves take out a grizzly yeah well it is because you know it comes at the time of the year when I have 24 hour darkness so I only have a limited amount of space where I can see them and then it's gone I don't know if they're going to come around and come back inside I don't know if they've finished it I don't know if there's a couple of rogue wolves waiting for me to come out so you're your own existence then becomes quite limited to inside until you know that it's clear a fascinating way to live life now 24 hour darkness - I did that I don't even think of that yeah well my Sun is going to set for the last time this next week and in Barrow and Prudhoe Bay they get a little bit more sunshine just because or a few more sunsets just because of their location they're not around mountains or Hills I've got a mountain to the north the south and mountain range to the east so I lose it a couple weeks before they do and then I won't have another sunrise until March Wow so so how did you you saw these wolves or you heard them chase down the bear like how do you know what took place did you put a spotlight on it um you get a little bit during this particular time frame that had happened you get a little bit of ambient light you don't actually have the Sun but your sky will lighten a little bit and even when the moon is out it lights up it's an all-white landscape it lights it up and I routinely even in winter as long as it's not blowing a gale I go up on my roof tops and I'm always looking around you always want to give yourself as much advance notice on anything coming in it could be a food source for me it could be a predator it doesn't matter I want to know what's around me and that's where I saw something going on there and I saw a big red splotch or what I assumed was red and so I know something was bleeding something was attacking something and then I could make out as it got closer that was a bear running and the Wolfpack was in the river and down there's 22 wolves and they just tagged him to keep him running once he wears out they've got him wow they're so clever um they are they're top predators and they're top predators for a reason and they live in that they genetically are predisposed to succeed so you know for me as a human being being there you know I've got guns I've got other things but you know left to your own devices I mean we are nowhere near top predator and they are the only predators that are that size that act in a pack yes yeah they think together they chase people in the father√≠s animals and do it and there's a hierarchy yeah you know you have the alphas who control the whole thing they control who's going to mate who's not going to mate they and if you if you go against the rules you're kicked out of the pack so then you have rolls and so you got your solitary units Wow and you're living in these these houses that you're living in they seem like they're made out of like cloth or something they are they're Quonset tents now for four clients in order for me to be there as a Caucasian I'm not allowed to own property on the North Slope so for me to have a lifestyle there I have to lease land from the state and have a profitable business if the business stops being profitable they have the right to eject me so there's you know and people say oh it's reverse discrimination and you have to stop right there there is no forward or reverse it is a fact I knew that going in and so it's a challenge it just becomes a challenge so I the clients can stay in the trailers there's bear-proof soundproof trailers they can stand now if I stay in that it's a very small amount of head space for me I don't like that the doors open to the outside world you you have to get your life down to all of the doors my final door going to the outside world opens inside because I guarantee 1520 times a winner I'm going to open that door and it's a wall of snow I have to dig a tunnel so I can get out and open the you know have an open space if I had a door that opened to the outside world I wouldn't get out so I've trapped myself but the tent that I live in I'm not a lot of permanent structures so I have a tent and so not allowed a permanent structure no because I'm leasing the land and you have to everything has to be mobile in case they for whatever reason tell you your lease is up you need to leave so everything either is on tracks or it's a tent that you can take down or something you're willing to throw a match on and burn you're not allowed to have a permanent structure that's a strange set of rules isn't it I mean it seems like no house is permanent they've knocked down houses all the time the term permanent is kind of weird yeah but Alaska still I mean if you want to break it down I mean we still have squatter's rights we still have you know if you if you're allowed permanent structures then perhaps you're allowing a squatter's rights situation to develop I don't really care about the background rules I just just tell me what the rules are and I'll meet the challenge and so your in these tents how easy would it be for an animal to get into the tent one swipe it's just you know figure your coleman tent may be a little bit thicker material and that's it so any well it's like the bear that i got this last year that the background of that my dog was outside in her house and the bear came up tore her little house out hockey puck did around the pad tried to eat her chased after some kids that were camping so it became after the bear attack that I had a few years ago there was a certain fear factor I did not aggressively go get bears I waited hey if you come through my wall I'll take care of you but I'm not and you know there was a fear factor well now as an owner I can't afford to be passive this bear presented a danger to my dog but also more importantly to clients camping so I had to go proactive and it was 16 and a half hours of tracking belly crawling over 800 yards and then I coughed and he turned on me well the long and short of that story was I just got the hide back now his claws are five and a half inches long so one swipe and it's done five and a half inches long and he's almost nine foot Wow so and his measurements he from what I understand he's number five in the world for inland grizzly and people wanted me to you know that there was a push to do the boone and crockett thing and I'm like number five you know if he's one or two I'll do it you know number five still pretty damn impressive yeah yeah he was an impressive specimen he was over thirty four years old Wow so you know I mean this this was a bear that was probably getting closer to the end of his shelf life and was going to attack anything when they get ready to den it's it's almost a certain insanity that they reach where you know they're going into hibernation and all's they think as I've got to eat I've got to get fat I've got to eat I've got to get fat if you are you know I always say don't act like a pork chop if you're acting like a pork chop you're in their sights so you were attacked by a bear yep was that in a camp that was at kavik um and I and I don't talk a whole lot about it I mean people always ask just immediately got emotional when I yeah toe you know I try to talk about it in the third person I I get my water from the kavik River and at a certain point the water is going to freeze over while I had one more shot at getting some water so I went down and what I have to do is get a pump both hands have to be used to get it in the river and start it up and I had a juvenile bear that had been every night he'd come and he'd go to my helicopter pad dig it up bury his food and run off I could see where he was going and where he was coming from and when a bear does that he's trying to claim your territory as a juvenile bear between three and seven years old you know he's not hot enough the chicks don't want them he's not alpha enough he's not kicking any other bears but but I have this prime territory yet no matter how careful I am it always smells like food it has cool dens you don't have to dig it's a prime place and so it's an alpha pussy the first step on the Alpha ladder is subjugate something and take over their territory and so the long and short I was getting my water I sat down my rifle and he was hiding in the cup bank and snatched me up and you know he he rolls with you he'll open his jaws put it on your throat you can still feel here and here where I ended up having to sew my head together he tore the hips out of the sockets and then he ended up going back in the river and older bear or a female would have just eaten me and and that's you know and and I accept that in my lifestyle I knew I was injured did not remember I had a rifle by the river got myself back to camp I knew my hips weren't in good shape and he was going to come back and finish the job what he did was kick me out of my property then I am lower than he is on the totem pole and he has my territory so I got my gun belt ratcheted it on the hips tried I remember calling one person I was told I called more than one person for help the troopers I got there answering machine because they're out doing other things and I called some other people I didn't I don't remember that I tried to get a hold of the oil companies to say I'd been attacked and they did not help but I went back got a rifle found where the bear was shot him GPS t't I don't know why I did that but it was important at the time and then the hips gave out on the way back over so I drug myself to the camp and I laid there ten days till somebody found me whoa so on days yeah and it's a memory I don't I mean at that that's going to be with me forever I had to be flown out once I was found they flew me to Fairbanks then they flew me to the lower world for immediate surgery and my kids did get to see me in that shape and that was hard on them too that that definitely brought it into perspective that I may be the first in the family to go and so they had to deal with that did you have any thoughts of abandoning that lifestyle when that happened I you know it became because I was working for the company that I later bought the camp from um it was a workman's comp case they put the hips in they had to do one twice and they took a couple of disks out and then the the insurance company said well we're not going to do any more work you got to get a lawyer and I you know I'm like why I'm not arguing the company's not arguing neither is the fucking bear he's dead and they said that's just the way it goes and my personality was well how about if you go to hell I'm going home so I called the owner he said yeah if you think you can do it and I said there's only one way I had to accept that there's 83 tagged Grizzlies within 10 miles of camp at any point they can decide to charge camp or come in aggressively um it's only a matter of time before I do get charged again so that's my test when it happens how am I going to react if I hesitate at all I have no business being there I can't perform the job it takes to be there but when it did happen I was able to I took care of the bear it was just automatic response so I knew I would be ok but you know there's how many injuries do you have you know when your head stops being able to get in the game and take care of it then that's when I have to leave you said that they had to take some discs out we've got several discs spit out but of your back yeah on the spine and I still have more there's more work to do but as you know not to diss the the workman's compensation thing but it's it's really not set up to help the people it's set up to help the insurance companies so I've just gone without the medical attention and I know I can't twist and Bend very often I know what some of my limits are and I try to work around it well so do you have bulging disks or when you say disks went out look yeah there's spit out there's one that spit out pretty hard twisting into the right is not good I have to when I lift things I have to be careful because when the bear got me yeah he's twisting and your body's just not meant to do that it's an outside force applying pressure and twisting it's not a good thing so but as with anything it's like for me I was later a couple of years later working on the overhead electrics and and fell straight down from 22 feet broke both ankles and the bones in my right leg and and that's where at the beginning of the episodes you see that I'm having surgery and coming back to camp um I've since had a few more things that I've had to look at you know you beat up your body so much and I'm not I'm not a spring chicken I mean I'm not the Crypt Keeper but you know I'm going on 52 at some point my body's going to say but you want to do that do it on your own because I'm checking out right you know so you you must if you're gonna do this lifestyle you must always assess reassess and be extremely honest with who you are what your limitations are and how can you work within those it's just such a strange life to be drawn to not just to be isolated like that but to be isolated in this really vulnerable way where in your intense it's it's so crazy it's not for everybody it's fuck yeah I would imagine it's for like one of the smallest percentages of people on the planet but you're very personable you're very friendly you're very smart so you you're you're not like this fucking Ted Kaczynski wacko living witness shining yeah you know what I'm saying it's like you seem like a person who joins being around people I do um you know people assume that because I live alone I am antisocial or I'm running away from something and that's not the case you know I run to a lifestyle that I enjoy and I really enjoy being social but I'd like to know when it's going to start and when it's going and I don't want to live extremely social but um I love engaging in it and then you know like a hit and run I know when I know when to leave right so you'll come into town hang out with people talk okay you guys take care I'm just gonna be by myself intent yeah well and then you know you no matter where you live it's a good idea when you're in a social situation learn what's healthy for you and what's not there may be people that you are quote unquote friends with but they're toxic I mean cut the toxicity out of your lifestyle and enjoy it yeah without a doubt that's great advice but it aren't Bears fucking talks like a shit to bears our bears you know they don't wake up and say oh that's who I think I'm gonna knock her around today right right I mean they they are animals and there's an instinct and there's a drive to survive and sometimes I get in their way and I'm in their sights like this summer it troopers even came by several times and said we we need to know that you have an emergency plan this is going to be one of the worst aggressive bear seasons ever how the numbers because the numbers are so high you know as man decides it's going to like the caribou herd size they counted nigga oh there's too many caribou let's up the amount that people can harvest well when they do that and went from two a year to five a year in the villages it's ten a day so you're putting all these bones and gut piles out there while your predators are going to eat those and then their numbers are healthier they reproduce more and then all of a sudden like this year the caribou migrated out a full five six weeks early and so their main food group left the North Slope so then you have all these bears roaming around and nothing to eat but Here I am walking around like a little pork chop you know um but the Bears this year I had eight that were circling camp just religiously every day but they never they never did anything they weren't dickheads you know they didn't come through the walls they didn't ransack you know I'm very careful with garbage and everything else whatever I have to have in camp it has to be flown in well it's a protected ecosystem you can't just go bury your garbage or leave it in bags I by law have to take all of the garbage in even human waste separate the liquids and solids burn everything to its lowest lowest - bag it up and send it to town so you have to burn poop yes that's hilarious well only if you're not doing the job because I don't what I'm doing it and I'm just saying do you have like a furnace like how do you have a big incinerator oh yeah I mean it's not the greatest job on the planet but it's a job right you know I mean I don't go cook food right afterwards I clean up you have a profitable business up there what do you do up there uh kavik used to be an old oil camp and now you know my goal is to I want to be the first 100% green camp in the middle of the oil field so I've turned it into sort of a twisted bed-and-breakfast um it's not a hotel like you'd find here where you have you know so many story building in these really cool rooms they are soundproof bear proof containers like a trailer on on tracks that you can stand and it gives you now that that's a measure of safety but I rent those rooms out if you want food I'll cook it for you it's always chefs menu you know you don't get a menu and get to pick from and it's whatever I feel like cooking that day um but that's how I make money now for me to be there there's it's not inexpensive that the dollars that it takes for me to be there even the heat there is no wood I can't do wood heat so everything has to be oil so my interest in going you know I've got a certain amount of alternative energy now this winter I'm working on a big project and hopefully by next year I'll be 100% green and not needing any fuel so I is it possible to be solar I mean when you say a hundred percent green like um well I've already got some solar panels and wind turbine and but Solar eight nine months of the year doesn't do me a whole lot of good right but so wind is the major one so I'm adding in new large-scale wind turbines more solar I will always have to have a generator as a backup but like for example when I first got there working for the other company they used a 100 kW generator 24 hours a day every day and there's also 150 kW well that's going to be over 100 gallons of fuel a day just for the generator to provide electricity Wow and so you know the actual per day you're talking between one and two hundred gallons a day I've got that down to six to ten gallons a day so I've already made a huge stride and making it better now have you done that um I switched I changed all the electrics you know there used to be a theory in the oil fields because some of those companies have a lot of money to spend if they don't spend their whole budget they don't get a new great big budget so there's a you know theory that you you don't need to be more efficient you obviously just need a bigger gender more power chords so everything every time you plug in a power cord you have what's called line loss you know and that's I guess one of the neatest things about the lifestyle I have is you know I wasn't born knowing how to do diesel mechanics and I tell people you know the only thing I used to know about it is how to bake bread in other words I had I knew nothing but I'm learning and it's just like electricity I don't like electricity but I have to learn how to do it so you know you learn line loss if you plug in keep plugging in extension cords you may have a hundred kW when you start and you only get 80 kW at your final ending point because you've lost so much of it along the way so I improved the electrics did more direct wiring fell and hurt myself in the process but got back up and did it again learned wind power I have a big battery bank and I can store power and use it later that's my entire internet system that I put in 12 years ago it runs off the battery bank we say internet system how's that work back when I first got there um and I was working for the other company I said hey we got to get Internet the analog phones annal there's two types of signal for cell phone usage or phones you have an analog signal signal and a digital analog travels much further than a digital digital only goes twenty-seven miles well I'm 83 and a half miles from Deadhorse no matter what I do I can't get it throw the signal again it's still not going to reach me well the government took away the analog signal and privatized it for themselves so I knew you're going to have no communications other than a satellite phone which is it horrendously expensive so I told the owner I said you need the Internet out here you know and he says yeah no at this point you know technology where it was then you have to get over the curvature of the earth to clip the satellites so he said if you want it you're going to pay for it well alright there's a challenge it cost eight thousand bucks to get the dish fly it up get the tech I worked with the geologists to find the bedrock and I bounced a signal off the bedrock and I haven't lost signal yet Wow you bounced a satellite signal off the catcher bounces it off the bedrock rather than people that point it where they think the satellites are going to go like here I point it directly down so as the signals are hitting the bedrock I kill I get it Wow so it was a risk I didn't calculate that I brought the geologists in I had an idea I'm great with ideas but I don't know if their bonehead ideas or plausible isn't like I was doing something similar is it's just completely you're originally me they may know nobody was then but you just came up with it on your own yeah yeah I I knew what I wanted to do I know the basic mechanics of what needs to happen and and then I apply sous technology and come up with a sous fix but I do check with people that are trained in that nigga yeah that might work well okay it's worth 8 grand for me to check it out and what kind of like download speeds do you get up there can you like watch a youtube video I can haul although the way they sell the Internet up there is you know your bandwidth your bandwidth you get so many gigs or whatever of bandwidth when I use that up then it's really expensive prohibitively expensive but for me to go back to being jungle Jane I am a mother a grandmother um for me to do this you know I work very closely with the kids we have a loving relationship but you know I like and having children - I mean you're dropping these little seeds and they've got to grow well my personality can throw a pretty big shadow not many plants grow on the shade I needed to step back so that they could get the sunshine but one of the turnarounds is is I need to know that I can communicate with people you can't run a business if nobody can tell you they want to show up so you know it to me it was the wave of the future I had to get it figured out and if the only thing standing in my way is money while I'll go out make it that's such a strange contradiction isolation but yet you want a condition yeah yeah I need to know for myself that the kids and grandkids are ok and have a system of talking to each other social media I throw up ten fingers ten toes they know I'm okay six fingers four toes they know there's a problem you know it's pretty basic and then they also we have a phrase and and I won't say what it is but there is a key phrase and if the kids or grandkids ever say that to me that means drop what you're doing get here ASAP and how long does it take you to get to civilization depends on the time of year to even come down here and do this um I had a previous engagement in New York City I've been trying on last a week ago Monday I called and I said you need to pull me now we're going to get a bad storm and you know my original flight out was Saturday no we got days and I don't know you really don't we got a system coming in I need those weather days well if you if somebody in the real world you know they need to get to the airport a little earlier because maybe it's bad traffic they're talking hours well this is Dave today is day 13 of this major Blizzard up there and I just happen to have a window a 3-hour window where a plane could make it in three hour wind yeah and and we just hit it right and I got out but the turnaround for me is when I get home I'm calculating that Saturday I'm going to have another window and I hope so because that's my way to get back in right now you know I've got a Wolverine that's just been acting like a real creeper on camp trying to get into things and so I don't know what he's doing while I'm not there um I can't afford to lose all my water and let everything freeze up in my tent so my heat is still going if that animal gets into my building he's going to knock over my heater and burn my camp down I don't know til I get there what I'm dealing with and that might be happening right now could be can you go to Google Earth and look at your camp um I suppose you could but you're going to get a delayed picture I believe with Google Earth but I do have two webcams and I did check this morning it's not I can see the dining hall into the east they're actually for the pilots so they can see the mountains and see where the sky is um and then I try to update it as I can but I was able to see okay I still have a dining hall tits so do you see this Wolverine uh you can't it's not a live feed on my webcam no do you ever see what I see almost daily almost ya know you know like with me and the animals if I need the fur I'll go ahead and get him right now for needing the fur it's only like I think it was five below zero I think five or ten below zero Zach oldest I've gotten so far this year not counting windchill so it's not really cold enough for me if you're going for a furbearer then get him when their fur is prime you know um and its first not prime and he's just being a Wolverine he hasn't attacked me as a person he's tried to mangle one of the buildings and I do what I can to dissuade him I would like what do you do um Wolverines if they've ever been injured or you've ever angered them or they've ever gotten trumped on a hunt they'll remember that like a GPS coordinate and they come back and they keep trying to attack it like them I guess it's a challenge so for whatever reason this Wolverine has picked one trailer as his nemesis and he goes and he rips the angle iron off and twist it into a little knot so what I've done is I've tied a little piece of angle iron down there and he takes that and keeps re tearing it up you know um so as soon as his enemy yeah that's for whatever reason that trailer pissed him off one year and I don't know why but it may I can't afford to lose you know for me to try and replace it is an ungodly amount of money if he doesn't get with the program and leave then you know we're gonna we're going to be like this and I have to deal with it but right now he can't help being a Wolverine I can't help not wanting him to ruin my stuff so it's do you you enjoy having them around into some sort of a strange way because it gives you something to think about I mean do you have like a connection with these animals which also don't matter your drama well you know it's not you don't connect with Wolverine I mean there well you could you could I suppose I seen a show where there's some guy petting them that's not my gig um I don't think you know it'd be like somebody if there was a race of people that you know bigger than we are and they come in and I'm drinking my coffee and etags my ass I mean that would be a bum day I don't see any reason to shoot an animal simply because it exists so what I can do is is hopefully I'll just keep dissuading him and he'll go wow she's crabby and she and he leaves or it'll come down to yeah I've got to take him out because he's now costing revenue so he might start tearing up a different tent yeah yeah or he's gonna go in and you know you tax the walls I mean I can only let it go so long but I'm willing to bet that if I keep you know he keeps trying to come in and I keep dissuading him sooner or later he's just gonna say wow whatever and leave but um I do I do enjoy the animals in their natural habitat I enjoy you know I've been able to see one of the moodiest Grizzlies up there um she's tagged and her name is Marty well a couple of years ago and and she is what thirty eight years old or something like that now or she was then um but she ended up popping out a couple of babies now she's the worst mother in the planet you know she'll let him get two miles away from her and in which for a hiker it's really easy to get in the middle of mama and Cubs so I try to warn people but I was sitting up there on the roof of my I call at the perch and I'm watching in here's Marty crawling up the hillside and there's still a snow field and she goes wee and slides down here come the two Cubs and they just all day long played and they were so loving so it's it's really you know it's a dichotomy I see the aggressive side but I also can appreciate the maternal natural side yeah you're dealing with it the same species that almost killed you you're watching them play well you know and even to do the lifestyle at all and I don't care what part of the world if you're going to go this remote and inverse yourself in their territory you have to be comfortable with your own death not the same as having a death wish but um like with my kids and grandkids we do one big meal a year and whether it's over the Skype or whatever I tell them tell me three things you can't stand about me what did I do that really pissed you off but tell me three good things and I do the same for them and it's you know just a very honest relationship I have it I have accepted that I may die due to either conditions or animals out here and I'm okay with that that's you know roll the dice I'm willing to accept but we each year tell each other I love you for this I think you're a douchebag for that but you know what I am going to miss you when you go and you know over my life I have this big chest and I've been filling it all the cool crazy things they've ever heard about me and some things are pretty I mean there's some things in my life even as a very young person that were really fantastic and so I take the photographs or the proof or whatever nice stuffing in this box so when I go they're going to be able to open that for the first time and see oh my god that really happened oh shit look at that but it'll be a pretty cool Chronicle your life do you find it really rewarding to be out in this incredibly wild environment like when you come to a city like you go from that to New York City is New York City just like a cool little vacation for you and then do you appreciate the wild or do you appreciate New York because of the wild um or both something when you you know my lifestyle the challenges I face and overcoming that um there is such pride in yourself that oh my gosh I did that how cool is that um in being so that was really little I mean I terrified of the dark but now I live in a place that's dark for nine months out of the year you know I mean there are always challenges know yourself better yourself you know um when I go to a city a bear I know exactly what he wants from me you know pretty much he's either gonna eat you or you want something here just passing through but it's a pretty honest relationship he wants to eat me I don't want them to you go to a big city and I'm used to seeing my horizon I'm always checking things there's no trees there's no buildings there's nothing tomorrow my horizon I go to New York and you can't go eight feet and you've got a 60-story building how the hell do you check your horizon how do you know what's coming at you you see people but you cannot be guaranteed when I see a bear and he's charging I know he wants to attack me you see a person walking down the street you don't know whether he's going to pull a gun out of his pocket shake your hand pinch your ass or wave goodbye you don't know so that's a predator that I'm pretty impressed people want to be around I know I when I got here I look at all these lights and all these people I'm like oh my god they're here on purpose Wow I always appreciate LA when I leave and go into the wilderness whenever I go into the wilderness I love being there like a couple times a year three three times a year I go hunting and when I come back I always really appreciate the city now yet flush toilets are just like cool oh yeah but just being warm and like dry and sitting on a couch and watching TV yeah yeah there there is it is not saying that I've never lived in a social setting or a city I certainly have you know the kids father biological father you know he tried to make it in Alaska and it wasn't the way I live it wasn't his gig so you're married I went down there tried to make it in the city that boy that wasn't my gig for very long we you know we were married 17 years and then one day were laying in bed and he's cracking up and I said what and he says it's real you know it's real simple you're more Grizzly Adams I'm more John Wayne the shitting and working and so we stayed the best of friends until he passed away but we developed and that's part of me you know don't sit there and cry and be sad because I've ended we were still best of friends and realized here you're John Wayne go get your horse cowboy I'm gonna go over here and get a bear and we made it work will you always live in like this like would it would it how does you meet it was born in Chicago and at a very early age my mom was leaving my dad and back then divorce still wasn't very popular but she left him brought us up to Alaska and then she left to go to her own thing so um very quickly I had to get used to living in a tent hunting and I finished school very early I graduated high school just before I turned 13 why'd you have to get used to living in a tent and hunting I don't get into that part of my life very much so um because you know I love my mother to death I've never walked a mile in anybody's shoes let alone three feet so what made her decide to go from Chicago to Alaska and then leave us and to our own devices and go to something else I don't know and how old were you when this was going on yo and um but she's still alive I've never held anything against her you know and that's the thing I mean when people they hold grudges on other people or they let it affect their lives you know you how many people are in therapy saying when oh it was ten this happened well fuck is forty years ago get over it you know I mean you have to move forward if you have one foot in the past and one in the future the only place you're not living is today some people wallow that they enjoy being upset but being a drama queen is fun I suppose you know for some people but you know it's not my style obviously not yeah fuck drama queens really wouldn't be back in Alaska after getting almost killed by a bear well you know are you gonna then be is your life then going to be run by your fear and when where does it stop mm-hmm fair is a desperate creature that grabs as much turf as it can get so once you start letting it run your life you better have a good pair of sneakers you're going to be running the rest of your life that's an excellent description it really is that's very very accurate you looking for the nicotine again yeah I saw it do you anticipate living there for the rest of your life or would you be interested in a similarly sort of isolated but different environment um or do you have a personal like I don't plan that far ahead I currently am enjoying the hell out of the challenges and thriving with what I'm doing but I have kind of a raven personality there is going to be another shiny thing on the horizon and I'll be like checking it out um a lot of people don't know you know I've traveled a lot in my life I mean there are so many awesome things to see on the planet and I don't want to die be sitting there in the grave my little soul lifting up and go fuck I wish I would have done that I want to be lifting it up saying got it nailed it you know um so there will be other things that catch my eye my body is getting older I've beat the hell out of it I'm probably not going to stop doing that when I can no longer function at kavik and make it safe for people then I don't have any business being there um there's so much to see and do in is that how you've always run it you've always run it as sort of a bed-and-breakfast um yeah the the company that had that owned it before I know you know the person that used to own at the company they were friends of mine and they came looking for me I used to have a 400 mile trapline along the Jim River and had a bunch of sled dogs and that's how I lived for a long time Wow you go 400 miles up sending your trips 400 miles down checking up all by yourself yeah and then I thought you know I did marry again that did not work out as well as I would have liked uh but you marry another trapper uh yeah he's somebody I knew when I was little and I ended up in Alaska he was gonna come up there and we used to joke around cuz he used to say I'm gonna marry you and I'm like it I'm never getting married sorry sucker but on his way up he got to a avalanches he turned around married somebody else and I'm like well a real man would have made it you know but it ended up it was not a good thing um he went a little bushy up there in kavik and yeah were you you lose your perspective you know um when you're all alone there's no social there's nobody saying who you can't where like in the winter I wear my long johns and jammie pants as long johns all winter long I try to gain 20 to 30 pounds minimum to go into winter because when I get stuck at 50 below in a blizzard working hard I'm gonna lose pounds every day I don't want to come out being unhealthy so I go in being a little junkie wow that's interesting it's a strategy yeah what do you eat to ensure that whatever I want to see a lot of cake and pie you know my body if you listen to your body it's going to tell you what it wants even a pregnant woman when she's craving pickles and ice cream she probably needs salt potassium and calcium so you break down your craving into what what's in there okay and you can eat something else but it's going to give your body what it needs your body can only remember where you last got it from so it's going to throw all these wacky things together and say eat chocolate bananas with raisins and you know some steak mmm so break it down you need iron you need calcium you need potassium you know you need niacin so go grab it do you ever have any vegetarians try to stay up there with you I do I hate her too you know I do vegan you can carry really yep glue wiry diabetic any nutrient diet other than there's some people there was only one group and I don't know what they call themselves but the they will only eat something an apple that fell to the ground it has no commit roadside or something yeah no I can't do that one oh my god people are so crazy um it must be very difficult to get vegetables up there it is I try to do a garden every year but for me at my location um when I used to do the hard time putting um visqueen it's a type of plastic but it has a very oily smell bears are attracted to oil and so every time I make a fist queen greenhouse it would start going good and then the bear comes up rawr and tears it apart so um and my area is much much much more volatile with the weather I will get snow and ice at least once a month this year I got my first big blizzard the end the third week in August and it never went away what care who migrated out and that was it I froze up third week of August yeah I have four or five feet of snow now and you know I've already dipped into the five ten below zero range probably 20 below zero with the windchill factor what's the lowest it never gets up there my thermometer only goes to a hundred below which and I peg it every year you know and that's the real temperature you add some wind on top of it and it gets psycho and and then you'd start compiling that you're in a tent with a thin piece of fabric how do you keep that warm yeah how do you keep that warm um sometimes you're just going to have to put on the gear there's been times where you know the wind is your biggest enemy so as the winter goes on and you're building snow up the sides of the building I know I try to let it get six eight feet deep because that's a form of insulation but where the wind hits your fabric it's going to wick away the heat as quick as you can make it so I have battery-operated fans to convict the air and then sometimes you're just going to wear your winter gear for a week or two until the temps come up 100 below zero that's incredible I do this thing called cryotherapy wears up into this chamber it's 237 degrees below zero you do it naked it's wear your underwear you stand in it for three minutes you get out you warm back up and you go back in for another three minutes and it's uh it's improving your circulation massive for anti-inflammation for like any injuries you might have it's incredible for like the healing properties and for soreness like if you're sore from working out just like straightens all that shit out right away yeah but I keep but that's just three minutes no sleepy you know the equipment that I have I have a mile and a half long runway if somebody wants to land in the winter I've got to get out and work that runway yeah how do you do that um I have a bobcat I don't I'm not the proud owner of a piece of equipment that's all enclosed and heated um whatever it is outside is what I'm experiencing so like for me to even get out on my two to three-hour window I have to go out there clear it and then sit there for an hour and a half until boom the plane landed and so erm II my dog and I jumped in the plane and left Wow a hundred below zero in a bobcat what the fuck is that like it's not good your face is exposed or you wait you're marrying yeah you're covering as much as you can I'm not the biggest fan of polypro it's in the end of plastic product and it will at a certain temperature instead of keeping you warm it's going to turn hard and then it's going to conduct the cold so I'm not a big fan of polypro I like natural materials fur it depends on what the temperatures are I do have two four outfits one with the fur facing in one with the fur facing out at those temperatures you're going to wear both and you get out there and you just get your work now the fur facing in in the fur facing us you have like several layers of fur yeah yeah I make these yourself out of bear or um usually caribou um and so well and if you go back to the very first episode when the oil and everything got stolen a lot of my things got taken too so I am in the process of making new outfits who stole your oil I'm not gonna get into that but you know a person I did find out who did it and um for me the legal battle you know so sure I go out and I see when I say hey you took this amount of money and fuel well they have more money than I do as a company and they're going to be able to stand the battle longer than I can so I'm going to spend four times as much to get back a little bit of money well the North Slope is a place that even if we don't live anywhere close to each other word spreads like wildfire that company is having a hard time even getting business now because they stole from mm-hmm good you when you when you lose you know respect is something that is absolutely earned up there but it's lost so easily I will kid that why would they steal oil from you like that just because it was there and they could get away with it they thought they could yeah and they did but you know and they had it people use now the camp is mostly ecotourism and ology that's the majority of the money that comes through bird watchers Northern Lights viewers scientists trying to get the groove on but August and part of September that's when the hunters show up and when I had to leave to have my surgeries shut down the camp this company thought hey this is a great way I can bring people in I don't have to pay for anything and they're going to be warm and they're going to use the equipment and but I did find a bill of lading that they left behind they threw away their garbage they did not burn their garbage so I went through the garbage so but in the end what is it worth how long were they up there for mmm I would say they ran people through for a solid month Wow yeah but you know that the point is for me what a bunch of fucking shit it's a choice do I choose to live and the negativity of that and drag myself through several years of court over it or I just go right beyond it right you know they have to live with being a dickhead I've moved faster so you say August September you have hunters up there in your camp and is it because the caribou migration yeah three of the major herds migrate right through camp the kavik River Valley is if you go into the different geologic papers professional papers even in the late 1800s through the mid 1900s the kavik River Valley is very unique among the watersheds they're my variety of plant life is far different than it is in other ones well the the type of lichen that a caribou eats and moss that they eat to gain the most fat for their journey out is right in that valley now they'd like a nice white stuff I've seen yes I mean this multicolored but yeah they eat lichen and moss right and that's where they gain their fat well I have a high concentration of it in that valley so they want to migrate through no guarantees implied because like this year they just lifted their collective cow heads and moved out and really unusual that they did now looking back at it winter hit with an iron fist and hasn't left yet so it was a smooth move somehow they knew what was coming and they left but yeah go figure that one but I do I pay attention to my plan sometime in August I start peeling the bark off the willow if it's you know if it's easy to peel the plant still thinks there's going to be plenty of good good weather once it starts to really get tough and it's sucking up to the skin while all the SAP is being reserved and that plants getting ready for winter it may be 80 degrees outside but the plant is telling me to get the hell ready so you know meteor logically speaking I can get on the internet and look at the weather systems and say oh I think this is going to happen but I go outside and look at my plants and my animals and I know what's going to happen that's amazing so you could tell by just pulling the bark what off of off of a plant that that tells me that those plants are getting ready for weather that I may not be thinking is coming but they do that's amazing how the fuck do they know I don't know why liyan dollar question they know and the caribou know everything knows all of the sudden like there was one year and all the Bears rather than like they they'll dig their their dens into the side of the bank and when the water starts to rise it comes in wakes them up and a bear's favorite food is cub so the boars wake up the male bears usually first and they run around find the other dens and eat the Cubs yeah um but then one year all of a sudden the Bears came up in about three thousand foot level two thousand foot levels started digging dens and I'm like I called a fishing game normally what the hell's up with that you know and nobody's ever there but me so I'm like dude I see this going on and what's happening and they said I don't know but all the bears the ones that are colored they're all moving up and I was like shit so I try to get everything set up in camp because that usually means an excessively high amount of snow which means an excessive amount of water and flooding in the spring so I try to get everything ready by watching what they're doing I can set camp up differently to be protected from a flood in the spring that is amazing that is so amazing that they know that an excessive amount of snow is coming how they figure it who knows but they they will adjust and readjust their actions you know based on something that they feel I can adjust what I do based on what I see that's so bizarre I want to go up there now we'll get up there I want to go up there I want to come up there and hunt caribou up there in august-september that's the time what I tell people I mean I cannot guide without a license but um I can I can look at trends sometime between August in the middle of September that's when they're going to be there now it opens up in July our hunting season goes from July through July but you know for so many months out of the year they're down south having a vacation in Palm Springs you have a 12 month hunting see it's just open all year round pretty much you the the animals depending on the species our hunting season starts in July of any year and then goes through the winter and depending on the species you have to give shut down the season so that the animals can give birth and raise new babies they have to have a safety zone but in July it opens up again Wow so when you shoot these bears like when a bear comes in Edie are you eating these things mm-hmm spring traps yeah spring bear is always better than fall bear um the gamy taste if you will is more concentrated in the fat a brown bear from down south is eating a lot of fish diet and you are what you eat so it's a very fishy tasting product I don't care for that um but up by me I like to tell people that the Bears eat berries and slow tourists so I'm cool you know but yeah the bear that I got um what you don't see in that episode is you know I bear I make sure he's gone it was a it was an emotional thing but I start skinning him and I start getting the meat I got about 300 pounds of meat off of him well here's another bear another grizzly start circling in and getting real tight so we had the four wheelers I brought him up and the boom the fog came down it went totally dark and so now you can't see so the safety dude for the filmies was there with his weapon and we put the headlights all out and you'd see this bear come in and sideswipe the four-wheelers well after 300 pounds of meat and getting you know harvesting the fur I just had to say it's time for me to back off the bear can munch on this which will buy me the time to get away it's weird that bears are such cannibals opportunists yeah you know I'm sure they don't look and say oh wow that was Marty you know it's just an opportunity to fill their beaks and it's survival at its basic the cub thing that was really creepy it is it is um I don't know I don't know what started that with bears but I mean it's a sure bet in an area where the caribou may not have migrated out early enough and when the Bears wake up they're fairly sluggish they walk around like drunkards their muscles are atrophied and there's not a lot of food but it's a sure bet that the mothers with Cubs tend to wake up later so they just go in to get out and it's an opportunity for food still it's so crazy that an animal would almost instinctively and naturally cannibalize it is you know I mean from a human's perspective it's it's it's a little creepy but from an animal perspective if you want to survive you're going to find what foods available mmm but it seems like they're one of the rare animals that cannibalizes on a regular basis like that is that's a state that if you've ever had a kid that had a gerbil as a pet oh that's true yeah that's true I actually had hamster snake they ate the babies and we we had a watch it more like what they they had a disease though called wet tail something to some disease and hamsters get when the babies get a disease the mother will eat the baby but you know our cute little hamster that we loved was just challening its baby's head yeah you know it was like an open coconut I was like what the fuck is wrong with fluffy Jesus Christ bloody mess inside the hamster cage but I think that was more like I said because they were sick it wasn't like she was really hungry she had playing hamster food yeah I don't know I don't know either I'm stressing but it's just it it's one of the weird things about bears like bears particularly that they will yeah they will survive at any cost yeah I'm alone a actually as you said they actually go out looking for yep their cubs yeah I wake up early and Marty actually the bear that I mentioned earlier she is old enough that she acts a lot like a bora bora is a male bear and a saw was a female and old as she is she has she digs her dens where she's going to get hit with the water to wake her up first and she'll do the same thing Wow she'll go out looking for Cubs yep whoa Jesus when I was in Alberta the the camp that I was at the guy who was there that's got John his son saw a bear killed the cub killed us with tactus female kill the cub and then ate half of it left and the female came back and ate the rest of her cub yeah and he was like wow that's a first I've never seen one eat their own cub but I guess once it's dead it just becomes me food yeah we watched these bears go out at - it was crazy watching these like Ultimate Fighting Championship of bears they just started going about it because the male kept trying to come into camp and the female would send her Cubs up the tree and try to chase off the male and he would deal with it for a little bit and they would come back in and then they would start started fighting and they were standing on to its two legs and going at it it's amazing to see even the wolves or the Wolverines not you know I mean I've seen a Wolverine now and when I say Wolverine yeah they're they're like a badger mine are about 3 and a half 4 foot at the shoulders 120 pounds but I've seen them take on Grizzlies and come out on top that's a big every yeah some of the Wolverines up by me and even the wolves they're considered to have they call it a throwback to the Mackenzie River breed and they're averaging about 200 250 pounds the wall yeah I used to have state record for the state of Alaska a trapped wolf it was 9 foot 6 inches nose to tail and I had it in kavik you know in Nome foot six inches so so the Wolves I'm dealing with are not these little tiny shih tzu things you know they are shih tzu wow that's crazy and you get in like a pack of 20-plus that are that are actually taking out a bear yeah usually a wolf will they adjust their pack size according to how much food there is an opportunity there is well there is enough by me that they've actually they never split the pack they're still and I used to say 21 and then the people that do the air censuses you know he called in and he says hey sits and here you know you know you always say 21 wolves and I'm like yeah so it is at 18 it looks like 21 to me and he says no 22 plus pups I'm like he says yeah they're actually dug a permanent den now which is unusual they follow their food source so to dig a permanent den shows me that my ecosystem is changing enough that the Wolves feel they need they can stake a territory and stay there Wow it's not just everything migrates out you follow it it comes back and you follow it they feel that there is now a good enough food source that they can stay year-round in one place besides the time where they chase the bear and the bear brushed up against the tents and you know they took them out how close do they get to you yeah pretty close um back when I first started at kavik you know it was set up differently different buildings everything but the desk was in the dining hall I used to live in a corner of the dining hall and so you have a window out here on the wooden end cap and I'm doing the stuff for work and you just had a feeling something was behind you and I turn around and I'm nose to nose with the big black wolf his head was stuffed right through the window oh so I don't reach the gun and he just slipped down and ran so so he kind of had a feeling that you were gonna shoot him um or knew you need to get the hell out yeah making a move there was young was doing a shady move so he needed to get out but I don't know how long he was back there and he certainly could have chewed me up but he was as curious about me as I was about him and it seems like if they're making a den and having cub they probably have a steady supply of food yeah Pharaoh now you know am I on that food group probably do they normally go oh yeah let's find a city and start attacking people no but I'm not a city I'm an individual hmm so but like when my granddaughter when she first came up there to visit and she was six five or six and every time she got more than ten foot away here out of the riverbank the big gray wolf would start slinking and so I had to tie a rope from her to me and she couldn't get more than ten foot away and which frustrated her so I took her for a walk down to the old fox den where the little babies were and all the little bodies are there and bones are there and and the wolf had gotten in and eating them and she was all bummed out and I turned her around to walk now we had not even two minutes there and here's a wolf track about this big and I have a picture of her hand next to it and it was right in her footprint and I said okay and she says he is stalking me and I said yeah so what does that tell you I said where is he right now and then her eyes got big and all she sees his brush and I said yeah we need to get the hell out of here you are a Scooby Snack and you're carrying a gun the entire time you do oh yeah yeah you don't go anywhere without a gun nope and when the kids get up there you know I teach them with little weapons first you know they get a 410 shotgun and a 22 single action and they learn gun safety and then like my grandson this year he came up and for the first time he he got to take down a couple of caribou and feed his family you know I helped him prepare the meat and he took it back down south so my granddaughter though you know that's the difference in I have to celebrate who she is not who I am when I'm with her and after her first year there you know I asked her as I was bringing her home um I said so you're gonna come up and visit you know Nathan my grandson he's all booyah about coming back and I said so do you want to come back up and see grandma and she said well grandma you know I love you right and I'm like yeah and she says but I'm gonna go visit Uncle Jesse and aunt Megan because they do mani-pedis and they like to shop they do mani-pedis for her she's a she's a girly girl anything sparkly shiny and pink is on her hit list so I told her I said well okay you can't bum out your your brother when he gets to come up but when I do take a break I'll hook you up we'll go to Laughlin and we'll go get big-ass sunglasses drink virgin mai tais and go shopping for dresses and get mani-pedis so I have to celebrate who she is not necessarily Who I am or who I think she should write well good for you so now you live in a place that doesn't have any trees what why is that several miles above the tree line is it is that because it just gets too cold the weather's too harshly yeah I don't have soil there is no soil you have ice permanently frozen ground you have rocks on top of that maybe a little silt but that's a round rock silt is a round rock it's not soil and so it's very difficult for things to grow and with the growing season in the cold temperatures things grow very slowly so it's just it's not a climate that trees can grow in so this is an incredibly inhospitable environment to a lot of animals so why do animals live up there like what with what keeps them coming back no matter where you are on the planet whether it be a form of bacteria look at an asteroid you've got bacteria and viruses it grow why who knows life finds a way Wow and life finds a way 200 miles above the Arctic Circle I choose sites I have a hard time recognized at isolation when you can choose an isolation more like in an area where you maybe have more trees and you know you could that may be one of my next steps I mean when I want a softer easier way of life I'll go down where there's trees softer and easier is to live in the forest it's so hilarious now how to help they find you for this TV show um the creator of this show also created another show called Flying Wild Alaska and I use those pilots to fly for me and so I appeared on a couple of those episodes Sarah Palin also did a show and she came out there to hunt and now I already had a family out there at the time it's very early in the hunting season not a lot of animals around so I flung her in a little plane further out because I had an 8 10 year old girl that were hunting for the first time out there and so but they had seen me do these other shows so when he created the life below zero concept he called me says I've got this idea do you want to do it and they came out and I said well I never do anything scripted period I don't want to hear how you think it'd look cool and go do yourself I mean there's enough natural stuff that happens that's what we stick to and that's what the show does is it's I mean if we swear and go psycho I mean that shows it on TV if we poach it and don't stock enough of something well it's going to show that or if you get hurt or whatever um so anyways they did this is a real and asked me and I said alright as long as you don't ever ask me to do something stupid you know did you have any reservations about exposing yourself like this about putting yourself on television and about show showing this lifestyle I don't have any reservations about showing what I do there are some things you know privacy is privacy and I do expect a certain amount of it and I'm certainly I treasure my alone time so I can I can sometimes get an attitude about sharing that there is a trade-off you know for me doing the show and though and the premise that it does it on one of the cool things for me is you know sooner or later my numbers going to be up you know I've looked all over there's no expiration date I can find I just simply know what's coming now I may not ever get to meet my great-grandchildren but if they want to know who I was pop in a DVD they see who I really was not who they thought I was hmm so that's a pretty cool trade-off for me occasionally there there is some unique territory that comes with being in the social setting there are go to some of these sites and you know I've had people send me emails why don't you just die I hope a bear does eat you um you know it's all things well whenever people have access just any kind of access to people there's going to be a certain amount of shit I'm going to do smells like that for me there's far more people that are positive curious and it's cool to touch this kind of a lifestyle you know some people romanticize the Grizzly Adams thing and this is a way for them to experience it without having to actually really outrun a bear yeah yeah that's how I feel about that show I I don't have a desire to live a subsistence lifestyle but I really enjoy watching all these guys do it and you do it and you're the very you're very different than anybody else on the show because everybody else in the show they live in the place where there's like woods and they have a house and like you like I said you're the gangster of the gangsters like they're all pretty gangster they're all like you know there's the line buddy there's a unique set of challenges for each and every one yeah it's just such a weird way to live life and I think there's a trend that's going on right now where a lot of people feel a bit disenchanted with urban life and if you've seen the Werner Herzog documentary happy people you know it's called happy people life on the taiga a year in the taiga the taiga river in Siberia and it's about these guys who are just hunters and trappers and they live this subsistence lifestyle in Siberia and they're incredibly happy they're always joking around and smiling and laughing and that's one thing maybe on the series you don't get to see I'm a really big goofball and I laugh a lot and I dance a lot night do by yourself though yeah yeah there's there's a lot of footage because every time they do a time-lapse I I Oh what are you doing oh yeah that's been done for a little while we're just letting it run out while I go out there and I do these songs and dances and um there's one really good video that they did and but you know I swear too much so I can't go on the air but um I don't do an Internet version yeah yeah like put uncensored clips give a little warning so you know when you click on I'm pretty goofy it's like me and I'll for the hunting sequence because you know for me any of us when we go out hunting and there's a camera right behind you you know the very first episodes were learning experiences for us all you know I'm out there trying to get the ptarmigan and they're all flying away flying away and I'm you know bitches you know what the hell are they doing well I turn around here's a six-foot-something guy in a bright blue outfit going dude there are no 6-foot blueberries in the winter out here right and get it down you know but and so we've all learned but so far the hunting sequence me and my hell you know I went and got Cornish game hens and you know what kind of a trail do they leave you know big sludge and the thing so I have this whole thing where they found on the shelf so I did this whole hilarious sequence of you know hunting the Cornish hens oh and but you know I mean all of us have a unique set of challenges part of the challenge is still being in love with your lifestyle at the end of the day there's just I think the cure to this sort of aimless life that a lot of people find themselves in when they're stuck in a cubicle they're working for a company the end of the day they just go to sleep to get up again they have to do it all over again it doesn't feel like they're connected to what they're doing or they it doesn't feel like they have a passion for what they're doing and then they see people that are living the subsistence lifestyle and it has this romantic quality to it the sort of yeah well you know that society today both people are going to have to go out and work they're going to have to work a lot of hours and not raising their own children and they're eking out enough money just to pay the electric in the water and do it all over again are you living life or are you just getting through it and is that the fault of the government is that the you know I mean are you over governed I mean where is the break where's the profit margin on the company's going to fall down short enough so that the money a family makes you get your two weeks vacation you go play in the woods with your kids right now people can't do that so I think these shows go look you know these people we're governed by the same law we're just a little lawless about it yeah I think the over competitive nature of a lot of people has led us to all agree to this really ridiculous life or you're working 50-plus hours a week and you don't really have a life outside of work well I can't imagine having to set my alarm clock and punch a clock for somebody else anymore you know I don't even well I know I own a watch I don't know where I put it I lost it a few years ago um but for me in the winter you know I know when I get my first sunset again in late August I know I'm about a month before I don't see people and then I don't even worry about the clock I wake up when I'm not tired I go to sleep when I'm tired if I'm hungry I eat if I don't expend a lot of calories then I'm not hungry I don't take it in what do you do to attain yourself all throughout the the dead of the winter um so no is the gift that keeps giving you can always dig and move snow try to keep the paths open you know the outhouse is a quarter-mile away from where I'm at why would you've got to go you need to you know wait Lord forbid you get the trots cuz you got a long way to go when your Pug could be in a blizzard wait a minute your outhouse is 1/4 of a mile away for a mile away from my door that's insane so every time you go you have to go quarter-mile yep that's I mean I when nobody's there I mean I can just go outside drop my drawers and take care of business I can get a five gallon bucket and do it there because who's watching I can walk around naked all day long and the windows open you know I mean if that's what I want to do um but I'm setting the tone of my life not somebody else why is the outhouse so far well they can I'm not allowed its protected ecosystem I can't dig a hole in the ground and have you go on it because human waste is considered potentially hazardous people take chemicals they take drugs they do whatever so it has to be in a bin that is collected which I then have to separate the solids and the liquids and burn it to its lowest ash it can have an odor that some people don't like therefore you don't want it right next to the dining hall but a quarter mile is really far not when the next city is 500 miles away it's all relative right but when it's a hundred below zero then I can always grab a bucket and do it okay I know I said yeah I mean you just adjust to your own lifestyle and you don't mind the summer walking 100 you know whatever it is how many hundred yards how many hundred yards is a quarter whoa Wow well quarter of a mile is 5280 hundred that you're gonna go so five hundred yards yeah you know I don't mind that why would I I got a leg cannon on you know something jumps out at me I'm gonna jump back a leg cannon yeah what do you like a 44 Magnum I've got a couple of 44 Meg's some have shorter barrels some have longer barrels and I just got a 454 pistol so with a chest harness there's something I'm gonna be doing here in the near future where I felt I needed something a little bigger a little closer to the chest because I'm going to need hands-free what are you doing can't tell you is it the part of the show yes okay while tuning I'll watch I'll learn from that do you do you anticipate like do you have a plan of like how long you want to stay in this place or you just merely like by your feelings for me personally no I don't plan you know when I like I say Raven personality there may be something awesome that I find out about or I see or I want to do or maybe I want to go gold panning for a while I don't limit myself my vision is my own not anybody else's but because I am only there through the grace of having a lease with the state and a profitable business if that turns around or the state or anybody else says look there's been a land swap it's no longer owned by the state these people don't want you there it may be out of my control when I leave so and that's something that you know I have to reconcile I'm also not a spring chicken not that I'm the Cryptkeeper but my age and my body is starting to wear down so I need to read the signs right you know to plan yeah I mean life happens what if I what if I can't see well anymore then hunting my own meat probably ain't going to be real successful what if I break another couple bones in my body I just had some more foot surgery I've got to have the feet work down again from when I broke them I had a difficult time walking this summer so I had one procedure done and I'm going to have a couple of more what if that doesn't come back are the bones just the heel and probably a lot of scar tissue the tendons reacted poorly um the level of pain I mean I I did it for a while but I was barely you know walking so so they did I went down just to see the doctor he ended up doing surgery on both feet um so that was kind of a trip but he wants to do some more procedures to try and help the situation if it doesn't get better I have to change what I'm doing and then you also have the downtime after surgery we can't do anything for a while I didn't take downtime I couldn't afford it so I just dealt with it well um this time I'm going to try to give myself two or three days a downtime but life keeps happening weather I like it - or not I can't let all of the chores go I have to whether I like it or hate it I have to keep fueling my heat tank if I don't have fuel or oil in the heat tank I don't have heat the longest I've gone without heat up there is two months and I just covered up in all my winter gear and waited for a fuel delivery two months and my time of the year was this that was in January February the coldest time for us and it was not pleasant and I didn't enjoy it and I don't necessarily ever want to do it again if I have to I have to but I don't want to but you don't know what's going to be thrown at you what if uh what if a blizzard sends something you know somebody dropped a pop can on the tundra and I don't know about it in a eighty hundred mile an hour breeze that's going to become a missile that might take out my tent so I have to have several places another tent that I can go to and live in that gets taken out trailer that I can live in and you also still get to those tents so you have to be able to make our house Wow but to get through the eight foot deep snow you tie your ropes you can tie it to the roof line you can tie it to the bottom and you wear snowshoes and just walk on the top of it uh you know when when an emergency happens you don't get to pick what you're wearing why don't get through it all but deepest snow though it depends on the type of snow if it's hard pack you walk on top of it if it's soft you swim Wow so swim through the snow how much has changed since you've been doing this television show it has the attention of the show changed your lifestyle in any way has it changed how you you interact with the people that are coming into your camp um no I mean I am Who I am uh you know I smoke cigars will single-malt and swear a lot um it doesn't change who I am the basic needs of the camp are set now some people I don't have a lot of people that come in just because of the show kavik is extremely remote the dollar value it takes to get to me precludes some people from being able to do it um but there has to be some crazy dude out there that's in love with you there Sartre is that what you're getting eczema gay yeah there was a there was one that showed up this year and actually for a couple of years I've been trying to set up you know and it was you know bringing the family out to hunt whatever and then it was like ah they can't make it can I still come out well yeah it's gonna cost us much you know assign their room to him I'm busy working come in and this person had moved into I call my personal building the twinky it's long yellow and filled with goodness right so I come in and here's this dude laying in my bed and has decided that you know we're in love and and he had his old thing going on in his head and he got very upset when I told him to get the hell out and he laid hands on me put his hands here and was holding the knife so I had the gun on my hip and put it in his chest and said you just brought a knife to a gunfight you lose why so Wow military people some of the seals were there and they held the guy I called the plane and kicked him out that's it just kick him out yeah why don't you feed him to a bear seems like that'd be the best way to get rid of him I wouldn't want that guy coming back fucked I'm not well got a knife yeah all of the bush companies have an Ono list and they know this person or that person or this nobody flies in unless they ask me right and then and the troopers know that should I feel threatened I I'm not gonna shoot for the kneecaps I'm gonna take them out does anybody keep tabs in this fella I don't know that's a bad human being it should just fed him to the parish yeah you know that's not my my gig is just getting him out yeah you know um it was a it's like anything you neutralize the threat kick him out chances are um I mean they got to live with themselves and they're probably not going to want to embarrass themselves again so now people have an amazing ability to distort reality in their head to the point where it it's not living with themselves arrest the world's I get interesting females sometimes and Men in prison seem to find me awfully sexy and none of them they're all innocent I'll tell you that bad they're like if I just get out I could live with her yeah he's done 27 years of four consecutive life sentences for killing his wives he didn't do it how many wives four wives killed all four of them that well he didn't do it obviously yeah he's been framed but barely um he and I belong together and uh whenever you know it's a don't marry him and I think you'd be good you know conjugal visits probably not gonna happen yeah no no marriage to say listen you seem to be killing wives yeah kee this relationship let's just keep the tonic yeah do you you know you could do your own show like really easily like you know I mean I enjoy the show life below zero but you're such a powerful personality it's all I mean I guarantee there's a lot of people that are just like fuck all the rest these people I want to find out what Sue's up to all day he is such a very rare human yeah it's probably a good thing for some people that you're rare yeah I don't know why not you know we could be all right with a bunch of you running around I mean it probably wouldn't happen but you know if you thought about doing your own version or another show that just kind of entirely focuses on you you know that's not something I would think about that would be something that a network might present they must be like looking at you and realizing that this is this incredible personality that's attached I know you probably like to think about yourself that way but no I like you know people say there are some people that say oh my gosh you're a star and I don't know I'm just a fat chick you know living on the tundra you know I mean don't put yourself on a pedestal unless you like falling from high places sooner or later a honey booboo is around the corner and you're done so if you put yourself on a pedestal that's a pretty big you know yeah no I agree but I just think you know you obviously enjoy some aspects of being on the show otherwise you would have told them to fuck off I do occasionally you know we all go through our diva moments um so you do kick them out sometimes we have butted heads a few times and I have I call it putting them in timeout and I just locked myself in the Twinkie and I don't know you know but they've they've been very very respectful occasionally it's too much social time for me and I have to I have to get my alone time just to get it back in perspective and how much time did they spend filming do they only come in the summer are they only there for a couple months out of the year know throughout the year because if you notice there are winter episodes and then there are summer episodes so throughout the year they're very respectful they call and they say hey what are you up to for i don't know until like you know from now until the 25th of November well I'm going to do this this and this and this is going to happen and fuck I didn't get that done well hey do you think we can come and cover this and this and this and I don't know I want to do this by myself because I might bomb hit it don't need that Andre on the air but um you know I go yeah we knew this that'd be cool yeah you can tag along and so they're they're respectful of asking me what am i doing do I mind having company and and let's get it together so there's no real set shooting schedule it's essentially do they decide like and Rhys let's say Kate and Andy maybe doing something you know everybody else's location is vastly different temperatures and you know than I am I'm way up there right so my winter is much much longer my freeze up is much much different they may break up before I do so I mean we all have to be given the respect of our individual areas and in the show does that that's amazing well listen you got to get out of here I know you get some other stuff to do but thank you so much for doing this I really appreciate it I really enjoy you on the show and I just think you're awesome thank you so much love talk of you okay for the terrible I would love to I would love to and everybody you could follow sushis on Twitter it's sue Aikens on Twitter and the show is also on Twitter life below zero TV thank you so much that was awesome you
