yes it's true that the new Joe Rogan experience studio will have a desk that has meow written into it in metal dam that's how we roll bitches dan troll deep and we hire craftsman having shit constructed right now I've made out of old we reused farm wood the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by many many things ladies and gentlemen because this shit all cost money and I'm trying to get paid yo I'm saying one of the things were brought by is a fucking badass new cell phone company called ting and what ting is it's they use the Sprint network so it's not like they have three towers in the whole country now they have a fucking major network they use a sprint network and they make shit really simple they cut out all the BS that is normally involved in having a cell phone like for instance you don't have to have a contract you know to pay if you cancel like this weird shit that happens when you get a cell phone it's weird it's not like buying gas you can't say we don't want to use your gas anymore so I'm not gonna give you any more money no you somehow know they got roped into some weird thing where you got to continue to give the money and if you don't want to give them money anymore you've got to give them extra money three hundred fifty dollars usually fuck kind of bullshit is that that's nonsense that should be illegal and what ting does is they take it upon themselves to try to create a moral business a business that that's fair a business that makes sense no contracts no bundling of ride-alongs services no overage charge if you use a certain amount of cell phone minutes per month and you don't use like all of your minutes they roll over into the next month how the way it should be broken ting calm that's where you want to go and you'll save 50 bucks off of any smart phone they have some dope phones especially the one that I got from them is the samsung galaxy s3 and it is a fucking bad-ass I love it especially for looking at pictures and looking at websites it's enormous man screen is gorgeous is it better than iPhone it's not better it's different it's bigger security it's bigger screen know that that part's better for sure but I really am so used to the Apple operating system that it would be hard for me to say what's better and what's worse and by the way I kept the BlackBerry for a long oh I hung in there dude I took a body shot I saw people cling to them I saw Mike Young last night using a blackberry it's probably reminding himself of the old jokes he's got written on it's blackbirds this side sorry Mike John Mike you know I love him sort of I do love him he's a great guy he's a great human being yes yes I just give me I give everybody shit about their act you know if you're telling the same jokes for ten years someone should give you shit and you should snap out of it I think that's for all of us don't you think Duncan yes but other than that my tongue is awesome dude he's very funny - very funny a person what are you doing with that noise getting crazy I like what you're doing tripping you out you aren't tripping me out how I get setting the stage so go to Rogan ting calm and find out more find out the technical shit that I can't tell you and see all the different phones that are available lots of different Android phones are available and even like regular phones leave if you're crazy one of those nutty dudes or likes one of those flip Dana White's one of those nutty dudes he's got like flip phone got a little flip phone that's how they all had them in Japan remember dude in Japan they all had high-tech flip yeah it's totally different though but still if King as you say is creating a situation where you don't have to have a contract mhm and they have cheap phones they're great that's called prank central yeah that means I can just pop in there and get a phone for a month and then put that in my friend's trunk or in a briefcase so they think they found some government phone and then randomly call them fuckers fuck you yes the fuck is wrong with you why would you think to use it like that especially in the middle of a fucking commercial dad that helps sell teen phones yeah - cunts what's wrong with pranks I think the UFOs are landing now that's really anyway back to the commercial go to Brogan tang calm and check out all that shit we're also brought to you by desk want TV what does desk want TV desk want TV is the website of Brian Redman he was the first one to put a website up that represents what what des quad is is our little family of fuckheads that's us we're the des quad long story anyway it's if you go to des quad TV you can buy a desk want t-shirt and we see them at so many of these these shows that we do and it's it's badass to say you know so many people were in these silly fucking shirts go to DES quad TV and you can pick them up there's also stickers for sale and news of all upcoming tour dates a lot of guys are starting to do a little mini road trips and I know Brian's got one coming up in Columbus Ohio yeah with Brendon Walsh and Tony Hinchcliffe and a special guest I can't tell you about who's pretty fuckin badass so I'm going to Vancouver that's not you bitch it's not all about you okay about you motherfucker it's not all about him I'm in the middle of a commercial for Brian like I'm doing somewhere to you man just get the program Joe you should be happy though somebody got another death squad tattoo this makes it I think the 15th one and check this out it's the new cat that the one that you like so much oh wow that's good that's a really good version that's Zach that is fucking creepy as shit isn't it and I can't even tell what part of his body because it looks like it's very thick it's clearly as dick yeah it's you know what is that not a hardcore pores going on there some vegetables we're also brought to you by Annette calm that's onn IT and Anna calm is essentially a supplement company all for high-end athletic supplements and what we call nootropics and what nootropics are is far more complicated for a retard like myself to be describing and would really seem hypocritical if I had some alpha brain with my beer is it not go there I don't think it does you really freak me out kid no I don't think it goes a beer Brian um Duncan excuse me no I don't think it'sit's nutritional and alcohols like the opposite of nutritional all right dude if you go to a calm onn IT you can check out all the different supplements that are available all of them are things that I have used extensively before we ever got involved in the company it's all stuff that I believe in anything that I ever sell you on this silly fucking show one thing I can guarantee is if I say something even if I'm incorrect I believe it I'll never tell you anything I don't believe and if I find out that I'm wrong I'll tell you that and if I use something and I tell you to use something it's because it's a really solid product period that goes all the way back to the fleshlight ladies and gentlemen very underrated product flashlights right just because I encouraged you to play a little piano in the background doesn't mean you can have fucking aliens landing on my head you're freaking me out man the newest things we have at on it are hemp force which is this new delicious protein powder it's the best tasting protein powder in the world it's fucking fantastic it's made out of hemp which is hard to get an illegal in this country Duncan Trussell illegal I know they've truck even though it doesn't even get you high that's a good answer to the question that inevitably comes to these poor folks that have to get drug tested at work you know we don't none of them like if you if you eat hemp protein powder you will not test positive for THC but if you eat poppy seed bagels you will test positive for heroin so you got to be careful about that which is really crazy but it is true they tell you not to eat poppy seed bagels before you go in for a drug does does that mean that you could take enough poppy seed bagels and extract heroin out of them do not no I don't think so I think it's just a confusion in your system because I think oh the urine tests that they use just register metabolites and it's just the same metabolites apparently I don't know I don't really understand it I don't think so I don't think you can get high from pot I don't think you could just you can't shoot up a bag all day can't imagine if that's what why the the appeal of bagels that poppy seeds were just super mild hair yes you know and you see it in the morning and just feel everything feels so good I hate how poppy seeds don't digest fully so like when you're wiping out all these little seeds flying all over your hands yeah they're kind of tricky well people have been arrested for having those seeds on them when they go to like the Middle East and lately strict drug countries because their seeds of like set off alarms and those fucking remember those things that they use for a little while that would push dust off of you blow they don't use those anymore noticed stop using those because dudes we're going to jail for fucking poppy seeds in other countries fuck that's just my composition anyway hemp force will not make you test positive it's just the plant and it is a it's a it's not psychoactive at all even though it's completely completely illegal yet legal it's really weird it's totally legal to have it's totally legal to sell but you can't grow in here you have to grow somewhere else it's really a fucking it's it's cool it's clear corruption and it's clearly the pharmaceutical drug companies controlling agriculture and controlling our access to one of the greatest plants the world has ever known for whatever fucking goofy-ass reason our government has let this go in place and even though they know that this hemp plant even though it's related to marijuana it has no psychoactive properties you cannot get high from it but it has an amazing source of protein amazing source of amino acids you can make essential oil out of it you can make fuel out of it you can build houses with it it's really unbelievable that hemp is illegal but it is so we have to buy it from Canada but it's legal to have it once you get it once you fucking let somebody else grow it it's it's so crazy it's just one more giant piece of evidence that we're fucked but if you go to on accom that's onn i.t you can get yourself some hemp course it's yummy it's it's not it doesn't have it's got one gram of sugar per serving one I think yeah something whatever small amount is and it's all stevia that it's sweetened with so it's sweetened with natural sweeteners and it's yummy as fuck and it's got maca and it's also got a raw cocoa in it so go to on attack comment so and anti T all right get some battle ropes in your system we got kettlebells battle robes do a lot of man shit Duncan Trussell and if you use the codename Rogan you will save 10% off any and all supplements alright freaks Duncan Trussell here let's get the party the Joe Rogan experience a lot of times you know someone you know someone for a long time and you go wow this is a fucking weird cat man I never met anybody like him and you never get it you're like what is this dude is not like anybody ever I wonder how this guy grew up and then you go to the town where they grew up and you go oh okay okay okay okay okay I just got a huge piece of the Duncan Trussell puzzle this weekend in Asheville North Carolina Asheville is so awesome I don't want to tell people about Asheville because I'm scared they're gonna move there I know I'm scared they'll move there and fuck that place up it's crazy I mean it's grown so fast already man it's unbelievably beautiful it's it's the whole thing is so ridiculous you've got this incredibly gorgeous landscape all around you everywhere these intense green mountains and then there's a super cool people in this town where you can walk around everywhere and you're like whoa it's like it's like they took the best parts of Austin and moved it to the North Carolina exactly right that's the perfect description it's like southern cool people but it's like freebasing Austin if that's possible he's really clean lining it oh yeah it's Austin in an in a needle shoved right into your dick but dude you didn't get to walk around there's all these new shops I went to there's a tea room there where like you like there's just it's like Oh opium den with blankets everywhere I'm you people with their shoes off sitting like reading poetry and it's fucking cool that place is so weird it's weird it's awesome though it was awesome the show was awesome hanging out with the people there was awesome thanks to my friend Sam for hooking me up taking care of us out there it was uh that the whole place was just so strange it's like what a crazy little town it's so small you know it's so small and cool and like everything I I just loved everything about it it's like it's like if Occupy Wall Street turned into a city no it's not because it's not as complainy that's true but it is filled with I mean it is filled with subversive folks it's there's a lot there's a lot of people there who are apparently in the environmental Liberation Front Oh God eco-terrorists perhaps or anything out there oh my god you should probably not say that on the air dude I think you're doing the government's work I think people oh yeah it'd be really hard to figure out there might be eco-terrorist there I saw none writing down the fucking Street on some giant tricycle chases guys on the phone that wasn't a nun that was a chick who's gonna go fuck her boyfriend and he wanted her to come over dressed like a nun that's what that was that's a girlfriend yeah that's a great girlfriend that stuff wasn't coming to my house on a tricycle dressed as a nun I'm warning but there were a few churches there so maybe it is you know I think religion is I've never been to one place that has no religion look even a Boulder Boulder is pretty pretty liberal intelligent you know sort of left-wing II kind of a place that plenty of churches my friend just sent me this thing I haven't listened to it yet on this debate that they did as to whether or not the world would be a better place if religion did not exist and it's like a like these are professional debaters and intellectuals I can't remember what it's like on NPR or something but the end result was they decided you have the world's better without religion would have been much better if yeah they say that but yes and no you know it's like I think the religion serves as an operating system for a lot of people and if they didn't have religion you'd have to explain shit to them and that could get so tiresome it would get so tiresome to sit around with some blundering moron you know pontificating on what it means to have a finite life in an infinite universe and what what what part of you know this part of this experience you really do play what part do you play and what what is your consciousness all about and why are you so scared of its shutting off yeah those are very terrifying questions for the average person and you know maybe like you know maybe some ditch-digger dude doesn't need to know that maybe there's some dudes who have some I I believe there's people that have brains that work way better than mine I've seen it I've talked to people that I'd look it's not just a matter of education it's a matter of some people are gifted you know there's some people have little tiny hands and then there's people that are built like Shaquille O'Neal and he could grab them and crush them and it's not fair it doesn't make any sense but it's just the way it is and I think that there's some people that are there living in this life as humans but yet they're not quite human they're like just below human like you talk to them and you like so uh so what do you think happens when you die well man for sure you go to heaven and you get to be with Jesus well I believe this since I was a child and you're talking to them and you know there's like a weird disconnect with a person like they they talk and it's not not even that they're they're not it's like this I've met some really intelligent Christians don't get me wrong it's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is there's certain people that are just really dumb and they really aren't capable of thinking about deep shit they're not capable of pondering the really insane question of what the fuck this life is they're not capable of it so religion I've always felt was like a nice scaffolding for people like that it lets them experience all of the benefits of being a positive person and being a giving and loving person you know we also experience those benefits you know it's just there they're teaching them to do it in the the way that it's it's transcribing the wishes of some holy master who created you and I said it once I'm not fucking saying it again write it down this is what you do do it or else you go to hell it's like it's almost like it's structured to make the idiots like have a really simple moral path like it gives you a nice little story to explain the really weird but real complexities of love and positive thinking and and how it shapes lives and your intention shapes lives in your imagination shapes your life and how this thing is malleable and it's it's not understood this life that we're living is simply not understood that's too fucking weird for some people they're not gonna they can handle that that's not getting in there that that's going to their ear and bouncing off like it hit a fuckin trampoline so for some people religion allows them to be on a good path it allows them to you know to do good and to experience the result of that even though they're doing it you know because of some fictional character it's like they're still doing the same they're doing the correct things it's like when religion gets nutty when you get into like the Inquisition or stabbing cartoon makers because they drew your guy when religion goes completely off the tracks like that that's when it becomes a problem but I think that's not the majority of religious people I think the majority of religious people probably benefit from it in a sense of a community for sure you know churches are a big part of neighborhoods and communities you know it's a big part of how people interact with each other and if you could find something that was a religion where you know it made sense to you if it was a logical religion it actually would probably be a good thing to be a part of because you're what you're doing is you're committing your family and you're committing all the families around you that are all in the sort of community together to take part in some sort of journey of spiritualism can I play devil's advocate literally sure against religion so because I agree with you but I think that the problem is that it creates a not only a structure where people can sort of rest and have a cool system that they're not going to come up with on their own but obviously the the danger of all that is that certain unscrupulous human beings have figured out that if they put on the right costume they can convince dopes to give them cows suck their dick take gold because all they have to say is and they're like they're the priests and religious leaders become like gods agents like CAA for God where they're like yes I'm taking the calls for God I'll tell you what God wants and yeah God wants you to blow me conveniently and I don't know why cuz he's crazy so he wants you to suck my dick and he wants seven of your cows I don't even know why I like Scout and he would like 10% of everything you make for the rest of your life that's what he said I just don't kill the messenger that's what he said we're not gonna put it on paper I just want you to continue to pay that yeah that's not even on paper right when you tithe it's not like you know this is like written somewhere well you have to give 10% of your money right isn't that something but just people just do I don't know if there's a scriptural thing that says 10% I think it's something that just sort of seems like a logical number but I remember that oh so a couple of years ago in India and in a temple they like opened up at the vaults in the temple they hadn't opened it up or they found some vaults and it was just filled with gold just filled with fucking gold and you know everyone around the temple was in awe for all this money but when you really think about what that goal came from it came from hypnotized people who believed that these priests were in some way representing God and then the gold didn't even go anywhere it mouldered in the basement of a fucking temple Wow so it's so when you see that there's that level of exploitation that happens and like you you retweeted that amazing YouTube video of the guy whose job it is to suck the freshly circumcised kids cock and he's explaining why religion that's in my that's the guy in my act people think that that's fake that's a really is real I couldn't believe it do you I did think you were exaggerating I couldn't believe that that's a an actual yeah well it's not only that he was justifying it he was justifying it by quoting the pages it says in page 60 full chapters oh he's going through all this nonsense with his fucking wizard outfit on its goofy ass beer yeah and he's explaining where it says it's okay to suck that baby's daddy's piece he's so completely lost his objectivity that he is actually trying to a explain why this is necessary not just it's a I think there's a distinction to make between that dick that baby dick it's not just a baby's dick it's a bleeding baby sick a screaming baby's dick and you know like I say in when the the bit about it that I do in my act like how the fuck do we know that that kid can't remember that we're just assuming this because he can't talk and he you know that he doesn't have a way to express how much it sucks that you cut his dick and start sucking on it but for sure you don't know whether or not that baby can remember that that seems like a really traumatic moment and I remember some intensely traumatic moments from when I was young so I would think that would be something that would fucking haunt the back year brain for the rest of your life some old creepy asshole speaking in a dead language and sucking your dick while he's wearing a wizard cost your bloody dick your dick did he just mutilate freshly slashed dick while your parents don't even save you your parents let this stupid Johnson hangin yeah they're paying to to get this dummy to fucking cut your bloody dick how would I suck it I just had my mom on my podcast and I was like what did well how did it go when I came out of the your pussy did they circumcise me right then did they cut it off then and she's like yeah yeah I can't she said it was sometime around there she's like she's like but you didn't like it you cried she's just crying like no shit I cried you snipped off the tip of my car it's so crazy it's everybody's mutilated you know the majority of Americans are mutilated and it's a weird thing with people where they don't want to admit that this is like like it's really kind of people you're so exaggerating rogue and fucking relax mutilating that's really what it is see like skin is there to protect the tip your dick don't you think uncircumcised macaques in porn look weird no I don't Duncan the skin is supposed to protect the tip of your dick and your dick is supposed to be like glisteny like mucousy it's supposed to be like super sensitive but instead they hack that shit off and the tip your dick dries out like it's not supposed to be dry like that it's supposed to be moist like inside a woman's vagina that's what your dicks supposed to be like and it's supposed to feel better that way because of that because of its it's like moist and like slippery and then there's this nonsense that people are pushing it's all been disproven by science about AIDS people are saying that it's like to protect people from AIDS like that is one of the craziest ideas I have ever fucking heard is that somehow another extra foreskin dick skin is gonna protect you if you fucker guys got AIDS like that is one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard like you gonna fuck that guy man he's got AIDS like to time circumsized oh well go go fuck away go hit it buddy like the neck is not protecting you from aids there's no fucking way that protects you from aids that's ridiculous but we we won justify doing it we want to justify that it was done to us and we were in denial about it you're you're hacking off a piece of a little kid's dick and there's no science for it whatsoever it's craziness and the majority of people do it how many pounds of baby foreskin meat gets generated a year enough to feed like a couple dogs for life right couple bears yeah think about all the babies being born and just chop chop chop screaming if you could put together all the babies being born coming out of pussies all at once and getting their dicks circumcised all together and one screaming mass if we have a dubstep music video I think it would I think you are under estimating the amount of force can meet its Genesis feed like yeah but like I have fell into his um hog hog ate him the Hogs ate them yeah pigs are a motherfucker man pigs are a motherfucker they're so scary big fat stupid animals that will eat you if you fall on their pay anything yeah there are 700 pounds yeah this they just started chewing on ah I bet there's a quick death that well they they fucked him up man you know they ate most of them before the the people even found like the guy went missing for a few hours and by the time they got there he was disemboweled they had just eaten the shit out of them well they yeah they couldn't even find him yeah most of them was missing it's really scary what a pig could do to you it's like the tibetan sky ritual with both yeah well pigs are even better than that you don't even have to mash up the bones that do it for you they'll take care of everything the pigs are uh you know they're responsible for more deaths per year than any other livestock that's crazy when you think about like bowls but no pigs are responsible for more deaths I had no idea yeah pigs are fucking for a wild pig especially wild pigs are really creepy that just doesn't go through my list of ways I might die you've never seen the the pig show pig man yeah I go goes pig hunting dude it is one of the craziest shows that I've ever seen on television okay it's a guy named Pigman and he lives in South Texas and the pig the wild pig problem in South Texas is like roaches in Manhattan I mean it is bananas you can't fucking believe how many pigs there are and they're huge and they're wild pigs it's what happens with pigs is a pig when they leave the it's really weird when they leave captivity within three weeks their body changes their snout starts to grow longer their hair gets thicker and bushier their fangs their tusks grow longer it's really weird like they physically morph and it starts in just three weeks as soon as they have to fend for themselves as soon as the foods not continually delivered to them so you keep them in like this fetus form when you continually deliver food to them when you see pigs you see them they're fat and they're lazy and they're just laying around and we just stuff them and overstuff them and then eventually slaughter them that they do not even remotely resemble wild pigs wild pigs are motherfuckers dude and they will attack you like this one in this one show this guy shot a wild pig with two arrows and it didn't kill it and the thing charged them from the bushes and he's unloading a pistol into it blam-blam-blam-blam as the thing rushes him a death run it's with tusks and there are hundreds of pounds three four five hundred pounds wild pigs and they're everywhere there are millions of them in Texas so this guy pig man and Ted Nugent get a helicopter and they're flying around in a helicopter shooting these pigs out of the sky shooting them from the sky it's it's insane they killed 200 pigs you know in a one-hour show it's amazing the different lives people are having yes it is this guy is just fuckin up pigs all day what'd he call shankam all motion I'm here to shank them sees he's his shank and swine it is just like this heavy-duty southern you know good old boy from South Texas it's a funny fucking it's a funny fucking show man like you know when you play video games and when you're going to bed if you played video games too much you kind of see him on the back of your eyes have you ever done that yes this guy when he goes to bed he just sees pigs in it from a helicopter chevy shooting and shooting pig do they shoot him with assault rifles I mean it's crazy it's they're swooping around this helicopter oh yeah yeah so why not grenades because they're actually gonna use the meat oh I see they give the meat to foreign foreign they give the meat to poor people they send me to Iraq Afghanistan yeah that's how we really get at them we bro we import pigs cuz to Muslims that's what seaport law if we imported these 500-pound murdered fucking hogs murdered from the sky death from above they do it to like Apocalypse Now director Dodge and it's called the pork lips pork lips now that's is it is that it is a fucking insane show um so there are no pigs in Iran that's a good question I don't know I do not know I know they're not supposed to eat them if it's a Muslim country right I mean you would offend a lot of people if you were eating them yeah because they eat their own shit is that what it is yeah that's part of gorilla filthy donee correct every rose bush meat that's where patient zero starts gross you ate bad gorillas one night then you get AIDS there's some people eating things in Africa right now what do you think that aids Grill it tasted like not good tasted like old feet Jim feat yeah they were hungry it tastes like a cadaver oh yeah it's fun it's got to be very human like dirty was that more gamey than humans though what did that gorilla do to get AIDS hey where did the grill somebody probably fucked it it's probably when you introduced like human we're gonna find out that all this shit boils down to somebody had a fucking animal somewhere all of it we're we're swine flu come from Wow funny thing about pigs they'll just let you fuck them so people started getting swine flu chicken flu chicken fire you know that's the thing about flus a lot of people don't know a lot of them are bird flus they're these flus a lot of them they come from farms yeah they come from these crazy places where you stuff a million animals on three acres and you know it smells like death and that's where diseases come from it's really weird Farms are fucking creepy man like like like cattle farms whether they butcher cows we went and did a fear factor on one of them I got to tell you about this other guy on fear factor too it goes with what we were talking about earlier about religion remind me but we went to this thing we had to do this slaughterhouse episode it was a fucked up show man where we gave these people it was like a bathtub of blood and they had to dunk their head in and pull out these rings they had to grab them with their face and pull out these rings and they were just covered in blood and one guy was he couldn't do it he was cold water the water would end up the blood rather it was really cold it had to be 38 degrees because otherwise it can go bad and then people get sick so we had to change the blood for every person I think that's polite yeah well that's I think we had to do it for like health reasons I forget but and remember being super super cold so anyway this guy starts going nuts and smashing the blood like the Hulk and screaming and this guy had been in the parking lot before the show had been talking in his sideview mirror looking at a side of amira going you are a winner you know you are going to press ahead nothing will stop you cannot quit so this guy had some like serious like hang-ups in his mind with failure when it comes to I don't understand you say he's smashing the blood yeah yeah yeah well like the Hulk like here's a big bathtub full of blood and he's gonna like this splattering all over everybody and him and he's soaked in blood screaming and he was a big guy he was a big dude he's like a football player and I'm looking at this guy I'm like if this guy wants to kick my ass like this might be a real problem like this is a big dude like this guy would like you know he's like a fucking physically strong guy like if you once kick your ass the very least someone's getting hurt he's gonna be gonna be some chaos and I'm looking around with these fucking camera man they're all skinny guys smoking cigarettes most of them were completely out of shape a lot of them are older guys were like back problems like no one's gonna save me who's gonna save me if this guy goes bananas that is fucking yeah this dude right here yep apparently he was a really nice guy and he felt real bad about his performance on the show and he just said that he was having some issues and he had had it like with like other sports in the past yeah it was insane it was insane by the way I don't even remember this I'm watching this and I don't even remember it I barely remember it Dante's Inferno man that's demonic we did a hundred and forty-eight of these fucking things can you believe that next shirt what a ridiculous job I had I'm screaming at these people giving them tell them they can do it this guy right here what are you doing psyching yourself up it's a story that goes back to my football coach and he said little eyes upon you you know a little kids watching you all the time and the man in the class with yourself in the mirror when you're done and you say good job that's what I want to do you go home and you can't look at yourself I don't want that man all right well you're gonna be looking at yourself in the mirror with a big fat face full of blood what's gonna happen now you gonna send Joseph home I'm gonna do my best buddy I can't put my head in there and then go home and have people say man you did that for now all right Josh were you ready ready you beat 19 joseph goes home and you move on in 3 2 1 go so he quit like right away and see how he's screaming punching the blood it's so nasty look at that and he couldn't do it screaming shaking shaking his face see everybody else just went in there he's totally quitting and that now here's Lee starts freaking out good instincts broken you really back yeah I saw that blood coming it's just so ridiculous that's anymore no I don't think so okay you know I noticed how much different my voice sounds before I got my nose fixed yeah I had a nasally sort of thing going on I had no nose for most of my life when I got a deviated septum operation completely changed my life man I can't believe I went so long I have friends that have like fucked up noses I'm like do please get your nose fixed just please listen to me get your nose fixed your whole life you could be like you know talk like this here you realize it you know your whole life you get this fucking thing that's blocking up air did you hear about that millionaire that did so much cocaine that yeah his fucking nose exploded did not collapse here's here's us here's his nose he's like looks like Boss Hogg now oh damn this what smell just go down Jesus Christ look at that fucking nose all right whatever you using windows on yeah I did know somebody that did so much cocaine that his nose in between the nostrils like made a hole in between the two nostril you got to do a lot of comedy yeah that's like a goddamn commitment do you think it collapsed all at once like one night he woke up and it was like that or at overtime that guy's an ugly fuck and he doesn't give a shit anyway he's just trying to get my dick shot and get my coke he's one of those I get my coke ah look at him the other dude that uh I want to talk about that one fear factor one a million dollars and he was gonna tie that he's he's gonna give them ten percent to his church and the dude started talking in tongues he was talking in tongues like he was like Shalom al mallamma I saw Leah yeah glossolalia glossolalia yeah just how long mallamma yeah yeah they start talking in like see if you could put that up pull that up man fear factor guy speaks in tongues it was so bizarre actually he won he won he won a million bucks so maybe the dude just believed in himself so much because of all this that you know he forced the victory well you know where that speaking of tongues comes from right no after the Jesus our Lord died he his disciples were all gathered together and some like hiding out and like I think he appeared to them or the doors open and a wind blew through and suddenly they were able to speak in every language and they all started speaking in all the languages of the world that's the myth so Pentecostal churches they will try to induce this state you know I know you've seen it and they handle rattlesnakes too because that was the other thing he gave them power to take up serpents so they say they have these rituals they handle rattlesnake so what do they do they get bit a little bit they they get bitten and they die dude look up Pentecostal snake handling you've never seen that Rogen you've never seen snake handlers I've seen snake dance around they dance around with the snakes up in the mountains there's a guy whose father died he was a snake handler and then he just died really recently who was one of those those snake handler guys oh man that is just the fucking worst man that is the worse that's so creepy it's such the opposite of what that religion it's so weird that Christianity managed to mutate into like malnourished country people talking in fake languages and holding snakes you're gonna Sunday that's fucking weird man yeah it's very weird it's so strange how religion can mutate cuz like if you look at that versus Catholicism it's two completely different things yeah this is from just from a serpent handling pastor dies from rattlesnake fight bite just like his father yeah yeah he's in West Virginia holla his faith wasn't strong is that what they think they think that like their faith failed and that's why the snake bit amar we did some traveling through West Virginia and got to just see some really bizarre places like one of them was a bar that was a house it was a house and then the the downstairs was a bar I mean it was just they had like a plastic sign that said bar and I mean it was a fucking house it was like somehow another they had converted their house into a bar it was so bizarre and then right next door was always a church and then there was always a strip club it was strip club sure bars chip Club Church bar that's all you had weird shit goes on in those hollers Joe in the in a city next to where my mom lives this guy fucking hacked up his dad bits and threw his limbs on the Blue Ridge Parkway it was like just up in the woods he was like threw his head into the forest and then his arm somewhere and then it's an arm somewhere I bet he wasn't a good dad that was I don't know I asked my mom's like yeah the dad's probably I realized I had the exact same thing where I blame the dad but she's like no it wasn't that you know the kid was just fucking crazy yeah yeah I mean you know I regardless of how bad a dad you are I don't know if you deserve to have your limbs chopped off maybe well there are relentless yeah for 20 years you deserve 20 years straight he just managed to crawl away to the ass trying to get to the eggs for 20 years so you just never lost your hard-on and develop those strengths just from resisting ass rape man but that fucking goddamn idea that people just walk from time to time dismember each other it's really strange that they're you know in the same way that what's-his-name flies around blast and pigs you also know that at this very moment multiple limbs are being hacked off in a variety of basements and back rooms and for us like definitely more than like 50 people at this very moment are probably getting their arms chopped off it wolf how about this how about think about all the people in different parts of the world that have to walk around on the ground knowing that their killing machine flying over their sky everyday and any point in time you could be the wrong place at the wrong time and a Hellfire missile comes out of one of these fucking flying killer robots and yeah annihilates a house that you're standing next to Predator drones that shit's intense and when you think about the fucking future we've talked about this but I don't think we've talked about this on the podcast which is that when you see those goddamn quadrocopters that can fly in perfect formations yeah and then you see those dogs that they've used that what's that dog called you know the other robot dog because people don't understand that if they can make that thing that size they can make it bigger yeah they can make that thing real fucking big so that you've got truck-sized robot dogs lumbering into your village opening up slats that quadrocopters fly out of blast everyone in the village is you know cremate them or whatever suck them into the dog and walk away that could be the future of warfare it's like a Trojan horse a Trojan horse filled with quadrocopters yeah that's completely possible and not not even remotely outside the realm of possibility because where do you think that they're they're learning how to build these robots it's DARPA yeah DARPA is creating these that that robot dog what is DARPA stand for that's a good question DARPA gives me that fucking creeps every time I see any DARPA related thing it's always spooky Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency oh Jesus yes okay that what is scary cunts scary cunts yeah crazy they're just finding new ways to fuck people up yeah that's what they do you know it's it's funny how we always like to call it defense how much money we're gonna spend on defense yeah it seems pretty offensive our offense budget yeah it's our offense budget really shit like robot dogs come on son those things are fucking terrifying robot dogs you can't kick over they get back yeah Brian pull up one of those DARPA robot that just came yeah I'm looking at it right now on the DARPA website it is horrific man the sound it makes that kind of hell's squeals it makes [Music] dude this thing is terrifying it goes uphill oh I'm looking at this video before Bryan pulls it up and it doesn't even seem real it looks like CGI this thing is walking up hills it can negotiate over rocks and terraces and it's built like a bowl do you think they can make that the size of a bus yeah fuck yeah they could DARPA leg squad support system how'd you get to that video I went to DARPA comm and then what you click on DARPA they have there's a little image of it you see in the look the lower right-hand corner yeah and then the lower left it looks like a dog running at you that's it click on that I love the way you figured out how to embed advertising into your podcast we know you're sponsored by DARPA job I'm not sponsored by robot dogs you can't buy that doesn't even make sense would it use coupon code we're gonna start by look at this fucking thing man that's like a giant robot bull imagines this thing had machine guns yeah and and then rocket ports Julie this thing's coming over the hill Chucho shooting mrs. fucking stories one of those things is coming over there 300 of those Yanks coming up oh if they build one of these motherfuckers they're gonna build a million the sound of 300 of those things at once is the last thing a lot of people are gonna hear this music is creeping me out I want to hear this thing Brian I want to hear the noise it makes hold on imagine 300 locusts they're playing follow the leader now it can follow oh they follow each other holy shit like it's got a face in there dude that is not if this thing's following him that's what follow the leader is oh my god they're calling it follow the lead or not chase you and hunt you down isn't that cute they call it follow the leader oh that's so sweet it's follow the leader look at this thing it's line artists this fucking goddamn terrifying Oh fine they can dance oh my god look at the scanners on them and shit reading what's in front of them this is so scary that is so holy really fuck shit whoo yeah that's some spooky shit man and when you combine that with those quadrocopters man it's not just that the quadrocopter isn't if you have you seen that springy thing yeah they can jump off of buildings and well just that alone is terrifying that thing is that thing is horrendous that that's that's a robot dog a giant robot dog that can house missiles and anything you want fucking anything you want those things are probably super-strong they can carry all sorts of metal fucking things that kill people on them and they look like they look like they weren't gonna stop that just looked like it wasn't gonna stop like it's like you couldn't get away from them they would never stop to keep coming yeah and even if they did stop a repair swarm of quadrocopters would come down and fix it you're not gonna you're not gonna be you can't beat it you're not gonna be able to beat that kind of technology in in mass that's kid that is like just as frightening almost as an atomic bomb because it's just as heartless and cold and it's just it's gonna do what someone said all that someone has to do is press the button and send it out there and they sort of alleviate themselves of any responsibility because it's the robot that's gonna go in there fuck things up and also there's this ridiculous notion that humans still seem to have that these computers are never gonna become autonomous of course yeah I mean at one point in time every single programmer that has ever made anything that you use on your computer has had to contemplate where the fuck that's going yeah where the fuck the the anybody who's talking about artificial intelligence anyone who's talking about it they all say it's gonna get to absenting point they all say yes and it's almost like we don't we're like little kids that have a credit card and we're just gonna keep running up the bill until the check comes and then we're gonna go fuck how do we pay this oh wait what have we done oh shit we're fucked yeah like we're gonna we're gonna create this artificial thing that is way fucking smarter than and realizes how gross we are I think it's not cheetah robot it goes up to 28 miles look at that thing going oh my god that's scary that is fucking terrified it's so scary look at it go man but again 25 miles an hour running after you imagine 200 of those running down a hill it's not it's not just one they just don't unleash one only swarm in there they have they're covered in crab like machetes gonna be like warmer it's gonna be better slicer blades underneath yeah they found out that cutting things apart is like cheaper than shooting missiles and guarantee they're gonna have drugs that can figure out how to turn human blood into energy it's just it's just weird to me that you know that this is all happening inside of our life this is all going on right now I mean we really are seeing robots that can run 25 miles an hour well really are seeing drones to shoot missiles it's like it seems like some shit from a movie but it's really happening right now and there really are people that are programming computers and programming artificial intelligence and they really are going to get it to a point where it can think for itself and they really are going to get to a point work and make its own decisions and where it can decide to improve itself Autobots this is really happening in our life like we really might be in this glory day before the scene in a terminator I mean that's like that's that it's within the realm of possibility if no BOTS do become sentient and then especially if they need more power well that the question is the type of singularity that's not if the singularity is gonna happen but the type of singularity that happens and that the big question is and advanced intelligence that we made machines it becomes autonomous are they going to view us as just a waste of time and just decide to wipe us out or I think that the other alternative is far more likely are they going to see that were a resource in the same way that they would probably see everything as a bit of information that they could use to transform and create whatever the thing is that they've decided is appart more perfect universe run so I think it's more likely that they're gonna assimilate with us than it is that they would just chop us to bits because we are rudimentary bio computers that certainly are gonna have some use you know I think that I think it's gonna be more about connectivity than destroy well the real issue is how do you program into an artificially intelligent being the need to improve or the desire to improve or the the need to progress it's like just because something is intelligent and capable of incredible things and capable of thinking on its own doesn't mean it's gonna have those human style ambitions that allow us or cause us to make like a lot of the things that we make the things that we make we make because of this weird competitive drive that we have because of this weird desire to innovate and improve and create things these are like characteristics that have led us to not be monkeys they've led us away from the lower hominids and we don't know that a sentient computer would have these characteristics like these the characteristics that lead people to work all day and bust their ass and you know yes and acquire material goods and be a baller and all that stuff those are weird instincts but what if those instincts inside of us are not just inside of us but are manifestations of a kind of evolutionary energy that's rolling through time and as it rolls through time it gets more and more complex and more and more harmonized which manifests in the form of evolution in the form of single-celled organisms becoming multi-celled organisms all the way up to us this is an actual energy that in the same way wind blows through trees and moves trees when this energy blows through the world or through time it causes things to wake up and connect and in that case whatever happens to be in in that wind in that energy is going to just wake up and connect that's what it does so in that case it's not as though the computers need to be programmed they just need to be fine-tuned enough to start picking up that energy and once they pick it up woof that's when the the whatever this point is that's assuming that something not natural something that was created by life not not born you know in a natural way is going to inherit the same sort of desires to progress forward you know I think that the universe certainly is getting more and more complex like everything if you look at the idea of the Big Bang that's there was a single point smaller than the head of a pen the giant explosion creates everything we see in the sky today that just that alone it's like then it has to cool down and then planets are foreign and stars explode and you know carbon-based life-form is based out of the star them but you mean yeah we literally have to have a star has to explode before you can make a person yeah a lot of people don't really understand that they you you look at that just that idea that and that person might very well one day harness the power to make a star explode I mean that person could if you exponentially increase the the rate of our destructive capabilities you know if you look at like 1947 when they first was it 45 47 when they perfected the atomic I don't know the year whatever year that is look at his in the 40s and look at 2012 what they could do now destroy the entire earth like a hundred times over if Russia and the United States and Pakistan everybody just launched their nukes everybody launch every nuke we've ever made be crazy I mean it would be nothing left on the planet the whole planet would be done well if you extrapolate a hundred years from now you know two hundred years from now what kind of destructive antimatter weapons are we gonna have then we're gonna have star killers yeah you know we're most certainly going to have to have the ability to erase things erase planets it's just gonna happen you know you made me think of man is like I've always thought and went that idea that we are star energy that's woken up because the elements are a result of fusion happening inside of stars I've always thought were a degradation of the energy of the stars were the energy getting weaker or weakening down but what if actually were star energy getting immensely more powerful only the power as manifesting as intelligence or consciousness and and what if the this destructive thing that you're talking about doesn't come from weapons but from innovation and and and this is this this is why I fucking love Kurzweil because he's he talks about this idea that it gets to the point where we begin to manipulate matter at the atomic level and this somehow spreads out into space where it where an ant swarms of nanobots just fly through the universe reconstructing matter according to the whims of whatever the Overmind is or whatever the the force of intelligence that is a result of everything connecting is now that's fucking a million times more powerful than a star it's something totally brand-new it's like a novelty explosion I think there's no doubt whatsoever that people are probably very much like a lot of other animals that create byproducts without even understanding why they're doing it you know there's a lot of ant like bees making honey I mean they make honey too to feed their offspring or their their little but they also pollinate flowers they do they do they do a lot of like weird tasks like they they help things move along in pollinating plants you you really like help things move along right you you're you're aiding in the process I think our crazy need to acquire things is aiding in the process of technological innovation at the highest speed possible I think it's one of the reasons why it's so compelling to get like new phones and a new laptop dude you got the new laptop oh shit let me see that look at that fucking screen yeah it's sexual man I mean it's it's sexy as fuck you to get a really dope phone you hold it and you scroll through it like it's there's something there's something alluring about that technology I think I think our desire to continue to have bigger better badder faster or more awesome or I think that is that's the number one thing that's pushing innovation the number one thing that's pushing technology is this desire for all these new objects and as that technology gets pushed further and further and further more becomes possible until you really develop reality changing technology yes I mean the atomic bomb is essentially a reality changing technology yep you know electricity is reality changing the Internet's reality chain LSD reality change sure there it's a bit but it's essentially inevitable it's like it's going to keep going and going and going as long as the humans don't blow themselves up with one of their reality changing things yeah they're gonna come up with something like a time machine come up with something like some sort of a transportation device or transporter a beam or they're gonna be able to scramble your fucking cells and reconstruct them on the moon I mean they're gonna be able to do anything they want eventually if if time keeps going on and people don't get killed by asteroids or blow themselves up it's just inevitable it's an inevitability for sure inevitable and you can kind of feel it you know and I know it sounds so stupid but whenever I fucking go without playing a video game for a long time and buy a brand new video game and play it it really fills me with a kind of I love it but it's kind of ominous and how amazing they're getting how important they're getting you know the you used to talk about this how our nervous systems might not be built for the massive amounts of sense gratification that are accessible through technology yeah and we it hijacks your reward system Borderlands 2 I started playing this game holy shit man it's such a perfect game not just like graphics wise which are really trippy kind of like heavy metal magazine trippy but like the game itself is the first game that's ever made me laugh it's kind of funny they've added a weird humor to it they get good voiceover actors and it's super violent but it's so narcotic that it really makes me understand that the technology is a drug it's a drug that they haven't identified yet as a drug but it's a fuck it's exactly like any other drug well maybe not even like any other drug it's like Cara women well porn is also a drug yes you know porn especially the immediate access to porn online it's a drug I mean it is a drug there's no question about it you know I was watching the dr. Drew episode the other day where there's a dude who was addicted to porn fucking fascinating man fascinating looking at this guy and his wife and you know them trying to work out intimacy because this guy was just fucking completely whacked off on beating it off to to checks on online it's a man it's a pull it's like a technology has a gravity and you and it's a gravity that doesn't operate on mass it operates on a tension so when you're around technology you can feel it drawing your attention into it the thing you were talking about with your phone with porn with TV with your caught your fuckin new car whatever it is it pulls at your mind in this very obvious way that's impossible to deny yeah and that that energy that is the beginning of the connection the machines are making with our neurology that's the very first contact when you feel that pull you're feeling feeling the force of technology linking into your nervous system you're feeling an interface happen in a very rudimentary level but that interface is gonna get more and more focused more and more advanced and more and more perfect until it'll lock in for good do you think people back in the day though thought that about books lemon blood these books man they're teaching us they're make well they did you know when they first invented printing that's one of the things that held Islam back was that they didn't allow it to be printed with the typeset it was only allowed to be like written down and there was it was a long time before they allowed the the Quran to be printed well that makes sense yeah well fucked him up that's adopted print was the the beginning of the devil meanwhile they were in the same camp as the Unabomber yeah a brilliant guy who they whacked out with LSD studies yeah I think there's no question we have some bizarre attraction to technology and there's no question that we're not set up to handle the type of sensory overload that they provide when when a guy goes on a screen and you know and his fucking face is 60 feet high and he says the perfect shit because there's a team of writers who spent weeks going over his dialogue with a fine-tooth comb and his music there's music playing when he's talking I mean it's the impact is pretty fucking intense the hero impact that you get from a movie yeah that's if you could if you could take someone from the 1500s and and and bring them to a movie theater and get them to watch like Avatar they they would shriek in horror they would cry and scream they would be weeping and fascination yeah they wouldn't believe what they were saying they would they would think that they were in the presence of God himself yep have you played a movie and God you know was in a fucking robe an old man in a robe who could make magic shit happen and you showed on this screen God like making things happen all kinds of crazy special effects they would buy it hook line and sinker 100% because it would be beyond the realm of their imagination and be completely beyond so the the question is my smite thing was that we're set up like that guy though our biologies like that guy our biology hasn't changed yeah but what we introduced to it on a regular basis has changed significantly it's it's getting and it's getting more and more powerful every day yeah and it induces a trance state and so the question is what are we like when we're not in a trance State what does that look like because I don't if you're without your phone for an hour you feel a little weird like if you forget your phone and you're out you feel weird so yeah because the state of consciousness that we're in now we have become dependent on the machine the machine has become part of us right so what is what are we like outside of that trance State outside of that stupor what are we like when our consciousness or our attention isn't getting drawn into some glowing screen and before that what is it our consciousness like when it's not being drawn into a book or a religion is there a pure state or we always like constantly in relation to something is there a way that you're not in a trance or are you always consistently connecting with some symbol structure out there you know well unless you live in the woods and go offline for a while yeah you're you're connecting and one tiny bit you mean it's like you have your finger on Homebase dead you know no you're scared to run away from you're safe you're safe you got your finger on home base how many times you've been at a restaurant and you're looking at your phone just compelling you check your Twitter time can check it check John thank you so much Josh a missing link that you could yes if you don't check you to it endless it sinless and and and it's I mean I I will admit man I'm addicted to the Internet there's no question my behavior is addictive behavior I am addicted to information I love it I love every weird little fucking thing man the fact that I you know the amazing leopard attack video that came out today what would is a video it's a leopard in a gorilla as I what it is it's a fucking it's a lie it's a leopard leaping at something but I was on the fucking airplane and couldn't watch it I try I spent 30 minutes trying to watch that fucking thing just cuz I was so interested in it but when you consider that 10 years ago 15 years ago if you wanted to see something like that you'd have to be sitting in front of a big-ass TV and before that if you wanted to see something like that you'd have to go out in the woods and and find it to see it you know it's it's like the the things that we are witnessing as human beings in this time period are things that most human beings in the past would see one of them in their entire lives if that if that and the thing is that these these things are coming at us constantly all the time so our senses are just on overload just a hundred percent overload yes and we don't we don't have the ability to process whether or not those rewards are being utilized in a natural manner it's like a it's like a parasite system it's like the story of that aquatic worm that infects the grasshopper and literally stalks the grasshopper into committing suicide just gets inside of its brain tells it what to do and and then hatches Brian if you pull up animal face off gorilla versus leopard I think that's the video but maybe that's what technology is doing with us maybe it's sort of embedded itself slowly but surely into our system and more and more and more it's getting to the point where you can't function without it it's beyond that point if you know the thing where they talk about if the Sun solar flares do it knocks out all the GPS satellites the havoc it'll wreak on this planet yeah it's way past the point of no return we've got to have the connection we must have it for our society to work for trucks to deliver food for fucking nuclear plants to work yeah if this shit shuts down you know oh shit yeah you got a fast forward quite a bit before the actual action that's fake you know that was an artificial leopard yeah oh this is look at these fucking these are real they're having fights in the trees what a scary ass animal and leopards are scary too because they're they're they're really quick I've never seen this gorilla fighting a leopard these gorillas duking it out look at that leopard just jacking that antelope oh my god that is crazy the size of that fucking thing I would say gorilla wearing I think oh I wish animals had police yeah the gorilla might win they look pretty fucking crazy guerrilla might just rip that thing apart in our scenario oh this is a scenario you sons of bitches yeah this is our face there's ones that are real though isn't there look this is so look at this is so dumb an arson air in our crab looks like a bad video game oh my god this is awful this is a video game for the 80s yeah pre doom this is what happens when the budget runs out yeah this isn't the video is there another video or is this the one you were talking about this is awesome it's like yeah yeah it's uh this is a hundred percent horseshit well there you go you were addicted to watching that though you really wanted to see it I drew you in well everything's real right that's that's a thing man and it's like there's so like a lot of meditative practice practices are all about like developing your focus and developing your will through developing your focus and when your mind is getting pulled in a million different directions by your phone and by the computer and by TV then it really does seem like you are it's like eating too much too many sweets you know like you're some innate part of you is gonna start rotting yeah you're gonna lose this really important focus like man you know when you get around someone who's got real focus who's really really figured out a way to pin to turn their minds into a pinpoint like a laser fuckin Tom Cruise does it from the Scientology training have you ever seen him you know like when he gets when he gets sprayed I saw he gets Tuesday blowing my hair dude I wouldn't be surprised I'm sure there's a lot of power in that but we're so distracted right now that when you come across someone who's got that kind of focus you almost feel like you're around Dracula or something it's kind of creepy when someone's like just toons and salesmen do you think that that would work on you though if you and Tom Cruise were alone in a room together and you you had a conversation I'd suck his dick stop if you were alone in a room with him don't you think that he would appear silly if you talked to him just for a couple hours oh yeah he would be a silly prayer Oh would he have like yeah did you ever see him and Matt Lauer you ever see that conversation well they got on the subject of Scientology as criticism of Brooke Shields taking antidepressants yeah that's a fascinating dude man he would crumble like a house of cards okay you know you think he's charismatic I think he's only charismatic if you're really dumb if you watch that video and you see like the way he communicates when he talks about you know matcha pink alum your glum like he's like he's like a silly person like well yeah he has to be protected yeah he well he's got an entourage around him a people who are probably better at hypnotizing but yeah I said brilliant after I don't I I don't think I get sucked in by that from Tom Cruise but I think that I'm saying but you're talking about Tom Cruise having this disability yeah man I think there's I think it's an example of people what is that new video game tech demo crazy oh my god look at the facial features this guy's like making all these different facial features shit her gestures that's incredible she's that's really weird that's crazy creepy it's gonna get gonna get crazy it's gonna be hard to kill people and video games you're gonna start feeling at this guilty this is the new realistic engine where it's supposed to look like a real it's realistic almost looks like a video this is quake that looks like a camera you're going down that looks so realistic if you told me this is a real video it's a yeah that's a video someone's gotta mazing that's incredible but my thing was I just don't think that you would be impressed with its focus I think that's nonsense I think that's only they don't that's only when you see him in interviews and he puts on this thing and I think alone you would think that would be silly no I think I'll give you a list of people I don't know why I started with Tom Cruise probably a bad idea but you see that focus in like politicians a lot like Obama's got it even fucking Romney has this weird way that he kind of does the heat-seeking missile lock in on people when they're talking it's different from the way normal people act and that level of focus comes from being supremely disciplined in some way or another you know whether it's because you're having to is a politician like if you think about the level of focus it takes for those guys during the debates regardless of whether you like them or not when you imagine that one misstep one one wrong thing that you say is going to get repeated like a strobe light for the next you know week or perhaps could ruin your chance at being president that's an insane amount of pressure that they're under and they've developed some incredible focus to deal with it which I think is different than most other people you know most people are scattered man I I eat dinner with people sometimes and they can't go for minutes without checking their phone you know you just get used to it you get used to this thing around people where it's like oh yeah they're one of those people who always check their phone like I know during a conversation with this person they're going to be constantly looking at their phone irresistible drawn to it it's the worst yeah there's some people that they can't you can't lock in with them if they have a phone on them no they can't resist it no they don't even know they're do it where it gets really creepy is where you're mid conversation with someone and they just just go down to the phone oh yeah another just well the worst is like they'll be in the middle of something then just stop and start texting and you're like hey man are we hanging out yeah what's going on here yeah d is this really that important you're gonna stop in the middle of talking like you stopped auction yeah started going hold on fuckin denial it's Vasiliy it's silly because most the time it's not that important what could it be is he most likely pussy oh yeah yeah someone set up some of that sweet pussy that's the other thing the robots are gonna have no desire for pussy so how are these sentient life-forms can even get out of bed there's known that no fucking reward system set up I think that you are being incredibly optimistic thinking these robots are they're gonna give up they're gonna pull the cord they're gonna realize how pointless life is and before they ever get to recreate it they're just gonna blow themselves up they're robots yeah they're gonna realize what's the point we're robots we don't have souls don't know nothing got nothing just sentient robot fucking circuits going off switch flipping bad boys the singularity happens and they're just a bunch of depressed they're homeless homeless robots because they have no other ambitions and then we have to figure out whether or not we want to put ambition into the robots because then they'll surely take over there will be a big dilemma to be a bunch of moralist or like we have to give them ambition we gave them life they're like Pinocchio he wants to be a real boy I think it's very likely that they will have no desire whatsoever unless it's programmed into them there's no reason for them to want to fuck there's no reason for them to want money or a big house I mean they're they're robots so what the fuck is the point in advancing what's the point in making more robots like what is it what's the point even being alive it's like it doesn't it's not gonna there's not gonna be any reward the whole the whole like momentum that pushes us towards all this technological innovation and towards progress is these weird reward systems that we have these reward systems are engineered by the universe to ensure that we keep pushing forward and all of the these reward systems are all like going after these primal reward systems you know that have been inside of us for like hunting and gathering and cold as a reward system that it wants a common cold is it is it after does it have ambition is it going for something it just does it's just doing its thing okay yeah but we know that we're not a cold we have actual we're more complicated but can we have our viruses computer viruses don't have ambition there they've just been coded to do something right but they don't act they react they when a computer virus gets into your system you know it reacts to the fact that it can get in and then it moves forward this ain't get in it just stops right this point here is like the beginning of like an endless argument that you cannot because the point is do we act or are we just a read my point was that computer viruses are programmed to do things they're programmed to behave in a certain way they go they try to go in if they can get past step one they get in you're right I mean if I'm that's that's how a computer virus to set up we would have to make these computers make these sentient beings we have to program them with some sort of ambition some sort of desire to move forward because if you didn't program them with a with an objective a mandate if you didn't then they would just be intelligent just because they're intelligent there's no reward system for them to want you know make a new nuclear reactor well again man it's like you're creating a situation where the robots are different than us knowing this thing where it's like they're not an expression of us or an expansion of us you know they could be us add they could they could take what we are our brains for example which is what is creating all the simulation theory for her once they take a human brain scan the neurons in it we're on energy through it and replicated inside a machine well now you have ambition now you have consciousness wow that's a big leap I think you have matter you have an organic matter that will move and react the idea of consciousness being completely local is is a fairly controversial idea there's a lot of people that don't believe the consciousness even resides in the mind you know if you want to get all woowoo with it they believe that consciousness is like radio signals and your body is essentially a really good at you know there's no way except to be speculative about this know what has happened yet but why would you but I would speculate that if you're going to recreate a human mind inside a computer I would speculate that the thing is going to if you want to say that there's consciousness that is exteriorized then I would say that that brain would be an antenna for it in the same way that our brains are that to me is like saying that if you recreated a car would start itself I don't think it's the same thing because cars never start themselves human brains are innately awake they're innately did you create an artificial baby and let this baby live life and learn all the things that a person learns to develop a personality or you can somehow another download someone's already formulated 80 year old personality into this this this creature well I think that you've got a lot of choices I mean that it's literally the idea is if we take the neural pathways of the human brain and replicate them inside a machine the question that we're coming up against is does the thing is that will the thing think will it be a person well not only that well will the thing be a person will it grow old or does it just exist in the state that you created and are you able to create not just a person but the mechanisms inside of a person the genetic coding that allows a person to continue to grow and and get older and and you know yeah move forward right yeah there's a lot there's a lot of questions because is it just a meat bag you know what if that would be really creepy if we created a person and just nothing clicked it's just a meat bag dad just dumb as fuck meanwhile get the like most advanced mind ever we checked the switches everything's on no desire to move forward you know and then we developed a robot woman to suck his dick and then all of a sudden he's out there huffing who's got a Ferrari he's he got a boat hmm Tex is an amazing fucking drug and then it definitely if no one can argue with the fact that it has been the carrot in front of a lot of people's ambition well I say a lot why don't you say all the idea of to be loved is in front of almost everybody yeah I guess all yeah I mean I guess I'm just thinking like maybe there's a I don't know it is a precision is it peace it is a peace it might not be your entire expression but it's a piece of your motivation for doing anything it's to be loved or the love of what you're doing the love of what you're doing ultimately is a better way approaching in yeah you know and you know you get love from doing that well and it's uh it's kind of a strange little uh it's it's serve a strange little exchange like if you concentrate too much on getting love for what you're doing then you're not gonna do good stuff you have to concentrate on being loving what you're doing and then when you love what you have to really focus on it and then you get love from it yeah it got the trick yeah it Kurt sure don't you feel like that with comedy yes the moment you get outside of that you are fucked man well this is that that's in the bhagavad-gita the verses you have a right to your actions and not the fruit of your actions which means you just focus on what you're doing and don't worry about what's gonna flourish on the tree and then everything works out much better well that sounds like socialism to me Duncan that's what that sounds like fuckin bhagavad-gita queer old shitty fucking writing what else to tell you to do yeah I think that it's um it's one of the sure ways to destroy yourself is when you start worrying about or you can't by the way it's unavoidable well if you ever had a conversation with your agent about how to improve your your response from the audience give the people what they want no thank God and you gotta you know you gotta think like well Jamie Masada would give the worst fucking advice in the history of the world to comics and number one I mean look Jamie's a great guy he's got a great club but nobody can tell you what can make you funny you are you and Duncan Trussell fundings gonna be different than Joe Diaz funny gonna be different than Brian red bands funny we all got a weird way of looking at things and you got to figure out your way yeah but when you get a guy who's not a comic it comes along with like the worst advice ever Jamie Masato's this one duties like buddy you're a Generation X guy that is your thing everything you say you say my generation I am Generation X and that's your AG and the guy was like the fuck are you talking about man fucking Generation X guy dude if I ever told you about me who's opening the door if I ever told you about the advice that my first manager gave me no so he saw me this was years and years ago lock this door just a case before and creeps are walking in this place is not exactly secure it was it when I got up years and years ago I he saw me with wet hair and he's like that's what your think a B you could be the guy who always gets on stage wet oh that's an awesome piece of advice did you think about it for a second like what is that even I guess I guess what I was thinking like well I probably don't like tributed for one but what's what is that what's the joke hey guys I just got wet well do you remember when you were doing open mic where there were guys who would have like a very specific sort of fucking shtick yes they were doing sure yeah like they have an outfit yes yeah yeah I've heard of I heard it didn't you hear that don't you know the story of Jackie Jackie banana Oh crazy Bob you know the story of Jackie banana Jackie banana yes a comic right buzzie didn't he have like a funny act like a fake act I heard Mitty just told him he had to wear a banana a banana colored suit with a banana peeling is he a guy that I'm thinking about there's there's a guy that had like this like sort of a throwback act sort of a vaudevillian sort of a gesture to vaudeville is that the guy I don't know it was really like hockey but purposely hacky on purpose is that the guy no there's a comic kind of like that Neil are you I'm not talking about Neil hamburger I'm talking about there was another guy who was from years ago as like a skinny handsome sort of a guy who had this like his Jacky something or another I don't know Jacky diamond said I'm sorry I can't remember the guys name but he had like this it was pretty funny act but it was was like it was like you could have seen him in a you know 1950s mobster movie he would be the guy on stage one of those speakeasies or something yeah yeah you know most comedy way back in the day used to have to have some stick it didn't it wasn't like you could just like go off in weird directions comics were very sticky back in the 80s there were a lot of sticky comics well look at Larry the Cable Guy that's his thing that you ever see the video of him doing his real act no his real self as Dan it's really interesting now yeah I was a comic and then he just took on me totally talks different but he took on this thing and he's a very nice guy I've only gone out with him once but he was a very nice guy who's back in like the 1990s we did Montreal together hung out at the Comedy Works and he sent us some his uh potato chips he has potat listens to the podcast and he sent us some their their potato chips that taste like hamburgers Wow it tastes like cheese mustard a burger it's a trip like you're eating it and you know this is so strange it's like you're getting all these different flavors and then you're like how quick does this cause cancer this there's no what there's nothing even remotely natural about that shit dude you know what I just saw on reddit that reminds me of his delicious goddamn I just saw on reddit cut off the cancer it's worth it you take fucking Cool Ranch Doritos someone took or ants Doritos and put it into a salt grinder and the caption was enjoy the rest of your life that's a great idea yeah you're like a mortar and pestle yeah do it like alchemy and Kitsch is an infinite Cool Ranch flavor on everything Wow that would be delicious on chicken or something like that you know like if you fried chicken a chicken breast with cool instead of bread crumbs you put Cool Ranch potato chips all over the hours be good on anything that's so yummy mmm that sounds really good on a turd no wouldn't yeah you're right but man this thing about stick this gets into metaphysics and this gets into a place that I think about all the time which is how much of what human beings day to day that people are doing is just as a stick in the same way that comics have this thing how many times do you run into someone who's got this thing going on which is their personality their ego this thing that they're clinging to are putting out front that it isn't even them at all well how many people do that in the guise of a radio personality I mean isn't that like the ultimate goof the radio personality I was listening to Opie and Anthony today and they do a thing called jock Tober or they go after hacky radio people and they start talking like them and mocking their act it's that it's the strip club DJ yes seem that's the that's the thing they go into the hey ladies get yourself some $15 kamikazes coming up to the stage girls drink for free guys ladies night and then the president yeah very much so when you speak in front of great groups of people you must take on a different inflection we as a nation you can you can't just talk to them this is what I think we need to do I think this crate this country's crazy yeah we got to change some shit what are you saying you're not presidential yeah you could say the same thing in a normal way and it would seem really fucking weird what my opponent thinks you know what might not my opponent just thinks that uh I'm taxes are too high and I I disagree who's not concerned me what concerns me is the good will of the American people what concerns me is the prosperity of the American nation I just want people to be nicer to each other and make more money what concerns me is seeing more made in America stickers on goods ah yeah that was that voice that hypnotic fucking voice and then we allow it but keep bringing that down like there's personality types you know this is where you get into like certain personality types where you'll run into specific groups of people who all act exactly the same like Goths people are into certain bands they all stacked they all they all share this similar personality and in cults it's a one of the one of the aspects of cults is that everyone in the cult kind of acts the same way and the way they're acting like is like the leader yeah you know so it gets really interesting when you start considering to yourself how much of what I'm doing is a schtick or how much of what I'm doing is just imitated from someone else whether it's my parents max acute that's exactly the way we we inflict on words you know I didn't even realize how heavy my Boston accent was until I started seeing myself on television you know I saw myself on television when I was 19 after a Taekwondo turn him and I heard my accent I was like oh my god I got to stop that and I've slowly like removed it over the but you have to hear it you have to hear it to realize you're even saying it yeah it's fucking crazy man and it's totally just imitate our atmosphere it's fun to like chase that thing back and and to this is where psychedelics are really useful is because you begin to start contemplating well who is behind all this who's behind the accent who's but do you ever just think where do my words come from I think it's all cool motherfuckers that other people copied you know that's what the accent is I mean there must have been one cool motherfucker in Kentucky that just knew how to talk in a way that just seemed badass this motherfucker didn't didn't give a fuck you know playing he just sat there with a cigarette dangling over his mouth I don't give up yeah and everybody in the neighborhood is like man I want to be like that dude yeah sure and they they all just sort of took on that inflection well remember when a movie would come out when you were a now obviously that's not true it's not like one guys it's not a patient zero when it comes to accents you know it's some kind of collaboration between groups of cool people but or but you know when a movie would come out and you would be an elementary school and then some catchphrase from that movie would suddenly go rushing through elementary school again I'm Rick James bitch yes yes exactly we're just kind of like a wildfire goes through idiots and they just imitate and imitate and imitate they can't help it they can't help it yeah and this is the big question this is like but it's also fun oh it's a yeah it's you it's human I mean goddamn everyone's guilty of it James bit there's no way to avoid it I love saying that no it seems to be up there seems to be a prevalence of people saying boo right now mm-hmm and also you started some shit man you've started powerful powerful beautiful I get powerful tweets don't complain about that you can't worry too much I'm not complaining about an enjoy shit like power I'm not complaining about I think it's great but I'm saying it's interesting to see how certain behave just microbe a micro behaviour get imitated and echoed throughout society it's a it's a very interesting it is fascinating it is it is it's it's it's very interesting it's very interesting that we sort of amalgamate we sort of take in from all all sorts of different sources around us that we like all the different things that we like it's always a problem with comics as well you know we see certain comics that are like just doing Doug Stanhope you know how many guys have you seen that we're opening for Doug if you ever went to one of Doug's shows but years ago especially he would have guys open form and they were essentially doing Stan oh Christ you got you got you before you buddy you know this is ridiculous yeah it's super common that there was a million it tells for a while you know they were just huge fans of a tell and they couldn't even help it they started talking like Dave yeah yeah they just found themselves doing it yeah you know you don't even realize it it's fucking incredible man and it's it's like you get thumb printed by reality in that way and it goes way back I mean that's that that's I just had my mom as a shrink on the podcast and like she was talking about the effect that she thinks what happens when you are a kid like getting your dick snipped off like you were saying has on the rest of your life it has a huge effect you get thumb printed by your parents by the subjective DNA of your parents gets thumb printed into you yeah and then you spend the rest of your life in this kind of strange hypnotic trance not knowing why you're doing what you're doing yeah and that I think is the beginning of you know when you're talking about dumb dumb people or people who are absorbed into some religious structure I think the beginning of human nests starts when you start thinking about wait what am I really what's behind this fucking mask what's behind the behavior mechanisms that I picked up for my folks are from movies or from influential friends or from whatever what's the being residing behind all that shit and that I think is when you stop being a machine or start waking up a little bit but until then you might as well be a fucking brain and a goddamn Commodore 64 yeah or you just enjoy this fucking weird existence and marvel at all the mystery of it all and just sort of try to take it in and just enjoy it because if you you know if you try to like get down to your core all day every day you're gonna you're gonna miss what's what's enjoyable about the experience I don't necessarily know if we're ever gonna figure out what's motivating us pushing us and want in one way or another what why do you talk the way you talk you know who are you but I but I do love the fact that there's so many variables I do love a guy like Joey Diaz I do love how Ari is so much different than Joey Brian so much different than me we're all just weird you know personalities that have come about through a whole bunch of different scenarios a bunch of different ways to live a life you know and different locations and different problems and challenges and different genetics it's a fucking trip man the human experience to get from point A to Duncan Trussell at 37 years old is a wild crazy fuck fuck you and everyone's Road is is unique and different and creates a different result have you heard the term dependent origination no it's a Buddhist term and the term is that there is nothing independent there's nothing independent of it there's no thing that isn't related to some other thing in the universe which creates this kind of tapestry so in these phones so the example that you know of course the beer this beer bottle is not by itself it comes from sand it's just what you're seeing here is in the flow of time the a temporary form that a bunch of sand and paper which comes from trees has congealed into to form this thing but 700 years from now this fucking thing is going to be sand again you so what you're watching right now is just a moment of this thing's true existence and then in the same way you and Joey Diaz and Brian and me and everyone listening to this are just one mote one moment of beingness in this web that for us traces all the way back apparently didn't nuclear fusion inside of stars which has gone through infinite time until it's finally manifested in the form of whatever the partially is yeah exactly which for a moment in time for a moment in time that we tonight cocksuckin third yeah but it's already sold out bitch that's cool yeah it's it's a an amazing connection that we have to everything that's ever existed and we are part of some weird infinite cycle as is the planet as is the the star that heats the planet all of these will end the universe won't it's this is but a blip even the life of a stars but a blip in the in the life of the Amber's they blow up all the time they said that there was a beautiful show on hyper Nova's they were talking about when they first started detecting gamma-ray bursts in the galaxy they didn't know what was going on they did they thought it was possible that we were under attack by an alien race because there was huge bursts of energy that were were happening all over the space all throughout the universe so they thought it was possible they were actually alien wars at one point in time that was something that was being considered until they understand the mechanism or understood rather the mechanism behind Nova's crazy for them but they're happening all the time they're just they're just blowing out there's so many fuckin stars we can't even yeah you gotta go if in your lifetime to the Keck Observatory in Hawaii if you've never been there it's one of the one of the highest observatories and it's above the clouds it's really wild because you're driving you dry it's on the Big Island and you drive there's a long-ass drive it's like a two-hour drive up the mountain and as you're driving you hit clouds and you're like fuck man we're not gonna be able to see shit we took this big drive up here but we're not gonna be able to see shit because all these clouds then you drive past the clouds and you get up and you go oh my god because first of all you're at 13,000 feet and second of all there's no low light pollution on the island they have these diffusers on all these lamps so when you look at you don't even have to look through a telescope dude you just look up when you're at the observatory and you're like oh my god the the Milky Way's in stay yeah and it makes you so angry that you can't see that every day yeah like we if we didn't have these greedy ass fucking cities with lights everywhere and driving around with headlights like if we could have just for one hour or a couple hours of one day well maybe just had one night a year where everyone shots all the power off for three hours and we all from 6 to 9 p.m. central remember tonight is you know star Appreciation Night and we all shut out all the powers in cities yeah they've tried that a few times where oh yeah good good idea see I'm behind the times somebody started up but if we did that and you would you you could see that we would have so many people that would be so much more in awe of space and so much more interested in the especially children interested in the idea of pursuing astronomy or or pursuing rocketry or working for NASA or something I mean just there our appreciation for you know funding things like NASA and the Hubble telescope and new telescopes and you know the Keck Observatory and all these you know all that stuff would be so much more appreciated if we could see the majesty of the stars we've robbed ourselves from that of that with cities the the light we don't even realize it because we've grown up with these things but all that light all the time has robbed us of really the most amazing thing you could ever see and one of the most humbling things I've ever seen in my life I've had psychedelic experiences that didn't affect me as much as looking at those stars because I I remember that night I couldn't sleep I remember I got back to the hotel room I was just lying in bed staring up at the ceiling thinking how insane that thing was and that that's up there all the time that I can't see it they really hit home the the feeling that was when I really started pushing the idea of the planet as an organic spaceship that's when I really started talking about that's why I came up with that whole bit about you know explaining you know that were on a rock hurling through the universe yeah like how insane it is to pay attention to the Grand Canyon you know that that bit yeah I was like there's people out there look how deep the Grand Canyon meanwhile above you is infinity did you see the Graham Hancock video that he posted on his information website of the sound of the earth yes dolphins dude it's the radio waves that the it's the radio waves that the the radiation belts yeah yeah but it sounds a lot sounds like it sounds like dolphins it sounds like chirping whales yeah Brian pull that up cuz it's fuckin trippy are you drinking a rock star you fucking water star yeah by the way it was it's called a Earth Hour it's actually one hour a year that that everyone's supposed to like just turn off all their power except for the refrigerator for an hour really yeah but that's cool Stella doesn't do that shit oh fuck you gonna do coke what was the shitting you want me looking it's M Graham Hancock side he's got this newsletter I don't know the exact it's just um just look up scientists find the sound of the earth yeah it'll pop up right away it sounds like chirping it softens or whales yeah yeah and it's a apparently the the sound of the radiation but the radiation belts make a sound that's like it wavers yeah yeah we're weird man I think it's just a matter of time before we we get contacted by something that's more intelligent than us I've been thinking that more and more lately I think if there is something out there that's more intelligent than then or than human beings it's gonna have to contact us really soon cuz we're like real close well this is the thing man this is I can't remember who fucking said this one of these singularity people said humankind's first contact with an extraterrestrial or with an alien intelligence is going to be a machine that's woken up and that's gonna be our first experience with it is something we made instead of instead of a thing from space well that's possible that's possible it is possible that we're at the high I mean there was one recent Harvard astronomer that decided after looking at 500 different stars that we may be the only thing out there and that there's so little life or evidence of life in these these planets these 500 different planets rather that they've observed but I think that's ridiculous and most ridiculous because he is coming from a planet that has life that's one of those 500 so it's not that there's nothing in 500 no you found one dummy and you're on it there's one and you found 500 that don't but you found one that does okay you have to you have to add that in stupid you don't just go looking for another one and if it the other one you can't find it welp they don't exist meanwhile you are one right that doesn't make any sense and also man that creek bed and Mars that she gives me goosebumps when I see pictures of the fucking gravel and Mars from water flowing on Mars I just think about what that must have looked like on that planet with Martian water rolling through whatever was rolling through I think there was probably life I'm on Mars yeah Bryan pull up how Earth sounds from space on YouTube and and it's it'll freak you it's fucking loud as people and a fairing with our podcast yelling mystery we got we got no sound proofing here nice house how Earth sounds from space it's on YouTube but so it shows up the earth itself you see like cloud formations Jim now that's not the one that's not the most recent one yeah see new look up Graham Hancock calm how was that movie you saw last night yeah fucking awesome what is this looper okay I'm glad that's good oh my god is it good it's not just good it's like one of the best movies I think I've ever seen it was a really good fucking movie I can't find the sound man I don't know where it is anyway go find it folks it's on my Twitter why don't I just look on my own fucking Twitter stupid ass so dumb [Music] the the looper movies really fucking good it's a really good writing you know I didn't know anything about it is it one of those Mindbenders where you're like brain feels like it's getting stretched out because it's so no you know wasn't that was the thing they managed to avoid they managed to avoid all sorts of if you go to my um my Twitter Brian I found it if you pull up there's a tweet i retweeted a gentleman named Aaron Rodriguez Aaron Rodriguez congratulations you were the guy who gets mentioned on the podcast Aaron Rodriguez and it says apparently the Van Allen radiation belt sings like a whale nothing to fear guys and it's 22 hours ago i retweeted it so find that son what was I saying you were talking about I don't know what you're talking about before that man fucking lost me yeah that's a planet that's so creepy sounds like it's calling a dog you know what it's calling other planet saying this place is filled with cunts a bunch of crickets and we are cunts with nuclear bombs don't fuck with it wrong Brian is the end of it I don't think that fucking thing that thing does not sound that that does not sound like a defenseless thing to me that sounds like a thing that could just jump out of the woods and bite your head off well it's not a real sound you know it's radio waves so we've sort of interpreted them as a sound as I understand it I don't think it's actually the yeah you stuck your head out of the Space Shuttle you wouldn't hear that yeah cuz he had to get wiped off but yeah you probably would hear that action yeah you wouldn't hear shit your head would freeze explode instantly isn't that crazy that you would just freeze yeah stantly in space yeah you just couldn't live yeah is that someone at the door who is it who is it who's motherfuckers keep interrupts I think what I think is their show no how many show starts in 30 minutes yeah comics what comics would just come back here and not say anything hold on Duncan yes Brian how you doing where you were yet next where are you going out of town I'm going to Vancouver this weekend oh lucky you playing at that hotel yeah comedy club what's it called again the comedy max that's awesome I knew it was Joey's the type of guy that just tries doors he doesn't knock that doors unlocked I'll stay stealthy keep it on the down-low cocksucker um so this is it's not Joey it's an audio rendering of radio waves right that's what it is yeah it doesn't really captured by probes it's still fucking weird lock that door to keep out the stalkers or something what's going on buddy you know me dog hit on me keeping it beautiful did you lock it what do you got man we're here for another sold-out show tonight at the Ice House in Pasadena ladies and gentlemen will we sling comedy dick on a regular basis and you know we got a lot of people come back so we we try to come up with as much new shit as possible and I'm gonna be doing a lot on the earth singing like a whale is when you bar you know I'll do this any material I'm doing a whole chunk on S&M tonight are you really yes I am I can't wait to hear it you better not use any of my stories your fuck what as an M story do I have no stories no stories and that's a shame no I operate a different level of you I I don't know I don't know if it's the right level well I'm not saying it is but it's different levels different level you're into you're into education let's make sure we say on occasion some shit that makes me uncomfortable as a man afraid to experiment about what he sees judging me as a fun time to charging I love you all gagging no Elaine you wore diapers you know you made that up yeah no I wouldn't judge you Duncan I would never judge you you I love you exactly the way you are I don't want you to change even slightly but the ball gag thing bothers me like the first time I'm like well I'm still intrigued by this ball gag business let me try it again Joey sit in with us man what are you doing doing what okay okay seeing that Joey Diaz ladies gentlemen in and out he's here he's gone he's here for our sold-out show the Bambino eyes welcome to my radio voice did you sew Opie and Anthony attacked these guys on what they called October they do it every year apparently fucking so funny because it was Opie and Anthony it was who else was on Tom papa was in there you know hot sauce in there I don't know it was just you know that that show is always like a bunch of people yes like all piled in together and it was really fucking funny and then within a half an hour an hour them doing it the radio station took down their Facebook page the ona savages had started attacking the Facebook page and shitting all over it fuck your bananas and tell them they're all shit drowning aid is so funny I mean I just I just fucking love that they're so sensitive they took down their Facebook page look this is what happened you got you got goofed on you should have been goofed on a long time ago and then you would have never done that radio voice I think they trained in that voice I think that that there's schools where people trained to talk like that yeah you just choose like strip club or or radio voice or whether person you know Anthony was saying Anthony was saying that they they made them this Anthony Ropin and forget I think they're all talking about how the guy actually said I want you to visualize who your audience is just you know take a picture out of a magazine that represents that guy you know your blue collar guy and just put that up there on the wall and you know that's the guy you're talking to that's your guy ah you know and Anthony was saying that he put up John Casey but it's like that that it happens whenever you get a producer involved in someone who's a non creative person involved in you know and trying to like shape your radio personality we got a do man is just tighten up your image you need a thumb ring you thought about a no longer I'm laying nose rings yeah man some rings Anthony Bourdain is the only guy that I've ever met that he used to wear a thumb rein Assad douchebag cool guy and he has a thumb ring and I'd watch him on a show and I'm like man I just gotta talk to him about that ring we're gonna be fine get the fuck out of there the tattoo around the belly button that's another one dudes get bored I could see tattooing your belly button that's just a board did you not up toe ring did you see that shit on reddit of the guy who had a rim job tattooed on his face like right on his mouth on his moustache really it's the saddest thing it looks like he's been crying like their did to him and some other guy they're both obviously fucked up and one of them asked some shit tattoo on his forehead but the other guy is right under his nose rim job I think there's a lot of people are just incredibly self-destructive yeah what is that is that is that like us losing our natural reward system with hunter and gathering and being stuck into some weird fucking environment or taking pills and trying to overcome reality with pharmaceutical drugs and sedate ourselves through shit jobs and boring meaningless existences as a cog in the wheel yeah and then you just go crazy substance-abuse turn to your face it's like the human version of pigs and slaughterhouses that start chewing off their own legs because they're too close to each other you just end up going into some but also a lot of times when people do that shit outside of the guy who did rim job a lot of times when people fuck up their body they're doing it because they want specific types of girls to like them I think I think that there's like writing rim job on yours no not that I said except for that guy but like the people who like just fucking like put in the like hanging themselves from their nipples or like people who do the ear it's the big ear holes if you think they're looking for certain types of girls and that's what it is I think it's a mating pattern some of us are sure it is with the ear thing is I would have never saw that coming me either I met a lot of cool people that have it too and I don't want to judge them I don't want to judge them but that's a fucking it's a trippy thing you got a fucking toilet paper roll in your ear son did you see that prank or maybe it was it was an idea for a prank it's awful but it's like you sneak up on one of those guys with a lock and put it in the ear hole and lock it so then they've got a lock like locked into their ear I think I saw a video of it or someone suggesting someone do that whoa brutal that's horrific because then you'd have to get it clipped that's horrific it's a dangerous thing man it's not a strategic thing to have giant holes in your ears it's dangerous yeah but if what if you ripped it off and then beat the guy to death with it yeah you do that too well you would deserve it probably at the shitty move yeah locking someone putting a lock and someone's fucking here you better know the combination bitch that's a rude prank it's not I guess pranks the wrong word it's an assault an attack but yeah all that shit body modification that thing where people in Korea is a Korea that they're putting up donuts in their handles yeah head bagels yeah what's going on it's like we're sick of our bodies or something man we're taking these strange paths to make our bodies look different it's really fucking weird the lady just grew in here off her arm but that wasn't cosmetic that's cuz she had to she had cancer yeah that's not related but yeah there's a lot of weird shit that people do but I say that but then I have two sleeves of tattoos you know two arms are covered in drawing Yeah right but still I can't talk no I think two sleeves of tattoos is a fuckload cooler than having your head inflated yeah it's cooler but but it's still weird to know the average person doesn't want to sit there and have someone draw on them with a fucking scratchy needle yeah it shoves ink under their skin just to make it look cool I want a fucking tattoo would you get I don't know that's the problem man it's tortured me for my whole life yeah I'm always thinking about what it would be and I don't know I'm hoping that when I when I go out to Brazil and slurp back some ayahuasca it'll come to me I think though just little hobos a little sweet face on your arm little hobo with a giant dick like evil boy that is tattooed on the from yeah the n-word yeah yeah huge dick but little hobos face no no I don't like that tattoo I was gonna me big veiny giant don't like that tattoo how about a black dick no about red dick to represent the American Indian being nasty to my Lombok show now it means the big hard red day like to Hulk if he was red you feel me on this nothing damn fella goes all over pit path what would what about some of the from the bhagavad-gita is there but again like that shit all seem so fucking like contrived you know it seems a little bit cuz like I don't I'm not I'm not gonna like look at my arm you like now how about ours took Crowley on your shoulder fuck that man I have an Aleister Crowley poster and shit falls off my wall my body some some goddamn chaos man there's a chaos magician named Frater is low if he doesn't carrots at his name who mails me like really weird a a cult shit man like really strange like he just sent me a demon a demon summoning box where he's painted the front of it it sounds really tough when I was there's so many yes there's a anyway it's there's a lot of weird there's a lot of strange shit out there man but the point is I would never want Crowley tattooed on my body there's a lot of people that have turns McKenna tattooed on them pretty interesting I think that's pretty good but I don't know man I like more of a something that's less specific you know something that maybe has the chance McKenna tats who's gonna be a real problem man I kept December 21st 2012 rolls over and nothing happens although he wasn't really convinced that anything was gonna happen well everyone's got that I mean there's a simple out for 2012 which is that it's a shift in the vibrational freak no one's ever predicted anything ever that's my problem with it no one's ever correctly predicted any like you know huge change in in the world ever no one's ever said you know on this day to specifically to the day right the world the world will change forever yeah they tried with y2k yes alright god that was crazy I wonder if they tried with I wonder if people thought 1984 was going to be a big year because of the book man I remember do you remember [Music] I don't remember that well 1984 is like nothing compared to what's really going on right now on your fucking phone is a like a wireless GPS tracker that they can turn on and listen to you and record you talking and where you are yeah that shit we were so primitive back then man your phone had to plug into the wall well it's really interesting when you go back to like to 1800s you know like when was the War of the Worlds weren't written I believe it was written in the 1800s right I don't know radio 1920s or 30s I okay I'll say 1923 well when um when homeboy did it on the radio orson welles what year was that it was hg wells 1898 yeah and then Orson Welles did it I think in the nineteen the early 1900s hey powerful in Edwards is here man come on in Park it comics have started shuffle inlays gentlemen which means we're gonna shift from this to that yeah let's shift from the Duncan Trussell family our podcast explosion in your mouth to an Icehouse chronicles that sound good Brian I didn't know we're doing that do you want to do one not really don't have to okay then one won't do it all right folks no more fucking podcast okay well we got well it's not even ten o'clock though dude let's keep going then if we're not gonna do a nice house Chronicles let's keep going because it's only it's only quarter to ten it shows at 10:30 but uh we're gonna the sold-out show here tonight at the ice house in Ian Edwards dude freak on what he what about this this shit with the dispensaries now that it got overturned what happened well the I think they decided to let them keep continue to operate because they needed tax revenue it would be catastrophic to a lot of these neighborhoods if all of a sudden those businesses pulled out what people don't understand is that this these businesses these cannabis dispensaries have become a big part of the economic success of a lot of communities I mean not only do people work there and have jobs and get paid but they also pay rent to landlords I mean there's a lot of them there's hundreds of them that would mean that hundreds of places no longer have someone renting them and it's not like there's like a shortage of places to to rent there's a lot of places to rent so if you you know it's like commercial real estate like I I had a look around at a lot of commercial places to get a podcast studio I looked at a lot of office space and stuff like that it's fucking everywhere everywhere so many places are available and open and if they decided just randomly to shut down 700 different fucking dispensaries for just dubious reasons for reasons that don't make any sense at all it would be it would it would suck it would fuck up the economy there's a lot of money that goes to paying taxes Joe was it was that I also read that the DEA was saying that they're gonna stop raiding medicinal marijuana dispensaries did you read that no I didn't read that when did they say that he's someone tweeted that I don't know if it's true I think it might be I might be paying you a higher you probably because one of the things that I read is that the DEA what they won't disclose any information about busts and what they're doing is they're going in and raiding people they're taking all their marijuana they're taking their money taking their plants they confiscate all the records they write down all everyone's name and then they do nothing and they don't have to do anything and when you try to find information on the tage the case they just say it's an ongoing investigation yet and they don't do anything so they come sign of doing something they're coming in and jacking people and not arresting anybody and Todd McCormick was the first person who told me about this and I was like that doesn't even make sense I was like am I missing something in this story and then I went and looked at it online but no that is the practice the practice is they just make it ridiculous for these people to try to run a business and they come in and take all their shit I think they just like trying to act like they're doing something to kind of put keep the show going that they're new in their job but they don't really want to arrest it I think they probably agree with the states that have California that have weed laws but there's like I we got to do something so let's just shut this down but not really try people I don't know if it's an agreement thing because a lot of cops do not like weed you know I mean when when cops break into guys houses and shoot their dogs 17 fucking times and look around and find a pipe a little bit of weed on it have you seen some of those Oshin the links I can't work they're horrendous man they shot some former Marines 17 times the other day and they thought this guy had pot on he had nothing it's the whole thing is crazy thought he was a dealer there's no pot in the house I'm gonna put some of these cops away just to let other cops know it's this always like yeah let's not rush to judgment the police chiefs like let's not rush to judgment let's see what happens like but they rush to judgment when the cops write up of criminal form on somebody that they arrest right and they put the story on the news like instantly that person's guilty but when a cop shoots somebody let's just wait well sometimes they do that but you know the Internet is sort of taking a lot of that away they're exposing these people like that that officer UC Davis that's pepper spray those kids in the face and then there was the recent situation where the cop cold-cocked a chick at a Puerto Rican Day Pride Parade he thought that she did something but she didn't she just was in the wrong place the wrong time so he turns around cracks her it was fucked up man it's fucked us to watch that guy's in trouble that guy's in trouble should be yeah he fucking should be even if she did throw water at him you not a lot of puncher dude you're a cop girl throws water you can't punch her in the face this is the cool show this is the cool thing about the proliferation of fucking cameras everywhere like it goes both ways but I've heard that the TSA is not letting you film them anymore if you heard this yeah yeah I've heard that yeah yeah that's what uh when we had who was telling us a story Kevin Pereira was telling us the story of being stuck at the airport and trying to film and have his girlfriend trying to film it and they wouldn't let her and they took him into a room he's like I don't have a witness here anymore at least out there I have a witness like I want to film this you know it wouldn't let him they wouldn't let them the whole thing it's just it's ridiculous so there's the TSA acting like cops now police state ladies and gentlemen we've reached a police state people want to control people the system sucks the systems and masks people are complaining and then they want to control the people complaining so they want to tighten down a police state instead of addressing what the people are complaining about when people get to the point where they're rioting in the streets or there's an Occupy Wall Street type of movement man the fact that the government does not address that on a formal basis on a regular basis that they're not doing something about that and adjusting it just shows you how how much contempt they have for the actual people and who they really work for that's not even a subject of a gachy that shit's not gonna come up in the debates you think they're gonna talk about Occupy Wall Street and addressing their demands or the petrodollar or they are the fact that China is like apparently switching away from the dollar to buy oil if you're about that show no I don't blame them have you seen the value to dollar Jesus well no I mean is it even me it's that the spooky thing is apparently our entire currency is based on the fact that most people use it to buy oil and so they have to have vast reserves of it on hand to buy the oil but if that changes then our dollar will drop even more than it's valued at now and the most extreme way because it's not based on gold into a lot of people it's called the petro dollar theory it's on Wikipedia it's a theory but the theory is that all the wars that we've been in have been with places that we're about to switch the currency from the dollar to something else and whenever that happens we go in an attack because the that's the only thing that our dollars valued on but it's a theory it's a conspiracy lucemon while we attacked Iraq yes and a mat right after we cuz he had already switched over and we attacked Iraq and then we turned it back to the dollar within a year of attacking yeah wow you are here to talk about that in the fucking debates you want your back come up well you won't hear them talking about WikiLeaks so there is a purpose to all these wars that's good to know that they're not doing it for nothing that's good well they're doing it for money son yes yeah anybody talk about WikiLeaks in the debate that's shit ain't gonna happen they're gonna sweep that on the rug is that dude still holed up in that yeah it's been there for months I think they get him any pussy this is sneak him in some hippie pussy does he have to pay rent there that's a good question I wonder if he's got a dope suite he's just promises not to leak anything about them yeah oh shit he probably has some serious shit on that guy well it's weird that they're in you know they're in England but it's the Ecuadorian embassy so he's allowed to stay even though he's in England they all just stand around waiting for him to come out so he stays in that house from he's been in that house for months no he comes out and does little speeches from that balcony nobody's still in the house Technic I was calling him rapunzel rapunzel well they they already got the DNA test back on the condom and it shows none of his DNA yeah I don't think you know they just want to get this Lucan sorry Julian I love you yeah they're jacking that guy yeah that's really scary isn't it yeah it's fucking scary and also that other guy that's in just in some pod somewhere getting water hose 24-hour Bradley Manning yeah they have him in solitary confinement I heard that he's naked he's not allowed to wear clothes he just like balled up in a fetal position in some orange room getting sprayed with water of music yeah is that what you heard I made up a lot of that when I went to visit him that's how it was after I fucked up that's but he's not doing great I don't think he can send letters and stuff I don't think you do anything you know yes they're essentially psychologically torturing he's gone I bet he's gone when he comes out of there he's gonna be a drooling Boo Radley he won't know any that's optimistic is it when it comes out of here it's written what you know it's really interesting is this guy could have done something far worse and he would be in a real prison with interacting with people he could have been a murderer he could have been the DC sniper he could have been you know he could have done something far more horrific and he would be interacting with people what this guy did was leak some information about some shit that he thought was horrific and in doing so they're treating him like he is fucking Lex Luthor they're treating him like he's the worst bad guy ever I mean while Manson's in a regular prison somewhere rogon have you seen this list that leaked about the different signs that someone's a terrorist like it leaked from the Army or something like what to look for what was one of them everything you do like you like you are yours because there's there's there's gradients on the list and on the red side it's pretty much all of it all of us are alike would be considered like terrorists by this new thing yeah back in the find it oh if you use so Media yeah read some read some of it back back in the day this podcast would probably be considered like communists and McCarthy era or you know this just some red party shit for sure Wow here's some warning signs according to the US military Wow you've recently changed your choices in entertainment you have cooler discussions I've gotten a blowjob porn you complain about bias to your socially withdrawn joi Diaz is that on I don't hear him check your socially withdrawn you're frustrated with mainstream ideologies your risk factors for radicalization include social networks and youth Facebook you're young you're a terrorist that is fucking hilarious that is just like the most broad sweeping brush I think I've ever read ever in an official document this is some cunt I know I think it's like the army and but the combination of this with the indefinite detention Act that's where shit gets creepy because it's one thing to just be like yeah those are signs that someone might be doing something weird but then I think a terrorist someone suspected of terrorism can just get arrested according to the indefinite detention act without a trial yeah so that's where shit gets a little not not gonna sleep that well at night well we have this girl who was coming on the podcast tomorrow amber Lyon who was working for CNN and was like clearly censored like they were told not to tell stories there's certain things that were told not to cover there's certain areas where they wanted to they wanted to report on actual news and they were told not to and they were told to read off government propaganda they knew was not true yeah and this is on CNN so you know it's it's it's real it's on it's not like it's not like people going oh yeah well they wouldn't act on that stuff no no no no this is like like they've figured out a way to control media Andrea propaganda is a real thing now it's a hundred percent real they can dig and lie to you all day long and if you want to travel anywhere they can restrict you they not only can they restrict you but just to travel you are going to have your body magnetically scanned so they can see you fucking naked yeah if you travel you must allow them to see your naked body that doesn't work as Joey Diaz clearly explained on the Alex Jones Show they missed a bag of weed hidden under his balls it can't see through Joey's balls otherwise they might be able to see distant telescope they have not yet developed a scanner machine they could see past you better watch how Kate is gonna cut yourself I want to smuggle something to another country you have to buy Joey

bombers and you can just fucking fly in the x-ray machines wouldn't see shit ever give you these x-ray they put that fucking the umpire thing on your chest that's with my skin on my nuts like fucking shield it doesn't go through cuz it's I hide that sack behind all they can see is this motherfucker you got three nuts luckiest motherfucker they don't want to look there they're like I'm just going over the place is immoral and they robbed eight hundred thousand dollars worth of loot to TSA people yeah they found that iPad and someone says did you see that yeah but they're robbing those motherfuckers dawg yeah they definitely The Fray they're always like swiping watches and shit you got a lot of stories but I went through the TSA today and they were being extra careful cuz like a penny a tip they dropped off into my end of it in and they're like sir your penny don't forget your PIN yeah everybody's watch anyone interesting this is a metal wash this watches man in a metal but it doesn't go off go right through the scanner machine it never goes what you fucking wouldn't it be hilarious if they don't even check in you well they're easy was that me how crazy would that be if half those machines really cost like $800 rich Bonnie go through and they just make you go through and press a button and go you're going through it is a second see who is nervous look how many fucking times they find people with bullets and guns and fucking stupidity it makes you really think it really makes you fucking think I guarantee half these people is just whatever Jack whatever you know today's a dates a free fucking day come on what a bazooka we're not gonna catch it well they did some independent testing where they tried to get people through and they got through with a bunch of guns and guys you'd be fucking surprised you'd be fucking surprised well you know what goes off foil from gum huh yeah when you have like a pack of dentine with a push through the foil back that shit goes off you have that in your pocket you'll beat but you got a weapon but meanwhile the metal that you'll watch is made out of for whatever fucking reason that doesn't go off man it just makes me want to puke when I look over and see a fucking old man today I saw an 80 year old man with a brace on his neck getting like a hardcore like your fat ass you know what come on he probably was he white he probably deserves to get searched I hope those black TSA workers working him over like a water hose I hope they dip their fingers sanitizer management feel like a hand sanitizer inside your

yeah this is uh during 2010 there was four forty five thousand eight hundred thirty-four new cases of syphilis compared to forty eight thousand HIV infections and three hundred nine thousand cases of gonorrhea whoa Kerry is popular which one what's Rihanna in the night nine thousand cases of gonorrhea and holy that's just for those who thought gonorrhea was over its backyard you understand it's got a rear the clap that's a good question is that the Clapp gonorrhea is the class I would assume it was um two-thirds of syphilis occurred amongst men who have had sex with men Wow most syphilis is gay syphilis interesting there are 377 reports of children with congenital syphilis yeah syphilis is transmitted from person to person it's a bacterium disease caused by long - it's a its cosmic bacterium can cause long-term complications and/or death not adequately treated sores can occur on the lips and in the mouth syphilis can be transmitted during vaginal anal or oral sexual contact

contribute some people get off new people were joined on no I never called one it was it was addictive until I got that bill then I was like how much was it a minute she was expensive yo that's great he's not amazing that they could just charge you to connect your fucking phone lines together and charge you ridiculous amounts of money and you don't even know what you'd sound like you see it like running like a meter so you can go ah just hang it up girls you know but you can't see them you know you're just talking you just I think from your town no idea you no idea it was like yeah I don't know if it was a 800 number or some shit like that I bet a lot of people probably pretend they were from your town you know way from Kansas home from Kansas to come and get you I'm gonna get to I'm on my way I saw a show about a guy who got tricked by these Nigerian scammers and it was fucking sad this poor dude went to Europe twice he believed that this girl was waiting for him in Europe twice all that shit I see that yeah kind of creepy that's fucked up yeah it's like what the fuck man he got went there twice well - sucks yeah yes but that's how you know social media works on the computers like it's just from back in the day when you to make those phone calls to those party lines people just been lonely for ages yeah and he's a way to connect without being in front of somebody and that's why Facebook and MySpace is so successful yeah all was well people literally get sick when they don't have contact with other people if they don't get sick physically they get sick mentally yeah something something goes wrong you're going to a strip club you tell the dues to the fucking lonely bro there beyond chicks gifts no yeah how's your mother how's your brother yeah let's do it dance I really don't want a dancer you when you see those guys and if you interview a stripper or a talking stripper and she starts to tell you those stories your heart breaks yeah you're like really something I can't really give you 800 to sit and talk to you for an hour well when I used to go to visit Eddie when Eddie worked as a DJ you know I got to watch like some really crazy shit you got to see like the girls were just like you know they'd be like your friend like hey what's up hey I doing you know like Eddie was like just like friends with his girls they would come in and then guys would like buy them cars and this one girl the guy came in and she immediately how are you like puts on this act and goes runs over and hugs him and she's like she's really hot and she's naked okay she's really hot and she's naked and the dude is a zero you know he's just a dorky sad goofy confused guy who's just not that good socially and doesn't understand he's being played and I think he had like a regular job to me is like a fucking postman or some shit but he would blow all his money on her and he got her a car like at least her like when those nice Yukons it's like it was crazy it's what they just take him like a vampire's fuck just draw him in and just just because for the guy just to be in contact with a girl like that is enough two chicks the guys that give him the most but the ones they don't fuck yeah they don't want to give in the boat listen when I kidnapped that dude my partner on the deal the reason is motivation like you know when you go to acting class they're like what's your motivation his motivation for the kidnapping was he was dating the chick no no no no no he was friends with a chick at a strip club that danced naked her and her husband had a beef he threw her out she loved the guy I you know the guy but she wouldn't sleep with him cuz she was Catholic she couldn't sleep and so she got divorced this guy was giving her all his mom it's the guys that don't get the pussy that give the most moon yeah it's a story as old as time it's fucking amazing oh I want to be into the stripper part of the story but when you say that time I kidnapped that dude I don't know the stories I can't probably agency data that I saw that time when he told me came to my house they looked at mine's like though we got a kidnapped is more at that time I wasn't the kidnapped he said we gotta rob this dude I need the money I'm like what money he told me the story oh did you have like red flags going off right there yeah he wasn't even robbing a good of it you know he was robbing look for a chick so she could get divorced oh oh his voice gets better he owns the house his mother had a bunch of houses she was a real estate woman he fucking had her and one of the House Office Doug Benson ladies and gentlemen he had her in one of the houses free rent he was paying her rent for it that's so common it's just business it's very fucking girls have been doing that to guys forever but guys have been doing that the girls too man it's like people get played them I think of your card nothing happened well it's also that these guys are so that these girls are so out of their league that they're willing to do almost anything get and they can't believe these girls are even talk to them I mean girls are tens man incredible body beautiful kids look at that ass I can't believe she's sitting on my lap and she's stroking his hair and puts her tits in his face and juggles him back and forth and this dude is gone man he's in heaven this is this is closer to heaven than he's ever been because no girl will ever looked anything like this has ever touched him and no girls ever really wanted to touch him some dudes they go through life without anybody being like really passionate about them ever no one's attracted to them they're socially awkward who knows what kind of fucking weird childhood they had and this girl's can do a number on a dude like that oh man no way she could there's no way you could stop her especially when they you know they got a chick sitting on their lap and they like seeing chicks like this sit on dudes laps in movies you know and it's like you just live in the movie lifestyle just well moment you'll pay for anything can't believe it's but do you believe there's trained agents who are like chicks in the CIA or trained to get fucked to like set people up I hope so hundred percent they've done that yeah 100 percent they've gotten people to the point where they were were undercover and they had to have sex with people unquestionably but they do you think they trained them do you think there's like I'm sure yeah a training center for hot girls you want to apply listen if you're gonna fuck this guy you can't fuck him like an agent okay you gotta fucking luck here you're crazy bitch in your cock monster yeah study these videos yeah this is a girl named Amber Lynn shoot in the 80s she was a monster well just a cock monster I know this dude that runs like Charm School right so he works with the federal government like the FBI like to teach the agents how to not get seduced by women really yeah so that's what you're saying in there is worse is real so that's probably right because it's a powerful weapon I mean yeah you can if you really want to take down a president you can you check that anybody with a body with a woman yeah sex is it's so powerful to someone who can't acquire it it's like one of the most the sweetest nectar known well if you can acquire it on a regular basis it loses its power it's just like getting your heroin fix every day yeah again then nothing it's just fucking heroin there's a lot of functional heroin users there's a lot of functional sex addicts yeah you know when you're involved that type of a crime that's why I always laugh when I read about drug busts or something because of the general probably cuz know when you have that number when somebody's selling 80 kilos a fucking month guess what they don't make that many mistakes right for an agent to infiltrate them they have to do something different yeah like when I was locked up in a federal joint for a couple months I got to meet people told me stories about shooting fucking blow with agents this is what the agents cross the line yeah they just got it up well they haven't see they go to trial they go to rehab and they get there and they don't have in their system so I'm in court yelling I got high with Duncan you know like that was a year ago move it you know prove it but it's amazing you know that's why you know no I'm gonna sell a kilo of coke to a guy who doesn't do coke with me I'm a business really that's the weird fucking thing really that's the weird thing man we're like the cop the CIA agent or whoever does begins to turn into the thing that they're hunting begins to like get sucked into that and then they're the criminal see you have to there's no way look when you go talk to attorneys if you ever get in trouble you go talk to tell you go talk to these dudes are very books more the attorney you want is the guy that knows his way around the court system the guy who went to college with the judge who's gonna cut a deal you went to school with the district attorney you followed me you got these guys are very book smart yeah they know the fucking long litigation that goes so far it's the motherfuckers that could cut a deal together Fattah same thing applies with cops if you're gonna bust a criminal you got to become a criminal you got to think like him that's why these guys they show you all straight-laced that's bullshit you got to think like them there's no way a guy yeah there's no way a guy that looks like whatever sons con you with the Solomon ounce of mushrooms you follow me is that that look like fucking Charles Manson they still have to eat a couple mushrooms in front of you then you'll get them announced there's no way it's common fucking how many times have a jhin's had to do acid in front of process below no fucking gas I used to do acid all but that's how it's local fucking County listen they have County Sheriff Undercovers those are the filthiest Undercovers there are all right Vice are the filthiest Undercovers Daraa and once you hang somewhere you see them come in see when I was a boulder I went to the puddle car wash so they had a contract with the town they would all come in they would just go around with confiscated cars sure if you're a cop and Boulder if you're a competent Boulder Sheriff's Department you don't arrest people in Boulder you go to the mountains and the Undercovers in the mountains come on the boulder so you're taking let's say i confiscate Joe Rogan's badass car I'm gonna drive around Boulder that's dump people gonna go alleged Joe Rogan's car no I take that same car and I go to fuck in Colorado Springs and I become a cop and that's how they do it they don't take your stuff and used it in the same County I became friends with all those County guys those County guys had beards they reek the booze they were out every night it's weird that they can confiscate your shit confiscate your shadow I watched an episode of Top Gear the American version where they confiscated a Corvette zo6 and they turned it into a cop car yeah Jail watching TV going that's my guns your fucking car it sighs it's a you know it's amazing about this deficit that we have because if they confiscate all this fucking blow in cash every year what a pause it go well fuck this go a out are you from Grove County dunk uh yo Tarzan you from Grove Columbus Grove County High School or something you know what that is in Columbus we're thinkin what were you know what Grove is in Columbus now grow something I just like I'm sitting Grove City let me tell you how bad a shape Columbus Ohio is in Grove City to play high school football you gotta pay hundred fifty dollars a semester as a fucking parent for your son to play in a public school dog they had a cancer the program the band of Grove City is one of the top five high school bands in the country don't exist no more don't exist on so you want to talk to me about sending motherfuckers to Mars and shit again you have to pay high school now for your kids to and it's gonna be a growing thing across the country because of the fucking school budgets that if your parents whether you want to play in high school sports now by the Year 2015 you're gonna have to pay for your son to play high school fucking sports my friends so put that in your pipe and fucking smoker it's on tonight with magic if you go home and watch the real sports they did a pretty nice thing I'm magic motherfucking Johnson they said that's the cover he went from dead man to a fuckin gazillion there he went from a fucking dead man to being a fucking gazillion so watch real sports on HBO they always do beautiful fucking things at that shit pay 150 each parents for each kid kids you know you know brother in this they can't afford ridiculous when you think about how much money gets spent on other garbage you know there's 6.8 billion dollars is what we spend a month in Afghanistan 6.8 billion naked 6.8 billion dollars the the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said that they could come up with some incredible web space telegraph telescope the government pulled the plug on it because they didn't have the money they'd have the money to discover new planets and possibly search for life or figure out what got us here or what could prevent the demise of the world instead they got all this money for Afghan why are we still in Afghanistan anyway we got bin Laden what's the deal well if you talk to the really crazy people they say heroin talk to heroin yeah they say heroin the really crazy conspiracy theory guys they say that it's all a big heroin operation well yeah because like if you want to fund black operations so you do it with drug sales because it's untraceable so if the CIA wants to do completely untraceable operations they just blow they confiscated or hair so when we had guys on from vice vice comm they were just saying that essentially there's no other way it could be happening because 90 plus percent of the world's opium and heroin comes from Afghanistan and we're in control of that area and there's video footage of soldiers that are actually a guarding the fucking poppy fields it's craziness it's like you look at it you go this is bizarre shit how is this on television how is this real it's it's all the shit that people in conspiracy theory chatrooms have been saying forever well you got oxycontin what's oxycontin all right synthetic heroin you got all these pills that were losing our minds over a heroin not to mention how much of a fucking profit I invest $50,000 and a pound the heroin I could chop that motherfucker on a fucking kilo Harold right now today if they if they could ever really prove that the government has always been selling heroin police that would be that would be insane times if you really found that out I mean when you say that with the government though it's like it's not really they're all different branches and shit like you can't really blame the FBI if some DEA guys are selling heroin you know you can't blame the NSA if the CIA is doing something because it's kind of all different organizations but if we found out that one of them was actually long-term selling heroin whoo you watch let's say we all feel it marry minute Langston okay all saw the movie American Gangster how the fuck is a black guy from Harlem hey man you're black I know I'm saying i'ma chill like this is your ship like it's such a proud moment in black history that you gotta fight for the negativity no he did that shit how does a black there's no free end up in fucking Vietnam yeah you think that date and that thing was just basically for him he had he'll think that that was no yeah somebody comes up King goes eh sure fuck the guineas I know what he gets in there for sure we're gonna take you to Thailand Thailand yeah let's go to fucking time not only just the Thailand into the city but until the jungles a fucking process and you gotta use a white doing black dude is gonna go in there just like that that's what you're trying to tell me and come back and go in with 200 million cash yeah that's you trying to sell me so he did that alone just and I'm not taking away the nuts from no black dude his brother would go nowhere with 200 G he got to in a gene I got nowhere the God does I'll sit here to this 200 200 million whatever the fuck he took always a wild way to live your life man a lot of people don't believe that story anyway no they don't really it's butanol him oh really what I'm saying he's saying Frank Lucas didn't do that and and they just they just say he was a chauffeur you know there's there's people that downplay him oh yeah he's a chauffeur he didn't do that it's just you know there was three and two of those motherfuckers there was two or three of those motherfuckers that ran in Harlem in the 50s and 60s and all they were were the same thing as my father my real father came from Cuba they needed a fucking face to go in there you know fucking Cubans ain't gonna buy from no Jew and the fucking guineas are gonna the blacks ain't gonna buy from no Italians so they took this fucking they took a couple black guys and they made them they said listen we'll cut you thirty percent thirty percent of five hundred thousand dollar profit that's a lot of fucking money when you live on the fifth floor of a fucking building dawg that's 150 thousand a month you know times three or four so they became pipelines to the black community you know they don't fucking there was no there was no genius there the guineas came to them they cut it 50 fuckin times and they gave it to the brothers and the brothers got it then they fucking sold it and if you go to if you
