four three two one style bender ladies and gentlemen salute sir congratulations man thank you fright your fight Friday night was that was what you would call like a coming-out party yeah in America in America yeah people got to see first fight in Vegas first main event first top-10 guy and I feel like I got to kind of like showed a lot of people look because before that fight a lot of people kind of like yeah it's too much it's too soon like the hype yeah as I all he's this and then for me I wouldn't take insult to it because they don't know you know you can't you can't fault them for it so we did a smart thing in the way you handled your transition to MMA too I mean you really you really took your time it did it right when did you and I talked for the first time about this how many years ago 2015 I think yeah tall you hit me up on this to Graham and said you know what am I gonna call when your fights ya know I was like yeah we'll take our time because it's my coach he's the mastermind behind all this Eugene Mirman and without him my career will be in the shitter so he kind of let just take our time there's no rush smartly on wonder-percent guy you see like looking for a fight guys like example sage Northcutt he's been up and down in the UFC fighter like his rise and stuff like that but you have to you can't just come in here with like maybe three fights unless maybe like a Mickey gall who also has extensive background in something else like jujitsu right but yeah I took my time for the round the world for different body types of different styles and then eventually that thing that UFC were like okay what do you want come on right let's go well you built up a lot of hype outside you built up some hype kickboxing you built up some hype in MMA but you built up a lot of Internet hype yeah there's a lot of highlight videos made of you and people like oh shit look at this guy and then dudes were breaking down your your videos like breaking down technique like look how he sets this up there was one that was at Brendan doorman who did it recently was it a Lawrence Kenshin no maybe was Brendan Dorman the saw yesterday yeah Brendan Dolman he did one where you set that dude up and then left I kicked him oh no that was a Lawrence yeah dude those guys are so important so in fact about that kick we're drilling it I hate you didn't taught it to me that setup probably seven days before and he said if this land is the finisher he said that Wow whatever and then in the fight something happened and I didn't even think about it just boom and it landed and I hurt my foot on his head actually I actually hurt my cuz I was a third flight of the night so as a tournament so to find a fight and I hurt my foot in his hand I was like okay cuz you kind of see me limp a little bit then I went in on him and just yeah I finished it off that was a beautiful high kick man the way he set it up was so interesting too because you forced him into this weird battle of erratic movement like you you did a lot of this with them you got to take care of this first a lot of guys think like what's frost AHA be what he said yeah take care of this scramble your brain dude frost the hobbies and treasure 20% he's a treasure I like the way he thinks podcast and yeah I lied when he said that I was like that's what I that's what we do I like to make these guys second-guess themselves yeah just get stuck like okay he's right here like fucking I got a reset right here okay cool cool oh just got jammed and then they just get flustered and they can talk all this stuff are we gonna do this in this net run and it's different when you see it on TV but when you're in cuz I've had it done to me I've got teammates that do it to me all the time if I'm not on my game they do it to me I'm like so this is what it feels like mmm no I don't want to be on the other side of that so if you come in over train catch me on some days Dan hook is a beast like three weeks Shane young in Singapore myself Friday night and Dan hooker on Saturday Dan hookers one of them never never celebrated in the Octagon guys he's all angry even Jeter caught him Fujita remember and um was a 2-1 line he looked at GW it he means it way looked at his like do you know who I am now and through his mouth go out at the cage but he said it went through the k2 hit you in the chest or something I am now of course you did but like it's cuz like the UFC wasn't really like you know putting them out there they kind of like you're sleeping on him so he just fit he felt frustrated yeah I get it yeah that's just cause he's so ambitious yeah I never said I don't have me in handy with that yeah of course I know yeah third party but all I didn't call fights me and him go at it me Carlos me John vaca BJ plant like so many spike people don't know yeah I've told them like when K 1 was the the pinnacle of combat sports right New Zealand Australasia was on top you had race that for Mark Hunt dog Viney Jason vine more Jordan Thai guys from that side of the world like we run like running it and other side of the world as well but I felt like we fell off and then New Zealand combat sports kind of took a little a low for a few years a long time and now it's we're doing it again like guys like me Dan Shane Kai we're about to like take it to the next level and then bring bring and zette sports again all the way up well you know what's interesting is that New Zealand in particular like you guys there's there's something about having you guys come over here and there's not like a long history where people think of you know exuse eland MMA fighters but New Zealand kick boxers I mean it's one of the most rich environments like think about all the different high level kick boxers that came out of New Zealand or Australia for that matter Australasia in jail yeah yeah crazy crazy number of like really high level kick boxers like when I came to help Rumble with his camp for Jon Jones cuz I Rashad linked it up and said you should come help us out and I said yeah sure so it's a black zillions when it was still around and I was surprised I was that man the stand up in America is not not even close when I left the grappling the wrestling cuz you guys haven't in schools and all the Muslims come here and open the schools and stuff like that part the stand-up was not on our level so I told Eugene that and he's like good I wanted you to know that cuz Doug had the same thing when he went to Vegas and then he saw like man these guys the stand-ups not really on our level so we've always had that um I don't know where it comes from these like a whole lineage of it even ray Sefo we come from the same school sure yeah blg school but yeah grappling and stuff I feel like we were behind at first because you know Internet we get seminars and shit like that I've got obsessive trainers like Adam Johnson he's my jiu-jitsu coach in a way and he's just obsessed so they constantly like upgrading everything and I think it went for him I didn't really get sees much you did too much a little bit in that fight but he or the takedown defense that's all Andre as well my wrestling coach is a romanian guy so we're we don't need to like go anywhere else I felt like we've we've got people where we are with stacked enough to be able to level up and compete with the rest of the world well if you've got someone like Dan hooker in your camp just doubt a lot when you have guys like you and him together that's what forces everybody to the next level and everybody around you will rise up to they'll see what you're doing they'll see your fight with Tavares see some your fights online to see you in the gym and you when you have a guy like that in the gym I've always experienced this in jujitsu and everything else everybody else's level rises up to try to catch up to that guy cuz this all they see like you guys are what the world sees is just awesome TV mm-hmm and then they see like the highlights the cool stuff but my teammates get to see me fuck up all the time they see me get my licks of course so when they see all that stuff then they see me on the world stage kicking ass didn't like men of course I can do it's like Brad Brad world Oh bad ass kick box a world champion one of my teammates or angry panda but he's he's moving making his move to MMA now right now but um he's he's another one of those guys that he and kickboxing doesn't really do for him he's B's like built like a Chad Mendes type guy short stocky pretty thick and he can wrestle you know but no one knows that yes so whenever he comes into him and may or the UFC then everyone's gonna be likely to take him down let's see what could happen but yeah they find out eventually there's guys from that section of the world me really stop and think about between new between New Zealand and Australia how many world-class kick boxers holy shit a lot yeah and they've run dude not just from this era but even back in the day right Dennis Lexi oh right wasn't yeah writing so yes he for me what kickboxing from Hawaii I know I know I know I'm like say up to race F Wednesday's like Mark home I never really invested in k1 back in the day I just got thinking Longinus I think Stan Longinus was from Australia why not like there's a deep-rooted history and kickboxing lost a lot of stuff why what happened there how that gets the idea that's a great that's it that if you want to speak to someone Eugen would be the guy or Tojo they're the guys I have the history just up here but for me I just came in and I enjoyed it and I jumped in the pool well from the United States you have there are some big kickboxing camps but also you get a lot of guys have come here from Holland and from other kickboxing rich places and goofed sure sure and of course guys who fought over there and came over here like Alistair and you entered into MMA it's just it is interesting that you know for MMA gyms there's like a certain level of striking and then you see like a Nikki hold skin will come and you start training with those guys and you realize it was there when I was there yeah a little bit of a sparring he's good what's happening to him now obviously him in a while I think he's boxing now well yeah yeah I think he's decided that there's more money in boxing and you know he's winning hands as well he does got a nasty left hook that bloody rope mm-hmm yeah I like a stop well I think kickboxing like if I wanted to take the boxing blueprint I could have done that cuz I'm six and one in boxing as well so I could have done that and just got built up fighting like you know the cans fight some champions local champions from national champions and eventually on the world stage but for me I just I never wanted to feel vulnerable I never wanted to feel like another guy could kick my ass in another dislike you know Floyd Mayweather you about to do this fight with McGregor part two and they had all these stupid rules like okay no I think that was all fake yeah I know but like even if the idea of it I'm like if you're gonna do it just jump in what do we doing okay we you're a man like you know fuck you we're gonna do it man-to-man well he'll kick stones no kicks going no knees no elbows and I had that bike it's just I don't understand on my why if you want to prove you're the best fighter you have to fight people from all the codes right and this is at the UFC that's the highest level you know so I've entered into any wrestling competition or jujitsu gravitation competitions I have only place on submission yes a mission I never I've never been first problem like you the second third or somewhere else but yeah I've only ever done maybe four or five in my career you have a specialty no and I've always felt like guys who have a specialty if they can get to a certain amount of good at this other thing without abandoning their skills as a specialty always gonna have that giant advantage I agree and it's just it's a same thing whatever got them to what they good at and they say boxing wrestling they can do the same sure Gary tonin was if I he had a one Fc or won one championship and not with one two yeah that wasn't a jujitsu stop punch that wasn't like amateur like a guy who was never strike a strike before he actually looked like he was flowing well with a stand-up and that's cuz the same thing happens in jujitsu or with you know this whatever made him great at grappling can make him great at stand-up as well yeah for sure I mean it's there's obviously there's the added element of getting hit that something can't psychologically handle as well yeah we know thanks yeah it makes a big difference I used to be but they never liked niver watch my fight after after happened I look I keep looking at what's happening I'm searching for people I'm searching for shots or whatever but a lot of people kind of like either flare arm close up or they not turn away but like they just trying to use the wall and you can't really use that in MMA cuz the gloves they don't help running kickboxing you can just like right I saw you with air nam la when I fought them for the glory World title yes that kind of style like you can just jog and not yeah down and beat the legs exactly the big gloves you can still find your ways around them and they made this the ring was probably put three of these tables together that was the ring it was smaller broke you in I crack I cracked the court I was able to get my footwork around them even this cage was big enough for people that was the cage smaller I was that yeah but I was big enough for me to think about that palms cage that I really like is is I feel feel like it's the right size I feel like I setup I feel like the you regularly you have see cage is big and I like that it's big but it might be too big yeah Mike for me it was it was small but it wasn't like oh my god yeah like in the phone before yeah I mean it looks like you had massive a lot better than a kickboxing right yeah whatever you think about that it's very rare you get a boxing ring that has anywhere near the kind of distanced from corner to corner yeah do you a good but do you have see this there's some pros and cons I think but it's a con when it's a fight like in Ghana versus Derek that's when it's a kai of a video of me before that fight all yelling somebody got a die Frances way to 53 I was like oh normally Jackie look yeah he looked he looked like he took it very fuckin serious I thought he was gonna realize that he got out wrestled and out conditioned he's gonna come back guns blazing and try to put a beating on Derek but he was so talented even with a fight like Stephen wonderboy Thompson and um dare until that five people were like it was born I was like hell no like I enjoy that fight but it was just small margin for error to stand up guys who you know you can understand the game where it's like the full placement you know faints all that kind of shit yeah and then people were like you know that sucked I'm like well you don't understand you know striking on that level but that Darren Lewis fight and Francis it was like I tried and just can't it was just yeah whose goal it was the number two least amount of strikes whenever in a three-round fight yeah and they both beast they both I know I motherfuckers boy no they both been in crazy fights like a they both been in nothing but exciting fight yeah except for you know some brief moments so it's just a psychological issue I guess who knows I said they said it was to do like like a PTSD from his last fight like shit I don't want to like get hurt again or whatever but he took a beating in that last fight as well he did people don't realize he did he got fucked up in that fight like in five rounds what people don't see is how he felt after it's six hours later ten hours later 24 hours later his head's pounding and headache close all the drapes and yeah yeah I'm gonna be a fighter he's only been doing it for five years that's really crazy and that's the thing he's just look at him I'm the runt of my people you go to Nigeria there's literally picks of the litter when I went back down my you should not be playing football big money in it but I think like MMA is right you can just grab any of those kids and give him some boxing gloves show them how to sprawl sure no matter how to wrestle and they're beasts like ten in Ghana's ten John Jones is just walking down the street I'm the bum I had the same size head and I was just a skinny boy so I look like a lollipop I was a long bro honestly just a runt of the litter I had to work I had to develop I think maybe like around 15 I started to get taller so every time I come back from school or from a holiday after school's birthday you got taller ain't got taller and then somehow I just filled out realized I go athleticism and then later on like I was never the athletic kid playing basketball or anything like that I was just the runt when'd you get into martial arts I started in Taekwondo when I was a kid just cuz after school programs and wants fun such a good one for kids man yeah it was fun that's what I like that was cool but um yeah and then I think I almost got my yellow belt and my mom kind of pulled me out cuz I was just wrecking shop around the house kicking everything I broke my arm doing back foot off the couch oh and she's just like that no more and yeah I found out you know unblocked to the Tony Jaa film I found that uh maybe into 2008 yeah it doesn't hate early today I found that and I was about 18 and those I know this is cool I don't know what this is and then I found that was MoIT I found a Muay Thai gym and then six weeks later I had my first fight Wow yeah that's crazy yeah I found a video of that first fight actually I'll throw it off how old were you 18 I was 18 Wow yeah I'm glad people isn't that a little bit too late but I'm glad that happened because I didn't feel like I was worn out because I've seen some kids who protegees fighting from like the age of 12 or 10 and then like a no-smoking shoes and like they get to a certain point and they just like wanna do something else not all of them some of them yeah sometimes they come back as well but sometimes I just find I'm sick of this you know I wanna do something else you find out a lot with like sons of trainers yeah it was actually the son of them one of my my first trainer and he's doing something else now but yeah for me I think 18 was a good year like good age to start and I just felt fresh it was something I want to do after my first fight I was just chasing that again that feeling because I've always been a dancer as well so I like that roar of the crowd so after my first fight again people that probably I was sick and I'm like what the fuck did I do I don't remember it he just went into his own yeah bro I was scared the guy looked like David twohy you know when David Tua haircut yeah he he was not 80 kgs he was probably like maybe 92 might what is 92 in cadiz pounds okay maybe 205 so 80 kgs would have been like say 185 175 or something so he was way over where yeah what the true my trainer kind of just he was a crazy dude so he just let it go and that when you you have to realize that at a certain point I realized okay this is not the guy to get me to that level I want to be me so I left and I moved to Auckland using Auckland the main city was your trainer encouraging brawls too much or he wanted me to fight his style like what was a like he'd always tell me like you need to have your hands up and you know he was a real purist of my time so he wanted me to have that you know like this way and stuff like that and that's the difference between someone that wants you to fight like them and someone like Eugene my coach when he first saw me just like cool we can work with that like he never try to make me fight any ain't like like him he never trying to make me do anything like this guy he just said okay I want you to jab like this and he would almost be like trying to get someone to write songs like the songs they write exactly this is expressionist art let me do me and it really is yeah and he could never understand these I put your hands up and I I like my boobs and people could still say get your hands up I'm like that's textbook I don't read the text but I had a look at it it was alright I like the balance I feel when I'm over here like my takedowns I was able to stuff them cuz my hands are already low and I can still show up when I need to I can still fly hands up when I need to but I like there's a different iteration when you have to stop takedowns yeah yeah kickboxing my hands were always down a lot of the times having the ability to get an underhook or double underhooks quickly but in kickboxing like my jab from there from the lows from I can't see what's going it's there's definitely pros and cons to everything but a guy who's got to kind of speed that you have could take advantage many times more of having hands low yeah it's really look at Roy Jones how the folks say how can you fuck you say hands downs no good right junior kept his hands down all that dies as well you have to I think you can train the eyes because my eyes were I was always quick reflexes by thinking and train the eyes mmm the certain ways just the Roy could just land that lead level yeah like his shoulder I think he just snap yeah crazy you remember that one with the four right hooks he hit that guy with remember he had giant biceps but he didn't have big triceps yeah like everything was hooks it was all like from throwing on the rock that's the thing most people I was leading with jabs as well so that would never help him lead left hook that was something different at the time that no one could figure out they couldn't crack the code Roy Jones jr. in his prime people-people it's like a song it's like his song gosh yeah oh they forgot that his song yeah because people did forget like what the first box I ever saw when I was a kid because I never really watched fights I was you know playing with sticks toys whatever making my own shit but I saw Prince Naseem Hamed and I remember this when I was about four but he was because I've always seen boxing on TV but he was the first box I saw that just made me pause and watch and just smile and laugh like what is this he was doing crazy shit yeah just because the way he moved and guys are boys I've always been drawn in guys like that like Ali even Rashad when he was in his prime doing this thing Roy Jones you know I preneur Whitaker sweet pea like just people forgot about Whitaker exactly it slept on him that shoulder roll I mean he was a master before we really saw it from Mayweather Mayweather obviously he gets hit less than anybody that's ever lived yeah you think about the fact that guy is 50 you know and really I mean you think about talks well doesn't this Ostler a good count uh-huh yeah I mean equipped him with one left hand like real clean and that was uppercut yeah a couple other punches but none of them were like dangerous he rolled with them yeah I rolled with everything fucked up in my fight because I at one point after I felt his jab I was like you know what I can just close the distance a little bit more and then that's how I got this shiner right here but the right hands this right side is fine cuz I was just rolling with a lot of them I was rolling with a lot of them so you just underestimated his jab I underestimated his head movement at first so in the beginning he was moving away from my jab and I usually said I drop it down drop it down to the chin a little bit and I did but eventually I could adjust I think from round two I figure out the range but his jab it wasn't as powerful as I want as I assumed it would be so I thought I can just take and give and that's how I got this shiner right into one of them but yeah it was a big mistake silly mistake so on the same card Uriah Hall fought polo coach yeah what a lot of people are thinking that might be the next fight four years old Dana funny story so we went to him I hope after my fight I chilled in my hotel room just hung all my boys but then after dance but I went out and someone told all Dana's in this club he's saying oh that's whatever and when I got some money and I was talking to the guy that led me and then cuz he found out my UFC fighter he just led me to the private room and I see McMahon I might what the hell and then we just thought yawning I talking to people and he's a cheater Dana and I finally meet Dana properly and we start talking and I dropped this name in there say yeah I want to fight Paula next and he's like and they have other ideas you know fair enough but I can they've done this a long time they're promoters you know so I think what they want is me you know being a bigger name Paul being a bigger name and we fight like in some super fight mm-hmm I mean and I can see what that you know why that but for me I wanna I want to take him out now he just knocked out VR Hall yeah was talking mad shit as well you know but yeah I want to take him out now before because he's gonna probably fight again we'll probably fight more than once cuz he's in one of those guy well see what happens how long is the UFC career last but I think he'll probably fly with me and probably fight more than once yeah I would imagine that as well I was very impressed with him versus Uriah Hall it's interesting because the contrast between your fight on Friday night and his fight on Saturday night that was just a brawl like a technical brawl mm-hmm he got hit with a lot of jabs but he is a relentless marauding motherfucker that guys he's yeah and this thing's footwork Uriah Hall I was watching my why you right there it's easy to look good against someone who just sits right there like a punching bag you know Uriah had tremendous potential when we saw him in the Ultimate Fighter sorry but it also might be similar to what you were talking about with sage Northcutt where who are also think as true still has tremendous potential and still very young yeah I think there's an approach to take that you took that I think is really smart you know where I got it from one of the talk shows UFC talk shows kenny floor and just said it he said um get your experience outside the UFC before you go them in the UFC was words ten fights nine fights and just like fight a lot of good guys not just like some you know listen to me man you don't want to fight you on your second fight right imagine you're a guy you can throw a couple good punches you think you're a badass and then you're stupid coach says okay you gonna fight this guy they call him the style bender fight anybody I'll fight for the title mentality yeah those guys they get lit up and they don't understand they really don't understand jump in a pool to quick conversation with a friend of mine who's a jujitsu he was badass Jiu Jitsu and he said he was going to go into MMA and I'm like okay how long you been training striking and he's like well you know he goes for the last four months pretty regularly oh my god are you out of your fucking mind I go listen to me man he's a black fella jujitsu like nasty on the ground I'll think about what you could do if I was a white belt and I came in here and I didn't know shit and I was like a strong guile maybe you know played basketball or something like that was just aesthetic and I tried to fight you how bad would you fuck me up on the ground right now think of someone doing the exact same thing like that to you would stand up because you don't understand that there are guys who can do that lows there's a Tyrone Spong there's you there's these high level kickboxer say you don't have a chance you think you have a chance cuz you're fast you don't have a chance you're gonna get hit you're gonna get fucked up and you're gonna get hit multiple times and they're gonna chip away at you until they decide to move in for the kill and they're gonna fuck you up there's not a damn thing you could do about it and it's almost the same as him grabbing a white belt letting him flail around and then eventually choking him it's an inevitable thing but the weird thing is some people don't see that they don't see that someone could do to them in a certain art they don't study objectivity yeah that's the thing like for me I'm always thinking like in anything why am I doing this why am I feeling this way right or right or wrong and that's why I said I moved to any makers I just know I want to be the best you know I could have been the best kickboxer ever I think that best boxer as well but I just thought in my eyes the guy who could fuck you agree fine you know just on the ground I've seen so many street fights so many street fights I'm like dude okay just push your knee down you know that just holding each other and just hitting hitting I'm like you can easily just choke the guy right now if you knew what you were doing so he's a champion 80% of street fights end up on the ground and people don't know what they're doing so I just felt like I never want to be in a situation where a guy like gets me in an alleyway and tries to like fuck me up and just snap my ankle or some shit but I just feel like I want to be able to be well-versed take care of all areas and I'll probably never get there or I'll die trying well how will you know 28 I'll be 29 dude in a few years I'll still literally you're still at least a year waist or two years away from you're suppose physical right an athlete that they say that for a professional athlete obviously they say everybody's different but there's something around age 30 to 32 where your mind and body catch up and you have a window there like Anderson Silva when he was like 32 32 was going I remember that was right the first one I saw alive was UFC 90 he fought Patrick Cote oh yes but like for me that far is very smart but that first round he used like probably seven different styles to just hit him and then I keep saying he uses telekinesis on his knee he just blowed it out but like Patrick had a fucked-up knee going into that final thing already hard to tell but it seemed like he gave it was good fight it was a good fight he just stood out in just yeah went to like throw a front kick and it just buckled on and hopped out yeah number like that fight that first round the way he just handled him I was like that yeah that's the guy you know what it really did open up the recipe to giving Anderson trouble though because the recipe to give me a nurse instruct Alice latest opened it up and so in mind Cote know but the real key was don't engage because if you chase after him he's gonna fuck you up slacker Forrest Griffin all these different people that came at him for sure Chris Leben mmm that was how the first 196 recipe for disaster I mean I knew when I saw that fight on paper I was like oh this is crazy you got a guy who's like the most reckless iron chind Marauder in the UFC and you're putting up him against a guy who's like a ninja hmm and this is gonna be crazy and this is a perfect fight it was a perfect fight in terms of like what you want to see like the effectiveness you have like high level timing speed and perfect technique whoa yeah and the way he did it was well as clean I think you only gonna hit once that fight he landed like hundred percent of his shots yeah and that fight yeah it was beautiful crazy and that's our style I was a counter strike at first that's when I started I was always like I'll wait for guys to come in here here it is right because I was afraid I was a fan of Anderson's from look at that look at that jab I was a fan of watching him fight in England and cage rage and watch him fight in Pride and I remember saying this ladies and gentlemen this is a different kind Streicher hmm this is this is one of the first times you got a high-level look at the looks he's given him as well shoulder faints and those feet man that bounce he's on people forget man look how good his pain he's over yeah it's fun to get up again yeah and then he ping ping ping this is her bra let me come on man almost every shot Lance he's not getting him it's incredible do full moons over insane and Chris was a beast man you could take a shot you could take it all the top there's one with him I was not my Eastern it was a guy rocked him and he as he's moving back as he's hurt and he drops the guy knocks him out cold yeah no Chris could take a tremendous shot he was a head unbelievable heart but Anderson I feel like in that that's my argument for Anderson being the goat yeah it's there's more years that's him and phaidor right yeah I saw his kid the other day after my fight I didn't reckon I was like in the elevator you're Anderson's son knew that yeah baby goat the only other person is the current guys is Mighty Mouse the argument against mine announces he's cleaned out division out he doesn't have a Chris Weidman you know a guy who's trying to fuck him up he doesn't have like someone who you really give a chance I was level right I mean there's never been a Mighty Mouse had a chance on and who had him down on points in the 4th round fucking him up and then he catches him in a triangle no that fly wait wait and he dominates man he just runs through people you think he's gonna fight them what's his name no he's right Mighty Mouse is fighting pseudo in a rematch which he's got better yeah so who'd have got better than Islam since the first fight yes Olympic gold medals in wrestling that's all you need to know and it stand up as well as clean he's kind of improved I'll give him Croghan credit yeah Wilson Hayes fight yeah yeah yeah he was crazy yeah so you can learn fast that's another guy great at wrestling transfer that greatness into learning stand-up and now just mixing them together that's the thing if you have to look at GSP they're just learning how to like mesh them together without like they're getting stuck I'm thinking too much flowing with it yeah that's yeah I think particularly the Wilson hates five because it showed that he can adjust his style like pretty radically yeah gave credit where credit's due well again when you're gold medalist in the Olympics and wrestling that's a special kind of human being that's next level it's just a special kind of human being the wrestling training I do now I'm like fuck Wednesdays it's vo2 max called a rate wrestle Wednesday just because it's like air dine and then wrestling it's two minutes on the air dine going hard with the heart rate monitor trying to get to the red zone and then wrestling for two minutes trying to get to the red zone and shot to Kevin Kevin Bentley he's the guy that showed me the most this camp so you know my hips or on point cuz every time I like stuff a takedown get back up alright boom another one after like Jesus crashes leave me alone cuz he's just on you like a blanket yeah so that kind of work is hot so imagine being a gold medalist what kind of wrestling training it takes to get to that level well that's why when you see a real high level wrestler against almost everybody else they have such a noted advantage in the clinch like Daniel Cormier and Stevie Miocic this weekend yeah what I mean Dominick Cruz such a we're very fortunate to have a guy that knowledgeable in in because Dominic's knowledgeable about basically everything started out as a wrestler but he understands MMA as good as anybody that's ever talked on the mic about MMA he's very clued up so when he talked about like he showed me some stuff that I hadn't caught about Daniel's giving up the the underhook so that he could limp arm and then steep a would run right into the right hand they had it all timed out yeah I really broke another foul just already lazy I was yelling off my face it's like wow dude when he connected and then he hit him I don't even know if I said anything cuz I remember I was going like I thought like that rounds fire there was a deja vu moment world just shipped these not come out and no a no so so close is a beautiful picture man they've been working together for so long when John Anik stands up and he looks each other beautiful look at that picture cuz who the fuck else is a two-time world champion in two divisions and also a commentator currently and a great working two jobs god I love that guy man more like these chunky as well yes he just like Chucky's nice way of putting it no honestly that was a girl what would you call her boy to Division champion his nutrition he says like 246 but he doesn't move like 240 seconds right yeah hundred percent so it's deceptive yeah you look at him like even Marcone he's another guy like that but last autumn saturday the way he was moving well house was talking about it in camping and so was Bob cook they were telling me after the fight they go dude and heavy wood he's knocking everybody out in training part it's almost forgot about Strikeforce how about that undefeated Strikeforce fucking Grand Prix having a champion tossing upper net Bigfoot dropping him all that kind of shit alright and that was brought up with five rounds and he wasn't even like he was early and I was early in his MMA career yeah so I was like you guys don't understand so I thought was gonna be DC putting him against the fence grinding him out for five rounds and still beating him up for like I'm fucking tomorrow and back and forth but knockout in the first round that was just crazy I thought story DC was gonna win it what was gonna happen was they were gonna get into the second and third and they were gonna start getting tired and DC's wrestling was gonna take over yeah those are five rounds yeah mr. DC but I felt like he had to somehow or another where ste pay out a little bit before he gets takedowns yeah it's the face I thought that would be the smart thing to do but I thought it was real dangerous standing up because steep a is knocked out Junior dos Santos longer Alistair Overeem knocked out for Bri silver doom with one punch I mean you think all the people steep a is knocked out to go damn and DC's coming up as a light heavyweight yeah it's time we were seen DC hurt was a rumble right yeah Jones obviously forget that to capitalize brilliantly on a tendency you know he knew that DC that's off the body yeah leaning mm-hmm what's interesting is that Dominick Cruz explained this to me as well is that this is how DC prefers to set up the single and that he prefers to leave that slide leaning towards his right side and then dive in on the single that's his preferred technique it's very strong and dragging you to the ground from that position mmm everyone does every live even John Jones myself when I was watching my fight I've only seen it once I was after the fight rewinding I took about an hour and a half to finish watching it just rewinding playing drinking all my friends won not because their understand I just like to be myself and just chill so they just doing their own thing and then we're just playing games but I watch it to see what I did right and I enjoy okay this is what I did good blah blah blah but then I see if I was fighting me hard I fucked me up now like see certain things okay this is I need to work on tendency certain tense and change it up confuse people scramble them some of the things I was doing in that fight I've never done in training cuz example elbow pads we don't haven't really more than elbow pads and training just knee pads I was using that I'm on back elbow to set up how to close a distance and I was watching I was like what did I learn that from I don't know you watch I did it probably three times I'd use the fake on back elbow to close the gap and I'd gallop in and catch them with a right hand or something why never like certain certain things like that with things like that good but then I can't really say that but do you think that maybe that when you learn it's almost like you're learning words like in these words or techniques and then combinations or sentences and then in like having the mastery of all these words you just see a new sentence that you could say yeah I was like I throw those obviously even though you don't do it a lot in sparring he just sees something he's doing like you know what this is what I'm gonna this and then come in here and it was like that one was nice but there was one of my last fight before that in Arizona Sean O'Malley throws this like spin and then the head kick mhm and in the fight I was like it feels right boom the first time I ever landed it and it caught him on the back of the head oh good I just kept them moving with it yeah true when Yair Rodriguez 360 roundhouse kicked BJ Penn in the face wondering when are we gonna see this I've done knocked out knocked down a heavyweight with like a tornado kick and I learned that about a month and a half before shot some David that he's the Taekwondo champion from New Zealand and he told me cuz I should throw it with the right of roundhouse and then spin with it and he said that's too much telegraphing you're showing the guy I'm gonna kick because he'll lean back and come back so he said go southpaw and use your torso so I'll give it away yeah you throw your shoulder your left shoulder from southpaw it's a guy after a few right hands so you kind of I'm gonna throw a right hand and then spin that's been right they could like one a tional so you know so that spin right there generates the force and I was able to knock down the knocked down the guy with it I never hit anybody with that he'll be back with that a lot exactly make sure they can't move so I'd like to do it with me against the fence or they against the ropes so that way they have nowhere to go not as much space to move around but if you're in the open it's hard to land land that you know what's really remarkably effective is that Raymond Daniel's sidekick to jump spinning back-kick I can do it on the bag I definitely did it in sparring before but when I saw Rick Rufus with the one of his first fights it's a really important fight with a Thai champion okay where he was fucking him up in the first round we played it back because it was a really interesting moment I think on YouTube it's labeled as the most important fight in kickboxing and what it was was the first fight where we got to see Rick Rufus in his prime faced a Thai champion and he stood and Rick was winning in the beginning and one of the things that he hit him with he did he did that touch side kick spin back kick in the air this is it the fight to change history is this Lawrence Kenshin as well yeah yes that guy's a treasure love his work yeah go google him or check out his videos on YouTube he's got so many he and I like the way they kind of work off each other's were like a lot of these guys they don't really um there's no competition they are working through together for the rock court and Robin black as well he's crazy yeah what I really love about Lawrence though is that you know he breaks down things and shows them in slow motion as his Brenda doorman and and Jack slack there's a lot of these guys it was that I don't look lighter and I remember how much Rick wait I know he went up to like 200 pounds but I think he started out in the 60s or 70s at the most this tie guy's pretty thick check out the pants yeah well he didn't understand how to deal with the leg kicks yeah this was this was a chewed him up early in the fight I think in the first round see this what this is showing is how the tie starts taking over with the leg kicks but I think in the first round he hit him with that side kick jump spinning back kick to the face and really hurt him this is Lawrence's breakdown instead this is this is just gonna show how he lost see how he tried to throw that body kick hijacked yeah yeah nice pulled by to the head why - I dropped oh yeah no Rick had his moments in this fight in the shore and it showed just what a dangerous striker he was but we didn't we just really didn't know back then about the leg kicks a the ones huh yeah I felt some Thai guys their legs their legs literally feel like just concrete yeah they're broken down from here and mine are right I feels like a Stegosaurus is back but sometimes when you feel it's like steel dude I felt so the first time somebody kicked me in my leg I felt so vulnerable yes I couldn't believe how easy it was under percent the ferp my first thought was goddamn and I have to recalibrate everything I thought about fighting I fought a karate guy kyoka shaking guy maybe two hours notice because my opponent decided at the weigh-ins he's like I'm not fighting him and then like this guy Jaime is who I fought I think four times now so he came over to corner one of his teammates and he was a national key occasion champion I'll fight him cool jump in the ring and it's padded fight everything yep two leg kicks in I was like whatever I can keep going and then by the fourth one I remember like okay don't do that again and then from there was too late that was only in the first round he ate my legs he ate my legs and I remember for about three weeks after that fight walking was just I didn't want to walk every time I but can you pass me this all just like crawling places and I hate walking but funfair how many how long about three weeks maybe two two and a half three weeks after that fight and it's just you know your legs are dead heavy filled with blood and it's just any little movement cuz your knees swollen as well sharp pain oh I hated it fucking hey I'm gonna take before you recovered probably yeah about three weeks before we I heal quick my honesty is we're not crazy yeah I don't know the why eco-tour when you fought Pedro his ode needed six months of rehab shit six months six months he still has a dent in his leg apparently from Pedro gave a dent to Kevin Randleman - yeah I never saw anybody kick a guy like Pedro yeah or kick a people soon like the the mid-90s and bas Rutten was running it back at the time and pedro rizzo was over there who lost dude he had they had this big-ass 200 pound fucking heavyweight and Pedro his old did that thing it made me so nervous was it hanging off the ground or was it it's a head I don't think makes the bones just heavy bones as well dance motherfucker dick dude big boys the legs were giant but it was there was a feeling of this very you know sometimes you hear someone or you see someone kick something or something you go oh I could never that no one gave that you can't take that Pedro had that yeah that you can't take that he hit Rico Rodriguez once and Rico was like I'm going down he's like I just try to bring this guy to my guard up with you he hit him so hard that Rico stayed on the outside the whole fight he never really he never really completely committed to trying to win the fight was a heavy way right yeah the guy with the problem PD problem wrong guy Rico get popped for PE news maybe I don't as a documentary on them no no no no marker oh yeah Rico I don't think Rico got popped but Rico was a Machado Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt heavyweight champion I think I'm an American wrestler I think Tim Sylvia beat him for the title yeah Tim Sylvia when he was at the top of his games a big giant motherf---ing still fighting no retired now he just Bo hunts and Iowa that's all giant now shit he's 300 plus he's like six six foot nine boy I always looked at him one thing I was just Gumby like a big guy but he could four people up he was like a you know I go like we get a baby giraffe trying to figure out its steps mm-hmm but he just knew how to move and how to use happiness Twitter its with advantage well if you go to the Golden Age of Tim Sylvia pull-up Tim Sylvia chaos Rico Rodriguez this is the Golden Age of Tim Sylvia back when Mexican supplements but easy to combine with all the PD kind of talk for me I kind of I thought yeah some people thought you know take steroids whatever but after I seen Icarus everyone's on steroids well everyone in a lot of holy fuck I was just like everyone not but like this the cheaters always gonna be a head of the solution the guys will catching them so whoever is on the new shit they can't get caught just yet so they update their testings ya know what I mean so it's like I watched that I realized if you have the team behind you you have people can fund it everyone's on steroids don't you think that you Sado they hold their piss for a long time right don't they hold your piss for like eight years I thought I'm just yeah use it for research whatever yeah but I think they hold on to it just in case new testing comes out so they can test it again they took gold medals away from two Russian cats in 2000's yes they went back and with new testing found I think they found EPO in their sister yeah it's a interesting think that documentary was a main change money open my eyes and I had a piss test the next day as well cause they yeah I told the guy I've seen this I saw this on the documentary last night I think the little cup they were using so yeah I was like who knows who's on steroids now and when the value sort of came through you know the guys that kind of like their bodies changed somebody who dropped off radically yeah so quick really quick like oh damn I never thought yeah like it's not just changed but change to the point where like you're not even the same person yeah you like doing an impression the guys in their 20s doing them an impression of who they were just a couple years ago on the sauce yeah shit's happening man snitchin Nowitzki is a good guy man he's just like he's got a bad reputation from a lot of people that could be cool with him cuz I'm you know I'm not cheating I'm not a guy that anymore I mean now he's what is his official title it's like athletes those helmets II don't want to be hanging around him like the wire would or wouldn't be as friendly with him because they don't want him sniffing around he's there to make sure that's funny yeah oh I'm glad he's around man honestly cuz you know you want I don't mind being an ambassador for the sport it's not like a clean sport cuz yeah back in the day even as early as 2010 hey Tim Sylvia Sylvia Rico Megan its own fight passing on that's it oh I can't find it anywhere damn it's weird like we look at him talking this like oh right I quit my job September 4th 2013 before I before I quit that job I think you're the first pause cat podcast I started listening to now I've got a few others like a like a whole list but I remember having those my headphones in my head just one so I could focus on the other things and my boss would just ride me for so long like just take that shit out your ears stop missing the music I'm like I'm not I'm just trying to be entertaining so I don't go postal on your niggas because that it was just you can enjoy what you do so before I when I was living in China I knew a lot of guys I fought but they didn't enjoy it they just did it cuz it makes good money and they get paid and I'm like do something else but for me doing that job holy shit so sucking every single day you know you wake up train and then it was just a block away and not walk to work and I just knew I was gonna get just ridden that day and man but it's kind of crazy now I'm checking in like I'm actually out here like I've listened to this was so long and it's like yeah I belong here now like it's weird everything just seems normal good good perfect that means you hit the right time it means you've got a good sense of timing just like something like even in my room I had a nice suite for this one shot to the UFC is that that main event status so I had like a nice little spot can join the rooms with my teammates and sometimes I'll just overlook the t-mobile Arena and just be like okay we were like we've made it we're out here no we're not done yet but you're there yeah hunt okay let's go and they just can't check back in you're in the UFC and now I mean you how to break into the top ten with that fight I don't think the rankings have come out fuck rankings I want to see like are so stupid you know they fucked up Paul Felder Paul Felder would have got that shot against khabib in what is the welterweight so it shouldn't even affect it shouldn't even affect the lightweight ranking no shit I'm not talking about that fight I'm the reason why Paul Felder didn't get that fight with khabib when Tony Ferguson hurt his knee it was a great chance that a commission wouldn't recognize him his wasn't ranked in the top 10 that wouldn't recognize him to be out of a great fight great fight but I Quinta was a fight and handle that well Paul Felder is a big fuckin lightweight yeah and Paul Felder has outstanding striking that would be a real interesting fight alright % so just cuz the rankings didn't let that go just because the rankings he notes that rankings that's not me I want to know who decides what that lie is it like a comment with it now but like what have they done what's their credentials where they trained have they fought are they just like analysts are they experts because it feels like if you will it be instead of figuring out who did it let's think about what you would do differently like what who do you think should be who do you think should be making the rankings maybe X Fighters X 5 or like someone who's been in the sport someone who's trained same thing let you say we're judging someone who's actually like that's all under snow dirt um there's the shit out of me man after my second fight in the UFC I fought in Glendale right it was a split decision I got in my head when they said you know Israel 50 whatever ha sorry 39 38 Adesanya how's that all fuck just don't cuz my wind bonus I don't give a fuck about my record I'm just like don't fuck me out of my money don't fuck with my money like one other incompetent judge and that would be in it yep yawn yeah only half my money yeah and now to piss me off so crazy like what have you done like how the fuck did I lose that fight in your eyes it is not a guy biggest problems the other other commissions have can't they just like it seems like it's too much work like it shouldn't it should be like it may be a group chat like okay let's change the twelve to six elbow who's agree yeah yeah yep that was like that's a no-brainer that one's the dumbest one of all time like it's what is it why it takes so long to try and make a change in the spor years well how about the weight classes Jesus you know Kevin Kevin Lee tweeted the other day that there's something like a hundred and fifty different fighters in between 155 and 170 I think he said more than that yes I said what he said about him almost died felt like he was gonna die one way well definitely no 1855 he that's Kevin it is scary you should be probably fighting 171 to 165 class I read on that tweet well it's a good class it should be 55 65 75 85 95 225 I blue 185 195 if that was me I'll take that though I would be jumping between those two why not I mean that's doable yeah I think the real problem is you give guys like 85 205 that's 20 fucking pounds man that's a lot of weight yeah I walk around 205 if I'm healthy like yeah if I'm DC it out well that's good that's a good amount of weight to cut like I bet when you get real lean you probably lose like six seven then you're only losing really cutting like what 10 this cam I didn't use a song I didn't use a bath for this fight nice normally like the last two I did and I was underweight just and I was only cut a little bit as well but this one I woke up on the way do you use an expert to help you like a Lockhart I'm gonna maybe for the fight week use Lockhart next time maybe but like normally I just I've done this for a long time some I know my body and I'm always accurate so I can feel like I'm about 98 kg or 90 three cages to them about 85 Katie's right about rehydration do you yep Lockhart method the old one is a whole system like with the waxy maize amino acids eating pineapples with crackers and honey and whatnot so I follow the list and my why pineapples with cracker and honey I don't know it's on the list it's a Lockhart one it's uh yeah I feel it's like carbohydrates from the crackers and the honey talking to the wrong guy I would know that kind of stuff life with me I just that's the thing I have guys like Mike my coach Eugene who knows why you know and he'll just tell me do this and I trust them right yeah but it's I know it's a Lockhart method and they've updated because I talked to Ian and he said that was the old one I sent to him and he said they've updated it so I said ok next time probably I'll use them too for the fight week weight cut and then the rehydration know the top fist you've ever cut like how have you begun let me go back go back this is probably early on in my career no actually it was more than China we're fucked up I was fucking around at the buffet or something maybe like the fight week you know and then I think I cut four kgs in a sauna it was easy on the last one but before that I was just like mentally sitting there like shit never again I'm never doing this again and I start to like visualize the fight level to make this guy pay and I start to get delusional and hilarious but yeah for Katie's it's not bad I've heard worse I've heard like yeah 6 kgs you know in a sauna and that's a lot on like someone who's not even that fat or that not that is that 1314 pounds I mean kgs dammit that's ok I know Pam how many pounds is that yeah yeah that's a lot 30 pounds take 2.2 so oh god that's right I'm going the wrong way and going the wrong way oh here it is as you get closer to the actual weigh-ins we cut back on the fat and start incorporating frozen fruits interesting something I use a lot is pineapple the reason is dietary fiber will hold water if I put a bunch of water into a bowl and let us let it brown and wilted the next day resorb the water via osmosis would be good lettuce again well I didn't know that when you guys are near the end of your weight class they are cutting back on how much water they take in so they don't have to worry about the body absorbing the water that means we can give them fruit the fruit which is going to help them fuel the brain interest hmm yeah that interesting huh now what kind of shit do you eat like a you want a very specific diet or a seafood and I eat it I like food I'm the best day is like for me it's where well you're not allowed it you want it more horse yeah like they look like fight week when I get here and I start to like crave just the good stuff and I go on these Instagram pages like tasty and I just watch and I save it and I right now where I'm gonna get when I get back home and it's like food porn for real yeah just thinking about oh my god and then after the fire once it's time to weigh in I'm good and I'm just alright eat healthy get it done I don't like pig out even on the the one I get I go from La Jolla stays do not eat pasta until after the fight because apparently that comes no pasta no pasta I didn't capital letters do not what about like maybe a quinoa pasta or lentil pasta that's that that'd be better I think strange yeah I think just like maybe pastry pasta that kind of stuff you don't have that Ezekiel pasta oh yeah I like that short thing do you have any elk yes sir yeah come on here for I got a spot till Thursday's you have a place we can cook yeah the easiest thing I'll give you is I'll give you some elk sausage that's the easiest to cook easy and I'll give you some directions and I'll give you Alex take directions they do have access to like a like some sort of a grill with a lid on it we can get it temperature control grill like a barbecue grill yeah yeah well as you get you just want to make sure and you gotta get a digital thermometer you wanna make sure the meat stays yeah you don't want to keep it you want you don't definitely don't want to cook it past 120 degrees easy instructions okay I'm coachable I'm coachable I know you are but you know you can't learn on your own ya know both are the thing about a guy like you that's interesting to me is like it's very obvious that you have very good technical training but then you deviated and you figured out your own creative path and something you said earlier which i think is really important and it's a good thing to hear for people who don't really understand martial arts is what you do really isn't art I mean you're expressing yourself you know there's some flow as being and for a person like me who's a fan of that martial art and I understand what you're doing I watch it and I'm appreciating it it's like I'm watching ballet or our Symphony I'm watching art I'm like oh look how I set up there was one time when you trapped his trapped his wrist and cracked him in the elbow and I don't know what that is is that's like almost like NLP cuz Northy some people use things coming at them in a certain speed none that pop so what I did like he had his guard up and I'll just like just give me a hand dude so like he gave you watch it he'd kind of like just well he thought you were gonna slow speed yeah nice spell because I'm used to he's used to the fast thing well that's the changeup in baseball yeah they throw a slow pitch and you're like what is this and you whip it you're like fuck how did I miss that expecting a ball to be so fast I've heard the term before but I don't change a bit change so if a guy throws like a 98 mile an hour fastball it also need throws one that's like a fraction of that I don't know what fraction yeah they swing too quick what would be a changeup pitch like how much slower would it be 20 30 miles an hour slower yeah deception that's what it is deception is the ultimate deception I got a few more that's this the basic one I use but I gotta I tried one on him you might catch it as a changeup from left kick to a front teeth but he just went right here it's let me see the highlight oh that was pretty you know another one that you see wonderboy likes to use is that front leg side kick front leg roundhouse kick calm yeah he comes in touches you with a front leg side kick and then sauce waffle yeah Raymond Daniels though has the prettiest version in that yeah jumping side kick spinning back kick to the face that he did in glory Liddell sick made that guy do the splits guy who can do that in a kickboxing match at a very high level that's when you realize like wow this guy like you can't give him anywhere under percent with a life space Josef valtellina and Nicky Holtz can when they fought him the rest you're interesting constant pressure and leg kicks chopping that leg chopping that leg chopping that leg yeah you know but what I like about your style is you basically do both of those things and you do the wild crazy shit but you also do technical Muay Thai as what I mean about I kept on saying about you are all being a button basher like you know II play Tekken and you just kind of like hope something cool happens that's what he does and I'm like establish your basics first establish your foundation land your jab he did it in this last fight for like normally establish something first and then the the cool shit comes afterwards you can't just lie and he's had success with knocked out gay guy with the spinning jumping spinning back-kick you know but like I think you'd have better success at letting those things if you establish your basics first land your jab set the pace he was landing a lot of jabs not fighting that last coaster was just constant presence with his pressure I think I called two minutes before happen I was I told - my friend of mine is like he's face fading he's gonna go soon he's going soon you can just see it when he starts to light and maybe cuz I see it that's why I look for in a guy or they tell me like I'm ready to go I'm alright cool I hope you're out you can just find it like that you look in the eyes or you feel them you guys starting to crack you feel them you feel them will ya you feel you get a energy energy like right yeah and he's ready to go like example my first fight shots of Rob Wilkinson I actually brought him in just to help me out not for this camp just before his wrestling pressure Rob Wilkinson he's a good guy he's my first UFC fight but when I was fighting him I was in the second round after his last takedown attempt and then I like stuffed his head got my leg and I skipped back to the middle and I saw him walk back like circling and just the body language I was like oh you're ready and I throw my hands up like what's up and then pop me boom and I just kind of like just picked him apart slowly I didn't rush it like I keep telling I don't rush these knockouts like a lot of people like oh he hurt Brad about three times but you know he didn't go for the finish I'm like I'm not trying to bum rush these days I just picked them apart they will fall eventually well not only that you but here's something to consider for people that don't know don't really totally understand what you're doing you're doing everything correctly you're not really getting hit much yeah you're doing everything correctly and by doing everything correctly you're kind of ensuring to continue your domination in that fight versus put yourself in danger which some people like some people like to bite down on my mouthpiece and bang I love me a just engaging Michael Johnson yeah but I'm looking at work I'm be that guy cuz is I'm not here for a long time I'm here for a good time I just want to keep my wits about me yeah like man where they get and get out make your money and fuck off that's what I want to do your fighting correctly yeah in terms of like if you're trying to teach someone how to hit and not get hit you're fighting correctly but in order to push further if you were trying to make it more exciting and engage more you have to risk getting hit yeah and that's not a wise thing to do I take risk I'd like to take risk in us and when I play my distance I okay am I too close my too far and I before I take those risks I calculate I know what he's gonna do already I'm like I can bait them with something like if I want them to jab not get closer and when he jabs I slip and rip you know what I mean so you just I take my calculate my risk and sometimes I might do some wild shit like that even though you're all fucked up on that one cuz it was a little bit slippery at night I got landed in training I've I catch it all the time but I didn't account for the sweat on his legs and I got back up any when I was like come on it was a good one you know what it's a crazy thing to do you're also very honest when things don't go your way yeah and then things go wrong you had a kickboxing fight was it in glory yeah no that was one with us in Brazil was name Alex yeah yeah well you lost and you were talking about what it was like to get knocked out yeah for me that's everyone's worst fear so that for me was to first for the first time my first back-to-back loss cuz that was just after the glory fight and my first not get along glory fight although you lost a lot of people thought you should have won the decision I won the fight you know I if you look at it more I don't even base it on that but like we both knew like I hit you more than you hit me you know yeah he were like well he had the pressure he walked you down and the commentary being honest was bullshit cuz I mean respect to a guy like Val to leave me boy he never he can't fight like me he can't understand my style his fight you look at his career he had to take time off because of you know trauma because that's how we fight so he appreciates that kind of style but what's his name well wellness walked me down boy he really couldn't do shit leg kicks is supposed to slow you down I didn't slow down I was still dancing around him in the fifth round I was slipping and stuff I was fresh you know but yeah that fight I felt like I won that fight but it's alright you know it wasn't meant to be everything happens the way supposed to happen I wasn't supposed to get that belt and I'm okay with it yeah well the fight was the fight exactly it really was just the judges that people have a dispute with the actual fight was a successful fight for you and that you did land more shots than he did but then losing the next fight hey oh and but you talked about it online like you were real open about it on Instagram and cuz that's the fair like every fighter like if it was just me and a guy fighting and I lost it's all whatever but when you put it in front of you know millions of people that's the fear sigh oh shit I don't want to look like shit in front of all these people what did you get hit with I was Southport was a little left hook from him and before that first round us my tetum up second round I rocked him but then from that wellness fight I let some bullshit get to me just online you know like people in your life is not live online people in your life saw man you should have won that fight bla bla case you shouldn't leave it in the judges hands you know they'll say some shit like and it just seeps into you so when I heard him in that second round I just went berserk what people expect me to do if you win the UFC do just like I'd say throwing bombs and just like I was no I was only throwing right hands I just died only right hands at him and I watched that fight back now I haven't watched it in a long time when I watch the back comes out why are you doing this cuz That's not me that's not me staying true to myself what I would have done if I was you know being true to myself is just all right cool where's this shot boom pop boom just pick it up do it was turn he was out he was out on his feet already so it's a good story for him you know like he knocked me out at the third round after you got rocked in the second round mm-hmm but I mean yeah it was good for him but if we fight again cuz even after my first my UFC debut he put like a contract up like he's coming to the UFC as well I'm alright make your way up I'll fuck him up hundred percent he's a very good kickboxer to it I mean he it's not Sheamus beat me twice and the first time as well was another weird you know he's walking forward and you know not landing shots but I'm moving back and hitting him the whole time and the judges gave it to him so I was I credit to you you got the fight I'll fight you again so if he makes his way to the UFC you can get it any time is he trying to fight MMA now or Z I think yes he's had MMA fights he's had him a fight sport a lot of kick boxers like I said my boy brat even he realizes like MMA is where it's at you know the UFC they see the way best run company I've ever like come across I fall the world for for glory for in China no one runs the show like the UFC like everything has a place and the time and it's just so clean and you get your money quick that's one thing I like about here walk so well the scene there's no I mean they've they've been running it that way since 2002 and now the new organization is basically most of the old organization yeah yeah it's nice to work for a man I still enjoy it after all these years like next one next one's in LA right yeah TJ versus Cody yeah like after the the last Robert Whittaker Yoel Romero fight that your weight class is kind of in this weird state I mean what do you mean well it's Whitaker won the fight but a lot of people thought Romero might have gotten the nod because he knocked him down and hurt him then he heard him again in the next round a lot of people thought at the very least it was a draw because if you look at them on paper Whitaker never really hurt my marrow but Romero did significantly hurt Whitaker twice yeah and you know he came off of knocking out Rocco but then again he didn't miss wait so that kind of puts ads for me I only care as long as I think he's moving up I think I think he said he's gonna go to light heavyweight yeah I think that's the the most recent how tall is he that's that talk yeah dude that guy is built like a brick shithouse looks like an action figure came in here when he came in here do a podcast and while I was in camp you know him and Joey Diaz translated in shit I was looking I'm like he's 230 pounds he's fucking huge how is he gonna make 185 that's how I felt when I first met Lee Johnson I was like yeah what a fuck so he's just like a thick burger like huge and he you don't want he hit me once I think when was firing only once like a clean one and I was like I'm not getting hit by that again know this it was good work I enjoyed the work we got together but definitely don't spar with you know he I was the guy that brought in for him to mess up all right yeah it was I didn't let it happen who I was making sure like not stay away from that that there's one heat eat me and I went from one side of the case of the other he hit you know that teepee does like the side teepee just put like an elliptical yeah that will be yeah kick yeah and he just did and I went hit the fence on the other side I was like you up he's a big boy and I wasn't I'll probably maybe ninety cages at the time so that was about 200 pounds mmm yeah he's a he's a motherfucker you know in the Safari oh yeah they get down 205 is a bit of a struggle which is just so crazy hey you got his licks as well it wasn't it was about I'm sure yeah hundred percent was good worried he make one seventy I have no idea I saw him in between fights at 1:17 he was 230 pounds I was like yeah just like we said if he come back come back as a heavyweight perfect dude he's an e or e being a heavyweight heed me fucking do the heavy weight he just couldn't answer the the puzzle that was DC DC's the one who really had him figured out yeah DC just figured him out man DC just knew how to break him I think is just the gas tank as well sometimes I he he puts his foot on the gas too quick and also learning how to not be conservative but manage your gas tank yeah yeah yeah he would just swing for the fucking bleachers most of the time when he did that he would just put guys in a coma mm-hmm you know and I just think at a certain point in time you know he was on the tear he was that motherfucker he was that motherfucker for a long time is that what was what he had with Glover Teixeira that didn't look like much nah uppercut it didn't look like much and it wasn't a bit of us like a scramble they were just working then dude was amazing with that I was like Jesus Christ yeah he had ridiculous punching power yeah like some of the most ridiculous punching power as I said mark hunt him who's another one rampage had that as well oh yeah I don't understand it's just it's it's something and Chuck what I like that he had it was cuz he was long as well he wasn't really a thick guy I think is his levers yeah his arms he doesn't know how to whip that oh yeah what are they fighting he and Tito I don't know ma'am but there's a video of Chuck working out he's working out with Ray Sefo shit maybe I'll give him credit benefit of the doubt because I'm lucky maybe he hasn't hit pads in a while let's see maybe three weeks from now and we'll find out I have no idea young Jamie pulled that off I would think that [Laughter] maybe four weeks let's see if he if he keeps the training up he might it's like riding a bike he didn't look like Chuck of old obviously because we have something to compare to but he you know he just he's not gonna be like that either way but let's see if can we get better from what that wasn't on Instagram but also he's a 49 year old guy who's probably warming up yeah that's what I mean you roll a roll but I'm 50 years old I can't I can't get hit no black crack when I stopped when I was probably 28 29 when I first moved to LA I still did some kickboxing you went to Benny the jet center in Van Nuys remember Benny urkki Dez look Benny the jet original og kickboxers him and blinky Rodriguez had the jet Center in Van Nuys and for me there was two things that I wanted to do when I came to California one I wanted to go to hard times billiards cuz hard times in Bellflower California pool yeah it's one of the legendary pool halls in the country yeah and two I wanted to go the jet center and Van Nuys and I went there dude it was all like gang members and blinky Rodriguez had like a program where he would let these gang members in and you know have them all take classes so you'd be sparring we're like hard to hardcore gangbangers yeah they had like one dude had this like really shitty tattoo on his back with his gang I forget the name and then it said fuck the rest and we're both putting our mouthpieces of my Jesus what am i doing grew up in the suburbs it kind of happens like gang activity kind of like just seeps us Wade so far they finally went to fight cultures know me oh yeah I believe blinky Rodriguez lost his son to gang violence or oh yeah that way did he had an open up program where he was letting kids into the gym and trying to help the community and help these kids I apologize if I got that wrong but I think I got that right please look that up blinky Rodriguez son gang violence I'm pretty sure that's true blinky Rodriguez was a famous kickboxer - he knocked out jean-yves Theriot when Johnny Torrio was like the pka champion one of the most feared guys in the world at that point karate and Domino's PKA karate was kickboxing but it was above the waist like Rick Rufus and Johnny if Theriot is this is that true that he did lose his son to gang violence yeah Johnny Theriot fought you see if you can find blinky Rodriguez chaos Johnny Theriot and Theriot is th er I forget all the rest of the way spell his name but he was the man in kickboxing in like the 80s because he was sorry he had pretty decent kicks nothing special but ridiculous knockout power and his poses hands like boxing boxing yeah blinky Rodriguez caught him with a left hook and starched him and that was always like one of blinky here it is right here they're fighting this is like one of blinkie's claims to fame throwback yeah I mean this is which was blinky blinky is the guy in the blue shorts Johnny if Theriot was the the tall Montreal guy he was an interesting guy man he was one of the first advocates of stair running - he was yeah he was like sprints yeah well running hills and running stairs because he fucked like he felt like for kicking power good for you but fuck them fuck them something about gravity oh nice so blinky was a karate guy he had all kinds of crazy shit spinning backfist and all that shit but he had this Oh son yo think you had a ridiculous left arms yeah from that low kick nothing wrong with textbook so it was an honor just to be there in Blinky's jail right there class this is way later I came to LA in 93 yeah so it was 93 when I was on the dream yeah the dream where I came in from well Boston to New York New York to LA so I started coming here around 93 and I think I joined I joined the Jet Center but they had got damaged from the earthquake in 93 and the fucking roof when it would rain it would just flood the whole gym so they had to wind up moving shit so life no word on that fight it's booked for later this year which fight Ortiz Liddell Oh later this year no word like terms one I wonder how truck or a Tito looks as well maybe waiting heating pads he looks good Tito has been winning you know he fought recently beat Chael Sonnen recently Cheetos that's right boy I saw to see Tito hit paths he still looks good man he's still a beast he's got a gang of back surgeries though yeah knee surgeries and back surgeries he does his whole back is all surgery man yet there's a crazy video of him he's lying unconscious they got him sedated and the doctor as a hammer and a chisel and he's in his neck and his neck shit he's going like this clink clink clink clink putting some spacer in his neck like fusing his neck together I'm about that life to that headlock life is higher than wrestling cuz easy it was arrested by a train all those wrestlers it all wind up with like some sort of catastrophic back injury it's just a matter of how long can you hold out you were mean I'm just I'm trying to be pre-emptive because something for the longest time I kind of I just neglected all that stuff with them like Cairo physio well no so now I'm like if I want to fight at this level and be healthy avoid injury you got to look after yourself in that sense what kind of strength and conditioning work do you do strengthen conditioning no sons is a guy that does my strength conditioning work and thing is I know not much about these things like even when he tells me to lift like put some template I never asked what the numbers are because if I if I know what the numbers are I feel like I might I might get dawn till I was shit I might can I can't lift this and then I'll ask afterwards I was that deadlift that was a 180 is okay cool that's all right but um yeah I just shit like deadlift a little bit of bench a lot of band work a lot of plyometrics like exploding yeah learning how to just fire like when he says go he is he he's not just working the muscles he wants to work the mind so when it's time to explode the mind just knows it's true yeah yeah a quick twitch and how many days a week to do it two times a week two times a week and when you do it on how do you schedule your does the someone schedule all your workouts or do you do to yourself you have input how's that work I happen but on my main coach teaching Biermann he's on the schedules my workout so he says today we're doing wrestling yeah and that we have a timetable so for each camp we'll just a timetable accordingly so for example when I go back now I'm not gonna do any vo2 max or a lack the capacity all that kind of stuff no camp stuff I want to go because it's after the fight that's why you work fine skill work yeah just upgrade the software but also because um yeah I think I've done well this year three three fights in six months I'm like you know what take my foot off the gas a little bit I'm just gonna chill how long were you chill for you think probably till September maybe burn that time I want to go back to yoga Bikram because I my flexibility is kind of felted in this camp in early it took me a little bit longer to get my kicks going you didn't was teasing me saying I'm getting old all that fuck that I still have it well like I just think I need to get my flexibility back to where it was when you do plyos and things along those lines do you stretch heavily afterwards Oh afterwards I should and I try to but sometimes it is I just neglect that I I forget after yeah that's kind of so important because that's the time where you really have some opportunity for stretching or really advancing your arrangement Electric's really yeah well explosive exercise you're really tired your muscles are completely heated up or you know Bikram is great for that too because you get a lot of exhaustion of the muscles then you have that extreme heat and everything's super pliable a when I go to Bikram I can still do a full split but if I had to do like a full split right now like a struggle I felt the way when I would after Bikram classes I was always more loose yeah good like he is something man yeah so I'm gonna hack it though they need a hack it cut the shit of course your jacket if he was between live or die never see your family again won't wait ten more minutes in the sauna shut the fuck up like even just for the first for the first session I ever did ever a Bikram i sat there I didn't push myself as hard but I just sat on the mat if maybe that pose with a little bit too much or if I felt some type of way but I can handle it that ain't bad if you can't look the whole thing about it is adaptation if you over run your body right away you're not gonna recover as well you're not gonna enjoy it as much if you can't get through a 90 minute Bikram class but you can do 60 minutes then you have to sit down for ten and then jump back here we go then just do that exactly know your body just sit down to sit down for the first Friday and just feel the heat just slide what you can and if you can't do it just sit down dude that shit is so good for you I know becomes a crazy asshole I know he's crazy HBO but here's the thing man just because he's crazy doesn't mean it's effective you can't throw out the baby with the bathwater I know that dude's nuts but also here's the other thing about Bikram although he's a great yogi and his system is amazing I don't even think he came up with that system I think that system is it existed for a long time and someone from India or something yeah see Google this please I think he lost a lawsuit based on him trying to copyright those sequences of yoga and I think the problem is that the yoga those moves all those moves have existed for literally thousands of years Lucian I claim them well he was trying to crank claim them in succession so like say if you opened up the style bender yoga class and you used all Bikram Muslims that idea what he's essentially saying is that he came up with this idea to put them all in that particular order which is a super effective order like his order of of yoga poses is an amazing same worldwide yep where you go I've taken classes everywhere it's also just because I only went to one so I thought it's the same thing for that if you do the well there's you know like vinyasa there's flow classes which are also very interesting yeah but I've taken those too but there's something really good about the 90 minute Bikram program he just has it nailed yeah he figured it out but I don't even know if that was his idea I think it was other people did that he sued people he did yeah he's gangster he's so crazy they had this uh I mean I don't even mean in a good way they had this HBO documentary where they're interviewing him and he was talking about girls saying that you know he banged him and all this different thing he goes listen to me he goes there are people that would pay 1 million dollars for one drop of my sperm 1 million dollars he's interviewed by it is like this like as if there's a bunch of people like waiting like an auction house filled with people right here 1 million dollars we have 1 million dollars for one drop of sperm who's that way how old is he wouldn't even look like three drops so what kind of specimen is easy like an old type dude he's in shape he's not holding it together ok you know if you and him if you didn't see if you're both the same skin color and you didn't see your heads and you looked at your torso as you would know who's who okay I mean he's like a seven year old guy I mean how long can you still make sperm one drop of my sperm one minute you're like yeah he's there he is jacked let me see go large on that picture not bad probably a few too many carbs yeah needs to get some squats or some Hill runs in but he's flexible as fuck and knows how to do all that she doesn't look 70 well you know what man look would you two let's go back to that picture again real quick there he goes picture getting his underwear the one in the art foot yeah one right above that right about here listen man look just be really the thing gravity's listening it must be realistic if you walk around wearing underwear like that in a yoga class you're there to fuck that guy's their facts fuck he's there to fuck and if you leave a girl alone with him he's gonna touch her he's gonna pull that Indian dick out he's gonna say what's an Indian dick supposed to like to bring it out with raining Jackie's weird little try skivvies a mess out here if you're a dude 70 you can't be like an amateur yo go to shit Wow look at that girl from the Kama Sutra yeah might be yeah okay like you can't have underwear like that on and not be good at Yoga look if you like a beginner and you fall down every time you try to Eagle pose they'll talk to you hey man watch close but if he walks in there phlex yeah he's kind of already flex man you know I mean he's fucking it's like I don't know if you were a boulder ya know bowling glove covered with rhinestones like you bet Michael Jackson glove style yeah should do it someone should yeah boiling love of varietals on it what else do you do do you ever do gymnastics gymnastics no I dance what kind of day you see it you said that earlier I forgot to go back to I start off with popping as a kid now I'm krump I krump dance that's like yeah what's a krump dance krump dance is um actually originally in LA it's uh real an expert yeah South Central LA like tight eyes and big mijo started it off but I'm I remember watch this movie as a kid and called rise and that's kind of what introduced into the world kind of like the way Umbach did with more time made a more mainstream rise spelled right here this is poppin this is what popping P I look up a guy called tie-dyes TI good him go so this guy's from from the electric Boogaloo this is how I started off look at him go back in a day what's with the tower though seriously are your hands that's funny you'll probably use it with a move or something oh yeah he's a man it's so strange like that people went thousands of years without these styles and then when electronic music came along people went oh the sounds different let's move different yeah but for me I had this metamorphosis last year around my birthday and then for whatever reason I just went back to dance cuz I felt like I had his Dan you know how people get writer's block mm-hmm I had dancers block for like maybe six years or five years I just couldn't create I could dance I could flow I couldn't create anything do you know lomachenko studied for years of you Kelly yeah yeah yeah classical you clean your cranium dance one thing I learned is muscle memory I know dancers who have to do shows and they have to learn like 20 different sequences and that's for the whole show like 20 different each sequence might be like anywhere from a minute to three minutes and they have to do it like that so when I started dancing again when I went back to training drilling my I can retain that information so much better like it's muscle memory right so I don't have to think about certain moves when I do it just boom cuz I remember this it's easy and the muscle just does like how do you do that I wasn't thinking so dancing really translates into muscle memory like that in an effortless we're like dancers I think have the best best muscle memory or maybe one of the best in the world well it makes sense that you were you're learning to use your body in a choreographed way almost like a kata you know like stupid when I was a kid I just think I really did I just think was Donna the cool it look cool when someone's doing it but I hate learning I felt like them to get the next belt but then once I learned them I forgot I'm totally but now that I think back I realize like that was a mistake on my part because what that was was I I thought I knew better which is hilarious I thought I knew better than people who learn martial arts for thousands of years and it's not the kata makes you a better fighter but it makes you have better control of your body yeah and the thing about like holding a sidekick up in the air here there's a lot of people that just can't do that I like that he's a guy taught me like well no like literally his dexterity and his legs heal on one leg while moving forward and he'll do it the other Laird like all the way down all the way back up southpaw don't there's a balance yeah I think the balance is between that and maybe lifestyle thai-style yeah I'm from the fine and sometimes you can go one side too much bushes you have to be objective enough to yeah this is what I need yes you know you feel your body you kind of aim for each each fight as well you know what you want to use right like with him I was gonna I was gonna throw some spinach it at some point what's his name I was after I saw Dana and him so I was working walking around with tawny shots at Tony angel off and then I see Jay silver who's the guy who used to fight he's a thick boy I fight something out of Raqqa and he just kind of recognized hey what's up and they got me into the club and then yeah Nick Diaz shows it what's up why you and I just shook his hand and that was it and yeah he's no legend he's still fighting well he's doing whatever the fuck Nick Diaz wants to do right now this all the time I think he's only gonna fight for I think this is I'm gonna go out a limb here yeah I think the lack of the UFC talking Nick Diaz into a fight I know he's crazy and he knows he's crazy - that is a criminal criminal under use of a valued asset I think if you wanted to have a giant pay-per-view riding a big star fuck he's a huge star so is his brother yeah but they haven't fought in forever Nate hasn't fought since he lost to Connor in the very close the pre-match big money fight well probably he made a ton of money and you know he doesn't live a crazy lifestyle and I believe Nate just got a kid ro yeah I think I think I've read that on Google see if that's true Nate Diaz just had a child either way congratulations yeah Liuba either congratulations you had a kid or congratulations that you did I love that dude though I love Nate on the spot the way they fought I've defined that Paul daily for I watch their life bro yeah I think I said that one fine you were there live no no I wasn't watching up on the couch that's crazy yeah he got clipped too he's one of the rare people that's got clipped by Paul Daley and survived it come back and then see the way Paul fell back as well - thank you leg it's almost like his legs just keep exhausted yeah that's what it is exception I keep saying it's easier to knock so not when they're tired yeah like that fight almost a brad had go cardio he was able to take it and I was finding it there was one I hit him on the body shot body kick and yeah he went for a takedown straight away I put I pushed him or framed him got him against the fence or something but yeah it's easy to get like some of these guys you can see he never gave me that sign like I'm ready to go like when they're ready to go like I want out you're telling overwhelming performances of Nick's career was against Frank Shamrock thanks dude that was when I was like whoa just body shot he walked but he put his head on his chest and just bah bah bah bah bah hey talking shit to him and Frank was like you know you're talking shit down that interview is that yeah I couldn't believe it now honestly like that pace even like my first fight it's sort of Diaz asking the way where it's like I didn't do it when I when I knew he was ready to go I just all right put a steady pace just put your foot on gas a little bit but not gas it out just but find the shot find the shot find the shine there's no need to like wasted energy well you've got a wise approach to to your voltages your overall and then they gain but in particular to your striking game you you were one of those guys that's showing people that you can be very exciting but take minimal there's a couple moments in that fight where Brad was charging at you we like hup-hup-hup here we go yeah to me that take the center people don't take the center of an almost as exciting is watching someone get knocked down I like watching someone figure out that like here the right hands coming the left hands come behind it I'm not their queen sweet a little bit in clean sweep if one judge didn't give one round to him but I don't know which round he gave because I thought I had all five rounds after watching it so I was like you can't even 50 45 50 45 and then 49 46 nothing damn that would've been cool if it was just like a 50 45 clean sweep well the the most important thing was not a judge's interpretation of it it was the actual performance yeah people enjoy the day some people were lying uh people are they got caught up in knockouts a lot like oh you need finish bread though but a lot of people the response was I'd rather see that than just a quick finish cuz he worked the guy he didn't get gassed he didn't you know I didn't I didn't dip maybe the third round I minded dipped a little bit but he lookit I had my poker face on I was fine I felt fresh and I ever said after my last fight before that like I was based on a three round camp the one I fought in Arizona it was based on a three round camp and I looked in the cameras I can go five rounds I told you Jean Marco doesn't man I feel I can go another two rounds easily and this camp was basing around five rounds so after this fight honestly I had the reserve ready I was like maybe three rounds I could have gone if if I needed to but you do you ever anticipate a time where people would have more than five rounds of an MMA fight mostly anymore most of times totally unnecessary yeah but sometimes to be long as I'm gonna get this guy in like three rounds I thought so I felt so I was like maybe that's just me bigging up myself you know my own ego but yeah I just felt like I would take him in three two or three rounds put five rounds and I still look good doing it so I was happy now when you see a guy like Paulo Costa who has like this just I mean he's not totally hittable where like everything you throw you're gonna hit him but he's much more aggressive much more days you see these shorter arms I stood next to him I was like he iced me he's trying to act like he doesn't know who I am and I saw any of yous like oh I do not know that guys like dude fuck I have now you know and I said after my first fight because these guys want to pretend and I don't know where it comes from maybe because of years of not getting noticed so I'm like don't try and act like it cuz a lot of guys though they'll creep my Instagram and then like see me in real life and act all high and mighty and I'm I'm a nice guy I like to you know be friends yeah I like to hug people say what's up at least just not like hey you know what's up I know you are you know I am but some people flex too much so for him yeah he knows who I am in his manager what's his name the fucking gremlin now he looks like a fucking arrow he looks like you know what lead Ishmael you know take his guy I know he is well lead is a mixed martial arts legend fights dude he fought in UFC 12 really yeah he fought uh Takahashi is that who we fought maybe it was 13 UFC 12 or 13 did he choked out hoist Gracie jiu-jitsu match Rio when hoist Gracie had just won all the UFC's and he was the fucking man a for the memory Ishmael who was a crossing Gracie black belt watch this he got ahold of hoist and this was in Brazil and a giant fucking audience it was in a soccer stadium I think it was a big-ass audience and crazy they wound up going to the ground scoot ahead well I got him in a clock choke and I remember this because of the time yeah at the time I was like maybe uh maybe a blue belt and I tapped a guy with a clock choke I was like clock chokes on that shit yeah and he I remember those with the ghee Clarke chokes with a geek I try I try I tried it a little bit I can do it when it's not sweaty but I'm with my arms cuz I'm out I got along arm so I can kind of get it a little bit if I if I tweaked it right and we'll lead had that constant Willie G days to calm he had that constant pressure Carlson Gracie top game crushing you know where you're gonna shit out bone fragments after you roll with them yeah that was their style man a scoot ahead a little bit and you see what lead gets that clock choke so here tell he's the guy that's like talking for right now right here he got here you know when you want to put a noise to sleep boy stood me up you always out went out like a warrior yep look at that he's out fuck out pressure early everybody won not to the mat yeah let it go no the referee should have known yeah no you're right shit but this was bat see there's Carlson back then this is when there was like a bit of a rivalry between Carlson Gracie and you know weird about that yeah I mean Hickson and hoist and Hoyer and rivalry was out he was a beast man so they just manage now he's managing now he's taking care of Fighters and stuff like that but he's a real legend yeah well Leeds a piece the spec you spec yeah he's like four he's the guy he's the guy that I think talks for I'm Paula a lot cuz yeah he policy I respect him trying to learn English as well that's one of the reasons I was like I really want you right hauled away because he was talking all this shit right a few wins I want to see him and I want to build up for that fight before cuz I will fuck him up you felt like there was holes in your eyes game they look yeah and Paul and Paul's game as well there's holes in his game boy what did you see him Paulo say he gets hit easy now and you don't want you know how Uriah was tapping him with the jab mm-hmm he doesn't want to if I was behind those jabs would be different setups it'd be a different setup I can come up with few other pathways after that jab like you Ryan was hitting the jab but that's a hit the jab and there's the chins up he'll hit the jab and what do you do after the jab after you land seven times you got to do something else with it you can't just keep jabbing him jabbing him it was like your hoster had extreme confidence in his ability to knock out he didn't respect his jab he will respect my job I look at my knuckle so this is my most markets my regular [Laughter] that's from what's-his-name it got a little bit more swollen because of them brat Tavares mm-hmm this is my regular knuckle and like I was jabbing him at first swollen right now from the fight a little bit but normally it's just good that's all out Chihuahua yeah but uh yeah with Brett in the beginning my jab oh he was slipping it and I was alright and then you just said drop it down and at one point he tried to counter it like Tyrone Spong slip the jab and count encounter but um I recognized it I was okay cool drop it down and I hit him with I think I went down to the legs and I took away attention then I was able to go back to the Jap and not I busted him of the jab now when you train in do you spend time to work on traditional moves like wheel kicks and side kicks on that shit you throw occasionally or do you throw them into your overall pad work game or how do you the pad work Eugene he has his own system and he knows what he everyone's different so he treats every fight as an individual you know I mean so he knows what me what he can do on the pads and what I like to pull and if I have an idea like Oh try this out he's open he's not like he's very open man he doesn't understand he doesn't know I'm trying to limit you from what you can do it what you can create so all the spinning stuff all the creativity of the things that I kind of bring myself I tried just to am just walking around my house shadow buck and sometimes you know just my own free time I might I just think about certain things like how can I do this different even someone like Chad Mendes it's something he does like the he fakes the short and uppercut I like that we're completely different body types but I like that and I have my own setups for that just because I feel like it's a good move but with different body types and he has no setup so I like to create on my own and then if I have any ideas or anything that I feel like can work well with the pads are with our with our flow I'll let him know and he's open to it well you're one of these guys that's coming up right now that's in this new wave of MMA fighters that is every it seems to me that there's like an incremental increase in the skill level there's always all-time greats like Cain Velasquez and you know fill in the blank there's like Anderson Silva this is these guys that burst out and they they stand out as extreme performers yeah but there seems to me like right now to be a new witness upbeat Magomedov hero sharp off that guy there's a few of these guys that are coming up where you're watch them you go whoa there's some little you recognize like a guy like me who's seen it for so many years I go okay there's a next-level shit going on right now yeah it's like like we're talking about lomachenko like gloma Chico's footwork and movement this is okay this is next-level shit I've seen a lot I mean I'm sure there's been some all-time greats when you when you go to guys like Pernell Whitaker and guys like Floyd Mayweather you know artistic geniuses but there's something that loma chenko is doing it they're not doing yeah right on a percent like even some things i watch his footwork i watch the way he looks like anyway you see my fight as well i like to look at guys i don't just like close my eyes and hope Thoren hope I don't throw up I aim and fired that's one of my quotes I say that but he does the same thing he likes to look and he's aware of where he is he didn't crunching yeah whenever you say chunking he's checking all that information he's like tragically muscle memory they say he's a dancer he'd learned what ways of ballet all that stuff rhythm timing off beat on beat it all translates well into fighting like easily yeah it really does and it's so fascinating to me and watching all these like new versions of different styles like khabib in my opinion is a new version of the ground-and-pound style I watched his ground-and-pound my jesus fucking christ like he's such a like when he fought Michael Johnson there's no Justin kg fight there son this is a male this is a goddamn mauling you're getting mauled by some crazy alien from another planet I like the way traps the hands and I had I had one on Brad as well a little bit but I think he recognized he tried to go away this one I had his back for brief more in that fight probably about a good 30 seconds and I trapped his hand um I learned that from BJJ scout that was on the Ben Askren video but Brad wouldn't let me have his right hand but I got it though because I'm I got these fucking monkey fingers like grip I can grip really well so I hold it and not peppered him a little bit and then that's when I kind of go to the fence and something happened go to Kimora but I picked from everyone could be there's the way he traps their hands and we call that the khabib everyone I when I get to my training part I start talking like I'm like you would never get this I want this type of shot you know I just don't like mimic guys like that just cuz they good at what they do yeah and if I can get it and make it work for me like Bruce Lee make it my own I'm really intrigued I mean I must really bummed out that max Holloway had a pull out of that fight that don't let Michael Bisping call him out on that though man cuz I think most other people would have just kind of like oh well good good luck but he called him out on TV like bro you look lady just woke up you can tell you recognize something when I watch the cuz I heard about it before I watched the interview and I was like oh obviously I didn't look at him he's just like you know I feel great love ya yeah yeah and he would have thought he would have rehydrated and fought maybe not to the best of his ability but well he might have got knocked out and he started the punching now Ortega is no joke no joke you know you don't want to come against to go up against guy like that and be slack you should go to lightweight well he's more take is fascinating to me because his the way he locks up submissions is so next level long range I like just that the technique is so sharp man when he dives on shit when he got KUB and that he got him in a doris at the end of the set of the first round I was like what the fuck man that is tight like but there was something about the finality to it there's like this is this is not a question of when I said well it was it was not that it was this the solidity of the technique it was like when he locked it in there was no doubt this fight [Music] slippery this wasn't like maybe he's gonna get out you know a guy gets a guillotine is like this was mad this was death okay and then he got him with a guillotine jumped on his guard he jumped in got agita beautiful that kind of stuff like what a god I like the way he looks good I look at guys like that cuz similar body types and lately I've been catching that I see in the fifth round give me another maybe seven seconds how to squeeze that but they're ragging on this well on the belt but every time someone goes for certain things I can snatch the neck but thing is I don't have that the way Ortega has where he knows like yes don't like for me I'm like I think it's tight let me try I don't know how it is right if you like if you tried to throw a jab hook with one hand and then throw it with the other hand it just doesn't feel right with the other hand yeah I'm by statue like from my own personal experience my left hand I know how to do with my left side but my right side it feels like awkward yeah well there's a squeeze that you develop with certain guys just get like this marcelo garcia style spins that's what has got it I want that that's the thing because I can get it no I've got to catch the neck but then is when I catch it I'm not I'm not dead set sure like okay it's over now like Brian if you don't tap you're gonna sleep but I won just wrapped a certain amount of black belts with that you would have that feeling yeah yeah he's a beast man he's a beast he's so fucking explosive on the ground he throws up triangles and August are I like his creativity as well yeah he thinks outside the books well knocking out Frankie was giant and hitting them with an uppercut like that yeah whoa out of nowhere it's just Frankie can take it to rank you fighting them at Atlantic City after that just like yeah a few weeks after yeah or four weeks Watson this fight to take getting knocked out by Ortega what do you think about that about guys doing that like getting stopped green uh same take time off after that up knockout in Brazil I took about I fought again in July are you totally unconscious in that fight yeah I remember okay so I remember this is what happened I woke up I was the oh shit okay let me try and get up fuck my arms just felt like noodles all right whatever and then this kid is fucking little shit like a baby came over and just like I either yelled in my face or whatever and I was like whatever I don't and then because Brazil they go crazy like holy shit he'd knock this guy out so where was the kid like near you by the K nothing he came in the Rea like and then the referee had to like yo everyone get order again it was chaos and this is why they were doing the count yeah and then I wanted to get up I was trying to get up and then like not and I think it was just over after that then I had okay cool good fight give him a woody call it fist pound and then the kid again came over next to me and just laid on the ground it's like and I thought it would knock you yeah I was just on his face brother how old was a kid seven go fuck if you can crawl the combro shots of Michael Blackson dick move at the time seven yeah yeah probably kid right was that his kid I don't know he could've got it either way your dad don't spank your spank you but then I remember like flashes as well walking out we're using to the stim they walked outside we just sat there and I was a real is that what happened and he just told me what happened right okay and then I remember back in the hotel chilling and then yeah I felt like fuck I'm okay this is the worst of the worst case scenario I'm okay and that was my first only ever knockout lost knock on wood and I was it's like fine you think you learned something in that fight about not giving into your motions and I just don't let people like people you're the man you ain't shit now I don't give a fuck like you I only give a fuck about those who I care about like someone like ash or Eugene those my close people if they say something about me that you know hurts me then I'll give a fuck but for someone like oh bro you the man this that but you got a blah blah blah blah blah or be more this I'm like cool i smiling wave cuz i don't even fuck what they think they're no one to me you know understand sir yeah after that fight I shouldn't I shouldn't have given in to people's opinions of myself I should have stayed true to me and just fucked him up in the second row I wouldn't knock them out if I just didn't literally just right hands why am I only throw right hand so you think that's like a like a critical lesson in your career facts I'm glad it happened like in the in the moment no hindsight it's like all fuck sucks and I hate losing I fucking hate losing one thing I went 40 and OH before I had my first loss and now it's the Simon Marcus Botti boy Simon Marcus like Andy I beat him in that fight as well but another judge like all three rounds least I beat him all three rounds and then okay but thanks for it's a big fight again restaurant they made an extra round and that actually I still beat him but then they gave it to him cuz he was a super sight at the time and I realized oh shit I lost okay I live my life and that was it but I took Winnie for granted for so long in kickboxing because I was always expecting to win and after that after a fight okay what's next cool i watch the fight maybe twice maybe even once sometime when watch the fight and and that's it what's next but this weekend ever since I got to the years ago just before every single for after I went out because my brain tries to go to that place where it's like okay what's next wait stop nigga you just main event it in Vegas your first fight smoke this dude all five rounds and you're on top of the world right now take this in let's all sit down look at the t-mobile Arena and just like I'm gonna be the little areas just by myself and then just get like you get objective and I said now I just like let it sink in like yo you're out yeah you're doing the damn thing and really embrace it yeah eventually when I go back home and I let things settle down and I moved back into the flow of things I'll start to get over it but one day I Fergie Mel the roses just stopped sometimes and smell the roses and it's not cocky it's not it's just appreciating what you've done cuz you've put a lot of work into this you know yeah that's a good attitude man I mean I think what you're doing in terms of your ability to reflect on yourself and to be real objective about your abilities your podcast the one thing he said when I was it because I don't have any big brothers so I don't really have anyone sending me apart from Eugene and like but sometimes when I when I first started listening you cell is like don't be a bitch you had this like big rant one time if you want to do this and do that follow your dreams and like no don't bitch yeah conquer in a bitch yeah everybody doesn't inner bitch I'm a bitch in the streets right yeah and I'm like yeah like a part of that was part of the fuel that helped me amongst a lot of other thing I take the inspiration from everything to help me like get out of that but I remember the day September 4th 2013 I was just like yep I'm out and I never I'll never looked I never worked a day in my life again beautiful never again I couldn't do it I don't have to anymore you're working but you're working at something you have a passion towards your line work it doesn't feel like work that's what I mean like I don't care if your work in the office that's your thing if you don't feel like you working you have a passion for what you don't just do that right but then like I said some guys who were fighting and they don't they just do it because the gate gets like Brendan Schaub he was doing it cuz he's great at it pays the bills but now look at him comedian podcast he recognized it though he's a wise guy in that he recognized there was this thing that he just did you go back to like his fight with cro cop or some of his earlier fights he had a different attitude about fighting and then he realized he didn't have it anymore but he was still getting paid well so he didn't know how to jump out exactly that's what i mean so if your name drone doesn't matter what it is just about you helped him done yeah you know I listened to that I was cringing the whole time but you had to yeah that's what I love that you got he's like a brother to me he wasn't all there yeah in terms of like he wasn't all in facts yeah that's how my home is all the time because a lot of people like they don't know how to handle like not the new me but the new lifestyle around me yes weird people get they get like they become like groupies on the in a way like II might spooky cuz you don't mean but you broke through the membrane into the neighboring dimension no like oh shit the letters on TV yeah I get it I get it yeah the people that know you and then Austin see you on TV that's a mind fuck man but they weren't seeing my first friends get on TV when I was a comedian yo and watch them on TV go WOW and I see him on TV facts but for me so the ones that are around me now they're the ones that can check me like they can handle it and they can check me like if I fuck up like I'm not perfect I mean it's not so there's no such thing yeah so it's like if I do something and I'm like I'm in the wrong hotel but like a you need to pull your head and you know what I mean so you need people like that yeah yeah I'm glad I have people like that now well having people like that and also having people like dan Hooker and you can and having people like all the other training partners you were talking about having great coaches all those things have to be together it's like you have to have people that are honest that are assessing you you have to have a good a good trainer who's looking at you who knows you I was like you're a little off today you're a little slow today or today we're gonna ramp it up I think you're hitting the next level we're gonna add in some more different things yeah having someone to adjust everything everyone that everyone is different individually even with fighting this stuff so that's one thing I love about our staff city kickboxing is cuz it can look at someone to be like it cool he needs to do this he needs to work on this better and it's it's beautiful I honestly like 20 30 years from now I keep telling my teammates that they're gonna talk about us the way we talk about them but I don't really talk about who's Jim and my mom but not Andre am I not as well in China he's a he's a kick boxing legend as well but yeah I one day I'll go out there and get some work and work them probably sure yeah man I mean mix it up yeah I Love New Zealand Oh get me wrong we're night when I see the Sky Tower when I hit Auckland I get excited like a little dog when he sees the park you know I mean I love being home but it's good to get out there get some work and without ego cuz one thing I realize now is if I go to a different gym it'll be different not cuz guys always that guy Brian spire might try to hurt you exactly ed bra you know we can play we can play I don't get paid for that you're also in one of the most beautiful countries that's ever existed there's something about New Zealand man I said I've never been personally but there's a reason why they film The Hobbit there because like you look at some of that shit and it looks magic yeah it was whoa that feels good to be like I just love the vibe as a vibrant ease and I like what is the vibe like it's chill everyone's real loose like and not like loose like Australia you can get loose like that but it's relaxed it's a different scene loose like Australia and lose like New Zealand all the stress of loose concepts like what's the difference bambam drinks out of a shoe all these like the attitude and then they're cool as well can't be choked but you can get some real loose constant I can use it like in anywhere like in America right you know but generally speaking like it's just yeah Australia's uh depends where you go Melbourne is my city that's my favorite city in Austria Melbourne Perth and then Adelaide mmm there's my favorite cities in that order but yeah I don't know I'll probably hit a few other sports as well see what the vibe is just keep moving around yeah now what about American gyms how many different American gyms if you trained out besides black ceiling like zillions mmm let me think I've trained with a few fighters well maybe I've trained with I think well I think it's the only gym I didn't go to ATT I am in LA then I trained most of times I'm here when I'm on holiday I don't train I holiday out right yeah yeah but um yeah about balance man yeah I try once in a while you go to too much this side you have to find it okay go to the other side it never stays right in the middle for that for a long period of time it's just like okay you're leaning this way go this way and find the balance so just feeling and being honest with yourself objectivity I say always check yourself Acy always check yourself no matter what how you're feeling and so if something gets me like maybe if I see something makes me feel a will I get jealous I'm like what do I feel that way I might want my hating you know like it has nothing to do with me then I find out where it comes from and then eventually it's like you identified the monster and then you slaughter it you kill it good for you man yeah good for you I learned I'm coming up I'm learning you're bad motherfucker listen Thank You ppreciate I'm glad we got a chance to do this I get more comfortable the way these go on dude you were great man it was fun let's fire thank you
