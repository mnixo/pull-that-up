oh yeah that's all he is and we're live that's it hi hello Benji yeah this stuff purple venom that's what he calls his friend calls it and yes friends leaking I'm pretty skeptical skeptical about other people's stuff but I hope now was that a coke nail no that one no I know there's a little bit long people think that they're cooked meals didn't take no they're real but you don't do coke I don't do coke ever if you ever done a Coke Zero I have done I have done it's like coke light it's like it looks like Coke you could snort it feels like he doesn't give you high no I I have I've tried it I would say honestly maybe four times hmm and I've never it's always just felt like I just took three shots of espresso and I'm not it's not really doesn't do anything for me that I'm like I better get me a better invest in that I need to try it one day because just I need to know what's going on I'm 51 years old how do I don't know what coke is hey you know I think it's worth I mean if you don't if you you know if you don't have a predisposition for being a hyper addictive first now oh I definitely do but oh but I'm also wise enough to know yeah I might can quit things yeah but you got experience you can control yourself but like I I was never I was never like I guess I've just never been someone who's like oh shit gotta have that forever like I've never been that way the only thing that I'm reduced to now is just weed that's it what me too but I also think that it's one of those things if you're if your life is health if you have a good balance and you're enjoying your time and you're being creative and you have good friends and you have fun you're not looking for something to fuck your life up I think many of the times when you're dealing with people that have like severe debilitating addictions that are really just taking over their life there's something else going on almost always it's like problems you know relationship problems work problems life problems yeah they're not happy yeah there's an emptiness there's a penis that wants to be fed or maybe you have a lot of success and you're freaking out about the success I think that happens with some celebrities yes I I think so yeah overstimulation let's do this oh yes do it yeah here it is he kind of the first I used an automated machine the auto have you heard of it no so cool it's like this like little Rinder and that's a grinder and it and it fits on a tube that you put an empty rolling thing in there so you like put that in there oh you got it and then it's like a yeah it's like a clear tube you put in the pre-rolled you know empty whatever joint thing and then and then you put this machine that just goes over attaches magnetically and then you put in your weed and you just press a button and like coffee makers like and it fills it up perfectly and then you just pack it by shaking it and twist it and then you're done these goddamn stoners today they're getting too crazy I know I rarely smoke I always make exceptions for stuff like this you've read it all look at it yeah wow that's actually pretty sleek looking yeah it's by banana brothers I think you know I I smoke pretty regularly but um I got high would be real I did this smoke box show Oh Mike okay I'm gonna be real a rat Cypress Hill I was ever so real I know I know nothing about hip-hop know anything about Cypress yeah I know I know people are always like you gotta you know vibe up I'm like I know shit I know Run DMC you really don't know any hip-hop now I kind of stopped after the Bohemian phase hmm you know like after Tribe Called Quest and dill until I saw like it just kind of lost me because it didn't turn in I like gangster in the beginning you know because it was something new and you're like what the fuck is this oh that's so cool you know but then it kind of morphed in the club hop where it just was all about bitches and cars and all that shit and it was really the lyrics the beats I loved I thought it was cool but I was like no I mean I because I left in 95 in 95 96 and then I know there's plenty of hip hop heads oh it'd be like dude you got check out so you got check out I know there's shitloads of shit and I maybe I'll go back into that phase but mostly I just like the beats and the production and the lyrics I'm not really I'm not I'm not lyrics guy anyways I am a lyrics guy and NAS is definitely my favorite lyricist cuz his stuff is so creative like what was that one we did everything backwards to the whole song backwards like he started at the end and then the fuck was I called James gonna cool it rewind yeah I mean I mean major look really yeah it made you look like I saw that and I was like that was actually a moment where I was like how am I gonna am I gonna start getting back into this shit cuz yeah because it was intelligent yeah you know what I mean like my thing is like if you're gonna be boastful on this shit it should be like Muhammad Ali right right right you shoot a clever you have clever flair also you can just be right in someone's face but I like that but then when people are like kind of going off about how much money they have and I'm like I don't really care about this well I analyzed this many times while under the influence and the culture comes from not having something and then once you have something brag about it right like that's like jay-z like that's 99 problems he talks about that 99 problems yeah even I get it I get it but like at the same time if it just sounds like basically the three things that everyone talks about which is like women cars of some sort and money or the things you can buy with money after a while it just all bleeds together it's only since the same song and I mean that's so dope that you can come from nothing and you can work your way up and you can hustle and you can get stuff coming in but like once you get to that place like why not take advantage of that place what about running the jewels I've heard good things about it yes the rapper i've heard good things about it damn I know I don't know shit man I'm more of like on the jewels of so cream an electronic guy like yeah let me turn you on some run the jewels please I wish we could play it on the podcast but then we can't do that anymore what your day yeah they will run you Julius but back in the day when you had like the internet was no one knew what a podcast was you could do all kinds of shit you just play things I mean you still can I mean taking down demonetized you get a strike against your channel if you get three strikes they take your channel down permanently it's are you are you - yes okay that's the real problem nice who's the real problem I'm uh I'm bypassing all that very soon what are you doing I'm just clears my own live streaming that's all right yeah cuz that way I just don't have to worry about all that bullshit yeah Oh in the lead that's where it's probably gonna have to go yes but but at the same time everybody's at YouTube yes oh so the secret is or the question is like how can you well you do both yeah exactly waiting yeah of zero zero alcohol Hamilton are you serious yeah I'll try it zero yeah cuz my problem with alcohol is alcohol yeah so yeah actually thanks man they taste like a regular Heineken mmm check what that that if you see these what is that it's a micro tech California legal switchblade what yeah what do you stab people at a tiny knife what you doing right now I've been going on since I saw you I like it well I like having a net I'm from Montana you always have a knife mm as always it's like the greatest tool but uh I mix it how's the button go okay so hold it the opposite way turn it around flip it around yeah and then the button on the top side see there's like oh no here yeah that so this is on the back this is a glass breaker okay a glass breaker yeah for like if you're in your car you know or whatever I needed to break the window Jesus but here's the switch is that really what that's for yes let me see that like crazy so this would break your window yeah hmm dude but how many people do you think could break a window with this I bet if you got a lot of people there's some old car windows and I could like line them up and just fucking yeah because it seems like that's like that's like kind of weird a weird like standardized tip for glass breakers really that crazy so would you get it see but it seems like it's slide in your hand it doesn't that's too small I think if you you know if you wedge them if you held it tight in your fist you know with your thumb over I think if you hit it it's more about velocity at rather than strength yeah cuz the way it's designed this would just be like super like precise strike that's what you're in a glass breaker with them man yeah playing games you ready Jim water you have like bottled water in your car arms I have bottled water I have a jump jumper so you know you can jump yourself know if you have bottled water in your car in LA you're basically drinking what is that shit that comes the leaks into your from your plastic AC BPA's oh no I don't know these I have glass that's all glass oh dear now fuck that I don't know I mean like people are gonna be like bitching because I talk about plastic vials all the time but because it's here yeah it's your solution for that I probably get glass and get a water yeah you just you just kiddo you just get a municipal filter yeah and that's it and you get alkalized water mm-hmm room temperature whatever and you can just have clean water and you just have tons and tons of vessels I'm sure what someone would be kr would sponsor E or something like that wouldn't be kr they're there uh like a I guess you a canteen company or water carrying like jug company itself people drink out of mason jars that would be like old folks oh yeah hell yeah old-timey are you kidding yeah I'll be like you know like grandma's kitchen cupboard yeah why do people like drinking out of mason jars I think it started with grandmas what was that banned what was that one Breeland no who's that one sort of bluesy Rocky band pretty recently damn wizard how he do it he's he knows what I'm gonna ask before I googled it he's a wizard he's got something he's got something some special talent but yeah those guys they dressed like they were from another era right yeah they wore like weird clothes from like the pioneer days yeah yeah they look like time travelers like from a steampunk era yeah I mean kind of I mean I know you're saying like in the beginning yeah you know fortune femme stir oh yeah I wish I remember her joke but she had a funny joke about Mumford & Sons and mason jars really yeah I think it was like something to the tune of you know she's mason jars for real not like not like this bullshit oh yeah threw up or I think that was a apologize from wrong that was I mean that's very funny I mean she is every she's so rad I saw her in uh Oh in Australia Sydney she's doing a podcast with Tom papa oh yeah sorry dare you again sorry guys Tom Papa is a brilliant stand-up comedian really really funny guy super super nice guy too and he's the master of bread him red red oh shit he makes his own sourdough bread and it is sensational how that that that's that's that's too much it's over here he brings a loaf of bread and grass-fed butter no no you cannot resist that's this bread that's bread is so good fuck your keto diet if it doesn't include Tom Pappas bread fuck your keto diet does he sell it at a big no-no there he is good and he has a he has a television show he's doing on a Food Network where he's visiting bakers he's a brilliant guy and a super nice guy like couldn't be a nicer guy and he just loves making bread he's so silly that's meat it's bread it's so good and it's like I really believe this that if you get the food from someone who's really cool like it feels different it tastes different and times just tom is just such a nice guy he's so fun and he's so smart like when you're eating his bread like you feel like I'm eating a cool guy's bread yeah yeah you know it's like someone who you love cooks you something like if your mom cooks you something it's like wow this is so much it's not just good it's good and it comes from love yeah yeah yeah yeah cuz the other person who made it standing right there yeah it's pretty unique experience specially read yeah I think that's the big thing with food too with with cooking you know I I never really thought of food as an art form until I started watching No Reservations which was Anthony Bourdain's original show oh yeah backward he's on the Travel Channel okay and then I was like oh like duh like I in my head like they were just cooks like oh they just cooking food it's because I cooked food before I used to work in the Corps Creamery I made burgers yeah I make grilled cheese yeah sure yeah yeah that's good so it's like I know how to put the fucking fries in yeah but watching these chefs create these like really elaborate creative dishes you start going oh oh oh this is an art form it's just a like a weird one like where it's temporary because I don't only exist for a short window in time yeah but now that we have film of it and now that we have photographs of it look things on Instagram yeah now you start to appreciate that oh it looks amazing too I guess part of the thing it's like if you could have like the most incredible steak but it came to you and it looked like the shittiest looking lentil soup Oh egg split pea soup like a split just just it just the peas though yes just a bowl of green but it was the most incredible taste yam it looks weird yes right right but yeah but they were like they're making things like yeah they're addressing as many senses as possible yeah does everything read looks good yeah looks like it crossed in the outside with those little slices yeah on the top of the circle they break look at that see how I guess that yeah I know yeah and you're like oh this has to we have to take care of this yes it's alright message it's it's art - it's like it's a temporary art form we just think of art is something like you know that Buddha statue or something that just lasts forever yeah but some there's some art like a sandcastle well it's temporary well you know in a weird way in a weird way music is kind of like that if it's not recorded right yeah well no I mean if it is recorded because you only experience it temporarily but it exists as a idea in your head you know that like a like a ghost image of it but then when you listen listen to it when you press play and you listen to it it's happening in real time as soon as you stop it it's no longer no longer exists so you're still just like in the kind of shadow memory of it right if you're not interacting with it it doesn't exist yeah yeah Wow yeah imagine there was something like that you could do with smells right smells are the one sense that doesn't get any love like your eyes people make all these beautiful things mm-hmm right your ears people make beautiful music you got like perfume Cologne and some fucking flowers it's all you got mm-hmm and weird shit like patchouli we're like settle down I said though you wouldn't be needs settle down settle down while you're in sting this incense sticks amber amber sticks amber smells by the way miss Pat after she was on she sent me incense did you said unto you - with black pussy incense soup does she make one no she was just talking about crazy incense flavor yeah she she she's aware of oh well she is saying she uses them or people use I mean the thing is you know that there's a niche market or people making custom incense with names like that right like they legitimately are naming them that way because it's a hip thing yeah that's a very specific kind of person right you have some kind of rug on the floor like some kind of Persian type rug it's miss Pat that's it yeah so what is it a joke it cuts at you some of these once it's butt-naked what does the other ones oh yeah claw yeah there you go black blood yeah pussy did you know miss Pat no oh my god you gotta meet her she's a funny she's one of the funniest human beings on earth for sure damn one of the funniest people I've ever met like right up there with Joey Diaz ahead she's so funny she's ridiculous like you leave a podcast with her and your fucking face hurts someone said that if you get John Witherspoon Joey Diaz and Miss Pat on podcast together we would like break the space-time continuum are you gonna do it fuck yeah I would love yes but I would just I would I would shut my mouth I wouldn't say a word I just want them to have fun do you know John Witherspoon I don't know dude he came on with his son his son JD is a comic as well yeah I met JD at the Comedy Store we're talking about his dad and like your dad is he's like a epic human being like he's so fucking funny and he's like let me get my dad to come into the podcast like yeah let's do it I would love to how you guys on let's come on so uh it might acts with my I don't remember how it came out but anyway he comes in here and it's like the Sun is like completely normal jdees intelligent he's funny he's like very very like you've you know you're not shocked by him he's a funny smart guy yeah but his dad is from another planet everything he says is funny the way he says it is funny he does not give a fuck oh I know that care dude yeah yeah he's on like his own groove he's on this I don't give a fuck times a million groove he's been doing a lot even it sounds like laughing like while he's like see this is what I grew up with him like that is crazy he's so funny like that guy you can make him funny in a movie yeah yeah good movie part he'll he'll do great in it yeah but he will never be able to compare it to him just being him in the moment because you lose that in the moment thing oh you know this isn't everything planned out yeah he's not reading a fucking script the guy just for three hours is just hilarious about anything about shoes he's hilarious about money he's hilarious about his drink he got to put his money in his pocket and rub it like it yeah he's yeah he like can hit any any angle anything is fair game it's he's doing a kind of art the art of being him this is what me and his son were talking about and this white relates he's doing an art form but it seems like he's just being himself and he is but he's figured out how to beat himself there's the most hilarious to the most people yeah it's a matter of whether or not you can plug that into a movie successfully it's maybe the best thing about just let him talk yes yes let him talk yeah like fuck your fuck your scripts like this guy's got a thing you know he's got a thing yes that is an art art it's like it's just like cooking it's just like anything like just like music there's an art to being a person even yeah for sure yeah right like why are some girls sexier is it just biology or is there an art to the way they communicate with you like when people are being flirtatious and then talking to each other there's an art to that yes like a little bit of a dance going on there yes absolutely some people are better at it yeah I mean yeah I mean it's a you know what gets your attention I mean there's so many factors like what it's like also like what you tend to view what's the first cue that generally will set you off whatever that is experience as you were a kid or you know someone you're on tour whatever was it was really cool and your cousin was a really sexy and those two a combination of those two elements are like something that you hit but I will say like yeah I think it's just someone who's is come when they're comfortable with themselves they just haven't that it also depends on what you're looking for - yeah yep but because resonance there has to be just like art just like music yes we're talking about like do you like it or not right music to you it might be the greatest song of all time to Jamie he's like yeah I can take it or leave it yeah yeah and then you can have a car you can have an argument about it which is really sweet but no one's ever right the bottom out yeah it's all love Motley Crue you love mom and crew it's not it's not this is anything wrong and bloody example but if you if you're fucking at home by yourself doing that that's art like why was that judge I'd do that with Whitesnake all the fucking the story before but a dude sent me in a white snake is set and I can't use that it's in the office because I had a girlfriend that made me throw it away after I got in a car accident I had a Whitesnake cassette in my car oh right why'd she make it because she thought of jazz dude you she's really gonna tell me what to do oh yeah she was older than me okay and she she's packing up all my stuff cuz my car was broken you know got I got t-boned and as I'm grabbing all my stuff she's like leave that I gonna leave what she's like leave the Whitesnake it's like you got to get over that music it's like yeah it's terrible music she was in like the Pixies that kind of shit oh yeah yeah just did back then I loved I loved them too but I also loved Whitesnake there's a thing that people do though where they only like things that make them appear smart or interesting and there's like it's like a hustle like you tell people you're really an Indian food and you really you might really be but there's also a thing you're doing like you're you're that person that's only into the cool stuff but like them that fucking Whitesnake song is badass that here yeah yeah yeah that's it's awesome they only had a few they were like really good they had that song is fucking banging to this day is this love that's a sexy video that was good videos it's like one of my favorite videos it's like the coolest even though it was 80s and it was like hyper 80s it's one of the few videos to me in my mind that is that had a style that was that kind of approaches timeless really yeah in a way it's good this wheat the sincerity the sincerity of it I mean that video is sexy with Tawny Kitaen and and and like her moving like around the bed or whatever it was classy it was it was like sexy was very adult kind of like watch it shit I have it but she looks amazing and and I love him just leaning on the wall like that he's like mr. cool guy it's it's done in such a sincere way but it's just on the right side of me still thinking that it's fucking great it's great art direction it's promoting ridiculous interactions yeah it was a promote promoting a ridiculous relationship just fucking talk what is all this drama I mean that shit he's very serious about what he's singing he's like a better-looking Luke from General Hospital remember when Luke and Laura yes that's it that guy it's like a better look in Luke that's so his hair is preposterous I know everybody there is just like off the time a Janu had a friend that just had hair like that like hey let's go let's go hit the gym he's like hey man you want to go go he's got like I get some a gallon hairspray in that shit I mean primped out that's just I ran back then that's that's white hair bro yeah you have the solution to that yeah yeah your hair you just it's fantastic you don't have to do anything yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah it's a totally lazy chaos it's lazy yeah it's chaos but at the same time like right but there's no work involved in the nose it's a beautiful chaos Oh as opposed to like yes no you got one of them picks and you're spraying picks and spring oh yeah get his hair that big oh I know there's a lot of work involved there that's a shit ton of hairspray as a lady offset it's just to keep yeah cos I like checking symmetry I mean the the guitar the band the like Whitesnake the band want some it was like it was the supergroup of hard rock like like it or metal I guess you can kind of it kind of bleeds into that like classic metal there's been a few of those supergroup so I just gonna freak me out man I'm like get off the car what are you doing in the car lady it's like she doesn't she just doesn't care she's rude she's on cartwheels wild look I wasn't serious that's what I mean man he's really serious about what he's singing about look and he's got three synth players in a row by the way yeah look at that yeah what is that mean that's a correct kind of hardcore I wish we could play this because it's so wonderful I do love the idea I mean let the hair color combination in the car I mean you know what this is good this is what happened when the war on drugs had a brief victory Oh what happened that you're talking about the band for a second the times Jimi Hendrix in this is the the absence of drugs like music creative this is coke yes is definitely maybe every now and then but it's not created by coke yeah that's like high-end party I'm you know like these guys are living like the high-end party shit sure yeah that's I guess that's where they're coming from but I mean to me that's what I like you know someone described the NS tens the the classic stage monitor our sorry studio monitors like when you're switching between different types show me what that looks like B right now you and Jamie on the same frequency oh yeah yeah well they're like a they're like this classic mixing an exec like are a tone and like they're just like speaker systems that have kind of become standards to a certain degree yeah and so and that weird thing about in his tens it's like in the 80s when they were using them I believe that's the right name for it but went in the 80s when they were using them it was really it had so much harsh high-end it was so crispy sounding and they said it was because of yeah it's because of coke usage and coke usage like creates a basically brains tend to favor different sound frequencies under the influence of different drugs and with coke they like that high-end crispy sizzle that was like hitting all the time and that was all amplified so then when you hear 80s music it tends to be it's mixed not all of it but a great deal of it is mixed with a lot of like upper mid treble miss Chris penis that's kind of a that totally make sense that's right you know sometimes albums need to be remastered because of that Wow but but that speaker is responsible that's what this is what I heard this is second-hand information but efficient that makes sense to you right it does totally make sense to me I mean it's one of those subtleties that you may never think about but then when you you hear about it you learn about it it blows open a whole new way of thinking about things well I don't know this but that's what everybody's always said about the the the dead and LSD exactly yeah that if you like the people that don't get the dead and I'm guilty of being one of those people yeah I'm not a huge fan but I respect them it's because you haven't listened on LSD apparently according to people that I say you listen to the Dead on LSD no like oh my god I get it oh I see I see interesting it's it's LSD music yeah yeah totally my cousin used to follow them around really yeah I filed that down for god I want to say a couple years where she was on tour they would selling bacon and eggs out of the car she was a total hippie like a real super legit hippie that's kind of thick but um that's rare so I got to talk to her about like the culture everyone's an acid they're all do so many of them are doing a Stram's I'd say every one of them but it's like it's probably half yes crazy for a concert imagine going to a concert in half that people were doing mushrooms like I know 100% of the time half I don't know if I'm that you're some pro I'm sorry I'm just guessing I think it's a it's it's psychedelic inspired music that once you're under that psychedelic apparently it makes sense and this is not me talking from personal experience yeah yeah yeah I mean it could be one of those things where you know there's like a photo slightly out of focus and then if you like bring in another or now better yet like a code it's like you get a picture of something and you're like I don't can't I can't tell what it is abstract and then you put you at this other layer on and it completes it and you're like oh that's what it is mmm in a way like I can imagine that being true but I can also say once you've experienced music that really ignites your imagination if you hear music that sounds amazing on LSD it should also sound amazing to you personally not on it how you can tell that it would be even more amazing if you were on LSD but it already sounds great it's like to me qualities like it exists in all states so like it's just yeah anyways that's kind of how I look at it it's an interesting perspective but you would think definitely the people see things differently when they under when they're under the influence of sure absolutely you you don't think there could be like a tipping point oh I think you're right no in2 to your point yes I do think that there is music where you like I don't know man and then you listen to it on mushrooms or whatever and you're like oh fuck this is dope I remember the first no doesn't - whole lotta love when I was high yeah and you know that period there's a period in the middle of the song where it's all just thimbles and fuck music it's like yes god damn I love that song but when you listen that song hi you like these guys were wild oh yeah this is the 1970s right yeah and these guys made a song where it started off great and then for a minute and a half it was just moans and fuck sounds shape for me baby I'm gonna be your back door man hey oh I was looking up this LSD okay for dead thing so they're sound engineer who went under the name bear which if you know they didn't let the Grateful Dead they used the Bears he was one of the only scientist when LSD was outlawed I could still make it wow that was the sound guy yeah oh Jesus Christ made it over five million doses but in between 65 and 67 it says they had their own personal guy and he was the one that making the sound so if that guy's still alive man they gonna put him in jail for the rest yeah so they were strictly formatted for LSD all right here's a dining car Oh Australia that's probably on the wrong side of the road because he was uh nasod that's just like don't get mad he's my hero I just cry and joke but that's amazing so they have their own built-in chemist God that must have been awaited that's so cool I love that because that's responsible I think that that's the responsible thing to do just let your own chemist that way you're not buying any nonsense yeah you're getting it from a guy who's a chemist yeah this is your person that personally makes this stuff for you you know where it comes from I just Matt how many people get busted at those concerts did feds or the DEA ever crack down on those concerts when I work I you worked you said you worked security yet like a great war yeah I did too for a summer and one of the concerts we did was for Phil Lesh he's the bass player of the Grateful Dead in my job for that day was to walk around the parking lot and they would just yell me and my buddy were 19 years old six up six up they thought we were gonna arrest everyone and they would try to give us the goo balls which have a bunch of drugs and I'm already two sort of dosis so we'd leave everybody alone what's a goo ball it's like a popcorn ball but from what I was told I've never had one bunch of psychedelics or show this leg dogs in it yeah it's just like a thing you would eat no this gets you high the virus by just the first guy to stumble on mushrooms what fuck like mushrooms had to have been like relearned at some point in time there had to be some people that lived in an environment where there was no mushrooms where people didn't get them and then someone found him somewhere but they didn't have any personal knowledge of what it wasn't tried it made it and tripped that had to have happened yeah I mean I think you know it could it could also be like hey I'm foraging for blah blah blah's and because arguably they would save mushrooms are around like weh-weh with some people you know not so scientific perhaps I don't know or maybe scientific have surmised that maybe consciousness or self-awareness came from the our species running into some kind of a psychedelic event you know which caused like this hyper self-awareness loop or whatever and then you know why that one deserves a lot of attention because people are so resistant to it like really rational intelligent people are so resistant to it and it's almost resistant to what to that concept oh yes but maybe our consciousness was somehow influenced my psychedelic but to a man almost to a man all the oceans are that even I'm over over generalizing but many of those people have not had psychedelic experiences that dismiss them so readily that's true the people that have had psychedelic experiences that tend to be skeptical or more rational they wouldn't they're not gonna have a definitive position on it they're gonna go well hmm yeah right something to consider it's more measured yeah there's the hardliners you know there's a hardliners on both sides the hardliners definitely believe that happened and the hardliners who believe that it that they don't have any positive effects whatsoever yeah yeah totally both almost equally foolish exactly yeah yeah I mean that's that's what we're experiencing right now but it leaves the people that have experienced it they know what they're talking about the people that haven't experienced it and don't think it's worth trying like all right right like how do you know yeah I know all these people are saying that it's amazing and then it might be this literally this source of religion itself it's one of the people when they've had it they have these complete life changes where they doesn't rethink things and want to be kinder to people and nicer to people I don't want to just have more of a sense of community yeah and then you're just people dismissed that but yet they'll take yoga seriously in meditation seriously and they'll go to a therapist all the time and maybe they'll even get on antidepressants maybe get all over the xanax somehow more anxiety issues Reggie Watts and then they're scared of mushrooms it's weird interesting yeah I mean I get I get it and I I don't know oh I get it but it's a flaw yeah it is a fly I mean it just I guess if your job is to take in as many angles as possible to a problem or a situation or a concern or whatever way all of the things about all of it yeah and then come up with a lucien based off of that but this isn't even encouraging anyone to do it but this is just saying to dismiss it as being not important when you've never done it is nonsense yeah that's all I'm saying I'm saying it's like I'm not saying you should do it I don't think I know a lot of people that birth to grave have done no psychedelics and they're great and there are wonderful people in a great life and they had a wonderful experience it's not a prerequisite it's not a necessary thing no oh yeah if you're speaking on the issues like well the research shows like oh you're gonna let the research show you is what the experience let me tell you about the research five dried grams in silent darkness as Terence Mckenna would describe oh and prescribe yeah do that oh my gosh do that and then we'll talk yeah you know just have one quick DMT trip and we'll talk because there's no way that I think it would be difficult I'm sure there's someone who has done psychedelics and has and still says no sure yeah yeah but I would say that most people they would understand at least maybe they didn't have a great time but they would at least understand the power of that yerin's I think some people have the burden of intelligence and what I mean by that is that they're really smart and they see a lot of people around them that are silly and they experience that so often that they get weary and they get they get you know they sort of get rigid in their belief that their opinions are correct because they dismiss most of the people that are around them mm-hmm cuz you're out a bunch of dummies if you're really smart guy or smart girl it's hard it's hard to maintain a good perception of what things are and what things aren't when you're the smartest person in the room you kind of never want to be the smartest person in the room yeah and also yes and also believing that you are yeah anyway excludes you from including other people who are also smarter than everybody in the room well Sonny maybe not even smarter which I said but I never sided by an ideology their perspective isn't dimmed right yeah yes they see things clearly which is I think one of the most underrated forms of intelligence like there's all this intelligence and solving mathematical problems Yeah right social intelligence but this heart there's there's a bunch of different kinds of intelligence absolutely be able to see through the bullshit is-isn't intelligence and some people don't have it yeah no absolutely and I think that you know at the same time wanting to help someone see that angle is also an important thing so if you're like a if you're someone who's like oh shit like let's say it's us maybe you're maybe you're trained in tactical awareness right and you I just have a different way of being in a room where you sit talk about all that stuff and the situation arises where like potentially something dangerous could happen or whatever then being able to explain that idea and that type of awareness so that someone can see that is also possible like sharing it they may not get it to the extent that you do but they at least you've included it in their viewpoint yeah maybe well people that are soldiers they do have a weird where men are in the room since my friend Andy stump he's uh always sneaking up on me said you got no situational awareness yeah yeah like we're in a crowd what am I supposed to just constantly on 360 looking for danger I mean yeah that's what he's saying that's because you see you know how they look at they look at things a whole lot difference how you stay alive exactly yeah I think one of the things it's super important for people to recognize and helps them open their mind up to other opinions is that even if they favor themselves very highly that competitive thing of comparing your intellect and your reason to other people it's very limiting yes then instead of worrying about yourself if you're smart just be smart yeah but they just appreciate other intelligences if it just just get into talking to them this isn't that's my thoughts on it instead of being competitive with them get into trying to find out how they they work because there's a lot of different humans on this planet and we have this egocentric position almost everybody does that there are at least better at one thing than other people are or they know some more about one thing that other people do it's a weird competitive thing that people get involved in it's been it's stupid like yeah you should recognize that it's awesome to have cool people around you that are like really small and interested in weird shit and you're intelligent and inspiring you almost envy their their creativity those are massively important people to have in your life but when people get they feel weird about comparing themselves to the other person because they come up under favor NSYNC insecurities exactly that's where I see that with a lot of guys guys puff up chests and start you know comparing like how much their houses cost I feel like like literally doing stuff that you're like oh we're still doing this like to Tipton to my mind away oh shit you guys aren't aware of it like a way that I yeah you guys are doing some 1990 shit here yeah because it's like I know cuz like either they're like doing an act yeah you know which I'm always hoping and I'm always okay that's why there's disbelief when it really is what it is I'm like oh shit oh that's best for real that's actually the thing it's weird right yeah it is a little it's a little weird I mean some people have a lack of cool people around them too that's a real problem yeah he's stuck in a shit it's like a good tomato plant is not gonna grow in the fucking Sonora Desert all right there's no nutrients there it's too bright it's the sun's too hot it's not the right climate Yeah right yes if you're stuck in some fucking shithole City and it's just your whole neighbourhoods fill with dummies and there's no prospects and there's fucking lead in the water you got Flint Michigan water you're drinking there still haven't fixed that no people if you drink bottled water in Flint Michigan yeah in 2019 yep like how how would that do they not have how did they let that ever get to that point like at all the things you need what do we need to stay alive number one water okay let's ignore that let's ignore that and work on the cracks and the streets let's ignore that and have new traffic lights that have cameras on them to bust you so we can get more revenue let's yeah sure we hire Parkington what about the water we do that we get that water yeah well it's it's my new phrase for you know our situation cuz capitalism cuz the current version of capitalism I said capitalism I don't even well no one about economics I mean I it's not really it's more just like a philosophical right I didn't have capitalism with regulation so that you make sure that there's no pollution you make sure that PS of course we with environmental disaster of course and aren't we also going on the fucking momentum of decisions that were made a long time ago look a lot of this stuff like a lot of these minds that pollute everywhere pollute environments wherever they are they kind of made those when environment learn about environmental laws were different right yeah for sure I mean environmentalism was it wasn't really a thing until like the mid 1900s I guess so like like Roosevelt like was like a huge like environmental hmm groovy dude but the idea of preserving swaths of land and like considering the environment when growing an economy simultaneously yeah like that just that just stopped like there's like some national parks stuff and maybe some things passed with like ozone some lead stuff some mercury stuff you know kind of common sense really hardcore shit that should definitely like no-brainers those have been done but anything else making sure that that balance is there as the economy grows just doesn't exist just the way capitalism is right now it's like it doesn't that's not considered a value there's the more in fact that more scarce it becomes the higher and value it is so it's so it's in its own best interest to continue to grow and grow and grow until it can't grow anymore so that so that's why decisions like that are made in my in my mind while decisions that impact the wilderness and impact in the environment like did you ever see that movie Gasland no great documentary on fracking oh wow really crazy what does the director's name Josh Fox Rowland know he's a different guy bro no there's no way no no no way but it's an amazing documentary and Jeff Hawk Josh Fox I did Josh Fox um it's really good really really good documentary it's whose box he's a guy who made the film yeah ok-hee and he was inspired by a personal experience with wasn't it do you remember the actual story Jamie it's like personal experience with some pollutants or something like that in the river the guy didn't know anyway made this amazing documentary and the marching people dismiss some of the stuff that documentary was so so surreal oh yeah they were lighting their tap water on fire and I don't know if you saw that but I did see that yeah and that's crazy people literally were saying you could do that before the fracking that's not it's not because of the fracking Wow people were saying that like okay let's assume that's true let's just get craziness ooh that's true the fucking water is on fire that's the last shit that should be on fire is this shit they used to put out fire yes your goddamned water's on fire yeah do you know how much shit has to be in your water for it to be on fire okay what's going on here and why are you so sure that this didn't come from fracking and that you could always let your water on fire and now you're telling us yeah you didn't make videos about this before before there was a fracking thing yes showing a video see are you sure of interesting are you really sure that there's a view tested the water you a fucking scientist you sitting over there with a lab coat and a fucking check sheet yeah I'm sure that the the toxin levels are exactly the same before and after fracking no you're not but why you so interested there's a thing that people do with it like really interested in the interests of big business and they want that like the guess and regular people who don't even have a financial stake in that business will make up excuses for the business I know it's crazy yeah what is that it's fear mmm it's just fear of losing jobs like people like losing jobs or losing the thing that keeps their their bills paid it's also like that no-nonsense right-wing mindset there's like a no-nonsense right-wing mindset all these fucking tree huggers goddamn tree huggers oh yeah I stopped us from making a good living you want those people to be poured you want those people to you ever see the look of a poor coal miners face yeah and I mean there's that thing that they do yes and no nonsense so they want to go with anything that's like good for the economy but bad for the environment it's just crazy it's because you never Pfizer you have to factor in the other the additional cost so how much is gonna cost to fix what you did if you ever can fix what you did and if you can't fix what you did to the environment how much should that cost because if you could if you decide like hey I'm gonna pull copper out of this fucking hole in the ground but it might kill a million salmon like you imagined how much a million salmon would be worth you're gonna kill a whole population of salmon how much is that worth I'll give you ruined fishing for all the people that want to come to this one salmon river yeah you kill a million fish like how much is that worth that's that should be worth a billion dollars yeah you should get fined a billion dollars if not more yeah you can't even fix that that's what I'm that's what I'm saying that's that's what that that value that it has no value it's also it's ours but who is earning is our stuff I know it that's like me that's like the earth it's just the worst because it's like it does not it's just a nut it's not a part of the equation for growing the economy that's like and I know there's gonna be people listening they're like just know about this shit hardcore I'm just approaching it from like an over kind of philosophical energetic viewpoint right right well we'll be in hippies yeah we're being like kind of a weirdo forest answers so have you ever seen some of the image of the mining that they do the images of the mining they do in northern Canada like northern Alberta no dude it's like some hellscape shit it's crazy it's it's like there's a giant industry of oil mining up there yeah all kinds of mining yeah and northern can a lot of folks that go up there and they do shifts but I mean you're talking unbelievably brutally ruthlessly cold occasionally people get jacked by bears yeah really living there living with monsters just outside the gates yeah I'm fucking nights watch type deal what they're trying to suck oil out of the ground and I mean there's so much of it up there and it's such a big part of the economy that you have these giant like aerial views of these this these places that are just fucks ville Wow there's one of them the one I thought was much more horrific because it involves a lake so what does it say photos fame photographer Alex McLean's new photo of Canada's oil sands are shocking yeah I mean it's creepy it's I mean but there was nothing there anyway the idea is like hey if it's just flat like that or it's ugly because we have holes in oils coming out of the hole who gives a shit no one's up here right look I get it I get that mindset we got jobs everyone has jobs and it's true it's a great job to have they make a lot of money you meet those dudes that come to a lot of shows when you do in Canada yeah they have a name for him like really loyal worker yeah yeah its royal it's real real rich oil worker fellows yeah that's the nickname did drilling he's giant that's one that I saw and see the water all fucked up it's all filled oil and shit all my Lords yeah that's a it's a water man yeah the waters far Wow yeah yeah it's it's it's funny all of the all of the issues that all of the imbalances are completely solvable there's like there is no deficit we don't have a deficit mmm in what it would take to just make good decisions that have make life really nice for most people on the planet I think a lot of managing has to be done because there's a lot of stuff that has unintended consequences and moving pieces affect all the moving pieces around them of course I think that's one of the things that people are really bad at predicting that's why I was saying like yeah you know how much is it worth to be able to get copper out of a hole in the ground it's gonna poison a river and kill a bunch of fish how much is that worth yeah you know it's like these people have this sense that like you make one decision that it only affects that thing but it doesn't affects a lot of things they're connected to that thing yeah it also affects the way people feel if you do something shitty like kill a million fish people get bummed out like that's real it affects the way they interact with other people yeah you know when you read something really fucked up on the news you like goddamnit and so you leave your house like that you leave your house like god damnit yeah two people that have that goddammit and then they they get upset at each other for something that wouldn't before yeah because they're just thinking there's a bunch of pedophiles out there and a bunch of monsters and a bunch of murderers and a bunch of people porn oil into the ocean ya know - bummer it changes when people do fucked-up things it changes how we feel about people 100% and I I don't know I get I don't know it's I try to get that to get overwhelmed by those but you know it's like really the best thing at least in my life that I try to do is is make friends with as many technologists and designers and people of that ilk hmm to be able to at least be a part of the conversation cuz they're at that they're like that the head of the wave I think there's there's nothing really in front of them they're just on that like you know whatever bleeding edge or whatever but it's just like that the place where chaos is being ordered and like the decisions are being made which waves we're going to do that and if you can have good conversations with people like that you can kind of I believe you can kind of help steer things at least technologically to allocate funds to different portions of technology that it should be more prioritize than that than they are hmm like like just figuring out things like accumulating water out of out of the air like more of that should be used or reducing carbon emissions all the various things you can do for that you know try to close that gap between the ultra ultra ultra ultra rich and in the poor it's like everyone can still be super happy if everyone if everyone had access to be able to level up to a point that's ridiculous that can still happen but not at the levels that they are well it's not interesting that the instinct that people have to resist that idea that poor people shouldn't be somehow or another we should engineer a way to have less poor people that we should consider it as a problem but people get really resistant to that right you start thinking oh no no what do you want to do you want to take my fucking money and give it to someone else no it's yeah I take my money but could social Lucy's take my minor yeah it's like well he didn't work for it so he didn't find the right way to work inside of the system's yeah I'm sorry I don't think they're right I don't think they're wrong about the whole concept of not giving people money doesn't solve a problem no it doesn't solve a problem but recognizing that it's a problem and engineering it so that we have a better society where more people are doing good that's great for everybody so early it's great for the economy it's a weird caste system thing where people who are really poor you almost want them to stay really poor yeah you don't want to I don't get it it's weird I don't get it I'm like I cuz I feel uncomfortable if I'm in a room of people and I feel like someone's being kind of just looked over consistently yeah that's the person I'm gonna engage with the most well you're a great guy that's awesome you are that I mean that's a good way of looking at I mean cuz it's it and also it's just like kind of people thanks but it's really it's it's all just a practical thing right i mean i mean if you're sensitive to that but if that's part of your value system it's like i feel like you know not everybody should be doing this or this or that or that but everybody is entitled to be recognized and respected for that and so that's kind of a cool place to operate from but I guess ymez relating to economically yeah if more people are doing well then you then you have a very productive society right there are no drags on it like there's a lot dragging this this economy sure it's just like yeah crime and poverty is getting beyond drug addicts yeah and a lot of drug addicts come from abuse yeah a lot of abuse comes from poverty there's a lot a lot of those factors that play in there that make us a weaker country that's how I'll be like if you really patriotic you'd want to fix all of the impoverished neighborhoods yes we if we're a team the team is stronger when there's less losers right well people are not losing in life well people are losing because they're stuck in a spot where they can almost never get out by the time they're 18 they've already been in jail twice and they're kind of programmed by their environment to be hostile because the world around you is harsh and nasty and doesn't give a fuck about you well you have to adapt to survive I mean that's how people are able to kill people in war people have a remarkable ability to adapt yes but the idea that they should be able to figure that out when you didn't have that's crazy that's crazy it's such a bad hand you have the worst hand of cards ever yeah and they're us we're all on the team like if you really say you're American I'm American man I'll fucking support this country this country's everybody man yeah everybody everybody I forget let's leave just for convenience sake let's leave out illegals yeah and only say the poor people that were born here that are you registered United States citizens week out work to do oh yeah we got work to do it's it's it's just it's a to me I mean I I see it and I'm like oh fuck man that shouldn't be a thing well but I see why you know it's like you're talking about there's this weird biological human instinct to create a tiered system of xiety because that's the way you control society is like creating a transmission looks like a social transmission and like that is interesting way of looking at it yeah cuz it's like that way you can manipulate you can like switch gears and you can play out you can play them off of one another mmm and and you know and I think like some conspiracy thinking writers it convenient is they can just convenient that people want to keep it's crabs in a bucket you know that expression yeah crabs never get out of the bucket the other crabs grab them and drag them down yeah yes true yes I mean it's a it's predicting human behavior you know to a certain extent and it's a lot of left over monkey stuff yeah man it's the it's not it's just still here yeah so here and it's a question shit up well we also needed it just a hundred years ago totally yeah yeah it was people were doing duels when they were the president was doing duels yeah you're right this is so recent you're right yeah every barek shit man shoot each other with little mini muskets in the fucking Street front everybody and you were the president that's true was there president that got a duel this is true right I think you're a looked it up as Andrew Jackson gotten like over a hundred doors I think but that's like was like that dual type to it was really just like a challenge to see who if you would show up really and then like always like someone died didn't shoot anybody he did like one person Oh about it they don't aim at each other that's why that's oh I heard that there's like you kind of like a mere them doing something like that yeah and that was a way to concede in one duel he got shot I think in the chest but he was such a badass he stayed he like put his hand over it and held it and insta cuz his gun jammed when he was supposed to fire so the other guy got him and then he fixed his gun shot the guy in the head and that guy ended up I'm pretty sure that's that's yeah but like the one guy who killed town she do you have a real motivation to kill a guy when shoots in the chest that's yeah you're like oh he eliminate threat now this becomes really just has to stand there he can't run away goofy is that you have to stand there let it do shoot you that's part of the deal right I don't the am Turner oh my god happy like I win bitch and yes a guy named Charles Dickinson not the rider but a horse a rival horse breeder and here's the account of their oh my god okay here it goes on May 30th 1806 Jackson and Dickinson met at Harrison's Mills on the Red River in Logan Kentucky at the first signal from there seconds Dickinson fired Jackson received Dickinson's first bullet in the chest next to his heart Jackson put his hand over the wound to staunch the flow of blood and stayed standing long enough to fire his gun Dickinson seconds claimed that Jackson's first shot misfired which would have meant that the wool was over but in a breach of etiquette Jackson reeked acht the gun and shot again this time killing his opponent although Jackson recovered he suffered chronic pain from the wound for the remainder of his life dang Jackson was not prosecuted for murder and the duel had very little effect on a successful campaign for the presidency in 1829 many American men in the early 1800s particularly in the south viewed dueling as a time-honored tradition just a couple of years ago with barbarians you're like well sometimes you just got to do it that is a time-honored tradition 200 years ago people were so goddamn crazy that you could shoot someone in the fucking face in a duel a street fight and then run for president and win ya its consent consensual I mean there are versions of that now but amazing but yeah his divorce rate raised more of a scandal than him killing that guy Wow how's that possible Wow I mean again priorities different societies yeah what is gossip like back then like gossip magazines and have like like hand printed newspaper with gossip in it that they would hand out yeah well why would his divorce become a big deal not that the printing press back then right oh yeah for sure yeah you know the United States got it theirs in 1850 like everyone had to buy into it people are so goofy that just a couple hundred years ago they were so goofy I mean that's one of the best examples of like a difference in a shift in culture imagine hearing that today imagine hearing that we had slid so far down that and Putin we're engaging in a duel and they were gonna go back-to-back and chomp cheated and shot him and we're yeah I wonder who would cheat who will have that habit of 12 chump took a bullet but his gun misfired then he reek arced it and fire again oh that would be something that's what but that's what he did that's what Jackson did Oh Mike was it Jackson yeah yeah though okay so he married Rachel Jackson who this is part of the duel because the guy killed Dickinson had publicly called her a bigamist because she married Jackson not knowing her first husband had fought not finalized the divorce or something like that so that was a bigger scandal that he was married to some already married woman oh like that got outed so he's like fucking you when I kill you oh my goodness Wow so he challenged him to a duel because Jackson challenged him to a duel yeah that and I renig horse bet he said oh my god of course you can't cheat on horse betting yeah that's those are two big things man don't say a man's wife is a bigamist you don't say that's what they're shooting people over fucking horse bets at shit yeah those are barbarian people in this our ancestors just two hundred years ago this is like very civil civil barbarian is like well we're barbarians with their rules well that's one of the more hilarious stories of the Revolutionary War right the way the British soldiers dressed was so silly they literally put a target on their fucking chest they made their vitals lighter it may look a few you should enhance you know it's like you can see if you could see things clearly it makes a much more viable target yes period yeah and you're talking about people that didn't have any sights on their guns in terms of optics obviously they had like little machined sights little metal sights but the way these guys walk towards them especially the ones with the X's on the chest or shit is so ridiculous they're walking bull's-eyes is the dumbest thing Wow and the only thing I'm is it makes sense to me that they had just had it easy for too long not not even easy but they were in control for too long they got they got a little silly yeah God how barbaric people can be earlier thinking about fashion well that the weirdest fashion right like that that was what they used for wartime like this is really professionals yeah you know I mean like this soldiers looked a little bit more like hey guys were professional soldiers and we're it doesn't look like good clothes for fucking people up in no it looks cool yeah but what a weird outfit right that military weird how much hand-to-hand combat were they doing it wasn't a lot of swords it was just joking off that's all they did they just got in the woods and cuz if they knew any digits I think I would be great someone could choke everyone out with that with those outfits yet it's just I bet that clothing doesn't move good too I mean I'm just guessing but I think they're fucking cloth it's probably dog shit back then yeah a real stiff hard to move around and it's just a weird outfit it's not like something you if you were to run through the woods and fire a gun you want to wear with like soldiers wear today and you want to be able to blend in but it's just so strange that that wasn't even a concern back then they have knee-high leggings yeah weird shoes wars were more like chests like every like the soldiers and all the different rank-and-file they're all like pieces on a chessboard so it's all about strategy you know it's like we'll line our men up this way and we'll do this and blah blah blah it's more like that's how battles are being organized is like chess games you know before you had gorillas right right right well was gorillas at first and then it became how that's true yeah like Mongol there were lighting people on fire and catapult yeah by any means necessary wore those shoes did not have tread they hadn't invented tread on shoes yet that's how I see people are yes they had leather shoes so the soles were leather so they were scuffed up but there was no tread I bet you some soldiers like figured out how they wrapped you know I sunk leather and wrapped layers you know I'm around the foot so it's great interaction yeah because if you think like you take like a trail running shoe and if you ever wear like like a Salomon speed cross trail she loves us yeah they're great they have these big divots in the bottom yeah really dig into the dirt with those things yeah if you had to compare yourself running up a hill in cowboy boots that have the flat leather Slippery source versus you would fall on your fucking face yeah there's no way you'd have any confidence yeah I have that nothing but those Solomon's just dig in and go it gives you a totally false perception of real I have um those Vibram FiveFingers running shoes oh yeah yeah yeah and I run in the trail ones which have like a good amount of tread in it but one day I tried to run in the ones that aren't trail ones they're they're basically just for the gym they're super thin there was no tread at all I was falling on my fucking face my legs were just going whoops going uphill your legs just go whoopsies oh no no tread at all it's just slippery I can imagine that you need like if you run it up a stiff hell you need divots you know you need something like - yeah don't even have that back they just had leather you find tread I sort of found a shoe I think it says it was from the Revolutionary War but it doesn't show the tread is just a fucking old piece of leather that's yeah Rossi - don't tread on me there that was their shoes back then bullshit ass shoes but the bottom was just fucking leather I mean when I when they figured out like Vibram leather soles you know I mean rubber soles where the hell you get out how to get those like thick socks some more time yeah those are those are clogs well basically this borrowed that Dutch technology yeah wooden shoes fuck look at those things Wow dude this is a couple hundred years ago people would just take animal skin off and chop it up and put it on their body I mean that's how people stayed alive like how they figured out wood and leather I wonder who the first fucking monkey was to figure out our skin and animal and where its skin you know had to be like in the monkey days right now I feels like it'd be a couple generations away from the monkey maybe don't you think maybe it was one just can't imagine a monkey doing one mean motherfucking chimp and they were going north and there's one dude who always annoyed them so he kills him with a rock and then uses the rock to take his fucking skin off and where is it to freak everybody else out but then he realized it makes him warm you know a little further north uh-huh that's like a movie okay I'd like to get a movie can you see that scene I can see that that that that's like that's what the entire movie leads up to wonderful in the first monkey figured out he could kill an animal with like a tool like the firt like Australia Pittacus or one of those oh yeah primitive humans when the first one was that stabbed something like a stabbed a rat or a rabbit with a stick and went holy shit right I can just use this tool yeah what other tools I'm gonna start eating yeah I'm gonna eat good because if you didn't have a weapon how hard is it for a person to kill something with your hands what are you even gonna get what are you gonna catch what the fuck can you catch with your hands well I can't catch a squirrel you'd be just your hands no tools you'd be hunting and gathering mostly I mean I mean gathering I would say yeah you'd be eating shit that you found on the ground yeah that's primarily what you would eat and then once in a while you'd get something an animal but but yeah but then they had yeah you're right they obviously had to figure out different ways of getting animals well it's one of the shifts that they think took place that allowed the human brain size to double over a period of two million years no real human brain size apparently I was listening to a Terence Mckenna lecture on this once and he was talking about all the human brain size doubled over the period of two million years it's one of the biggest mysteries in the fossil record and his idea was that they discovered mushrooms and that the chimps over this period of time with the monkey people whatever the fuck they were in ancient hominids yeah had discovered mushrooms after the climate had shifted and he backs it up and he did back at my place he's dead now he backed it up with some climate data that we know from you know core samples and stuff like that yeah he thinks that they experienced climate change where the rainforest had receded in the grasslands and that this gave birth to the rise of ungulates like cows and you know deer and things like that yeah and they would shit these mushrooms would grow on their shit and then they've observed a lot of these monkeys in the wild picking up cow patties and looking for grubs and beetles underneath it I think they might have experimented with the mushrooms and that if they experimented with psilocybin mushrooms a lot of things could take place once they realized that it was not just a viable food source but also provided them with a bunch of different benefits one being their vision and increases visual acuity know we're seeing those roses yeah so they make them see things better - makes them hornier makes it more communal and it makes them more creative and all those things possibly could have given birth to the two to language and to a lot of other things they also think it's possible that that creativity could have enabled them to start hunting that they started using tools and you in thinking and and trying to figure out ways around stuff and trying to you know try to figure out how to make an effective weapon to kill something in the distance like the more they're thinking and becoming creative the more that stuff's enhancing them and this this period of two million years is like a pretty profound jump for the human brain sighs they think some of that also came to do with our desire to kill things with with weapons but once we started hunting and eating meat we got way more protein more bioavailable protein all it was healthier for the animal for the human animal and then we also started to try to figure out other better ways to kill these animals which made it even more creative and competitive yeah yeah and they think that all this these all these factors might have taken place that turned us into a person that's pretty amazing two million years yeah it's just like a deviation well you know it's 65 million years ago we were like a mole oh yeah people will like a little shrew that's all that's right I remember that what's the name of that thing I think it's sort of Norfolk errific good trick well it's north kisser Franciscus I think you're right North Crispus sisterís it was like a weird little Mole sorry specific this that's what it is yeah it's um a little tiny rodent yeah because I did a podcast or it with oh there it is the alias of what does that word youth Thorian eutherian mammals was a small rat-like creature depict in this illustration that lived 145 million years ago in the shadow of the dinosaurs so that rat-like creature apparently survived the earthquake impact I don't think that's the thing though it's there's another there's a formal name for it I would I know because I was on a podcast and they were that one of the segments of it they talked about this thing this is but they don't the only reason why I'm skeptical because it says 145 million years ago but I guess maybe they survived the impact scroll back up to the top of the title says these rodent-like creatures are the earliest known ancestors of humans whales and troops oh ok that's even more crazy like we used to be a whale yes our ancestors we shared a common ancestor I should say yeah we like went into the sea and then yeah on land that thing that fucking rat became a whale what all right maybe that's it ok mm-hmm got turned into a person folks think about that we set in your rat traps and then 100 million years from now rats might be some super superior human form I think that's very possible but I mean that I get why Christians are skeptical now like what do you show me your work God made this God didn't I was not a rat I was not a rat sir yeah I just appeared but in essence here's what here's a way to kind of maybe justify that argument it's like let's say the mushroom thing is true right so in essence humans became humans with the intervention fuel of a natural psychedelic substance which then expanded the mind and enabled the growth of that my the acceleration of intelligence self-awareness like like Lightspeed and so in essence like God created man or whatever you like that idea it's like well in in essence it is the unit if you think of God is the universe or whatever I that's one way thinking of it God a collective consciousness whatever you want to call it like that that intervention or the the ability to see or sense that expansiveness of that collective intelligence could be attributed to God so therefore you could say well I was never apply was like well yeah you are from that what created you was something more cosmic so and if if that's even true well I was reading a quote today from that someone was mocking from Piers Morgan we was talking about the unit like atheists and not knowing what happened before the Big Bang not knowing how no one has any answer for what happened before the Big Bang and about how this made sense to him that this is I think the way he was saying it was a somehow or another was evidence or at least in his eyes of something more superior out here this no atheists can never say what was there before the Big Bang they just say nothing and they can't explain what nothing actually is no human brain can which is why I believe in something that has superior powers to the human brain well that makes sense that there's definitely think out Brian Cox went after his ass what a Brian Cox a if you mean the hot Big Bang then there may be a period of rapid expansion known as inflation this theory is able to account for the observed features of the universe including cluding the CMB power spectrum and the flatness and horizon problems I love it Cox just came at him with the science I love it I always try to do it I know what he's trying to say what Pierce mark is trying to say and he's right no one has an answer as to like why this thing became why the Big Bang happened it's an interesting quote by this guy we was talking about forget who it was I wish I could remember but he was talking about how people how it might have been McKenna have so much faith in science and so little faith in mystical things but yet science revolves on one initial theory where magic took place where everything came out of nothing that it was smaller than the head of a pencil so everything you see in the observable universe including planes trains and automobiles all of it had to have had an origin in the most spectacular sorcery the world has ever known like it is all dependent upon magic so he wasn't he wasn't saying that you know ridiculous ideological ideas of the start birth and death of the universe are fact but he was saying that look look the fact according to scientists is that all evidence points to this whole thing coming out of nothing this whole thing this whole thing existing out of nowhere and with Piers Morgan it's I think is saying is that that gives birth that that gives proof did something superior to the human brain which for sure it does well yes yes here we are at this is Terence Mckenna we were asked by science to believe the entire universe sprang from nothingness and at a single point and for no discernible reason this notion is the limit case for credulity in other words if you can believe this you can believe anything well I think I said it I said it in a paraphrase achill way that's basically the same thing he's um you know yeah saying look it's all it's all knots man yeah I mean my thing is like I think I like to think of it as in simulation terms and in in the sense that if thinking of like reality the way it's perceiving the way that we move through it is a kind of a designed game of sorts mm-hm and so if I think of it in that way like nothing and something nothing in something that's just kind of that's the core of our reality right we live in a binary reality everything is a complex assortment of binaries that add up into a really complex system right in a way so what do you think it's moving towards well think about that well that's that's the thing I think that part of the rules or what makes it hard to rationalize like nothingness or or something very very fantastic is just because it because it's binary we are binary in our thought process so it's hard for us to not think of things in a binary way so we think other was a beginning no there was an ending there was a beginning there's an ending but really it's infinite it's like it's paradox right it's everything and nothing simultaneously hmm and and the absence of which but but I've I guess what I'm saying is that the idea that things are infinite that reality is infinite it's kind of a good way but kind of can be scary but a good way to think of it because it doesn't make any sense wouldn't be it seems like we have a limited way of viewing what reality is and I think we're limited by a binary thought processes I guess well it's also interesting that we want to put any sort of limitations on the universe and that yeah its immense size isn't crazy enough for us we could look at what we know right if we know that the universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies like just there's a bunch of competing theories as to what happens you know with black holes and whether or not there's multiverses there's a bunch of theories right yes right but one of the most profound ones that it was ever explained to me is that there's a supermassive black hole in the center of every galaxy and it's exactly I think 1/2 of 1% of the mass the entire galaxy oh really so the bigger galaxies have bigger supermassive black holes and the concept is that is there is a real possibility that going through that black hole you would encounter an entirely different universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies each galaxy have a black hole in the center of it go through that black hole an entirely different universe so each one s universe when you have hundreds of billions of galaxies there are hundreds of billions of universes through those black holes and each one of those galaxies or each one of those universes has also hundreds of billions of galaxies and each one of those has a black hole you go through that hundreds of billions of galaxies that the whole thing fractal exactly just like this cubes happening there's a resistance come on yeah there's a thing like an instant reaction to resist that notion as if the universe itself isn't already the most incredible thing of magic right I know what do you care if it's infinite why is it why would you even resist that well because that's the part of the binary thinking it's like I want something to have an end it's like it's a it's a way for us to survive but like you know it's like oh there's an end to that that creates a a need to survive but when you think of things in an abstract way like well if something is just infinite infinite infinite and what does that mean about us it's like that's the question that's the thing to explore because then you have to renegotiate or your your relationship to reality yeah which is pretty sick we have at least we'd like to take comfort in the idea that the universe has at least there's a certain parameter to it I know now it's 14 billion light years and that's it no more no marker as if you can even understand what 14 billion light is there's no way it could be that number it seems more like 19 but whatever that number is you know they don't say the way Cox explained it to me yeah that you and I believe Sean Carroll explained it this way as well there's a real dis real lack of understanding about what goes beyond that because it takes a certain amount of time for light to even get to us yeah and that time that that the light doesn't move fast enough to reach us from further events yeah so I give you had something from like 200 billion light years ago but maybe the light would even get to us yet yeah there's things that yeah I mean we're living in a siphoning yeah I mean that's when you see that's the other mind fuck when you're looking this guy and you're seeing a galaxy or of any sort of star like in the deep deep deep distance of space yeah the fucking light coming from that thing left a million years ago yeah right now way more you're literally just looking at the past what is it if you had imagined what is the closest star to our star in the seeable universe when you look up into the night sky we think the Darla's star how is that a star sometimes things are called stars but they're planets from old-school times oh and I could be wrong if you had a guess was the closest how many my office in sorry I don't know that's how straight I sent or is it how much is it how far was that or 4.3 light years from Earth wow that's too bad that's a hop skip and a jump if you go the speed of light take you 40 yeah it's like the Hawaii of outer space that like they go there and there's a pit stop there before they come to earth and the aliens come they want to chill I oh shit some use for breaking not really it's a binary pair so I imagine that means that they move yeah each other they orbit around each other there's technically a third star Proxima Centauri which is because it says those are an average of 4.3 this one's 4.2 - so it's well Nikoli close they're nice in an average so two are closer than the one on one day now do they know if there's planets around those stars so they they didn't even know there were other planets for sure other than oh isn't it crazy so just a couple decades it's it's so amazing to me it's like shining a flashlight in the ocean yeah you know like that's what space is like it's like you're removing a beam but like things are constantly changing at different distances and you can see better under certain circumstances and you can see at different times so like it's kind of like a big existential party you're like I think I'm making sense of this and then there's all these theories and then someone catches another angle they're like no no I mean yes a little bit of what you guys were thinking but also this they're like fuck and they just keep adding to it but I don't know if we're gonna find necessarily anything we talked to physicists about the subject and they try to explain to you how they even reach these conclusions mm-hmm and how they know that there's black holes out there in the first place and the a theories fucking like these these these theories of multiverses and yeah that's my favorite and brains the membranes that there's like yeah mmm theory like lines of universes then we collide with each other again yeah fuck that's what I think goes sorry by the way which was like in interest it was it interstellar yeah with Matthew Modine is that the star or the Russian training with the log yeah I'm just Aris yes no he wasn't Russian no no no no who's the shoot oh yeah he was like Ultra guitar boy yeah some but there was like a guide training that or what game was the opponent training well Matthew Modine was training crazy but he was trying to drop weight to go down to fight this to wrestle this guy that everybody was too yeah that's right it would but was shoot the one that was walking the Loch yeah it's carrying a log up bust up stadium stairs that's right that was so sand he was like super hard cause like you think gonna make the weight I hope so he was I hope so too and just kept walking with the log that's so good see if you can find that seat that's so good I mean it's a great movie man it's it's a great thing because like that interaction right there is so genius because it's like tells you everything you need to know about both of those characters yeah yeah exactly so they go there area is there's a dude is badass beast wrestler of course he's by himself and if I can cool headband well his friend was a fake Indian and lied about being a Native American so he could get into college no she first started made him look cool like here we go do I know you oh I don't swing Thomson hi can you play this over the air no no don't we're getting we get pulled yeah taking to make the wait I hope so it's like all up so - just walking around to the log boom when everyone's scared oh wow it's pretty big yeah great for 80s dad again well he looked like a real wrestler yeah you look real like guys like Mark Schultz when he's competing in the Olympics he was fucking jacked man yeah there was some jack wrestlers back then still this obviously yeah it's one of the more physically intensive things you can do had that protection that muscle protects you yeah it's also I mean just wrestling all the time you're getting it sort strong oh yeah that true that - you get a certain kind of strength to get that weird grip strength oh man and tell me that shit was like it's like immediate like violent amounts of strength like for grips and stuff like because I just remember my friend he was a wrestler any and I was like yeah I don't know wrestling it seems pretty hard it would ever see here let me show you a move and I was standing I was looking at him and I just blinked and I was just out of breath just on the ground on my back just like they're experts at throwing bodies around just like oh it's like strength grip and being able to torque shit and yes it happen I mean it's insane well think about things you do to get fit right like with sandbags and stuff people do a lot of like extreme things right they flip tires throw sandbags yep they take heavy bags too they throw them over their shoulders oh yeah when you're wrestling you're doing all that plus and plus it's resisting plus another thing is trying to get you right yeah it's super active it's like it's like active strength is gonna be a deeper form of strength yes yes a range of motion strength yeah that's why the worst kind of strength is like Nautilus machine strength yeah yeah weight assistant is not the worst kind of strange didn't say that those things all have their purpose they're really good for like specific types works at workouts and specific types of exercises where you're just trying to fatigue the muscles like a lot of like a lot of strength and conditioning athletes like to use those to bang out reps because it's they feel like there's less factors going on in terms of whether or not you could drop the weight when you're losing you have nations it's safer osted it's safer but it's most people don't think it's ideal for just right for sport specific name for just overall strength because you're you're not getting balanced with it like if you if you go to heavy weights like free weights most people think that free weights are superior to a machine because you got to balance that thing push it and you develop you develop stability you're actually holding the weight instead of just pushing against for like using your force against something that's lined up on tracks yeah you're controlling it you have to control it the whole way yeah so that's what wrestling is but it's fighting back it's even harder eighty pound dude who's also fighting back and fuck you trying to pick them up and move them around and he's also trying to get you at the same time yes anagh strict as all strategic yes you're like on a strategic instinctual level you know then you hope your training and your reflexes and your tuition it's really interesting to watch like really skillful technical wrestlers because they go from one technique to another and they just chain wrestle like watching like a lot of those particularly rush there's a lot of Russian a lot of Soviet bloc athletes from you know years back even we're like really really technical with their wrestling really beautiful to watch them chain these techniques together yeah do these different moves to try to achieve dominance it's a crazy sport yeah I whenever I watched it it's like you feel like it's like when I watch dance I'm like I'm kind of moving with it you know I mean it happens with all sports I suppose but wrestling it's just like like like the energy when I'm watching it which has been very rare but in high school used to see wrestling matches and my friend was a wrestler and just be like yeah yeah it's cool cuz it's like it slows down it's fast it's slow it's fast they're exhausted you take a break they go in and then then like nothing for a while like really just like slow moves and then suddenly someone just does like this really weird walk and it just flips and it's like I love that energy man it's a different thing than any other sport yeah it's different than any other sport that's in the Olympics to like the Olympics yeah boxing and wrestling and then you have sports judo yeah judo and even talk one no they have talked window Olympics to now but the thing is that it's a different kind of sport man it's the sport where people get fucked up those are different yeah just they're just different it's a different feeling when you're watching it it's a different consequence when you fail yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean it's as close as you can get it's the closest thing to fighting oh yeah I mean cuz fighting is mostly grappling it's a lot of it a lot not everything yeah but like at least what 2/3 maybe well okay so real fight it's really like a street fighter I guess I make street fights go down pretty quick sometimes they do but sometimes they just get people get knocked out sometimes people could just get flat line because they don't know how to strike and someone does and I'd punch them in the face that happens a lot there's a lot of videos I think I see those yeah I mean it definitely does happen that a lot of fights go to the ground and I think jiu-jitsu great thing to learn and wrestling is a great thing to learn because of that like the ability to manipulate it's body is really important but you also should understand what someone's doing if they're trying to punch you some people just don't have any idea what's happening yeah just get their fucking Bell crack because they don't see a guy pulling his hand back they don't see the shift in weight right let's see someone about to punch them they don't see where the punch is gonna come from with direction that they have to avoid they don't see those things because they've never experienced it because they they don't have a training they don't have any training and striking that's just as that's fucking dangerous man that's with because if you lose to a wrestler or you lose to a jiu-jitsu guy a lot of times you rest on my beat you up on the ground you might ground and pound you but yeah jiu-jitsu guys probably just gonna choke you but kickboxers gonna slam his fucking chin in your face you know one time you do not want that oh it's the worst way to lose the worst way to lose is to a striker weekend no this is a fastest-ever knockout neo see history this guy Jorge Masvidal knocked out this two-time Olympic wrestler Ben Askren he was a beast of a wrestler and it knocked him out five seconds cuz Askren went to shoot to try to get ahold of his legs and miles Bedell ran out I'm with a flying knee and hit him right in the face while he's trying to bend forward that's legal yeah oh fuck yeah it's legal that's it right there oh oh fuck it's all over the internet you want to see it so yeah takes five seconds it was one of those things where we watched it we went holy shit like as it happened okay is that us talking about it but don't mind uh you just turned away from I wasn't the one below it that wasn't it wasn't it no it wasn't it oh it's other people talking about the reaction I see it's definitely on Instagram but apparently it's getting pulled left and right yeah of course they're gonna try to do that which it's just it's just like that's for everybody let everybody have this like no we need that we need to own that commodity but that's it's it's good for everybody it's not how the internet works either you don't win here hands here we go so this is the beginning in the fight ready this is round one yep how cold five-second call by the raft though yeah it wasn't even really five seconds he was out cold at three seconds they summoned a time from here boom I'll cold three seconds and as the referees running over to him yeah I'm why is he yelling at him they hated each other really and they hate each other Jorge Masvidal said that guy was taunting him for like ten years talking shit to him so he couldn't wait to do that to him yeah now what well been dust himself off he took it like a man I mean he really did he went on a talk show and talked about it afterwards and good you know that's that's how if I can do shit yeah yeah I said look it sucks I don't like losing that guy's a douche Yeah right but they're probably gonna end up being somewhat friend friendly later down the line no yeah no Moz we'd all said that if you saw him at Whole Foods it's not over he still smack you in the face even Whole Foods couldn't hold him but Whole Foods can't hold back the kombucha the real gt's kombucha the kind of you need a credit are you getting to show you've ID'd again like now Whole Foods man that's like that's like hello gran you can't start a fight no he's willing to break the rules I saw a fight at Disneyland on Instagram the other day the Jews were going at Disneyland some got punched a check to see Finland two people were filming that these people were throwing down in front of their kids at Disneyland Oh terrible technique - everybody's terrible terrible I love that the equally disappointing aspect of it well it's terrible to me it's the most disappointing it's like guys if you're gonna fight learn some technique yeah I mean it's like someone's stealing the stage and playing bad guitar you'd be angry with yes sir of course you I'm saying yeah I get it no I'm in complete agreement I think that that is kind of equally important because hey man if people are filming yeah people's like a consensual fight you look like you're trying to pretend you know how to fight yeah and that the worst is the pulling off of the shirt I don't even know how that even becomes like an instinct it's actually a good move well it's to keep you slippery right so you can like well you want yeah you don't want anybody choking you to death with your own jacket oh that's true yeah that's true well okay but I mean I guess in the videos that I've seen it's been mostly about like hey check out a jacket I am bro yeah yeah and here did it I kind of like this dude got choked out but I couldn't quite tell what was going on here cuz he went down quick cuz that security and he wasn't been out for a second so he's pulling that girl's hair see oh yeah he's out cold cold oh gee dropped him his head banged off the ground to that ball dude choked the shit out he's like well I just killed a guy I better get out of here I think but you know what no charges were pressed because no one wanted to say what the fight was about hilarya was that so it was a guy that was holding a girl's hair at the end yeah I said he got spit on and then he went crazy wow I don't know if that was the whole thing and then funny that's all it takes a little bit of water a little bit of yeah it's funny it's like at all the things that make people go crazy spit in someone's face is like wow go to war here yeah I mean it's it is pretty good not a crude biological weapon back in the day if you had some like smallpox yeah yeah how dare you potentially infect me do you ever heard Damon Wayans joke about a when Magic Johnson came back to the NBA Magic Johnson after he had HIV and then came back to the NBA he said Damon Wayans who's my opinion one of the most underrated comedians of all time still one of my own fantastic all-time favorite but in one of his HBO specials deals he goes everybody was avoided magic nobody want to play defense he goes except Dennis Rodman he goes Dennis Robin was like listen I spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptoms I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate your sim to this day that's one of my all-time favorite lines I hear that line of my god damn that's a great that is a crafted brilliant thing to think that's underneath it hurts that one hurts I'll spit in your mouth and he sour your symptoms he says I'm sorry I fucked Madonna that's what he said I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate you say oh yeah it's even more potent that's like some shit talking like that's the type of shit that wins that wins the whole thing yeah you got to walk away yeah keep talking after that like you know that's it man and take it lost like a man yeah yeah yeah maybe that's why spitting and it's also it's gross it's just great it's just gross and so rude it's so fucking rude I mean when someone purposefully spits at you yeah you're like I want to destroy you I could kind of understand that reaction shit think people were get like licking food that's grocery stores and like some girl's gonna get arrested or she's facing like 20 here or something I don't underst I I don't want to know why yeah it was funny to lick food then you know other people gonna buy it yeah well people think it's funny to spit in people's food when they're they're serving it - yeah it's weird people kind of grow sometimes yeah you know they'll get it any way they can man yeah get back they'll get back at the world yeah do you take this shit position in life it's like no I don't I don't agree here's your salad sorry yeah I know mix it up so you gotta be nice to son you gotta be nice to everybody we like swapping spit with people and that weird that is really worried well because that's consensual right yeah well not just it's consensual it's like it's pleasurable it's like even if it's consensual you don't wanna be spitting in your mouth no cuz that's super fucking gross yeah by kissing someone's open your mouth and they like to like that would be weird like you just spit my food this is gross goddamn it but if someone's kissing you and their tongues in your mouth you're swapping literally swapping spit it's sexy it's hot we like it yeah yeah I'm glad I'm glad that I like that part yeah cuz the other part I'm just like yo man you can't what's wrong with you why are you doing this mouth you don't need to do that it's like the delivery method is what we have a real problem with yeah exactly this part from the program is to fucking football players do it this is for giant Lou oh that's a movie yeah so they really did do it for the song pretty short they had to they spit each other's mouths why guess when you're playing football you just want to be as savage as possible and you don't give a fuck you make out with a dude you'll fuck a couple of guys and then you're gonna play football yeah cousin you feel like you don't care here the entire force of the universe minds yeah people do things to let people know they don't give a fuck yeah that's fair that is fair do things like that like the EV you seen euphoria with HBO show no it's didn't elastic yeah it's I think it's out now you know what it is Jamie I've heard of it heard it's good it has not watched it yeah it listed about ridiculous it's basically about it centers around a drug addicted high schooler played by zendaya and it's just about the modern kind of modern generation high school experience through her drug addiction or trying to overcome drug addiction or kind of realizing what is going on with her at that stage in her life and there's just it's just the culture of all the things that kids deal with these days but it's done in a really really hyper beautiful stylized way it's so crazy intelligent it's amazing it really blew me away I was not a went to the opening and was like uh-huh I don't know I don't know what this is and then the guy got up and talked about it because the writer experienced addiction has been clean for 15 years some of them but that was his life back then as a teenager and so they adapted it and it's great but the reason why I bring that up is what were we talking about a second ago what we're talking about before that spit in each other's mouths yeah we went from that to people want to pretend they don't give a fuck or the one to let you know they don't give a fuck oh yeah that's exactly right yet so there's like a great scene in the first and the pilot it doesn't really give away anything but one of the characters she's in a kitchen and there's like a big bully dude popular guy that's like getting getting in her face and being really threatening and then she takes a knife and she just slices her arm and she and fixes she's like stay away from me motherfucker there's something like that there's something more eloquent that says well that happens and then she introduces herself and leaves she goes oh by the way I'm huh and she walks out but it's such an intense scene it goes from the darkest to the darkest to like a practical this this person is really smart the who cut her arm is incredibly smart that's a crazy thing to do to someone yeah yourself that comes up in front of them it just shows you that's like I I don't give a fuck like that's like the thing I'll do to you yeah exactly you know and the guy was everyone was just frozen they were like I don't know what the fuck there's a bunch of high school kids in the kitchen pretty cool pretty cool like character detail it just kind of like shows you everything about that character in a split second yeah Jesus amazing I love that shit that's intense yeah I love when you don't know something's good you don't know anything about it and then it turns out to be yeah it's the best feeling Oh Christmas are one of my favorite parts ago in the movies I love ya previews but yet they ruin movie exactly I know I'm the same way I'm the same way it's like peeking into a Christmas present like when you're a little kid you like I just unwrapped this bitch yeah you rabbit that's a fucking TIE fighter oh my god it's Darth Vader's ya little fucking sneak another Jack's like yeah oh my god apparently let me look at that yeah fuck I have been caught but that's almost like what previews are you good to see a little bit about what the movies about oh yeah wouldn't it be better if you had no fucking idea have you just snapped I don't want to even know a synopsis and well I don't know what King Kong is which if you didn't know what King Khan was like the newer King Kong yeah you thought it was like about like a king yeah yeah you have no idea and you sit down you have no idea how the story's gonna come come out and the moment you see the gorilla you're part of like holy shit ya know when he's fighting dinosaurs and stuff you like holy shit yeah it was so much better then you watch all those proves are the special trucks or Ranger on the new Godzilla no but you go to see it it's like yeah I've already seen it I know he's gonna breathe fire out of his mouth I know what it looks like you've shown me yeah it's you know my favorite trailers are the ones that just kind of give you a feeling of the world and that's it like the new Joker trailer is sick yes it's perfect example it's great it's a piece of art unto itself but it's not giving away a lot I mean there's a lot time you see a lot of shit and you kind of get an idea but not really it's a it's a very artful trailer yeah but you gotta have something yeah well people are gonna go to you I know that's the problem but remember Cloverfield yeah when that came out and make that weird the ATS their show just feel like and that's all you heard yeah Cloverfield you're like what the fuck is this those are weird movies right like those movies like this movie sucks because it was just filmed by people who were there well yeah quality's terrible the camera is gonna be shaky yeah we're gonna scream and drop the camera it's gonna bounce and you gonna see like I knew back then if I mean Blair Witch you know it was kind of the starter of that brought Blair which freaked me out the first time I went to see it I want to see with Chris McGuire comedian Chris McCoy yeah and a couple folks that worked at the movie theater across the street and they came to see us we were performing at the Houston laughs stop okay and so they they we were talking to them before the show and they're like hey we work at the movie theatre and I was like oh we're gonna probably go there this weekend and see that Blair Witch movie and the dude was like hey I have the keys if you want we can open it up tonight after the show what I was like fuck yeah so it was right across the street so me and Maguire and I think there's like three of them that worked there we all hung out and watch the Blair Witch together in a fucking empty movie theater they made popcorn and every flads dudes dough though they had the key to the place I mean if their boss found out there would be fucks Ville yeah so don't share this y'all not telling anybody but this is like 17 18 years ago it's a very I mean when that movie come out last time ago 1989 yeah 99 so yeah 20 fucking years ago and we were at the Houston laughs stop this is awesome so cool what a great like flow of an event yeah yeah you have a dope-ass kagan's and you're like oh yeah check this out yeah it was fun but that movie was scare the shit out of ya yeah it took me a while to get into because I remember Dogma you remember that that Christmas so they remember the celebration that had come out that was the first movie that I saw that was made all on you know because they had those rules like they we only use natural light we only use db/km blah blah blah and it was great it was interesting and weird and oh my god that's kinda crazy and then Blaire which came out and had that kind of vibe but a little bit more curated like Marin narrative but I was like I thought it was eerie but I really didn't get scared until the very very end yeah when when it's going down the stairs and then the flashlight is searching around and then sees that girl facing the corner yeah that fucked me up yes that that's really that one moment so the whole thing I was like that's pretty you know it's cool it's creepy okay if I hadn't been it's just that thing I was like fuck you it was a strong closer here's this real strong closer I mean that's the way you go out yeah that's the way you go out but isn't it interesting that we like movies that are on film right we like that look yeah we did we like the things that are in the forefront focus but everything in the back is just like yeah Clary and fuzzy that's true it's got this like quality thing to it even though now we see videos that are very literal from phones all the time we see that kind of imagery we still don't necessarily see you wouldn't see that in a movie theater necessarily you to to distracted by all the outside images so if you're talking differently you and I are talking I'm focusing on you I know there's some stuff over to the left and stuff over the right but I'm not seeing it the same way I'm seeing you yes right that's one of the reasons why like when you interpret video like you visually interpret video it's a very weird distortion even though it's the most accurate representation because you can't look at everything at the same time so if you look at a photograph and everything is in focus what kind of what are you using what are you using to see things with exist my eyes don't work like that yeah I'm actually looking at you and everything around you like I know there's a clock right here but I'm dude I can't even read what time it is it's right there I can't get it but yeah I can read it right yeah okay you know this stuff that's just a few inches to your left or right and I literally can't see them yes just a tiny tiny point that you're actually focusing on yeah just focus on right in front of these things yeah from the face so let's make that make sense like for focus it kind of replicates the way that and it's also a storytelling mechanism right focus on this part you know yes it definitely is that yeah but it also it's like it looks cooler it just looks yeah it looks at the hope it looks Pro you know it's it's high-res yeah maybe like a video camera like a regular standard consumer grade video camera almost takes clearer pictures oh for sure yeah it's it's like if you ever put your phone in time-lapse mode yes it looks like the way it tracks when you're moving it over objects it's got a higher frame rate or something like that but it makes it look like that pan and scan shit you know when you're watching sports or whatever and it just looks wrong you know like it's too literal there's something to the way everything moves just feels slightly off do you think that we're just accustomed to the way film looks and then if we were accustomed to the way video looks then a film would be look clunky to us well you have everything started off as video and then they said you know what it's not really good to have everything in focus uh-huh it's only good to have some things and focus in the back way some things are blurry and then they come into focus and actually enhances the filmmaking yes right yes like in a horror movie yes but something's blurry and then they zoom in on it and you see it's like a fucking monster hiding under the bed oh yeah no that's not what I didn't want that to happen you've now just revealed exactly what I didn't want to see yeah yeah no I agree yeah I don't know I mean I don't know but I know that do you know people like film I think it just looks it's the texture of it but now people like DV well it's like people like vinyl right there's people that are just diehard vinyl fans they like to sound yeah I mean you know I like I like I like anything you know but I'd like to I'd like to make sure that it's the best quality of it or the most natural use case for it you know you know it's like when people used to mix when people started listening more to music in their car that they could like put a thing that they bought in their car with an eight-track or whatever where they used to have record players for cars too but you know the way that music sounded they were kind of they also had to consider the mix of car speakers what does it sound like on car speakers so going back to the aura tones and the NS tends and then the standardized car speakers that people test audio and then ride and it's a different parameter right because you're stuck in this little contained metal box yeah yeah so you got to figure out how to mix the music but generally it's the sound system that has to be adjusted mmm the sound systems have to but you mix to say they kind of meet each other in the middle but great hi-fi systems might actually it's a quick anecdote but when I was in Seattle I knew that I liked hi-fi systems but I didn't know why they were so expensive and so I went into this place this guy named Leland who was working there was kind of friends with him because I'd come in and I just scoped gear all the time just looking like I loved audio gear it's just really sweet and and then one day it was towards the end when they were closing and he turns to me and says hey man do you want to get your brain fried and I was like what do you mean and he's like stick around okay and he closed shop couple of his friends came in close the shop it's like maybe five of us went into the back room smoked some marijuana went into the show room the main room where they have all the speakers and all the different types of units and he says then he kind of turns to us we all sat down and couch and he says okay you're gonna listen to a this is a system in total it costs about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars whoa and and then he just goes proceed Singh goes through and explains all of the stages that you know that the current is going through and what the music is going through what's being played on all the cables that are being used all this stuff and then I heard all of that crazy speakers like okay cool he lowers the lights and he puts on a Bill Evans trio record I can't remember which one and he just presses play and we sit down and like within probably thirty Seconds people were crying Wow and because it felt holographic it felt like you were in the room with those musicians that were playing right there for you and then I had the realization it's not the money it's not about the money it's about what does it take to engineer a machine that becomes invisible to the experience and that was that kind of blew my mind so whenever you're designing anything it's like designing experience engineering should yeah should should get the fuck out of the way what was the medium was it vinyl vinyl yeah yeah what do you think like in your description what is different about vinyl well I mean supposedly if you have a really nice quality piece of violence cut really well you get as close to the original mastered recording experience like coming out of the studio if you're talking about older tape so whatever that final mix is when someone plays it they're like it's been mastered here's the stereo two-track we're playing the stereo two-track it's been mastered that excuse me I'm a little wheezy and and that's what you hear you hear it in the best possible context on the speakers that it was mixed on it's everything's optimal so essentially when a record is pressed if it can mimic that the stereo to track the master which it does then you have something that for at least the first I don't know vinyl people will say how many times but a record starts to wear down but if you have a fresh press you can run it a bunch of times before it starts to degrade but in that state you're hearing it like analogue super analog it's like how many times you think you play it before it starts degrade I don't know I guess it depends on the ears of the audiophile but there's probably an average I don't know what it would be maybe 60 or 30 Oh 50 times now is there a digital format that at least comes close oh yeah yeah FLAC files what is a it's a file format black files are good usually 128 96 kilohertz like that's there's like kind of mastering the digital mastering standard and that standard is is basically what that is what a record is so that's why you have like sites like HD tracks that I really dig you can get all your favorite out well not all it's not as big of a selection but you can get full resolution from like stereo two-track master from the studio level quality in a digital format that you can buy and then put into a high-risk player so I have a high-res player a hi-fi player and it runs the it has really nice circuitry and all that stuff and then use a really great pair of headphones and you've got the closest thing to a record that's repeatable infinite times and is the headphones the way to go or one of those crazy Tower speaker jammies the way to go huh well it depends on your use case like if you if you nephew here in a house and you want like a cool living room system or whatever I would always opt for speakers and not not Sonos and not that kind of stuff people they dig it but true I mean records are meant to be played off of two speakers with it's a 2.1 so unless it's specifically engineered which is very rare for like Atmos or whatever the fuck but usually it's two speakers in a subwoofer so why would I not want to hear the music the way it's supposed to send Brian however I understand the convenience of those speakers so I'm not totally knocking it but for me if you're gonna get a system for your living room if I can get a 2.1 system yeah you want it played out the way you want the sound to come out either way it was recorded yeah otherwise it changes the experience yeah completely the the Sonos and those types of things they they fake stereo Henry Rollins was on the podcast and he has this most preposterous setup in his house he is a gigantic audiophile oh shit a massive lover of music oh my god he collects all these albums and he even runs a radio show I love his radio show yes though it's on case here double yeah so these Natick these are the crazy fucking speakers he has in his house what the fuck and there's some where are those thousand dollars is what they are I forget I have seen those I've seen pictures of that that's um it makes this Alexandria XLF is what they're called okay Wilson Alexandria job they look I mean it's disgusting look at those things you have to have their weapons you know like you you have to pull back so we can see big-ass four full-size those things look what a weird-looking piece of equipment looks my future robot looks like an ATM machine right yeah totally or like a display screen robot yeah today we have here swipe here for you thank you for your business cuz I've so is the one that we're looking at on the right hand side is that the back yeah Wow look at all that sugar it shows the inputs know what the fuck they have discrete inputs for each of the frequency spectrum the different speakers oh damn some people go deep it's like everything right look at it that's what it looks like oh that's another one look at that guy craziest thing I mean it's beautiful I mean audio is $100,000 fuckin speakers we that guy he's like I have it all my spirit look at the fringe on my curtains I am Heinrich Ottomans that's crazy man yeah well there you go any sound system at cars amazing to man because right you know if you get like a Marc Levenson like Ivo yeah as a Marc Levenson system in it yeah that's just like the whole thing's engineered for the shape of the inside of the car yes so it just rings out in all these perfect places it's it's tight one of my favorite places listen to music is a car and I was stoked to get my Audi cuz I got the B&O system in there and I've never heard better audio I mean I've heard some dope-ass I think I have a I think the Tesla uses leavens and stuff I'm not totally sure people haven't been able to figure out but they should have by now but I remember like five years ago trying to figure out like who what is the premium audio system like what is it besides a premium audience and I couldn't get an answer if someone figured out what the amp was but they couldn't figure out the speaker so that's interesting but but the Audi man Bang and Olufsen and I have some 18s at home there's a 2.1 system and it just finally started it kicked in and now it sounds amazing I was like really kind of disappointed for a while yeah it's weird there's also yeah there's like a burn in what I think there's a burnin I'm not sure maybe it's totally maybe maybe I did get better I mean what do you think of this we'd buy them fantastic it's pretty really good yeah it's just it's not weighing you down no it's just a nice friendly like you're you fucking high but like yeah feel good sweet stuff it's not like you're not freaking out I like it a lot what's it called again purple what purple tones no uh purple rain venom venom thank you jeez yes does he know what a bond I know the great brain that's awesome purple venom butum Wow yeah you have the the Browns yeah and then there's like a subwoofer that looks like an egg yeah and they're great because it's my house kind of mid cinch mod heads that mean mid-century mother oh that's me tries I think it's a lair is the first time I think I've said it sounded just like mid-sentence are provided for I'm Eunice the pity that the the overall layout is mid cinch mod the only people I don't trust is when I go over their house and they have a minimalist setup like where they have like plastic chairs that don't if they have any cushion and a flat table with nothing on it and everything's small and there's nothing there I'm like what are you doing yeah I know they're you show me your clean brain yeah the fucking psycho where's the soft surfaces where's the place to chill I you know I I like what I dig is that mid-century sure yeah you know like I was it been julno Jules figure it is it's a I think he's a Swedish or Danish architect or a furniture designer finn juhl that's a thing and he makes these like you've seen these chairs before but the originals are just it's such a great work of art it's like sturdy comfy but light enough that there's like a bar in the back that's just made to grab and you can just throw it around but when it but it's set up in a room it looks substantial and it looks comfortable but super lightweight so their idea was like to be super modular really easy to move for company you know this already that's not quite it typed in furniture oh yeah that's entry mantra first yeah Oh what was his name a finn juhl spelled fi and then yeah tool maybe J Georgie you HL yeah like that orange one right there yeah that's like one one does one design but that one has that that extra thing and that's not how mine are minor just like it's just a back and no arms and the but the same shape and you sit in them and they're just great they're like firm but comfortable like you feel active like you could get out of it if you need it to that were there no what does it say at the top that's this shit fin fi yeah yeah and Trey Uhl maybe try classic or something that but look at stuff though yeah it's down if they look at the grasshopper chair yeah so weird when you have a chair that's that low to the ground that that's too low mine are not like that mine are like thing is you can keep your feet in front of you yeah like the stretch your legs out like that 109 chair like that that kind of stuff so it's like normal chair height but it's beautifully designed but its minimal and for my living room like I like the idea that I could just like move my furniture and if people want to dance or whatever you just do that and you don't have to be the fuck you know I'm gonna need help like one person clearly grab both chairs and right and you don't have some bullshit sitting there that could break yeah yeah careful yeah totally hey guys don't go near the end table guys I'm really sorry about that hey hey hey rock and roll music Scott everybody crazy Jesus Eric fancy speakers I told you to beat the chill-out mixes only yeah you need to chill out mix mmm-hmm for late night like really groovy jobim stiff you know I was like a brilliant bossa nova mmm do you what do you what are your thoughts on like streaming services like music like title and stuff like that well things like Spotify and Pandora are these free Apple music these streaming services I think they're convenient but I don't quite trust the quality yet and I have a lot of vested in iTunes but I started using title only because it's the less that's that seems to be the least popular of all the streaming services but it's jay-z's mm-hmm company and not that I'm like it and i jz fan i just like that it's owned by an artist right and that they focus on super high-end codecs for their streaming so it's like the highest quality possible-- for streaming since then Spotify claims to have it I don't think Apple does it yet anyways but I like I like the title set so I mean I guess the idea being as long as it's fair for the the artist you know the deal for streaming and how streaming's streaming is calculated and how that turns into revenue for our on the revenue side of things that's really that's the biggest concerns revenue side of things it seems like that's where this whole thing was like the wild wild west when they got started and the the way the parameters were established it's not in favor of the artist it's in favor of the people that run the streaming companies they're the ones who make the substantial profits yes absolutely yeah the companies do all they have is the work of artists I know just why it's so crazy that they make most of money because they provide a platform yeah all they have is the you don't sell shit without artists if every artist is like nah fuck you yeah you don't have anything yeah you have no no you don't sell anything yep like you're to selling tomatoes and you don't even grow them yeah you want most of the money like if you were a tomato store and you got your tomatoes from a farmer in the farmer to do all this fucking work to make the tomatoes and they sold them at your store but you got almost all the money yeah though I know it's totally crazy doesn't make any sense you couldn't grow tomatoes with any other farmer for the next ten years after oh yeah that's a yeah because they tie you up yeah you have to make commercials about these tomatoes but you have to pay for them now you know it all comes out of your profit not ours yeah crazy it's all about it's all about direct economy you know I mean like that's that's the way that's where we are now I think yeah I think that's where we're where we are where we're headed I think that's definitely I don't you know I I can barely that's why I want to kind of do my own streaming stuff like that I don't want to be in tied up and to with another company that utilizes behavioral statistical data to increase their algorithms for targeted advertising like that's not really interesting to me yeah I think with a guy like YouTube just build it and they will come you know and then advertisers who resonate with your sort of mindset they'll find you there's money there's plenty of cool CBD brands and yeah fill in the blank of cool companies that'd be more than happy to advertise on something that you know what have a guaranteed audience of a certain kind of people yes don't totally totally I think it's great and I think also just having a direct store - yeah I love the idea whatever I make that's it's just sold yes Doron like you're just paying me and I'm getting it and you're getting the thing and that's it yeah I mean you've worked for a bunch of different companies before you've done things it's like it can be great you can work with a bunch of cheerful people or absolutely a disaster you got some time suck in the middle of the fucking mix and they they just the demand too much attention there's too much conflict and nonsense and yeah interpersonal drama and sometimes people start fucking oh yeah people that work together start fucking and then you have to hear the opinions of both of them while you pretend you don't know that they're fucking that this is weighing heavily on the way they're communicating with everybody else like oh yeah that's supporting each other and you're supposed to support them too now their relationship has become center stage in your office that's like one of the reasons why people don't want office romances not even just because women don't want to be harassed by men that are trying to fuck them all the time so we'll just say no one can do it but also because once it a relationship does happen one of two things yeah either it'll everyone's roped yeah either it'll go great and everyone's gonna be a part of it so your relationship becomes a part of the whole ecosystem of the office mm-hmm or it'll go terrible and people have to pick sides and or one of you has to leave yeah like so or that dude you you if you amongst the most miraculous people you have a amicable split and you become really good friends afterwards you still work together with no problems even like each other spouses yeah it is possible it's possible it's happened I'm sure it's happened yes for much much more rare I was running a company I'd be like listen you guys can't bang each other yes I know it sounds gross I know you're here all day buts problem is like what if you met the girl of your dreams on a job that was your dream job you're like sure what do you do you have to make this like a fucking Jennifer Lopez movie right yeah totally like like - yeah I'll - successful I don't give a fuck about this job Jennifer I want to be with you don't play the music it's like no you don't have to quit I'll quit you know fuck this I but I've got a quick no you can't and then they decide to start their own firm yeah if it was a real chick movie the girl would have like the smaller paycheck too and the guy would lose the bigger paycheck and he would he would come she would come home from work and he would be wearing fucking like like an apron and he would be mopping yes that'd be great well I guess I guess I should get used to it like that's my life now and like the perfect job I gave up my perfect job for the perfect woman yeah yeah yeah that would suck if you had the dream job but you met a girl there who she was single and she was into you and you're both into each other you like goddamnit what do you do you start banging and don't tell anyway that's what you do right prom probably or if you're like super Pro and super committed you just figure out a way not to and just kind of maybe come up with an agreement or something I don't know plot your exit yes you don't plot your eggs always know your exits while you're lying about banging each other yes yeah you got a lie gonna lie and say yeah yeah we're going to movies tonight my friend Melissa anyway Todd's house for some dick that sucks such a terrible way to live guys don't do it yeah worth it well the most terrible is probably live in the closet that's probably the most terrible yes the most it's a super unnecessary one I think yeah well no in some case it's not at all yeah well it's also like it's symbolic of you know we all have things in the innit closet I mean that's like it's like a pretty big level that's noticeable by many many people but in a way it is a metaphor for like there are a lot of things that we don't allow ourselves to sure like let people know about and especially in the corporate world right you're you're forced to present a air quotes professional image and this enhances your ability to earn living it enhances your ability to be successful inside that corporate structure so you you literally have to play a role all the time which is why if you talk to women who are dominatrix is one of the things that they say is the the guys who really like to get kicked in the balls and shit on are the guys who run businesses the guys are like yeah they need to feel it yes they feel alive they're kicking the balls they need someone pissing in their mouth they need salt they need to get smacked they want to get crazy because they're so buttoned down all day long they can barely take it they're so lucky Reggie you're so lucky and an artist so like son of a bitch I love it songs in a cubicle right now mad at you fuck him no man you guys can live your dreams I mean yeah I mean it's it's rats and people about credit card loans yeah I know well you know we could be more of us could be more creative but we're not really designing there's a society to support that yeah we you and I can't fix the streets no but we can inspire people to fix the streets it yeah of course I mean you know sometimes it just takes a little kick in the and the yarbles I got a conversation with my friend the other day we were saying he was saying you know he kind of really need all kinds of people because there's all kinds of jobs that you don't want to do and I was like yeah we're having a problem with our exterminator and I'm like but like could you imagine a dude who's really cool who's into killing rats like that's we just for living it just fucks rats up that's this whole deal again rats I know I know there are people that just sort certain types of screws yeah assembly line all day long so what they do somebody needs to do that otherwise it's not gonna get done well you know I mean theoretically you know robotics and when people fear like robotics getting over jobs and things like things like that theoretically the positive side of that is if society's organize themselves in a way that ensures that people remain productive aside from these automations because it's taking away the menial tasks the repetitive tasks bullshit and then we were able to allocate more brainpower to the economy if that's the way it's viewed it's it's rad I think it's a welcome thing and I think yeah there's fear you know the unknown and things like that but if the government helps or you know there's a transition that's at least considered it could be really really beneficial well how do you feel about things like universal basic income how do you feel like that I mean that's because that's what people are gonna need if we get to a point where millions of jobs vanish overnight because of automation which could happen you're looking at a I mean I don't know what I'm talking about but if I did I would say you'd look at a nationwide version of what happened in Detroit when the auto industry backed out well yeah I mean I don't know I mean I I don't know like the universal I mean I it kind of makes sense but I also don't know about the successful models and the non successful implementations because obviously with societies it becomes a lot more complicated because it's people and people are complicated and so when you say there's universal income for there's a base amount that everybody will have you don't have to worry about certain things right well transitioning out of the current state the mine state that we're in some people just gonna try to blow it you know all and then and they'll go into debt and then you know maybe or maybe you design the system to be really foolproof and it's just a commodities based so people can only get the value that they're guaranteed as you know rent being paid actual food you know actual things so they don't have access to the money I don't know if you don't give them access to the money they don't give them adequate choices in terms of where they can get their food like I'm not in favor that because if you have like a government place where they had groceries you can go get your groceries for free a place is gonna be disgusting so well because there's no competition you know I'm saying yeah well maybe no incentive for excellence well maybe if it was like a you know some kind of a card or something associated like an Apple pay type thing so you just you go to whatever story you want to similar to like a welfare card or yeah like food stamps yeah exactly but a little bit more frames differently right like you'd have an account with the government where every month you get like $1,000 cash and $500 in food yeah maybe something like that yeah yeah and then their rewards for like you know moving out of that like phasing out of that right I think the way andrew yang has a structured you would get everyone would get it you could opt out of it like say if you were doing interests like yourself like you could opt out of it oh that's cool yeah I do like the everything thing because as soon as you make something specifically for a certain population especially you're talking about that anything it's not it doesn't it doesn't work I mean conceptually it's just better when everyone knows like oh you have it I have it something that binds all of us that you brought all in common obviously this billionaire doesn't need it but there's just a precedent for people that make a certain amount of money they're suggested to like you know offset that like put it back into the system so there's more money right people that need it whatever but I think like saying it's for everybody is kind of a smart thing to do I like that everything yeah everybody is that you have equity in the corporation that is the United States of America oh that's interesting yeah that's weird particularly if you're thinking about natural resources like a man you know when you imagine the enormous profits that someone gets from natural resources like the idea that you own the oil that's under the ground like is who's decided that like why have we decided that you can go a mile off the ocean stick a fucking tube into the ground suck out all the oil and make a trillion dollars or who said who said you could do that that's not even your ground yeah so what the government is giving a license to BP in BP drills holes a mile offshore and then they suck all the oil out and they make billions into who's getting that money and how much does the government get and how much is a BP paying for that contract and why doesn't that money go to the people that live in a country because if the people live in the country the country is a corporation the corporation is the one that owns this water yeah they are the ones us so the idea would be that you would we would all profit from it and they would make substantially less than they make now and then instead of these people making billions and billions of dollars for something that's not even theirs yeah like that profit would be split evenly around the country in terms of infrastructure and replenishing impoverished communities and community centers and trying to figure out a way to engineer out all the horrific neighborhoods use the natural resources yes I mean that would be wonderful like they've had to pay some people for fracking they've had to pay some people off because they just ruined their their their neighborhood like there's people that live in a place it's like fully toxic now yes what do you say this is from the original spill in 2004 it's been going on consistently oh yeah it's still leaking this is the fourteen-year-old Gulf oil spill is leaking up to 4,500 gallons day they found that it was many many times more oil was leaking out then they thought it was so that's still that's going into the ocean right now from that stupid oil pipeline yeah the the quicker that someone figures out an alternative energy that's kind of what I'm saying it's like that it needs to happen this is ridiculous it's just it's everyone's doing the easy thing right now and it's just feeding that again the the the capitalists mission machine is just like no that's okay that's acceptable well you and I have righteous virtue because we drive electric vehicles occasionally that's that's true I do feel a little bit better I feel better than people when I Drive might as well mmm you assholes yeah poisoning the world I you know I feel I only feel better driving my Tesla only in that it's just faster it's just faster than almost everything on the road yeah it's a time machine that's the at that's exactly what I call it I always say like if if there's a location that I want to go to I appear there yeah I don't know Jun yeah over there he's just like and you have that P 100 D yeah it's the one I have which is the monster one yeah and it's meanwhile that fucking new thing that they're coming out with it the Roadster I've a second faster zero to 60 yeah it's oh well 11.9 1.8 theoretically 1.8 seconds here this thinks he's changed his uh his take on that I think he recently said it's 2.1 are you serious yes okay we're very disappointed right this way because you got to break the two bearings what kind of nonsense is this I know where's my point where's my tenth of a second it ain't going to matter kids fucking thing's ridiculous I kidding it's just a fucking weapon yeah that's it's it's insane but it also has six hundred mile range yes that's what I heard which is just insane to me I just love that it's a tinier car it's like the fastest thing ever yes there's only gonna be maybe three other road-legal cars that you could buy that would get to that that level one car tonight they're gonna look obsolete compare that oh yeah I mean well the thing I'm excited about is the Pininfarina electric car all designed completely in-house and I don't know when it comes out but I don't know if you find a picture it is the nastiest piece of tech don't let the Italians make the engine though trust oh yeah I don't thinks I think they're leveraging like not let my people design things you let them design the way it looks but all the wires they're barely paying attention standard girls asses heat and spaghetti I guarantee you that's so funny that's so true you like Germans and Japanese make reliable cars yeah they make their engineers oh they're good whoo damn that is a goddamn Batmobile yeah she'd be nasty wow that's a real car oh yeah when's that coming out I think orders are there good that went five million G's yes that's nice yeah there's all this money coming active arrows how many shakes are there I mean come on get that fuck at the any borrows a little bit of like Ferrari laferrari as a lot of Japanese styling as it's the perfect blend of like all the good things about like tech looking car know what it's like it's like a Ferrari 488 yes but one that walk 1900 or Alexis LFA oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's yeah I got that hundred one hundred how many Newton pounds of torque no whenever they say that Newton meters I don't get it those European ones like what are you saying I don't feel it all I know is what is high and then I base it off of that it's funny to that we still use horses I know well stupid as I look at that see is people power less than two seconds so that's like the but it's an electric vehicle yeah I'm sure biting has one coming out that looks really cool those 180 miles an hour 186 miles an hour in 12 seconds so 12 seconds later you're going 186 miles an hour look at control cockpit that's what I like about cars like that I like better look amazing it's a fucking house and the house they know it a house in the hills I'd get it Wow that's right if I could I'd get it what yeah oh yeah easily I definitely want to get the roads I'm thinking about the Roadster I'm getting that bitch you got to man come on got to I mean it's not that I mean for 250 grand no you're getting a car that like that's that's a what is that was it again when you keep showing us Jamie you just flip into you know check out Jamie's on a route a rabbit hole he went down to YouTube let's see what was lovest was doing the other one pull the rope stir oh yeah that that thing's Bettis what is the other one Rimac concept - oh it's a serious door handle for the roadster oh yeah you slide your finger down you had tops I mean who knows it's not it's not using that steering wheel I don't know why they do that they do that for concept cars that no sideview mirrors which now is actually becoming legal which is great I have no sideview mirrors because it looks sexier but so what it looks more sleek does it really bother you that's like if you get dude and girls really hot but she has a chipped tooth oh no no no that makes that makes that makes it better that's like that's character man that's beautiful so why do you need why don't you want side mirrors I want to see it just creates a cleaner line fuck a clean line I wanna see what's going on what have you died I wanna see what's behind me man well the new Honda all-electric car that's basically kind of like a like a golf kind of an e golf but it's a fully new car it's got it's got the camera system with the side view mirrors they're just right on the edge of the dash right where the mirrors kinda would be and the guy the guy who was doing a review of it one of the few guys who's gotten to drive it said that it just blows you away you're like why have a car has been like this forever because it gives you an accurate full time view of what's going on and the rear view mirror is also a screen no impellers no pillars what what are you laughing at make fun of this car no go back to the house this was always some honda it's cute II also got the most ridiculous turning radius its turns tighter than a London cab yeah because it's got a stick in the ground yeah just it just plants the pole in the ground and it just rotates yeah yeah the roadsters is evil I don't think it's really gonna come out in 2020 I don't think so you there I think it's gonna get pushed back yeah but it's just such a gorgeous it does have some active Aero I think in the spoilers active it sounds cool looking it looks like what a car supposed to look like a 2020 exactly yes Reggie Watts let's
