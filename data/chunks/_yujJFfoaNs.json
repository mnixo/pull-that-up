the Joe Rogan experience Joey Joey Diaz come yeah but you got a teensy bit gesture I ain't gonna work in here yeah 18 t doesn't work in here yeah but call him call Joe Joey really quick I think he knows I'm on the podcast if I wants to say something he's probably high as fuck right Joe Rogan what is he gonna say predicta what he would say Eddie Bravo I told you I told you cocksucker electric chair all day something might happen I might have got pulled into a meeting Joey Diaz is all low on the fuck up he's selling out everywhere he's constantly getting brought in for meetings and fucking people want him to do movies and it's just it's incredible it's incredible yeah yeah he's uh might have went over the 405 or something I have to ask you this did the didn't come out the after party no no probably so tired right yeah no I just didn't feel it Joey oh it's ringing check this out these gonna work yeah what I'm not sure if he's gonna answer you're on the radio tell him tell me you're live on the cast he's the greatest Joey Diaz is the greatest what we need is a food emancipation proclamation we need a food emancipation proclamation to free the food system from the enslavement of bureaucratic orthodoxy so that consenting adults and I'm choosing my words very carefully here so that consenting adults could make a voluntary choice of food choice the type that they want from the source that they want and if we allowed however many in our society 5% 10% 20% whoever didn't continue every option to orthodoxy and say hmm is there something better out here can I choose something different if anybody who wanted to opt out of the of the current industrial government orthodoxy could do so voluntary consenting adults here you know we're talking about the right of private contract if I want to if I want to come to your farm voluntarily no extortion here okay voluntarily look around smell around ask around and I want what you're producing I should be able to get it the government gets between my lips and my throat I call that an invasion of privacy and yes and I do also believe that we should legalize all drugs all of them because the government that can tell you you can't smoke dope can also tell you can't drink raw milk or or or refuse to vaccinate your children or you know go down the line the fact is that the orthodoxy is so convoluted now that it's perfectly safe and fine to feed your kids coca-cola Mountain Dew Count Chocula Cheerios and Pop Tarts but not homemade charcuterie pickles raw milk and backyard butchered chickens not crazy it's absolutely crazy and if we would free up I mean I travel a lot I talked to thousands and thousands of farmers I just talked to 200 farmers up in San Jose this weekend you know and what's the limiting factor why is local food cheap why is our kind of food I mean cheap more expensive that it has to be why are we perceived as elitist why isn't it more available why is it so hard to find integrity food this is the issue and if we would free up those of us in the system that are ready to access our neighbors with quiche and noodles and charcuterie and you know name your you know name it to free us up it would it would completely invert the entire food system in a year that's what's weird about like Bill O'Reilly or the Big Bang Theory or any of those shows is they have this perfect opportunity at any moment to blow people's minds yeah I'm just making 180 degree turn just turning in some complete opposite direction they'll imagine if they let me direct an episode of Big Bang Theory with no notes yes it's gonna be a little back to be enough to write it too you could know I can like if I have creative liberties with the script yes and I can get as many guillotines as anyone god that'd be so fun that'd be so fun if like they had to do that at once a year they had to let underground artist edit and direct their shows just to see what it would turn into why there would be a terrible idea be fun no yeah be fun for you but just those stakes shows like sitcoms you know right but it's not low stakes cuz imagine if it was your show and then some fucking DJ Doug Pound comes along he's like I'd like to direct your show for a week like fuck you man we're gonna kill your whole cast no you're not man no holes have watch that shit listen man trust me seven no Lia teen it's gonna be awesome they wake up and it's all a dream though that's the that's the cavea blossom becomes a demon yeah I'll start eating babies ah baby salad every day but we'll just use like rubber baby dolls don't worry but if bill o'reilly came out for one show in drag and just it's like this is who I am now it doesn't really explain it same guy even he's the same guy just like this is who I am this is how I've changed deal with it that would be as big as G that'd be as big as Jesus how Jesus will come back it will be bill oh right I'm now Wilhemina Wilhemina O'Reily yeah and he starts slowly beginning a transformation to to the female gender yeah yeah that would be incredibly just tells you like the reason why he was like that it's just who scared scared all the time yeah that people find out that he identifies with being a woman and that's where all the hate came from the homophobia all the Jesus love all that craziness that was he was into it's really just I wanted to be a woman yeah and then he just starts putting pictures of his new surgical crusty Bill O'Reilly pussy up on a screen and people just it causes waves of suicide but here's what's crazy people still spot him out at night like dressed like a man he looks perfectly normal they realized it's just a fucking scam like everything else he does he's not really becoming a woman he's just a bullshit artist no that would be one of the more views Salvage no it's what happens is you realize someone's blackmailing him you realize somebody has something worse than that and they're like listen bill that's like a house of cards move here's what I want do on your show what do you think oh my god I know I've got these pictures of you fisting chimpanzees chips what I was doing for Jesus so I go see the tide goes out you don't know wife is chimps explain it God moves in mysterious ways well they're phiston to wear a dress you fucking cocksucker I'm not when I go out that's my deal my personal life
