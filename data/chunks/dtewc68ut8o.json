equipment I don't hardly do anything other than I do some bench press stuff I do some a lot of chin-ups and bodyweight squats and stuff like that but almost everything else I do is kettlebells because it's just such an effective workout for like real body functional strength there's a lot of videos that are available on how to use kettlebells will eventually probably sell them on our site to we'll

back from a world tour ok the Joe Rogan experience train my dad Joe Rogan podcast by night ok powerful da my rare uh Joe you know how we're always doing the Irish accents to each other yeah why is that what is wrong and we've been doing that for fucksake decades well I went to Ireland right I got Ireland unbelievable I mean it was like I thought I told you over the phone but I go in and I'm in Galway da Miranda for fuck's sake we heard you with Joe Rogan we love the show one Keith goes I started doing martial arts because it Joe you realize you have an effect around the world this Beautiful's go away and kill Kenny this isn't even doublet well you know what I don't think men are represented fairly in the media I don't think there's enough actual you know guys that are telling you what's what's really going on from their honest perspective as someone that you could relate to you know I think a lot of people are full of shit and I think a lot of men could use some martial arts training it's good for you I think martial arts and comedy is a great great mix it does work is seems like it wouldn't but it really does work you know when I was when I was a martial arts guy only and I got into comedy I was almost embarrassed of being like having something to do with martial arts because it seems so douchey it doesn't seem like that would like that would be funny at all Joe even people that beat the shit at other people want to have a laugh they want to relax over yeah comedy is great for you martial arts great for you everybody and it's beautiful when I hear stuff like that that somebody is always great I got such a kick out of it I mean it happened every night every night guys came because they heard me on the podcast that's awesome yeah that's awesome I get people sending me pictures of their kale shakes that drink kale shakes every morning so I got a lot of people doing this Kevin James got me onto a Kevin James lost 80 pounds for this movie where he played an intern a fighter yeah and looked fucking fantastic his fucking face became thin he always told me how strong he was he's an animal hey Kevin James loves to eat he eats like a motherfucker but physically that guy is a he's a bear dude he's a big boned head he hits hard he's a big scary motherfucker and he you know he really could have been a fighter if he ever chose to go down that path he has like serious power like especially in his hands but he he hit mitts with Mark telegraphing and I was watching him hit the mats like he's like a real athlete even though he's his guy so he lost all this weight and he looks so good I was so blown away I was like what the fuck did you do and he said the most important thing is everything I switched to an all vegetable diet everything was vegetables every day he didn't need any animal products at all he did this for a long time he went back to it eventually but he would have a kale shake every morning and the idea was you you have this thing called a Vitamix you throw kale cucumber celery pears got and then I throw ginger and garlic in there and it tastes like ass I mean it's it's barely eatable you just sort of every time I do it it's like a little victory like there I just I got through that next the next day I win again you know every time I do it I feel like I win like we had a good but I was just saying but nutrient wise it's like incredibly dense it opens up your bowels your shit comes out like like it's just lubed up and on a Rhett you know one of those water slides that's so it's like it's like your body you feel like way healthier waterslide shit until that I've always want to shit - spectacular my shits when I have a well good white people say one of your shitting that don't wish I did I wish people could if I could like record it and then play it back for you you could feel how great it is so legit ristmas Joe effortlessly pours out of my ass ah that's me back of the show my shits entirely green you're kidding goes right through me entirely green it's crazy it's like man how clean is my asshole my asshole is like vegetable fresh Marsh it is yeah so it's that's how I learned from Kevin and that's like people sending these pictures now all the time uh there kale shakes IKEA like all the time on Twitter we know went to dinner with goodie mcil soup - with dinner at the Palm that night yeah at the steak house yeah great plan I noticed yet Kevin was in a great mood talking laughing as soon as the food came he was like on a mission didn't fucking look up like was his last meal well that's when Kevin had gotten back to eating again oh that was he cuz he had really like Christian he's all in or nothing he's like he's kind of like me in a lot of ways he's were very similar and one of the ways that we get crazy about things you know he'll get crazy about golf and just like fucking want to play golf all day but a year well that's so you're like that in pool yeah I got real problem starting to warm up after three hours Joe tired I played a just woman the other day and we only played a race to five it was like I was such a tease I wasn't even warmed up yet it was so I can for me pool is like a three for our experiment experience well you have that long time like I said I said to you you have the marathon runner and I have a sprinter mentality like when I'm on stage if I'm doing really well I can't wait to get the fuck up cuz I'm doing really well I want 45 minutes I'm out of there bing-bang-boom yeah but you like you love to like be up there for a couple hours and you and it's great I mean I think only if I can maintain the energy and I've never seen you not well I think it's also you have to factor in the audience's energy so I don't do shows as long as I used to do I've done some stupid like two and a half hour shows and the problem with that is people don't want to hear you talking for two and a half hours after a while they're bored it's like and then the end of it it was always it always it became like this question and answer section right and if it felt to me like what I was doing was I was having this killer hour and ten minutes of comedy and then I was ending it with like an hour of mediocrity I was like this is like the question answer sometimes would be awesome but sometimes it would just sort of become a fucking yell fast people yelling shit and just become gross and well some of that you know they've shot you know the Dave Chappelle thing with the five hours yes I said to the thinking was up to seven okay whatever but something ridiculous I said to the the Booker of the club I said that he took material she goes was all new material I said well I don't believe that so I asked the staff they go for material he asked one guy where he's from three times the guy says I'm still Pittsburgh ah that's hilarious well you know if people are willing to just sit there and you just sit around talking is that still stand up you know it's like your stand-up is your your craftsman when you go up there you got jokes you got punchlines you got setups you got you can't wait to get to them cuz they're killer but I have no idea how to write I swear to god I'm not true I don't I don't have any idea how to write a show that because it has to come out in a it's in its own way I don't know how to like mathematically remember Reed of Radner uh-huh people like that are like joke technicians right and I know you know how to write a joke or you just say funny things I just write what I do is I write and I write blogs like blog entries and then in the in writing about something since there's no pressure to be funny yeah then I get the ideas for jokes out of that or I have ideas and I'll slowly work them out onstage I do a bunch of different ways sometimes I don't have anything written it's just this idea that's been fucking with me and then I go on stage and I try it one way and then I say why was that that idea was missing I'll try it another way the next time until eventually I get it I had dreams last two weeks of shit that was killing in my dream it was don't be that water playing pool right oh yeah I had another one since then but I was having this dream about organic alcohol what was the one that you told me we were playing pool our relief pitchers yes yes I had this dream wake up and it what fucking 70,000 people know what's up a relief pitchers I mean you know what's a relief if they get off you know it's like I'm like such stupid non joke no I'm fucking like it was a part of me but I think I knew I was asleep and I said I can't wait to wake up that fucker write this down oh that was nothing nothing was funny it was so unfunny it's funny and you were killing Israel in my fucking thought throngs of people I know I've done that before I know I've had dreams where I was killing on stages I can't remember oh god this is the best stuff I've ever written yeah and I couldn't wait to write it down and I woke up when were you talking never waited up laughing Joe sometimes yeah I had I mean when I was first moving to New York and my dream was I had a job and it was involved I had to sit and soup to see how long scientists would stand around with these charts see how long it took soup to cool and it was chicken gumbo soup right and I remember sitting in the Super's like last fucking ah and then I sit down and I turn to the camera there's a camera in my dream and I go i $8 an hour sitting at soup how bad could a big that I moved to New York and then the rest is history that's hilarious I think if you laugh a lot and you used to laughing a lot it's more likely that you're gonna laugh in dreams yeah what if Bert Kreischer just sits there and laughs like non-stop in his dream but I'll tell you what bird is a happy motherfucker right now that guy is that guy I've never met anybody who's like more thankful for like success and like things that are going well in his life and so happy he's such a happy nice guy I always wonder about guys who were always depressed like Marc Maron yeah I got a lot more but Marc is one of those guys that was always so depressed now he's successful and he's got a really nice girlfriend I go is this bothering you guys I don't know what to do I know what did my feelings because I'm so used to so used to being miserable it's gotta be careful man because that all that is really bad for you all that years of and that's not like woowoo that's like that's real the years of harboring resentment and bad feelings and selfishness like that all that negativity that fucks with you man it keeps you from sleeping or it seems better to me though I'm sure it is I'm sure he is I mean he's a smart guy he knows I mean he's been one of the things is he doing a podcast where you really very very openly bare your soul yeah I mean he like when he does these like monologues where he talks about things in the beginning of his his podcast he's being uh he's very honest about all of his transgressions and his thoughts about him in the past and all sorts of different things so I think it's like super therapeutic in a way to do something like that like you can really get over your shit when you broadcast it yeah you know and I I think I think we all have a tendency it's it's so easy to go towards the negative it's just so dangerous it's so dangerous to think that that's the more profound way to think it's so it's so fucking stupid for you I never really let somebody else's success diminish me I just thought what never never have you never been a jealous car ever again anybody somebody said one time about Eddie Murphy does it bother you that I said what the fuck's Eddie Murphy I'm doing me he's tremendously talented yeah let's not like if he didn't do 48 hours I would have well you know what I love is loved about you Dom and not just you a great comic but you really love stand-up comedy like there wasn't there's always everyone had this idea at some point time and comedy that you did I mean not everyone but a lot of people in Hollywood you did you put together an act and then you got a sitcom and then you got a sitcom and then you went from a sitcom to a movie career and that's the only way to do it and any way else is not fun but you you were like I like being a comic I'm gonna come on making plenty of money like I got a nice car I live in a nice house like what the fuck you want from my need yeah what do you want from me what else yeah one guy says to me goes what else you got coming up everything is it's like the deli man what else what else I know it that's all you're gonna and I said down like I like it - steena collodion really cool got a movie and we go in the series cuz you got anything big coming up fuck big you got coming up at Jiffy Lube a new muffler I don't bother I don't gotta judge other people's career it's a funny thing though like people will talk shit I've seen so many people talk shit on Twitter about random people's careers like whatever happened to our IP to this guy's career like who the fuck are you like woody what why is that what is that weird free shot that's not a no that's a bizarre thing that sports writers who couldn't make their grade school football teams or critiquing guys like Romanowski critiquing guys there were great players you never played they never played anything well I've critique fighters I've never fought kickboxing and Taekwondo but I've never fought an MMA fight all I do is you would have built you it became up when you were coming up a would have you would have fought him yeah I would have and I probably be I probably a mess right now right about now says oh I'll never forget the fight that I came to see you and the mother and the sister was sitting next to me other guy too got knocked out oh that's nice huh reality hits you when you sit next to the relatives yeah well especially if they get badly kayoed and so there's a visceral fear that comes from people getting badly Kayode cuz it looks you know like they're done Oh guy gets head kicked or something remember we were that fight in Vegas and the guy got hit and ref caught him till he was so light remember it was Felix Trinidad really yeah yeah we saw Felix Trinidad I forget who he was fighting but it was when Trinidad was really coming up it was when he was light I think it was a welterweight fight but yeah I caught him with a left hook BAM I dropped him Felix turned out had a wicked left at the ref court we got the one the ref caught a guy before he hit the ground yep at least the back of his head didn't it just the front of his head was hurt yeah we saw a couple great fights in Vegas I don't remember who else we saw fight there but I remember we saw a couple good fights there boxing live is weird like you know I'm used to at the UFC because I'm the voice of it yeah it's weird when you're sitting there and you don't hear any commentary yes watching guys just fucking get the shit kicked out of each other yeah you've seen it's just the sounds of it as sweat the blood yeah the impact sounds and the O's of the audience oh yeah oh shit I told you what I realized after seeing that stuff when I and I want to do it again you know I loved it but I love violence I do I love my I just don't like fake violence like I don't like violent movies because I don't like that I don't like seeing somebody like Joe Pesci be able to beat some 25 year old stud because he's the star right right right don't buy that shit get outta here you know it's like yeah you know Joe Pesci almost got beat up by the bouncer at the Laugh Factory you know that story yeah that was red red was the mulatto guy he looked like a human wall well this was a different story than cuz I'm talking about Ken big can the rapper oh it was Ken yeah I thought was red come on where he says uh that you ain't animals ain't no movie motherfucker oh man was he was a what was a yeah remember Ken right yeah Ken was a big fuckin do yeah he's a football player and a rapper and apparently something happened and Joe Pesci got he tried to go crazy with him he got yelled

possible I love people and their fucking life is falling apart and they pull it together yeah I love that shit I love it it's one of my favorite things in life I goddamn Rocky movie I got to do it I'm starting to reach the depths of alcoholism I have it for real yeah yeah yeah what we talked about the holes and next thing I'm gonna try marijuana Dominic I think I do I think you're doing and I'm it

we'll plant it out so I'm driving you know if to worry about driving anywhere and we'll bake you out on air okay what do you think Goods buzz I get paranoid well that's very likely that's very likely maybe but how much does it take to get you high I'm just a little bit yeah this is really strong weed you know they keep talking about that in the news and we've talked about this on the podcast before there's the numbers of you know what the tea THC is so high that this is not your father's marijuana it's totally true it's fucking really strong weed now but it's still not going to hurt you so I'm going to kill you how long should take the wedding dress it just freaks you out you could take hours depending on your body she's that's the only thing I like getting stuck in something yeah if I don't like it well could be an issue dad hope that he doesn't like it Stanhope a tweed really sound like alcohol I like anything damn yeah did I tell you that one of my best friends is prosecuting the Sandusky case oh my god really and he like knew about this like over a year and a half ago but they didn't they had get by gathering up evidence and it's really interesting I mean it's we were doing like role-playing and trying to see what Sandusky would stay if he took the stand his wife's on the stand today why you imagine that's crazy oh my god and like we're doing thing like why would ten kids you know embarrass themselves to come out well I don't know maybe they miss remembered it I love that misremember Webb bullsháá but so scary the whole story is so scary because they protected him yeah they protected that guy you know when when people freaked out when everybody went on a goddamn rampage because Joe Paterno got fired I wonder what information they had you know I mean who Joe when you just go to the cops oh yeah you have to like why would you go for the chain of command what is this Nazi Germany I don't understand I don't understand what comment done I don't understand what happened why what they said happened was he went to it as another assistant coach we went to his father and then they went to Paterno Paterno to somebody else I would have gone to the cops right away if I see somebody hurting a kid BAM Madison how do you not beat him to death right there on the spot yeah you know that's got to be an instinct too you might want to beat him to death the guy's raping a boy oh the whole thing is just so creepy if it really happened the way there saying it happened I mean I'm assuming at this point time that he's guilty I guess why not why would all these kids come in yeah you're right no we have simply come from the same I'm not I would certainly not argue and I just you know for the sake of being fair the whole thing is fucking horrifying it's it's so terrifying it's so terrifying that they had this monster and protected they that's really the case yeah that's so scary to me it is well I was Catholic Church type stuff how else could they not know I mean how could they not know the Catholic Church type stuff is fucking horrifying Dom we used to have a priest that molested us when I was some in the summer camp really he never got me because I was such a nut I was always a light sleeper and afraid of the dark like a real man and then I would have a flashlight on under my under my sheets and every night I slept real light you know but he wheezed and we knew about it and nobody said anything because he was a priest oh my god and then they just had a whole thing about him even though he's dead they condemned his actions and stuff and the Philly papers recently what did he do to do he was just like you know jerk off kids in their sleep or would I play with them or whatever odd I don't think he did I don't think he did any of the Sandusky type level stuff because it was mostly a sleep thing it's amazing when you find out how many of them oh my god yeah well apparently the whole not having sex thing abstinence thing doesn't work well not only is it not work like it's who's signing up for that it's not like you go to a different heaven than me all I have to do is be a good guy and follow God's Word and I go to heaven too right and you don't get pussy I get to fuck my wife and they don't get that's ridiculous yeah that's that's no net no natural person now I mean something wrong with you in there for your prostate let that come it is you can get prostate cancer yeah it's terrible and and not only is it terrible like how how could an organization exist that has this many people the fuck kids could you imagine if they just started up tomorrow the Catholic Church started up tomorrow and all of a sudden you know there was no Catholic Church and then all sudden they said listen we just found this new religion it's it's we're really sure this is what Jesus really meant and they just started fucking kids 20% of us fuck kids dressed quick right away people would stop it they would go what the fuck are you doing you can you can't do this this is all you know the shifting of the people was just as bad as some of the horrible they're putting a predator in a new area well that was Ratzinger the guy was the Pope right now he was in charge of that shit you know what he said but yeah he said something about why the island the the churches are empty and they said why you know with so much molestation he said it's a mystery what the fuck that what kind of answer is that like everything's a mystery it's a mystery it's a mystery versus Margaery Irish people are fucking smart yeah that's why are smart they are smart they're smart as fuck I love doing stand-up up there they're there they're rowdy smart people and then they're not buying your bullshit you can only fuck their kids for so long the rest of the world has to catch up that's right Ireland's figured it out yeah you can't fuck our kids at all ever going to kill Kenny more than any of the other Americans you know I really know a lot of

genius man like it's amazing that a guy like Sandusky still alive you know with all the negative shit yeah that's done how is his body still holding up how is this though I have thought when he waves to people like he's running for office he gets a he's smiling and shit we can see how psychotic he is I mean if anybody else accused if you're innocent you're accused of all this you'd be out of your fucking life uh it's so weird even think about it that's it's so sick and gross oh this is so few things in life that disturb people more than someone taking advantage of children as they know that the whole future is that kids futures fuck you're poisoning that kid's mind that's the one thing in prison they say that child molesters get their ass kicked yeah course because a lot of people try other lawyer Boyd torch rectums you know as children fuckin they said I love when people do I hope they do that to him in jail but it's gonna fuck him then look at stretched out grass oh I see they're gonna kill him if he goes in in general population yeah they're beat him to death wait 69 now right yeah and then they put it if they put him in you know Scyld solitary isolation I mean it seems like they're just going to convict them I mean it just it seems like the evidence is pretty overwhelming it means only the problem is with these kind of trials it has to 100% it can't be a hung jury if one person is not sure then they have to do a retrial this one seems so crazy though it almost neat requires a second case it requires him to be guilty and then you to go back to the whole school and everyone involved how the fuck didn't you see well that's going to come down after this the president the guys who resigned are going to yeah they have their day in court most the Paterno's dead right did he die yeah he died that killed him too I mean he had cancer but I mean he would have he would have thought it he just was a coarse beaten man stumping what a terrible position to ban you know I didn't have it all those years of incredible success and he was king of Nittany Valley you know Penn State and then BOOM fuck man it just shows you this ain't a fucking movie they had a movie this this world is strange it operates its fucking strange and you know they're famous for their linebackers they called the linebacker you and you know who was the coach the linebackers sans oskowskis so he was a yes he was in a revered revered revered revered hi coach welcome to turn into Irwin Corey member I feel he was revered wow that's nuts well there's a lot of guys who do really good at coaching because they really like men that make sense right yeah well when you're really looking out for him yeah people put themselves in situations like that's what's scary but some people really do love kids and they love to see them successful I mean I was a great fourth grade teacher because I fucking love the kids and I told them I said I don't care I just do it you know I want you to happy happy my self-esteem you learn this shit great I said but let me tell you you're never gonna be in a some of this math this such bullshit I said you're never gonna be in a bind they go man if I only knew the Pythagorean theorem I get out of this champion yeah it's better they have they're happy right and learn you know I said learn it's past the marks cuz I don't wanna get in trouble but basically I want you to go to the gym have fun in life you know that's a good teacher that's a it's a great advice if you don't want any mathematicians for the rest of human history Asians are going to come out anyway kids that are a eggheads who are brilliant in it you know you just shouldn't force kids like that like me who had nothing is it possible to teach really complex things just make it fun yeah yeah the only thing they couldn't understand I could never get through to the kids was the relativity of up and down now there's no absolute up or down it's relative to a point because we're in the universe yeah I mean like you know we're you know like people go well that's that they don't understand how people in Australia are not upside down alright right I never explained that it was from a relative point but there are only nine ten years old right what is hard to grasp the whole organic spaceship thing oh yeah that we're all floating down here we will be looking for land looking for property Dom looking to settle down put a house down and there's probably no there's nothing permanent stupid the whole earth is a convertible yeah it's flying through the universe a convertible that can be easily hit play another convertible yeah daija and it happens that's the whole theory about the moon's creation the most recent theory is there was earth one and earth one was like fiery fucking ball of flame or whatever the fuck it was different I don't know what what what about it was different than Earth too but it got hit by another planet and that created the moon and changed the whole orbit of Earth and Qian atmosphere and that's the reason why everything exists today I mean the reason why we were able to sustain life because our temperature is remarkably consistent because of the fact that we have a moon you know is that it yeah I don't know how it stays within a couple degrees yeah that's part of it part of it is the moon the moon keeps our orbit really steady somewhere another like it's gravity interacts with us I don't understand it I don't understand gravity I mean we're supposed to understand what makes things float in space and what makes things stick those things I used to have a fear when I went to the beach that I would be sucked up into the air whoo gravity wouldn't work just like me I swear just that day all of a sudden oh fuck gravity thanks a lot and I can't get there gravity's a crazy thing to wrap your head around that there's stuff floating when you get outside of the gravity of the earth so you pass a certain distance from the earth where it no longer pulls on you you can float yeah like the earth has not that far it's not that far it's a few hundred miles right oh I mean I mean thirty miles or something yeah I think it's like just as soon as you get out Alice's here how many miles making things up 300 miles is like space shuttle that's like that's where the space oh it's that especially when they go to like 250 300 miles they go like somewhere around oh man it's crazy and then they you know obviously that's where the space station is you can float around up there but I don't know like at what height you can start floating what hi did you come crashing to your death and what hike you just float around that's because it's that's a real fine line man how I was doing a roast with who's the first man on the Moon uh Neil Armstrong Armstrong I think was Neil Armstrong was one of those guys Aldrin buzz aldrin he was a member of the Friars Club really I did a roast and I remember saying like what the fuck could scare you you've been to the moon right and I'm magic sitting in a ship going boys were off to the moon today if you really went to the moon dumb don't wait a second was it a Disney film Joe are you telling us that nobody ever really went to the moon I I think it's very possible that people went to the moon it's also very possible they faked the whole thing well if they did it was like a best orgasm I ever had I did a good job they've got us all excited people think I'm retarded for thinking this and they're right I am retarded it's not retarded all special thank you like like what was her name special so special who what is that song I gotta have some attention oh yeah Patton the fuck the pretenders oh no no not the pretenders yeah I take a wizard pretend was it it was a fuck I can't remember him now will is Tom Petty's ban the hard part Heartbreakers one I think he was the Pretender yeah you know heartbreaker Vegas I used to work with him when the old Garry Shandling show oh really I Tom Petty's a big Beatles songs together I remember well as a kid I was about 13 years old and this girl was telling me how cute she thought Tom Petty was and I never forget that so I was like Tom Petty is Chrissie Hynde Chrissie Hynde thank you and I was like Tom Petty is such a bad motherfucker that this girls they think he's cute well because he's like cute ugly because he's talented so talents the advantage of being a man you think any guy goes Susan Boyle oh man no bang her help got all the fucking award she's won well there's a few dudes out there that will marry you know famous famous monsters there's a few girls that'll do that that'll pick up like good-looking guy it's kind of lost and yes that happens that does happen you get him Bo this girl's at us powerful women that have him Bo's I've seen that shit but it's not as common now not name clothes not even close the women will genuinely legitimately be attracted to some like really successful gross guys thank you I appreciate the government for I was setting you up Tom it wasn't I know you had something to say about the subject it's a weird thing thank God were men to be a woman who yeah much more you know I felt really difficult I mean the whole thing about makeup and getting ready oh I was out of fucking um I was at a well I'm gonna say where it was um I ran into a woman that was very hot in like the 1970s and now she's uh you know now she's getting along in her in her age and she's got all this plastic surgery and shit and it was it was so weird to see so famous person I want to say her

that's permanent can you can you like no it's permanent yeah it's permanent you can't like relax and stops to stop doing what you're doing it makes your face like that no I remember I work with

go happiness then goes he'd never make a face good his face why does that look better well just looks tighter I don't know if it looks better I think you just got to deal with the fact that you're

awesome well if anything we could do to to you know to make this world a little bit better place as I help the young men help the young men that are coming up and give them some sort of fucking perspective that's different than the one they're getting every day either at work or in school or in the media getting this perspective that you have to be some asshole exist yeah some guy who doesn't exist you have to fucking you know you have to abide by their silly laws of political correctness so you can't tell the truth you can't you can't be honest about what you like you know it's a fucking terrible place where people have to live in just this shitty state of despair all the time it's not necessary I like to watch to women sometimes I get a little lazy ha do you like what you're doing well like a video well that doesn't really do it for me no no I don't I mean I guess if they were right there in real life I was gonna watch I've only seen it once in real life well I've seen a couple times but once that was like a video where they were actually making a video and it was like one of the most sexless things I've ever seen oh you saw a film in it yeah yeah it was real weird it was um they were they were doing one of the dudes was a writer for News Radio was a porno writer oh yeah were a writer he I think you're gonna score he dated a bunch of girls that were in the business and it was this is a long time ago this like we're talking about like 94 I guess somewhere on then and he broke up with this girl because uh they were out at dinner and this is when reality set in to him they were out at dinner and she was like just like really tired she wasn't anyways like what's matter is I say something she's like oh no it's just I gotta do anal with this guy all day and subscribe she's like hate that and all he could think was like can't wait till Friday how does that even fit in right right to the world that I'm living in how is it that the woman I love is taking taking dick in her ass all day at work I know like what yeah that's that's quite the job I remember we were at the riviera steve Schirripa was there and he don't want to go up by me he don't want to Steve is very faithful to his wife and you know Steve right yeah sure and he he tells me you want to go up and watch them chew porn or up in the penthouse I'll get Chapter I said yeah I got I go in and this girl's peeing on this other girl I go wow this is romantic where are they in a tub or something yeah and then that night we had in the we went up there and me and Sophie Sophie wanted to see it my girlfriend you know and the girls needed so much attention but when they weren't getting attention is one girl lays down on the piano because you want to see my trick and she put a you know this is a cigar holder that like a little capsule that they put stars in like a metal thing she put it inside of her and she popped it out but she shot it so hard it fucking hurt the girls forehead she's like she's staying there the girl goes you know you imagine if it fuck left a permanent mark what happened to you I don't wanna talk about it holy shit Jesus Christ yeah but you're right about having the wife and you know a husband and wife and when one of them does porn and the other dozen of both the zoo it weird is weird so this dude took me to a set and these girls were doing it and it was it was Jill Kelley and Janine and Adly to say I you know who both that fan they're both beautiful Janine is really yeah and this was back in the day she only had know she had any tattoos maybe she had a couple but now she's like fully sleeved and shed oh yeah I don't yeah it's weird um but and they were just two girls like eating each other out I was like I was like this is just so strange it's feel so that the music in the whole the whole thing we're watching the camera yeah you know Circle them and seeing the lights and the guy with the stubble Mike I was like this is so odd it just seems so strange anybody got the gum it was his real what was almost like clinical or something yeah of course it didn't seem like you know like if these are two girls and they were just sitting on the couch and all of a sudden one girl just start eating the girl's ass he'd be like whoa what the fuck like you'd be nervous right like what is happening here this is crazy but to watch it like to go and like it's sort of orchestrated and action okay you know I want to fingers now okay yeah let's uh yeah spit on it spit on it put your ass higher measure it I was at the cutout I was at the Magic Castle and a friend of mine and there's one of the dancers from the shark tour came in who I knew for years ago so I could just say that because there's so many of them and we go back to my house and we're by the pool table and Christie you know my old girlfriend comes out and I shouldn't say her name what doesn't matter it's not her last name still love you yeah and she has huge breasts and they she took her bra off and just had her t-shirt on there sticking straight out and the girl just casually walks over to her lips or thing and start sucking at this whoa me and my friend Ali we don't know we're just like they're like holy shit and you know I mean if Russell Peters always does that joke about like act like he's gonna jerk you off as a joke sake we take care yet a tough guy and it was just so odd and it was sexy to a point and then one of the girls wanted to go down the other one that's right drew the line imagine if there is so as many like really openly bisexual men as they were openly but it was just different it's different well it's different because it's bullshit because a lot of them aren't really bisexual some of them are for sure are you but there's a lot of Webb makers I'm saying they're fake and um it would not an act for us ah see don't break my family and there's no stigma attached to it no social stigma you know yeah some girls genuinely like girls of course but there's a lot of fake lesbians out there we all know this I know the girls that are in the porn that are girls are all real I mean yeah I mean all that although a lot of them yeah not all those girls you can't say most of those I mean if they if they're not gay they tell you well I'm not talking about girls that are like into hardcore sex either I'm talking about girls like making out with girls at bars and shit like yeah well they don't actually do anything oh yeah yeah it's a lot of that going on where they doing apprehension well you ever hear of lugs lugs lugs it's a phrase in high school and college girls use its lesbian until graduation no yeah like a lot of some girl just say well I just one of my friends daughters is a look really what she said she's no she's not gonna be a lesbian
