and we're live joy ideas my brother I feeling like a new fucking man rested you I know rested right rested very rested I looked at it at this as a reset button as soon as I came back from Vegas I know what time it was February 29th it was a 50% opacity yeah we were there a week later we were there when Tommy was at the Mirage in the UFC had their there Vegas the Las Vegas card it was it was a ghost town just half not even half full I mean a week after you you were at 50% capacity was probably dropping less than that dirty it was at 30 but do UFC was packed it was packed yeah and then I came to the Comedy Store March 2nd and that's when I could smell it in the fucking air when I went into the green room bro and I saw all those people in the green room I basically had a fucking panic attack yeah and I went right to the door there's a street door yeah in the back of the Eddie Murphy door if he comes back that's what this house is gonna get it out of that guards so I went to the Eddie Murphy door and I stayed there and you could just see people in the audience like nothing was going on and I just got I just got shit like I was shattered by Saturday and remember I was supposed to be in New York for Saint Patty's Day and the Monday before I was supposed to be in New York the 16th and 17th with a show at NIACC on the 12th and I saw it happening I can't went to a doctor's for a shot off my knee to get the gel for the arthritis and he said them you might have a weird reaction to it and sure enough Tuesday I went to boxing class and the guy goes dog your leg is bruised so I had a little bruising on my leg and I got home and that night on the news that hit New Rochelle and like a win second the Rochelle in Nyack they're like fucking neighbors you know my memory man I served me right but in my mind that talked close yeah well pretty on top of everything so I sent a letter to picture that might need it it produces and I said I'm not coming does they wanted me to come in Thursday for wardrobe and then I was just gonna sit in my hotel room for two days you know I'm go to Jersey and eat shit like that so even during all this they were still planning on filming and this is for The Sopranos movie so we were gonna do a couple shoots some reshoots not reshoot you like extra scenes right that Tuesday when I got all new Rochelle a bus I sent them a picture of my knee and so I'm not getting on a plane till Friday I want the swelling to go down but it doesn't take the fucking I got a GED and when I was in New York City in May I went by the garden teeth lunch I wanted to get out of my hotel room and I went to the garden on the side you could sit there at 12 o'clock and they have everything steak sandwiches whatever you want pretty fucking good two trucks I know they have a building that has floats inside and have some trucked and you could still outside fucking beautiful but while I was sitting there was a Tuesday I was off from shooting and I remember calling my wife there specifically saying I like it here everything but where all these people can't call yeah if you sit in New York City in Manhattan like on the 50s and just sit there at a cafe you could estimate I mean it's like maybe 10,000 for every 10 minutes that you sit there people that walk by you we don't have that foot traffic and now I awake phase in New York there's a little bit of foot traffic downtown but Sunset Strip that ship sailed you don't see people walking around the Sunset Strip Hollywood Boulevard but not to the dense popular you know no not in the numbers of New York so we said no fucking brain there's a GED here this is Smith sitting there gone this is gonna happen I just kept cutting it down and my biggest fear was going to the East Coast and getting stuck it could happen I would've had to buy a truck the Cadillac and drove back I was already prepared like I was like I'm gonna buy a truck and drive back do you think you do that drive that's a long ass fuck I could do it I've done that drugs only times what is it five days five days four days there's what four days you got to do like what sixteen hours a day yeah it's hard to stay awake I did Colorado New Jersey like the back of my hand how far that early eighties three what is it from here to Colorado like here to Denver I think 16:16 here to Utah Salt Lake is 10/10 that's a good one that's a good escape that's a good escape I don't have not but I've done Vegas multiple times right Vegas is about four and a half warnet yeah and then you go another six ish somewhere in that range you get to Salt Lake depending on traffic it's awful it's not like you go to Salt Lake City at 5:00 in the afternoon like all fuck rush hour hey where's the cars fly by we thought I thought Solly said he was like millions I thought it was like millions of people it's some Millions what did we figure it out Jamie didn't mean it's like a couple hundred thousand yeah cool fucking place I love it I love Salt Lake City so with the radius at the moment the morals mistake on it nobody knows dick about thick like a reefer bong grenades great Mexican for a food you go to that one this is one famous Mexican joint I some lizard I was walking around and some guy goes Joey Diaz I got the perfect spot for you you seem cool you drop with your Mexican joint what is that there's a one famous Mexican spot in how did you get the number it says estimated as 200k but yeah that's like that goes all the way out to the mountains 1.2 million that's nothing yeah that's nothing no 200,000 in the city and you see those popping when people would like dense and then I started hearing that we're gonna dance or coach our I'm gonna cancel our childhood that too fucking greedy cancer coach our dog old people that's what some Palm Springs well once they cancel South by Southwest I was like whoa whoa this is crazy and the storm was planning on keeping the oh are open and they cancelled my show in the main room they asked offered me a spot in the Ori was like I don't think we should be doing shows like this just doesn't seem like this seems like it's getting real because if you make a mistake and there's a forty a period where all these people can get infected who the fuck knows who gets infected during those 14 days it's so because we didn't know what it was yet and still we don't know what it's still strange because so many people idris elba apparently is asymptomatic he's not showing any symptoms and he has asthma and I was reading something find out if this is true that somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 percent of the people are asymptomatic and I wonder if that means they never show symptoms or a wonder if that means they they're asymptomatic for a certain period of time so 60% of people infected are asymptomatic but a certain percentage of those people will ultimately get the cold or get the get the coffin all the terrible symptoms the fever because you really ask listen you know a lot of people I know a lot of people that has it I have Michael yo Michael yo was almost dead Michael yo went to New York City did Gotham he came back he got real sick you know yes yes he got pneumonia and the cove in 19 at the same time so he got coronavirus and pneumonia and he said now now six days ago I talked to him two days ago he said for four days before that he thought he was gonna die his art couldn't breathe pneumonia and this korone of I think I think this motherfucker winning it like plays with you if you don't have it if you don't get it you you can kind of like oh this is no big deal but if you do get it it fucking grabs you like Jamie knows a girl who's 21 who lost her sense of smell and taste and it just it wrecks people we were we were googling a story about this Olympic swimmer from South Africa 31 stud athlete Olympic swimmer he said this virus fucked him up he said it was the worst thing he's ever experienced so it's weird it's like it pull it almost like plays with our mind like it makes some people seem like they're immune and some people are fine maybe it's you take a chance go outside take a chance go to a restaurant take a chance to the beach let's go to the page what's the worst thing that can happen crack close asshole and then don't deep fuck it and then boom a bunch of people in your family get it and then boom your grandma dies look at Italy you know what happened anyway lately they just went out they all live together yep yep yep yep they all live together and they hang together nothing wrong with that that's how people are I came from this husband there's a basement you grandmother and grandfather living a basement your parents live on the second floor you live on the third floor boom we hang out together the foots go family god bless him from freehold New Jersey and lost more people from a family reunion and went to like that oh yeah sorry yeah I saw that one I saw the one that the guy had the 39th Bert the 40th birthday party and the old guy on planes afterward and went off to different parts of the country a family majority was not very old either no the youngest one that died I think was 55 I think it's somewhere in that range it's um I might do it well I have the mask on am i jumping up and down at rowlf's buying groceries no am I going I stop you know I went to one boxing class after that yeah was announcing I was like you know what this is too personal we haven't give it a chance I got a bag at the house I got kettle bags at the house everything could be done out of my house yeah if you're a person and you want to work out there's so many YouTube videos or just bodyweight workouts you can get a fucking amazing workout with nothing you don't need any equipment you just do burpees and push-ups and bodyweight squats and lunges there's plenty of working out to do folks and it's free it's a beautiful thing about YouTube there's so many really good fitness instructors to just put their stuff out there for free because they want people to follow them and you know you can get a ton of great bodyweight workouts you don't need nothing and if you need weights folks you can pick shit up around your house and you could do a great workout with I'm sure you got a can of paint somewhere the probably weighs 15 pounds you know people have things laying around don't you know how to start going what because it was fuck me meditate so what I do is I hit the bag I broke my work pot because now you can't do that long workout now because we're gonna do for the other day for the restoration day there read that crime so there's no recovery my world just some be worried about every 15 minutes yeah nice in the back hitting the bag is very essential yes in the bag is very essential get the Yaya's out you're punching you look at anything benefits over 44 boxing benefits over 50 the number one benefit is stress you know for a couple days there Doug I was getting scared you know I wasn't I'm not scared of it but I respect it there's a big difference I respect what's go on something's going on I'm not a fucking scientist have you ever been here in an earthquake yes this for me it's the same feeling but but more magnified it's like okay this is alright but what is it like if it gets worse right oh yeah where were you in July I was on fucking stage we were we were home I didn't even feel it I didn't even feel it I was in Beach and the room showed and I just kept going I just kept going fuck if a beam falls and hits me this is it but you don't know why you're on stage I couldn't let them get scared oh I couldn't not let them get scared cuz now you lose the audience right fifty people in there I know so I could not let 22 minutes brilliant it was perfect I was just thinking about the other that was one of my best times I had the last year would stand up right in the middle I'm on stage and I had to calm them down so I just learned to a rant so they didn't get scared yeah yeah my last show I did was like a Tuesday or a Wednesday at The Improv I forget maybe Wednesday did one show a p.m. show great fun time but I was like I think this is it this is the last show for a long time I didn't want somebody to say they went to the improv right I didn't want somebody to say that they got sarikamis yeah you will never shake that thing is you'll never know there's no way anybody could dial it in to one person or you got it from that's this the weird thing is we're constantly interacting with people and touching surfaces and according to this these cruise liners that they're testing where these people were sick even people that are asymptomatic it shows the virus stays on surfaces for much as 17 days that's a new discovery they thought it was three days before that now they're realizing even in asymptomatic people people that don't spray these it's weird it's a fucking weird virus man it's real weird real weird my friend dr. Peter tea I was saying that most people 55 and under they seem to just get cold I mean it's a date they're fine they feel like shit for a while but they get over it he said but then there's this 28 year old fitness instructor that one of his friends is treating was a doctor and he's guys on a ventilator he's a fitness instructor and they're like there could be genetic conditions predispositions and then they're also it might be vaping they think in that vaping might have something to do with damaging some people's lungs you know or cigarette smoking cigarette smoking is a bad one and they think that that might have contributed to a lot of deaths in Italy and in China out smoke us and they have less cancer in China see the thing is are we sure they have less cancer like when they say they have deaths like how many deaths they have out of China would you believe those numbers I don't trust a fucking word of it they're trying to say that this is an American disease that's what the Chinese people are there's some propaganda Network from China that's I don't know it's connected to the government or water may because people just fucking around maybe it's people trying to be funny but they're putting out that this is a man-made disease that was spread in China by the United States government so who the fuck are you trusting I'm not trusting I trust Italy when it comes to the numbers because I think they're being pretty honest about what a disaster it is but China's trying to make it seem like everything's bouncing back now I don't buy it they opened up the movie theaters in China yeah movies like one night movie oh my god watch a horror movie boy you're in this fucking theater just wondering if everything you touch is eventually gonna kill you fuck apparently they were saying also that it has something to do with blood type they don't know why but a lot of the fatalities were blood type a seem to be vulnerable or maybe it's just a coincidence they say they don't have enough data yet you know especially here like reliable data that we can trust here in America they don't have enough yet so when I when I think about it what gets me is that same feeling like an earthquake like once an earthquake it's like oh alright what we're okay right now but now we know that this can happen like the first one I ever experienced I was the first year here I had an apartment in North Hollywood and wasn't it was a thin place like you could hear the next-door neighbor she would get phone calls I would hear her answer machine go off this is the 90s and I would hear the person talking on her answering machine I could hear every conversation she heard she had like it was through a towel like that's how thin it was it was a shitty apartment but when the earthquake hit the apartment just went like this and I remember thinking this is like when you're a kid and you're playing in a refrigerator box remember those refrigerator boxes we would get him on the street and we all climb in them and fuck around but they were they were flimsy I'm like this house felt like a refrigerator box he just started moving like this and it wasn't even a big earthquake it was like a five something like a five five or something like that it wasn't a huge one they say was an aftershock from Northridge you just started doing this it's moving back and forth and I was like whoa I didn't think it was gonna be like that I thought the ground would shake I thought I'd be like like you feel your feet moving it's not everything just goes left and right everything just shifts like the ground is made out of like it's sand or something like instantly it just becomes pliable it's weird I saw the cat drinking water and all of a sudden I saw the cat in the air bowling here that's how much of a dip in May I heard it looked like you're like you're on the computer and something and you yeah and I looked and I saw the cat drinking water and all of a sudden I saw the cat in the air and when he landed he took off and they're supposed to feel something before the earthquake I think dogs do better than cats those indoor cats are done they don't you bring them in door runs by them they're like I'm done that that but I don't think so my pets are alive and kicking at midnight they would all they say Kevin look they're like Judy's how many do you have now three you only have three that's crazy you're up to 11 at one point nine nine I think you're at 11 you probably forgot I had so many of them outside I was feeding I had so many of them oh that's right you had a bunch of feral ones that lived in the yard to you Marc Maron has that kind of set up - yeah or at least he used to it is all place it is fucking phenomena 3 mmm I'm down three girls mmm all the boys punched a ticket my favorite one died three months ago a little boy now I'm down two girls so I don't know what I'm gonna do for my next move is I'm waiting to see what the smoke clears maybe gonna German Shepherd out we should all get out of here no shit legit we should get out of here this should be our wake-up call which is all just a denver this is a big you know there's a lot of places like Loveland hour outside of Denver you know I mean evergreen 30 minutes outside of Denver - what what happened to Montana what happened my town no but here's the thing Denver's got comedy Utah's got comma you know what why don't we just open up with Club of Montana Billings we could do it that's okay he's opening up a club in st. Louis everybody's opening up a club that's if we did go to war with everybody else comedy school and fuckin we miss Montana if we just decided to do that when was last time you were month Oh what did you think I love it there I love Bozeman what are we waiting for the winters a motherfucker those son winters real bears will listen till now what is it I realize that we could do anything he's actually realize look after every earthquake a certain amount of there's a certain percentage of Californians I wake up and say I'm not going through that again right they get up and leave there's certain Californians then go like me they go shit you gotta get a generator for my fat sleep apnea machine and every time you go to supermarket buy two something yeah two cans of creamed corn cancellous you got my fucking garage I'm good yeah you gotta have dried I'm good I'm good you know why cuz I'm a child I'm a child of the 60s when I was growing up every building you moved into had a fallout shelter you dumb fucks nobody remembers the fucking fallout shelter and they had tang and fucking TV dinners down there and everyone saw while your building would run a fucking thing the Russians are coming the rest and you'd have to run to the basement and close the door and they had like a vent and grammar schools you gotta go down to the basement and they give you like the fucking Tang juice and all that shit about five children you coast then fuck yet nobody remembers the fallout you so I've always lived like it's the fallout shelter I always had a back situation I got weed till fucking tongue doomsday my family came over here went 6660 I've been over here already dabbling over here since the 50s fucking around numbers whatever the fucking my mom was doing whatever the fuck my dad was doing so they were already hip they made it official in 66 hmm so what I was being raised here my first couple years in this country were we were living under fear Vietnam was going on they had just killed Kennedy and now they just killed cuz I was alive and kicking when they went sit on sehun get killed Robert Kennedy so it was a different time then we were living in a little fear Cubans had pointed missiles at us awesome the Russians weren't that fucking cool so that's why the fallout shelter was big just in case they threw a bomb at us we go downstairs to a basement live and stuff like that so I think what fucked us me was the you all Romero fight deny the euro America fight I was invited to a friend's house to watch the fight and I pretty much had a nervous breakdown from the fear leaving the house really because it was cuz the virus yeah really nervous breakdown you didn't want to go to your friend's house best guy in the world you were like I stay home for people you know I never know I asked him if they were cool yeah I know nobody's been to China nobody's been cuz that's the problem ya know was gonna in fact look at the the skier that once gain and New Rochelle the Jewish guy that went to the synagogue well the two dudes he went skiing with I already seen him in critical condition where they were he went in a group then he went to the synagogue in New Rochelle and spread it all around he should be the most popular guy in the neighborhood today you know I'm saying that guy like nobody wants to talk to so he brought it there from Italy he went skiing in Italy he couldn't go to fucking Riverton Wyoming or fucking Utah or fucking Aspen you gotta go to Italy like a big shot well he probably playing a trip to Italy long before he go to Aspen

together some sort of fun too hope they do it quickly and we're all gonna be able to donate and there I think they want to have some stream shows too but I don't think that's the way to do it I mean if if they do do it and they have a bunch of people almost like podcast I'll maybe that maybe that would work and have like a telethon raise money well I say what I thought about this dream thing I like doing this dream thing but a podcast not stand up I thought but then I saw this week with John whatever HBO John Oliver John Oliver and last week he didn't have an audience not good no point of well when no one's laughing at your mind you need that energy yeah they were doing live shows from the Laugh Factory yesterday was yesterday and it was no audience and I was watching Jay Mohr on stage for a couple minutes for had a panic attack and I shut it off no I just I wanted it to work weird and I thought that I could do it for people just to break the monotony you know it's like watching someone with you know voice sing in the shower yeah no no leave me the fuck alone this is how bored are we how bored do you want to go like a 10 o'clock are you like I'm talking good night yeah no I'm not I'm not bored my wife goes to bed the baby goes to bed we iveron a homeschool schedule they have an 11 o'clock 10 o'clock video conference at 11 o'clock then we do math we take a breather and she hits the Mitch to everybody gotta hit the midst of the house because I get that stress out you know move they move and everybody's on a schedule but at night like this is the FIR I have not been out of the house and 21 nights no one wanted 25th today's 25-23 nights so at 11 o'clock I get a little bored think that I'm the edibles started not working because you won't been too exposed to him yeah I just been thought up intolerance I've been popping to trees you know yeah I've been eating them so much like the first like the first week of the week before st. Paddy's I was I was under so much personal stress like I was so fearful of that plane ride hmm to New York that I was getting fucking gizelle I wasn't even matched if you took that flight you would have probably caught it I mean that that the whole New York area these are real good chance you had as a JetBlue by myself cabin I had it all planned out but the more I thought about it I'm like I don't know guys I don't want to be in the hotel I know how 40 said I know how the foodservice industry works it was that very weekend that yo got it the very weekend you went almost I was the heat of it yeah that was the fucking heat of it and it's still it's still just climbing well they said it's to two weeks it's gonna reek it reach its apex but they they have you know an astounding number of cases they do however test more than California so they're more accurate in terms of their numbers there's more testing being done in New York City I think by threefold than California it's crazy man this is a whole new time and I really hope it's a wake-up call for us it is a wake-up call this is Doug listen as jokey as this may sound or whatever I've always had a faith my faith got me to where I am a faith in what a higher power let's call it a higher power I always had a faith in a higher power and if anybody knows about karma is me I'm the fuckin poster boy for karma I know all about it for me this is like a power letting us know like it's a reset button take a look around you guys have gotten caught up in selfies yeah like you've gotten caught up in selfies you know you go see a fucking concert it's two hundred and fifty dollars and sixty dollars to park you know you go to a movie theater you walk out an American family can't go to a sporting event no more the normal American family cannot go to a sporting event no more without a lot of control Joe we can't move an apartment or more 1500 for a studio we just got greedy man the Greed's been too much you know I got to feel bad for Disney losing six million suck my deck you were charging 140 a day cocksucker 140 a day I think that's the least of our problems no I think the big problem is people think this is all this life the way we're living is gonna be permanent no no it's changing for a reason yeah it's changing for we were getting fucking greedy but there's definitely that and we were getting a little overzealous but we're soft we're soft that's the big one and especially we're soft right here because we don't have to deal with weather right here we don't have to deal with nothing you go outside everyday you could sleep outside and it'd be alive it's a great place to be homeless all you need is a sleeping bag get under an overpass if it does rain it only rains ten days a year you'll be fine you know this is this is a great place because of that but because of that also we're not humbled enough you know the places where people get humble to the places where people have to deal with direct nature snowy places real cold places like if you go to any place that's near an ocean that's a little slap in the face like wake up bitch take a look at that you ain't shit mountains are another one same thing like you die up there stupid there's bears up there's mountain lions up there they're fucking killing deer with their face you don't think they'll fuck you up to go go hike go hiking get lost hippie you know like it's a wake-up call those places and I think this is a wake-up call for the whole country the whole world is a wake-up call we're vulnerable and it's also a wake-up call I mean I can't say this enough people take care of your health please it is a one defense for this that seems to be agreed upon by almost everyone is that if you have a strong immune system you have a better chance to get through any sickness and you can do something to extract in your immune system your immune system is something you can work on you know you can work on it by cleaning up your diet you can work on it with regular exercise you can work on it with regular sleep all those things have a real big impact on the immune system also vitamin supplement with vitamins eat healthy diet get some exercise and if you can get in a fucking sauna everyday tremendous for your body producing heat shock proteins for your body reducing inflammation alleviating stress it's great for your cardiovascular system it's just great for you there's a bunch of different things you can do you can you can use this it's like okay I'm alive now this is a wake up call I'm so glad this didn't happen to me I didn't get wrecked by this I'm gonna get my life in order and it can be done it's something that everyone can do and this is the time to do it this is a good time to do it if you're surviving and you're getting through this this is a good time to get your health in line what you don't know lot of people don't know about me is I was a sickly kid really we never I never believed from the age of 4 to 6 because my dad died and my immune system fell apart it was respiratory I always got colds always shots you know vaccines I knew the people by first name at the hospital at Roosevelt Hospital in New York I mean it was real with me when I was sick something else I've asthma did you really which went untreated like I just said you have asthma still like my mother said that's for faggots don't worry about it you don't need to have asked me right now outgrew it my daughter has it though really she has it and now I see it Mayer and I go does she have an inhaler yeah and you don't use an inhaler at all anymore no did you ever for like a week my mother goes to get rid of that you live in New York City you don't smack me Wow your mother's hard so I grew up with this fucking thing and then when I was 16 I got putting off for 13 days for a lung infection from Paraguay service is then like I'm not supposed to smoke hmm I'm never supposed to smoke when I started smoking I would get sick the days afterward like I had a jump a hurdle to smoke pot but when you were smoking cigarettes what about that that was a completa not even talk about that but let's talk about the hurdles I had smokin reefer early on I would smoke reefer and it would be an event I would have to take three or four days or it would crush me for that long well then once I built the Tower and saw that then I started having to build the tolerance of who I smoked dope with like if I smoked dope with me you and Jamie and somebody else the next day I'd have a temperature do you get sick from someone yeah 13:14 so by the age of 15 I already knew how to keep my shit like if I smoked with you and Jamie every day that's who I smoked with once somebody else comes into that circle I would get sick hmm so I had to knock that out so I had to be very aware at a young age of who I smoked with I got sick a lot when I was competing I wasn't taking care of myself back then I didn't take vitamins I didn't take shit I got sick a lot cuz it was always stressed out too cuz I was always nervous cuz fighting all the time so you know you get ready and the weeks up to a tournament you know that's the most stressful and the week of the tournament I would always come down with something you know and you want a fighting sick fought sick in Anaheim I flew out to California to fighting the Nationals I fought sick I had three fight sick did we figure out what the percentage said that was an estimation that was close to 60% of a sum obviously it was like 20% those well I think as time goes on we're getting a better picture of it take care your immune system kids I've been drinking a shitload of water to pee and my crazy kombucha CB up the oil yep CBD oil for sure I took some Patsy be deal accidentally I was wasn't paying attention I went to the cabinet to get them some CBD on my man this is tasty what is this it's like peanut butter CBD oil and I have three droppers full and then I looked on it said pet Oh My Damn hope I'm gonna be okay the differences between CBD md's pet formula and their regular formula but I had three full droppers of their peanut butter pet formula it was quite delicious it was pretty good you take a lot I take enough supplements vitamins Katie yeah I take a lot of things you know like I said I down the reef for a little bit throughout this I was going like through a half ounce maybe a week mmm joints among its numb down like 1/8 a week I've got fucking a couple ounces at the house go off at a booth I'm enjoying the time just the relaxing time of no pressure of things to do you know no shows to go to stay home every night hang out with the girls I'm enjoying I don't watch the news yeah I was fucking with me the first week I'm glad that little nervous breakdown on the 7th that was really fucking with me and then I said that's it I went back to my roots I went back to Boulder I took it back to the Roper Institute bitch and I took him back to the meditation so what I would do is I'd hit the bag 15 and then to come down I'd stretch and just do yoga poses and breathe and then and with like a long fucking meditation and get some vitamin D I'd do everything outside and back at the hostel backyard hidden did I think that hitting the bag is a kind of meditation yes I really do yes I think if you really can just conscious breathing and I know three minutes thirty seconds off my do try to do five set to that yeah but then after that the stretch has really helped me oh yeah now I have no crowd there opee I got no acupuncture no spice cryo closed closed hmm yeah I stayed away from the last two weeks I did a little nut Nova tour which is the red lights until about ten days ago yeah and then this started getting more serious and I go you know what let's start just cutting down this whole thing mmm and then it's last week and I see what was going on at the parks and shit there's a park close to my house I just let me go but I can make a few calls I'm like this is crazy look at these people packed they're on top of each other yeah and if I'm running but I knew that makes no sense they're all running the same way are you running right into some when you're running right into it I'm Gidi Joe this is what kills me I got a GED and I'm sitting there watching these fucking morons run behind each other you know like yeah all of a sudden you're fucking Rocky but you're sucking

pulling in the park ball isn't what are we doing here well you can be by yourself right I saw some people hitting the pads at the park where someone was holding pads for somebody you did do that we got some space away from you can get a little work out there's always gonna be that good trying to come up to you yeah there's always that day man aren't you worried about the coronavirus I have to take the racehorses out early my daughter's a race was so at a 45 I give my wife a break and I just take it for a little stroll just wear a little wear out a little bit we play badminton whatever the fuck that is yeah tennis with the fly yeah I throw a wiffle balls either I just only the other days in the heat of all this I'm there at 9:15 for a reason they got the playground on sealed off and then they got a huge fucking part and for some reason everybody got a walk I walking between me and my daughter dog by the second person I had to say something really really you can't walk around you gotta walk in between people can't have enough they passed your fucking wits well they don't they don't change their behavior the best was the guy that watched me playing with my daughter and I could see him out of the corner of my eye Gerald and I could see him I could see him whispering to the wife some stupid shit and what does he do he starts walking towards me and I'm not even paying attention to him but I am I'm watching them through this fucking vision mm-hmm I'm watching him I'm playing with my daughter throwing the wolf football and he's walking towards me finally had to stop and he goes hi I just wanted to shit I go stop he just looked at me and I felt terrible for but this is what's actually going on they still want to shake your hand yeah people try to shake your hand still they still want to shake your hand I'm like it's not gonna happen stop right there yeah I go hit me on Twitter now it's your back but that's it I don't want to hug I don't want to know nobody nothing you gotta tell me I want to hear yeah unless you're showing in here with a fucking envelope which I don't see you have don't come close to me at all people did they're not changing their behavior though that's something baby there's a number of people right so some people pay attention to everything some people are over cautious I went to the fucking supermarket this lady had goggles on and she had I mean not goggles but big jackie onassis dark sunglasses a fucking face mask with these giant gloves on and she's walking away from everybody like everyone's a bomb and she's doing her grocery shopping Michael you've gone too far this is a little ridiculous and then I'm looking at other people that are acting like there's nothing wrong when they try to shake your hand and then there's people that are paying attention too much so that they've become paranoid they're not even living their life and then there's other people that aren't paying attention at all they're barely paying I'm in the middle I'm in the middle I know I have to live my life that means I want to go to 7-eleven for nothing yeah 7-eleven is filthy I don't have to go in there for nothing okay nothing I got rolling papers and everything in my house why this I got lighters till next morning I can light myself up ten times with wide as I got I'm not you know I'm not putting myself in a bad position ya know you've been quarantined Jamie's been quarantined Jamie I didn't go to fuck you know there's somebody instead tonight there'll be a concert no go where no if I tell you that tonight there's a concert they'll go if it was if it was Liberty University's letting students back in today Jesus is gonna look out for him yeah there was an article on CNN they were showing Liberty University opening up its doors again students like this just started you fucks you can't just you know what do you think we are right now beginning yes yes you don't think you look good till mid May no listen it keeps accelerating every day but it's accelerating everyday that means it's at the beginning every day there's more cases every day there's more people getting sick doesn't he say yesterday I don't quote me on this he's talking about Easter yeah because it's a very special day to him see he said it's a special day this virus doesn't give a fuck what day you think Jesus came out of the ground this virus doesn't give a fuck and if you don't respect it people are gonna die and there's people like the lieutenant governor I think is who he is of Texas who is like we should take a risk with older people just to get the economy back in line people like whoa what are you saying you think the economy you should we should get the economy back in line and by doing the economy some old people are gonna have to die you've ready to sacrifice people for money yeah older people would rather die than let kovat 19 harm US economy Texas officials said older people would rather die that's what he says lieutenant governor Dan Patrick okay yeah and you know he was saying that he's in that high risk category himself because he's 70 you notice these politicians are terrified that this is gonna lead to an economic disaster and their names gonna be stuck on it you know I think they were terrified at first that they had they had to act that a closed things down but they didn't have a plan and now they realize like oh my god this might have to stay locked down for a long time what happens the economy yeah you didn't have a plan no one had a plan so they locked everything down and now they're like listen this could last a long time we got a fig we got to start the rumblings now of getting this ball rolling again because if it's goes six seven months and no one's working no one can go outside their house for six seven months like this is crazy what we won't have any money and China's gonna take over Tucker Carlson had this whole piece he did that I saw that was actually pretty accurate you know where he's talking about what what could be possible do like he was talking about how the NBA did you see that whole segment where the NBA they had said something about China and then then you see all these people that were praising China and saying positive things about China what was this what was the reason behind that Jamie your MBA guy the GM for their Houston Rockets tweeted like support for Hong Kong that's right that's right was support for Hong Kong and then China got pissed at that and so then they started tweeting nice things about China and they started well at the time if that happened that the there was like an MBA teams in China doing games and we just come back and then they started asking all them what they thought about this and then like the Bron started supporting China I think and then everyone jumped on them and like like money over people I think well you mean that they face consequences for supporting Hong Kong yeah well what tucker carlson was saying in his piece was that imagine if that's the the whole country like understand that like if china's the ruler of the world of china becomes the ruler of the world not the united states because of something like this like this is all really possible like the idea that the united states is the ruler of the world so it has to stay the ruler of the world forever no natural disasters disease fucking asteroid impact there's a bunch of different things that could shift the balance of power in the world rome used to run everything right the you know the there's europe england the UK you see England used to run to half the fucking planet there's a lot of different countries that were on top of the world that are no longer on top of the world and we would be in a real sticky situation if we had to live under the same military dictatorship - China does and the idea that we would never have to live under that we we can't where America well that's ridiculous because we're human beings and other human beings are stuck in a circumstance where they're living under a military dictatorship so there's no difference between them and us other than culture and the place where they live that that shifts things change with natural disaster with disease with failure of the economy with war with all these different factors things change and our perception much like our perception of our society itself it's always going to be like this and all sudden this disease comes along as it shuts everything down you're like whoa that's a fucking wake-up call need to recognize that this is kind of fragile well the whole system is fragile if those things happen natural disaster disease war anything catastrophic happens the balance of power completely shifts and who knows whose control the survivors are under who knows who knows how this works out this is all real touch-and-go right now this is real touch-and-go this is uncharted territory where we have slipped into a place where no one's working and everyone's scared and the president wants to go back to work on Easter because it's a special day to him and Joe Biden can't talk the guy was running for fucking president for the Democrats can't talk did you see they were deleted the latest shit Tim Dylan sent me two videos he's like what the fuck is going on like he's in a cognitive decline governor in New York Cuomo put him in put him in coach put him in you want it you want a guy to run for president that makes sense you want a guy who's an intelligent guys a strong leader who's got a lot of experience and press the fuck out of middle school that's the fuck out of me too what he's like putting up human lies more than money he's impressed me I tell you who else is impressed me I don't know see you can't say nothing because you're always gonna be wrong there's always a knock well but Joey you're wrong because he's declined the woman's abortion Act there's always something that's true that's part of that's that's the argument they had about I don't even know what it is I don't even know and I tell you it's always or something I don't even know what the issue is late term abortions he apparently voted for I know there's always something so and I was just making a joke but I know you're actually the other guy that's doing a good job but I see that he's communicating this is governor Newsom yes he's doing a great job I don't know what his politics are I don't know if he's a democratic or republican I just know he's stepping up and he's fighting for these people and he's making some smart choices and you know what I don't know it you a fucking scientist Joe Rogan let me check are you a scientist no me neither go fuck ourselves until that time I don't know I do know one scientist and she's telling me to stay the fuck home business mmm I knew no I dunno three four people work in emergency rooms that have told me it's not a fucking pretty place no my brother's a cop in the marina in a hospital and he says that it's a fucking nightmare that you have to sort them out a and B and B is if you have kidney itis and a is if you have Quran Verona they say it's a fucking nightmare right because you gotta think the same amount of people are still getting injured yes and certain other stuff so Mercy's coming in hope is coming in they're not corona ships yeah they don't want no corona people doing that they just want fucking you know they're bringing in a ship with a thousand beds there's fucking these goddamn cruise ships you want to talk about a petri dish stuck on a metal craft in the middle of the ocean breathe in recirculated air with a bunch of people partying around you is the ocean and if you fall in you're dead because they don't scoop anybody out when do they ever turn the ship around scoop somebody out when they fall overboard did you ever go on those cruise shit oh no chance for comics that was always a death sentence I made a mistake no when I was 21 with a chick no one of the cruise ship the one that used to go around Manhattan so you leave at 6 o'clock and you're back at 6:00 in the morning and they take out far enough so you can gamble yeah a blackjack I did that one one time nice but I knew I wasn't gonna do it again got out of my system I'll only go on a fucking cruise ship yeah there's economic I hate you hate to say this is a comedian amongst us it's a death the death sentence for me they have additional work I do gotta say though the fucking Impractical Jokers those guys did a tour on a bus I mean on a boat apparently everybody loved it so it's like if you get your fans in there right a rare thing right yeah there's people that could pull that off yeah yeah well Alonso goes on jazz too he doesn't does jazz cruises you know Londo Bowdoin Alonzo Bodden is a serious jazz fan loves jazz music loves him I love him to death he's always been the best Clippers fan before anybody even talked about the Clippers I ride a motorcycle everywhere yeah that motherfucker badass bike yeah he's got a bunch of bikes one BMWs mm-hmm but he was a Clippers fan when they were all 192 he was down it by himself at Castel Alonso now he's living like a doctor he's fucking yelling soon as they got climbing I was happy just for a long time that's how much I love Alonzo that I was happy just for a while everybody nobody has a beef with Alonzo nobody no why would you first little break-in ass she's giant his fucking hands a ginormous he's a sweetheart he's a sweetheart he doesn't even know I could break him baby never you'd never know that he's 6 foot 4 250 pounds solid muscle or whatever the fuck he is he's a tank of a man but he's just he's hilarious too he's he got he he's a dude it's got great points like here's one of his lines he said he goes not every Trump supporters racist but every racist is a trump supporter there's not a whole lot of racist voting for Biden I mean maybe a few they can't let that guy run for president they have to put his op he's gone you have to see these recent videos have you seen it Jamie and then you fucking killed Bernie Sanders you basically killed Bernie sighs they can't read that Porter you put the kiss of death bottom cocksucker oh my god Julie or the Puerto Rican chick oh shut up okay she oh oh she's a Puerto Rican chick that that she was 28 years old she won't show thanks to riches congresswoman she's like fucking I won't talk to him because the Joe Rogan backed them well it's not instead they used a video of me to support their campaign to say that I endorsed them and then they took a bunch of my bits and they took a bunch of things we said on the podcast high as fuck out of context and made it look like I was some right-wing monster make them like I'm some sort of homophobe it's and then they use the trans folk thing from that the variety that you still yeah man yeah if you don't know the story used to be a man for 30 years became a woman for two and then started beating the fuck out of women without telling them that her whole life she had been a man up until recently she just thought it was a medical condition that she didn't have to reveal and I got mad domestic violence yeah it's crazy it's it should be criminal to not tell somebody they mean the idea that you're the same thing as a biological woman is just not fact it's not scientific fact and yeah I said a bunch of horrible shit about her that she's a not even horrible shit that she I just said mean things that she's a man like you're a man you can't you can't just go fight he said the truth yes that's why I did I said the truth and I said I'll have a lot of friends but here's the thing I'm a guy that I support bull riding okay I support if you're a woman you want to fight a man I support it but you gotta let that person know that you're a man you if you used to be a man you got to let him know if you wanna if a woman wants to fight a biological man right now a guy with his balls and she wants to do it and they and he wants to do it and they sign off on it you could skydive why can't you do that they're both the same wait go ahead I don't think you should if you're my friend if you're a woman and you're my friend I'd be like there's too many physical advantages it's too dangerous all they have to do is hit you once you said they don't have to be as skillful as you if they clip you you're fucked and that's the truth that's what happens I mean it's a giant advantage doesn't mean the woman can't win because Germaine de random II actually had a kickboxing fight with a man and knocked him the fuck out that went that lady's a beast the Iron Lady from Holland she's a beast but she's a former UFC featherweight fucking champion of the world means she's an animal that lady and had a real close fight with Amanda Nunez recently for the bantamweight title she's a one of the best fighters on earth and she beat a man and knocked him out but you shouldn't fight a man if you don't know it's a man that's rude and if you didn't know that someone used to be a man that's rude too so they tried to pretend that I'm not this transphobic Crusader I love all people I literally love all people I don't care what you are whether you're gay or straight or Asian or black or white or I don't care I don't care I just if you're nice I'm nice to you that's I'm a hundred percent open to everybody but I'm not gonna bullshit you can't fight women if you used to be a man and not tell them it's so ridiculous that that's that's even a debatable subject like I had a bit about it where I said never do it I think as a society we could get to a point where someone would say hey man I don't think it's cool if you get your dick removed and then beat the fuck out of chicks and people be like you're out of line that's where God that's where it god we got so overly progressive in the the fight to do the right thing we got to write that script about a guy who falls in love with a girl it turns out she's a man she's really hot you're still into her do you really care it's a good question ya know that's what some people don't care some people ugh I don't give a fuck I'm right or die with you Hugo when you're alone with them her in public yeah man it's um in the fight to do the right thing and that's what what's going on with progressives when they get overly progressive they think they're fighting to do the right thing but you have to be able to call out shit that's wrong on your side and this is one of the problems that the Democratic Party's having right now with this Joe Biden guy you guys got to be able to call it out you can't let this slide cuz everybody else sees it and Trump is going to eat him alive he's gonna eat that guy alive the guy can barely remember what he's talking about while he's talking do you know which one it was cuz there's a few videos there's a few of them play any of them they're all Rick they're all crazy every video of him recently talking he's stumbling through shit he forgets what he's talking about we should be making those masks we should be moving on those ventilators we can do that why doesn't he just act like a president that's a stupid way to say sorry he's done no no I probably best I don't he's like Junior soprano yeah it's not that's the that's not even the worst example that's just an example the one down there when he's talking to that lady I think that one was a struggle too that was a struggle fest and people at home are you at all concerned as Trump says yeah this is it not let the Cure be worse than the problem itself we have to take care of the cure that will make the problem worse no matter what no matter what we know what has to be done we know you have to reassess the recommended period yeah see he doesn't know what he's talking about when he's talking and this is not like this I'm looking at this like a medical condition okay I'm looking at this like okay when I'm calling a fight and I see a guy limping and I'm like I think he heard his name Thiago Santos against John John's I think he hurt his knee there I think there's something going on with his knee like that's what I'm looking at this I'm looking at this like this is a medical issue that's not a normal way to communicate unless he's high as fuck because if I was high I'd be like I don't know what I just said to this lady blasted or edibles going what are we even talking about I don't think that's what it is I think he's he's oh he's very old I think he can't he doesn't look good either and they got makeup on him his skin is all pulled tight like a lizard he's got the button Governor Cuomo that's I loved his behavior I loved his attitude so fuck and he's been honest and I'm telling you if less you're a fucking idiot just go to any street corner in New York you know looking fucking footage from July light it's too many it's too many people it's to go I couldn't even think about get on a ferry gonna either Rudy's like I was staying somewhere on Park Avenue and I'm like I gotta get into an uber which I'm fuckin filthy okay when you walk into an uber people are sitting in cars with the windows shut breathing whatever he's breathing yep I open up the car and listen you guys are you gonna get in yeah give it a minute and then take my handy wipe out and lower the window and close the fucking door but why not it when I get on the ferry I stand outside I don't sit in there I breed that Hudson River and that's good for you that's as good as it's gonna get affected all those bodies and shit floating in there that fucking maluca dust in there and pollution whatever the fuck is in there but I know look at within weeks Teaneck right t-mac was one that got contaminated a Fort Lee got it you know that's all my fucking neighborhood dog I don't think nobody Hoboken was really bad Hoboken come the cops out of going there fuck Hoboken was like a party my call Balkan didn't give a fuck like they were fuckin just having orgies in Hoboken Geno told me you got to say it really so they finally had to go down and they closed Oh bulken like you weren't a lot to go into Hoboken only people who lived in Hoboken good party in Hoboken then they just had a fuckin to shut it down somebody had a meme on their page but it might have been Darnell I forget who what no madman snoop I don't remember who it was but anyway they had a meme on their page that said you tell people you're gonna put them in jail if they go out after 8:00 p.m. but you're letting people out of jail early cuz they got the corona virus and there's someone going hmm like what like what the fuck what are you saying are you gonna lock people up but you're letting people out you know if if you looked at this whole thing there's been some weird people of God test they got tests I think I tested there's been some weird I don't even his Bahamas fuck who mr. bike it just his business whatever his fucking name is angels Elba yeah the black dude that got shot well he lives in England and he got tested because he was in contact with other people that had it you know why the fuck that Harvey got a test cuz he's in Rikers and Rikers has a massive outbreak no yes yeah he's in Rikers he's in maximum security he's in Buffalo now do they move into that because of the corona he's in a hospital in Buffalo he's fired he's fucked he probably has no will to live you know I mean he probably doesn't have a will to get through this I mean I don't know what kind of medical treatment they're gonna give him but this could do him in easily it's running rampant he's so sick already you look at the guy he can barely walk his health is deteriorating all that the stress from this trial killed him crushed him took 20 years off his life instantly this is just a death sentence why don't you I was just saying we were talking about this yesterday imagine if you came up to him four years ago and said I want to show you your future dying in a bed in prison for things you've already done right now you're walking around toast of the town getting in limos climbing out people are waving to you and cheering you're getting interviewed on the carpet everyone shouts you out I just want to thank Harvey Weinstein for his amazing amazing company and the movies you put together that allowed me to shine yeah how many people have you seen all the people that that praised him and then four years later imagine that he thinks the things he's already done he'd already done them at that point and they knew why they were praised I wonder what they knew they knew they knew scumbag selling it they know yeah you got to assume they all know so what the fuck yeah they went back they knocked on doors wait a second so I rape you you go to that party what do you mean so I raped you at a party now the next year is gonna be another can festival and you're gonna show up again because they wanted to work see the thing about Harvey is apparently this is Whitney Cummings take on it she said he would actually give them the things he would tell them he would give them so he'd say hey you fuck my dick I'm gonna make you a star and you would actually do it he would actually put them in these movies he would give them what so they were happy so they would get all this treatment and they haven't spent some a long time with him every now and then so they would send him emails lovey-dovey emails but really they hated him and that's when all this came out he didn't even see it comment cuz he thought that they loved him he thought that they would send him these emails so he sent the emails to the press like look look at all these emails these girls love me even though he had done scumbag shit to them it's just he had it set up where this was how you got by this is how you made movies this is how you want to be famous this is how you get famous I can help you get famous you got to help me get rid of some come today everyone I thank everyone did all the guys do really every guy because he will feel real intractable apparently oh I don't know man one of the people said the producer did not have symptoms and was under close observation was not clear why he had been tested on you there's a lot of shit that don't sound right to me they don't give listen in vick's are the last people they care about yeah alright and the only problem you have with those things you could really sue the state like I got locked up when HIV was starting to get popular 87 88 so as soon as I got to my destination they had already built an HIV unit that was fucking state-of-the-art facility everybody else lived like a fucking Momo the HIV guys live like kings microwave ovens TVs yeah they let them get microwaves oh they had everything in there how come their own refrigerator because they didn't want their food they didn't really know oh yeah yeah of the HIV so they had their own thing they had an old cook that came in and cooked for the six guys in that unit so you never know I don't understand that must have contributed so much to homophobia but okay when you not in jail I mean in the world you know during the AIDS crisis what do you mean homophobia in the world during the AIDS crisis when AIDS was was out when it was a big deal I mean I was almost too young to remember because I was like 21 when it was happening I was still a kid but I mean the people that were already inclined towards hate and gay people and then there's a disease that everyone's terrified of that you get through sex that could kill you and it affects gay people disproportionately 83-82 those were tough years you know they even made a good phenomenal movie about it called and the band played on mmm with Richard Gere and a bunch of great actors they Richard Gere played the guy that the fucking the guy that's a choreographer that did a bunch of plays I can't remember his name oh yeah he played him in a in like a weird manner and they everybody in that movie was a movie star it was a phenomenon worried about age at HIV HIV really started with a stewardess a male stewardess that would take flights from France or Italy or England ones don't quote me but let's just go with France to New York he would come to me fuck somebody from the plane then go to the studio 54 and get his dick sucked and then go right back to England and he kept doing that it was all sex with the same stewardess really if you watch watch that and the band played on people forget about that was gonna put that out in this week I never saw

Stallone puts him in all his movies now he's always old and all the Sylvester Stallone's movies but this guy's name is in fact that black dude so when I came to the store this was one of my favorite movies of all time it's a guy it's a movie about a guy who hits a lottery ticket in New York City he wins the New York state lottery ticket the first lottery ticket of all times true story that actor in real life one that guy on the run right there yeah he's the one that's a Vinny today's your lucky day yeah my name is Carmine fuck oh he was he's also that what do you think I stole that line from

daddy Murphy's going to rob he's had great with the scenes like he had that one with Beverly with and then he was in Midnight Run with when fucking they've made the Niro go look for the guy the guy

Australian Anthony Lombardi is he really yeah he's Australian that's amazing yeah he's Australian they're so good at doing our accent yeah he's tremendous so they let him be the lead dan al played the fall he played the brother they still let him be in the movie got a great role you had a great role the Italian woman that's an airy movie played the mom I don't even know what the point of the

Redd Foxx oh my god this is such a good movie get that picture I refuse to go see this movie I'm like this is just black exploitation it's so fuckin brilliant this movie have you seen Dolomites yes I haven't seen it the new Dolomites I heard it's amazing I think it's amazing I heard it's amazing I think it's him I think he did a great job and just he says one line that movie I tell you that I love I fell in love I had tears coming out of my eyes he's an open mic man and he's fucking dying to make it and you know how we are and one of us comes up to you later Joe you know like he's right I think I'm gonna do this and the other committee was like man he is a bum and he you know like when you're at that when you're an open mic and you really can't and he was walking away and he said Thomas to somebody goes it's gonna be alright and Eddie Murphy does not hey man there's nothing worse than having something to sell them nobody to sell it to and it made me feel like an open mic because that's what you feel like when you're an open mic yeah you get but nobody sell its it do you member that feeling when you'd watch someone on stage and the crowd was packed and you just wished you could get up there right now and that's I'm trying to do right now I'm trying to reform during the break yeah I even wrote the story out of how I like I was lost and my ex-wife fucking forced my hand and drove me to the Comedy Works in Denver and how I got offstage and I was like this is it and I'm like but the only obstacle has a wife and a kid we just bought a condo how old were you 28 it stole my soul like it just like I didn't want to go to work no more nothing else mattered the only thing I loved as much as doing comedy was cocaine like nothing else I just like cocaine and stand-up comedy and I couldn't figure out how to do them and make a living and pay for a family then she came home after three months issues he want to be married no more and part of me was 80% relieved him the other 20 I wanted to be a father and the whole thing but it's a truth I fell in love with it it fucking just stole my soul like I didn't I knew everything they had I watched every tape I studied Carlin I studied the shit out of Pryor I studied the fuck out of dice I studied the fuck out of Bill Hicks you know I loved or ex you know I watched today I'm before I came up here I was in a rabbit hole cuz I took my daughter for a walk and I sat down from it to get them a drink to send some emails and Rodney Dangerfield was on The Tonight Show the week before easy money and he said that uh he still he said joking The Tonight Show and I was laughing I thought it was funny he says he drinks so much he pissed on house a night that was on the other night Caddyshack oh the beginning was on I watched that far that's a great movie so like this vacation whatever the fuck is going on it has been rough on me at all the first week was rough on me before st. Patty's Day when I thought I had to fly to New York was rough on me I already had a plan already in mind I'm coming back from New York and I'm just staying at home I'm hiding like a motherfucker that was my plan for how long I do not know Joe if he says the 18th I'm not still going out for 20 I have a 4:20 show yeah I'm for 20 show in Vancouver but it's on the 18th or 420 420 Monday night Monday yeah that's not happening I don't see how it can happen unless they come up with some sort of cure in ten days I mean it's the 25th unless somewhere around the first week of April they have a cure that's not gonna happen yeah I mean there's there's some hope to some treatments that they're coming up with there's no cure right now there's no vaccine it's not even close your way plus how big is this place that you doing I'm doing an arena and what how do you feel doing it like do you feel I don't want to put anybody at risk okay if if people can go to the show and have a good time and not be at risk I would love to do it's a weird man if the flu was going around I know this is worse than the flu but if the flu was going around we wouldn't think twice of doing a show it's what's so weird about this it's like it is absolutely more deadly than the flu don't miss read what I'm saying but it's just so crazy how different our approaches to this as approach to anything else that winds up killing people you know we've all known people that have died from a disease diseases there they kill people all the time but we've never been in a situation where everybody's scared of one disease it's so strange man it's so strange and I don't think I could be able to get past that and just do a show right now I'm 90% sure they're gonna cancel it I mean the the stuff that they're coming up with for treatment one of them is a malarial disease and old malaria disease there's some other different treatments that hold hope and but there's so many people man that could get infected if you've got a show of 12,000 13,000 people whatever it is how the fuck are you gonna make sure those people are okay is it your responsibility do you say come at your own risk you know I mean what if you get it when you're there like what are we doing what are we doing you know I mean well it's the whole thing's crazy it's I think it's gonna be a long time before we feel comfortable doing shows again it's gonna be strange at first you know but I'd also think when the dust settles it will settle hopefully unless this is the first thing that falls and then all those other things fall into place we talked about natural disasters and we're gonna appreciate peace we're gonna appreciate freedom you can appreciate being a roam around do whatever you want go out at three o'clock at night you're gonna you gonna appreciate it you can appreciate being able to go to a diner and have breakfast with your friend the two o'clock in the morning and laugh you can appreciate it cars on the street everybody acting normal it's gonna mean more to you now it's like the Sun after a rainy day it means more feels better has more of an impact and I think we've gone through a long stretch in this country where everything was static everything was doing fairly well we were on an upward trend no real tragedy national nationally to change the way we live our life other than September 11 so we got like September 11th and then all these years of war of course crime of course always say but we're basically business as usual for most folks not anymore is a wake-up call it's a wake up call that you have a finite amount of time in this life and this life the way you're experiencing it right now it's this is just how it is right now there's a million different factors that are in play constantly and you've been real lucky this stretch of peace and harmony but that shit could change at any moment it really could and we got to use this time to be nicer to each other we're gonna use this time to realize that we got we got a little confused we got crazy you know everybody's just trying to acquire things and everybody's trying to you know move their way up the corporate ladder like hey there's there's a fucking end to this ride okay this ride comes to a stop someday and it doesn't matter how much shit you've acquired it doesn't matter you know how far you got up this ladder you know what what position of prominence you have in the community and how you're respected by the business world nobody gives a fuck when you're dead it's not you're gonna die we're together right now experiencing this thing in this like really distracted way the thing comes into focus when you're forced into a situation like like we are now where you literally are nervous about your survival then the thing comes into focus and you're what to me my gratitude is coming to focus my gratitude towards my friends my gratitude towards my family my gratitude towards you know look we were very fortunate that we're not living check to check you know many of us and many of us have been in the comedy community many as many of us are now there's a lot of guys listening to this right now that we're hoping for these weekend's coming up so they could pay their rent this is uncharted territory for those folks and all of us that are experiencing this but the people that going check to check they're the ones are really getting hit know that you cannot stress over this and not that your stress makes you get sick yeah weakens your immune system we are work you know and I know 50% of people are being honest you know my friend said that they yanked them the other day for the cable you know cable doesn't give a fuck so they show this cable off they will they call them and tell them they were shutting this cable because I had the money I didn't have no problem with it my wife just we have to pay this so they're just jumping on people right away yeah they jump on you right away so yeah they didn't want a stack I don't know how landlords gonna be I had another friend who said this is really funny Oh God divorced ten years ago close to eleven years ago there was a dispute with one of the credit cards during the divorce 4,200 bucks coming out of the fucking woodwork yeah chasing down cold cases cold case isn't shit like that yeah they realize a big effort whatever money you have if you didn't pay your student loan they might yank it now just jack it from you yeah I'd say we had to do this right so be very fucking careful you're right you know all right and you think about it that way who knows what the fuck they're gonna do they're telling you on TV yeah this landlord isn't gonna care first off listen if you can't do business I can't take your rent money but Who am I gonna put in there anyway who called you this morning incidentally gone to look for a location for a business and if you have two brains in your head you're not doing anything right now no you know buying the house unless is your business like unless you drop and buy houses for a living even if you do you'd be like let's hold on here nothing for the next six or seven weeks you don't know dick I've never even thought about the China thing I didn't read that article but that was even enlightening but you don't know dick mind your business you don't got it I don't have to fly nowhere do you understand me yeah I'd like to go anyway I got Brea the first week of June I got Indianapolis and Cleveland somewhere in there and June that's it I got nothing July July 31st I got Las Vegas who knows what's gonna happen there and August 1st I'm in San Diego who knows who knows of any of those days I'm being smart about this listen so what you mean to tell me is that motley crew who was supposed to start a huge tour in August Guns and Roses who were supposed to start massive tour in June they're all pushing their stuff back to October and November December I mean when Live Nation thinks about giving that motley crue money back they have a heart attack they have a heart attack there I know yeah well hold on to this you know cuz it's August I talked to salami he talks to what's-his-name Ricki I think it's August that they go on tour so what are you telling me that right after people a lot to go out people gonna start going out and spending money right away I don't think so guy I don't think so they're evaluating every day we're not at work every week that we lose the width of that 1200 I'll check that tomorrow that's what one I'll check is basically gonna get people groceries I think that right now like where we're real touch-and-go but shows the rest of the world right China's touch-and-go everywhere is touch-and-go everywhere Italy certainly touch-and-go they still got their streets locked down you know who knows what they're singing that night they don't give a fuck just singing like no then New York's got act like gay people they got a fuckin sing Yellow Submarine more sing war pigs bitch this is New York this is the boogie down bronx what are you singing Yellow Submarine for is shit for mellow submarine yeah all right you know what's killing me the most about this there's one thing about not wanting to go out and do commie there's another thing that you can't go out right okay I'm the Captain Kirk of the enterprise you know what man I gotta get out of house every three nights so if not somebody's gonna get stabbed you know that even a belly room show I don't give a fuck there's always something for us to do you know how long anything is gonna be I guess honest what I'm seeing today by what I wants in the news last night I think for me to go back on stage it'll be May first I don't know when I'll be on another plant again don't-don't-don't yeah it's all guesswork right now we've really really have no idea how is your focus been on writing have you been focused enough to really write the best stuff you've been writing right now no yeah no okay I've written it all okay I haven't written at all while this is going on I'm winging I'm tried I've tried to write I've written jokes they're like you know the funny thing was like last week they had that poor little white kid that the rosy cheeks mm-hmm he's like you could tell that dude never got a D in his life you see that video you know this is doctor yeah yeah this is our turn in Florida you know yeah like I had to write about shit like that like yeah everybody's mad at that kid jump that's me right that was me and my EP maybe one eighteen year olds yeah can you imagine come up to me and 81 and gone where's the coronavirus I would have snorted we're here to party I want to take give me a line that coronavirus watch nothing happens to it give me two lines I guarantee you you know so it's all different that could have been us that kid was a dumb as a fucking stump did you see that poor his parents must be like Jesus we fucked up with that dummy this one girl was like is my birthday turn up oh my god there was like 20 little chicks are doing that fucking me breaking heart dance to each other ones breath oh I was fucking dying that's hilarious the achy-breaky heart dance yeah whatever I don't know what dance is don't quote me the fifth grade type shit goddamn so I don't know what the fuck's going on you're always gonna have that with kids though kids are gonna fuck they're 18 years old they're gonna fuck they're going out they have a couple drinks in them they got plastic cups they're gonna fart what about the dude who took his certainly and he got the fucking herp when he was over there he ain't they Bono Mack so now they're both busted disgusted he took his mistress to fuckin Italy to do something and they both got the Corona oh yeah and they got detained over there somewhere something up Oh cats out of the bag mama file for fuckin divorce she's got nowhere to spend the money fuckin Manhattan shut down yeah there's nowhere to go in the world like the UFC's talking about putting on a fight on April 18th you know I don't know how they're gonna do that I don't know if they're gonna be able to do that in the United States they're talking about doing it in a place with less than ten people and then you know they're just an open arena I guess someone's gonna commentate it it's not gonna be me and they're gonna be duking it out like in an empty place and they're gonna try to do that on the 18th they did it for the last card in Brazil because it was ordered by the government the government ordered all large gatherings to break up when they started seeing the cases of Corona rising in Brazil so they had to do the Brazil card indoors no people weird so but they're gonna plan could be Antonio this way they're gonna plan it so it doesn't even have to be a big place they could do did it like a film studio like legitimately they could sit they could set this up in a film studio somewhere I mean they could Tyler Perry's got a place in Florida they could good on a Florida rent one of Tyler Perry's gigantic film studios set up I mean we did it in when we did fight for the troops when they did yeah yeah San Diego and several other places in Austin as well whenever we did it there's a few birth carrying there 'he's a few different ones that we did they just would use an airplane hangar and the troops be there that they would be the whole audience was the troops in their uniforms and they would set up this octagon in an airplane hangar and it was pretty powerful it's different different real different different kind of show but they could do that they could do that in a studio or just a large warehouse UFC could do it set up some lights have some crazy high-speed hook up to the Internet well it's party notes getting uploaded and we're watching it from here I mean that they could definitely do that the UFC has the capability of doing that the thing is how they're gonna make sure that nobody has it you know you're gonna have to test everybody and if someone has it do you let them fight like what if they have it and they're like Idris Elba they have no symptoms but they got the corona like what if khabib as the corona or what if toni has the corona just khabib you can fight him this fight is so fucking cursed there's places I gotta be honest with you I gotta be honest with you I already that's one of the first things I thought of would say started talking then they started talking about the NBA game can feels this is why Dana's trying so hard to make it happen even if there's only ten people in a row at first for a couple of days that was mad at Dana my fucking day now I go you know what this fight has to happen this I don't care if this happens by itself in a fucking airport in Havana Cuba mmm I don't give a fuck but this fight has to get over with we've waited so long how many cancellations three quite a few three for you this is the fourth time three or four I think this is the fourth hospital visits broken me yeah anxiety might be the fifth this might be the fin oh I think so yes I this fucking curse google it how many times has Toni versus could be been canceled I'm gonna say I think this is the fifth time it's many times though and it's the best fight then they they kept giving you know first the NBA then the next tested positive yeah then the fucking city of New York went under and I'm like all no everything's pointing in the wrong direction I go but don't have Vegas then Vegas said then I fucking March 20 this is the fifth it's the fifth I walk in time come on this has to happen it is the Phi don't care about any other quite just pay them Dana just pay them just one fight just pay them one for I'll pay the paper don't warm ups I'll pay the 6950 pay-per-view just to see khabib and get it over with could you imagine that's it nobody nobody else has to fight 6900 one fight one two three trainers in each corner that walked in eight yeah one guy and we'll you'll put the fucking judges they watch from home listen that terrible one there there they tell me one of their terrible win that ass yes I'm gonna help them be in there you often times you honestly you get a better view of what's going on when you're watching at home okay so yeah especially headphones on so when I watch with headphones because I'm watching like when I look down at the screen sometimes when I'm watching fights I have to sometimes I get a better view I can't see what the fuck is going on there's pillars in front of me you guys are grappling and I don't know if someone's trying to get a submission or what's happening sometimes guys tap and I didn't even see it was like what did he what do you do I don't have to like break it down then I have to look at it on the screen when you're watching at home often times you have you really have a better view of it but this is doesn't it's not as crazy alright so we we don't need them they're within social distancing we already here you could put them in a fuck judges can all come right here I'm gonna look over the shoulder come right here and then so all we need is the three guys in the corner yeah two fighters the ref Bruce Buffer test Bruce Buffer Bruce Buffer he could do a long distance no no no he's gonna do with a gas mask on Bruce Buffer was gonna be in there red face with a fucking school but helmet on does it have to be pay-per-view do you think cuz there's no class for it of course it does really know what are you a communist no socialists trying to get fuckin free show same time you're talking about passing on stimulus checks how are you the UFC wants money I'm sir how are you gonna get people to pay for you're gonna get plenty of people like I said you know what saying I Jamie wants everything to be somebody fucking loses here so you gotta be a douchebag somebody loses her because how am I gonna put all this there's three or four prelims five free limbs and then for fights before that so I'm talking ten fights I'm talking twenty people three per whatever their trainers that's a lot of people Joe in one fucking place of winner so it can't we got to eliminate their early prelims and just do the main card they could do that but everybody also I'd have to test everybody everybody can not share a space either I cannot be in this room with you all Romero without throwing a sidekick because he's about to fight but if everybody's tested and everyone's negative then who gives a shit that should be the only thing like if you're testing your negative but you should be able to wander around I think this motherfucker is a creepy motherfucker the virus yeah I think you're right I think we're gonna find out more I think that could be a 21 day something I'm somebody waiting hear about what about the people who got stuck at Texas Airport last week four hours of the luggage when they came back internationally there was O'Hare to Ohio last week nobody's testing positive from waiting on line eight hours yeah if you go on Twitter everybody who's dying is from functions of the coronavirus right and you can join a virus you had it going that line so I got to see how long this could really stay two weeks ago they were saying the stamp the air droplets stay in the air for fucking three hours now I don't think they have a lot of reliable information yet they have some they know what it is that snack have you seen the corona virus on the rap song no I got it on my Instagram page you haven't seen it no great these guys it's really catchy I started I start singing it throughout the day sometimes I'm driving around what you're doing it for me no I'll play it for you I have to play it can't even play it now and one get a copyright strike will play it afterwards this is the world we're living in I think people are less less worried about bullshit right now more worried about real things I think in that sense some of my favorite people that I've ever met are people from Israel something about them they like carefree my friend Shuki he was a kick boxing trainer in Tarzana Majuro gym and Tarzana nice to go down and train with him there and he was from Israel and I went to eat dinner at his house once he invited me over his house was family and there playing bongo drums dancing and shit they were having so much fun they were so happy and I said tell me this I go why why're Israeli so like carefree it goes because every day over there you can die every day over there you can die he goes any day something can happen and he goes everybody just while you're alive you want a party party party have fun have fun have a good time and I was like wow that's it they have a heightened sense of appreciation of life like my friends all my Jewish friends that would go over there for whatever religious thing they would go would talk about how hot Israeli chicks were like the chicks in Israel they're wild while and they all have to go to the army oh yes he was stuck that was the old show they got stuck there while fucking missiles were flying - what the fuck is that that's right that's right yeah yeah it's uh we got we were looking for trouble instead of trouble being here our life was so soft we were looking for trouble where it didn't exist we were trying to create problems where they weren't they weren't real we were getting outraged about things that really didn't matter and now we see what matters so now that focus has to be on real real survival things and health and community and taking care of each other and looking out for the people that don't have any money right now because they're not lazy they just got fucked you know we got to look out for each other right though all those things coming into focus now instead of the nonsense that people have been fo what you eating there what is that okay I thought it was aspirin or ibuprofen I was gonna say don't take that shit why not shouldn't take that shit right now ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and it can do damage to your gut bacteria apparently you can fuck with your immune system what ibuprofen it's advil stuff like that's good if you're you know you need it if you're injured right but it has an effect on your your your gut biome and it causes inflammation on some people cam Hanes was on that shit every day he was taking 800 milligrams every day and he was in all this pain and I sent him this Rhonda Patrick thing where she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and and taking large doses of it particularly like all the time and so he gets off of it he's like fuck like there's danger of stroke see if you can find the dangers of taking too much ibuprofen because there's a lot of people that really get into that I'd be prolonged I take a baby aspirin at night that's fine that's it that night I think yeah I go to bed because so I'll be protected between 5:30 and 12 which is the highest rate of having heart issues ibuprofen is very different than what so you know cam runs like 20 miles of the FDA strengthens warnings that non-steroidal anti-inflammatories increase heart attack and stroke risk yeah that's that's like Advil it's non-steroidal anti-inflammatories there's a bunch of different ones motrin advil naproxen Aleve ibuprofen yeah that's ibuprofen and naproxen so two different types of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen they're both available over-the-counter and he said it's important to be aware of the ibuprofen warnings and the proxy warnings and take steps to limit the risk so cam was on 800 milligrams that shit a day right he's in pain all the time because he runs so much gets off of it and the pain goes away so he's taking something for pain and it's causing him to be in pain all the time because it is causing all this inflammation because his gut is reacting to this fucking chemical he keeps dumping in there and it's a vicious cycle because you've got all this inflammation and that's what's causing you to take the shit and the shit is giving you the inflammation and he's thinking the inflammation is coming from his running so he gets off of it no more pain like god damn we're so ignorant so my initial guys who's an elite athlete means the guy who runs ultra marathons he's run as much as 240 miles in one race right and he didn't know like how many regular folks know that this stuff is bad for you how many regular folks take unnecessary medication that could be beneficial to you if you have a real issue but he take it all the time he'd take it too much and actually causes problems this is a wake-up call for people when it comes to your health a wake-up call for taking care of your meat vehicle take care of your body you got to take care of your body this is one that if you're fortunate and you have a strong immune system you you can mitigate some of the effects of it and that's the case with the common cold it's the case with the flu it's case with a lot of different things if you're healthier you have a better chance of coming out of it on the other end you know moving on the flu shot never so I just found out recently that I could take it doesn't work as good on older people though no we asked dr. Auster homeless I can never take it gonna has needles involved you could touch I would love to do heroin once in a while but to get really high and I was a needle that's where you throw me the fuck out that's where the party ends me once you say needle that's where it ends for me so done yeah um you got a great joke about that I want to say it right now what's that you about needing a flu shot but it really is the truth that it is I've just I think the immune system we've we flown so much we have flown so much yeah that that bills different type of immune cells we did like at the Chicago theater and giant places where we took pictures with people after the show hundreds of people you know I just did the Treasure Island sold it out and took pictures of everybody else's show that's a lot of people went back up to my room and took a tremendous hot hot boiling shower you know the last time I was at the store I always take a shower before I go to the store mm-hmm the last time I won April 2nd yeah I was probably the first time in years I took a shower that night that's how disturbed I was like I was fucking really disturbed from that last time I was at the store yeah because I thought everybody else was going to be social distancing more people grabbed me that night than ever before and every time they grabbed me or somebody came up to me and talked to me my skin was crawling I'm like I'm not coming down here for a while yeah there's no social distance an thirst or no so I was following any rules over there I was like man this is my fucking spot but now look not him live without which is crazy you're not gonna live without and that helps sometimes like I said not doing comment I give it a breather and or not being able to do County two different fucking things yeah I can't wait to get onstage I have a ton to say you know we all do the last fucking four weeks we've made ourselves laugh and now we lose our fucking minds yeah I'm one of the reasons why I haven't written anything is cuz I'm just enjoying the relaxing me too it's been too long we've been doing this too long but and the last run this last nine years has been a run it's implied cast well once you started really school you started really kicking ass on the road - yeah you really picked up your pace you got it yeah you got it gotta make hay while the Sun shinin as they say no but you got it you got it right there's a car you got a right well I felt like um with this I wanted to think about it because I look I'm I'm one of the you know I love one thing that max Holloway always says says it is what it is and it's a simple philosophy it is what it is but it's also it's a good way of looking at things it's like what are you gonna do you're gonna freak out it's not gonna change it it is what it is and this was this what it is right now it is what it is we're inside all day you know if we go outside we go outside for a hike there's no people there you know come here stay away from everybody no hugging no kissing everybody just distance and we do our social distancing and we wait it out and just this is life right now we're still lucky we're still not look Justin ran comes here a couple times a year after he gets back from the Congo okay and Justin goes over the Congo he sleeps in a grass hut and he's come back with so many different fucking diseases he's got malaria three times now we have so here's some new parasite that they don't they haven't identified they don't know what it is he's worried it's in his brain because he's having some shakes and some chills and some some issues that lead him to think that it's connected to whatever the fuck this parasite is so they keep running tests on him they have these top biology virologists that are examining him but he's deep deep deep deep deep in the Congo so who knows what the fuck's in there there might be some new shit in there he might literally have some new shit in his body right now and you know this guy keeps going back he goes back because he's compelled he's his his mission in life is to improve the lives of all these people that he met there it's changed his perspective you know he's an amazing amazing person and he's constantly doing that like that guy is so happy and so friendly and I think one of the reasons why is because his perspective like he knows what it's like where these people live he visits them he stays with them for months at a time he knows what it's like and he knows how lucky we are over here we're lucky as fuck so right now we can't do stand-up you and I are extremely fortunate we have podcasts you know so you could just do your podcast instead of what do you do it two days a week do it three do it three you probably you'll be fine you little give playing chances to rant rave I only have people over the trust you know no one's sick don't touch anybody wipe everything down wash your hands take a lot of vitamin C eat healthy take all your vitamins make sure you get good rest get in a song if you can please get in a sauna they have them I mean I don't know if they have them at gyms fuck you can't go to gym good dick nobody's got a fucking soul get in there get in the hot tub then nobody knows where the fucking goal of a photo that everybody has a sauna if we have on your lies I got a cry I wish I could do a thousand things but you can't they were also saying one good thing just elevate your body temperature just elevate your body temperature like by working out and breaking a really good sweat you know the data actually has a good effect on your immune system as well even if you like exercise in a hot room you kick up your immune system you have to do anything crazy but what you're doing is you're you're introducing those cytokines those heat shock proteins where a bunch of layers and get a get a little decent workout and really get hot sweaty it's good for you all that stuff's good if if you look at like the first thing after benefits of working out it's always lowering your stress working on your blood pressure yeah this is the opposite this is the times right now a debilitating that yeah there were like if you went to a queue boy if I had the ability to acupuncture right now I know he'd tell me like oh all this shit is well they they make you grab the thing well this is low like all your chakras a block like shit like that all that shit is probably running low like you need help with your immune system yeah even though you haven't been doing much because just the subconscious thought that thoughts that we have now you know we start to say this shit goes deep into your subconscious that's what happened to me that's why I had my little nervous breakdown on the night that your Romero fought so tell me you had this is you were kind of getting into it you were your friend invites you over his house to watch the fights and you're like I can't and you had a breakdown having me over like Wednesday and I'm like absolutely if not I'm just gonna sit here at home and watch him by myself like I always do or I'll go to Brett's house all right you know Brett yeah right right that night he called me like on Wednesday he was really doing Saturday I'm getting a catered a couple people coming over love for you to come over he broke his leg skiing Oh No so when he break his leg skiing three months oh sorry oh oh no fucking metal in his leg no main dog so I was young crutches still yeah yeah he just got off maybe a week ago oh what a time to have just got off a fucking surgery when this shit is going down yeah you beat the surgery curve like by three weeks four weeks oh my god imagine I'm okay all day I'm with the family fucking six o'clock comes I gotta jump in the shower it's basically where he lives jump over a little Kang and make it right go a mile past the Comedy Store that's it for some reason man I wanted a shower in the shower I just started getting an irregular heartbeat I came out somewhat to the war anxiety medication got dressed what are you taking they give me a 0.25 whatever I don't take them what is it zanuck zanuck it's a football it's the baby want it's not the spics the junkies take its so you got a little anxiety so you took a xanax and so I took how often you take those things most of the time between you and me I wash them my wife washes them much as I put him in my drug pocket and you forget they're in there and I forget they're in there like prom in the hamper on the mire so between you and me I watched more than I and I only get like he gives me if I ask him he'll give them to me I asked him fine maybe two prescriptions a year you know so just keep him around just to keep him around just what does it do I've never done I just in case I get that Morgan Murphy freaked out I got Morgan Murphy freak what's her name what's her name Morgan Murphy yeah yeah I had a follower at the store I know what it was that fucking walked up the stairs and my anxiety lit up really I almost passed out but I went up there and destroyed the room I came out of a fog at the 13 minute mark I didn't know what a lot of my mouth I didn't know you wrong Zarek's or anxiety just things I did something up there and I just got this weird anxiety and I remember reaching over to Pauly Shore Polly can you go up there for me I can't do it fuck you I got so fucking mad and I went up there leveled it but I was in a coma I was Levi no no my body was so I had so much anxiety it was just I was just spewing I was like Roseanne Barr at night saying shit I was just talking when I got off the stage Pauly Shore told me you should get anxiety a lot more often I just worked myself up you know you work and I worked myself up that much that night I wanted to see your Romero I definitely want to see Joanna against Ching whatever whatever I was young I was young I wanted to see her so and all this another Joe Rogan it was I wasn't getting a stroke I was gonna take mushrooms and not eat them but I was gonna take mushrooms with me and my jacket how long you know I would have only within the car pulled the car the driveway what like six steps stop the car and then sat there for 10 minutes deciding whether I should take the mushrooms I'm gonna get stopped by the cops I had no idea bosom mean no nothing there was no reason for this paranoid it was just my mind playing tricks on me I started walking in the house thinking I was gonna about to have a stroke I couldn't control myself should I take the keys I know I forgot something you weren't I No let me go get the fucking xanax just in case I get a fucking shy bring an edible now I will bring edible yeah yeah probably go back inside and get it edible how is that that was my acting oh my gosh wear this shirt I should wear a different shirt anyway this year well I just went through this whole fucking and I finally said stop Joe Diaz get your shit together cock so this is when I turned your Diaz yeah Charlie's go let's go motherfucker we're gonna go let's go come on what are you fuckin Buzzi what are you fuckin pussy I got in that car that they're like mainly down okay I went over there he had some Yub for me with some Lobster mashed potatoes and shit and we just watched the fight we had a great time there was a dude that was turning me on to medical shit telling me the fucking inhale silver Oh block the fucking block the fuckin thing yeah yeah it was great but you know what that night I realized I was just having a fucking this can't happen no more hmm that's the type of shit I like to avoid I don't like that I said the first time I got high I took another bone with the jujitsu and somebody mounted me by mouth please get off please please please get off me please I had to go outside take my gear off and take my dick out and pee in the street as far as my bar that's how bad yeah I got a pee right away it's like when I go lift on Mondays and Thursdays I go live for the train when she puts 400 on the swamp machine and I got a fucking squat as soon as I put the back I gotta go babe she's like what are you going I go my body just wanted to shock my body just wanted to shock that's how you could tell and when I gotta go I gotta go my first three months in jujitsu I learned the hard way never take an animal no bueno don't be taking a Hannibal at 10:00 in the morning go Jiu Jitsu at 6:00 it comes back hmm even if it's gone it revisits you the first time somebody threw a mountain me dog had one of those heavy judo Jesus hmm I didn't even know the lightweight geese yet oh my god Joe Rogan's I had a call a time out like it was over had a run outside take my chi almighty top off and just take my dick out and piss cars are gold by Burbank Boulevard I'm just peeing I don't give a fuck about the cops I tell them the truth I get these huge anxiety surges yeah well I work out heavy like heavy weights I gotta go to the bathroom before and before I get my car I think how long does that ain't does the medication help you when you taking a xanax not if you don't take it right buddy you got shit to do in the daytime though I got no time for a fucking xanax I don't know what does it do that's what I'm asking well I'll tell you what happens with Zanic so I know for a fucking fact that nobody could tell me when I first got into comedy how I go it'd be as the secrets of comedy you ready okay when I got into County all these jerk-offs you gotta bring five people to a fucking show I'm not asking nobody to come to a show I just wait for Joro gonna call me and ask me and once a week you want weed meet me at the comedy club I gotta meet you the county so don't worry about it just made me there next thing I got you pay and tell at the door so I got into selling xanax there was a crazy guy in Boulder it just gotten out of prison for the murder and his wife I don't know they were getting xanaxs from the pharmacy so I was getting valiums the v's the one wouldn't be you know anything ten milligrams you could sell those with two bucks apiece he was given to me for like a corner so when I first was an open-mic ER I was an accessory but it always cuz I got into a contest so for me to win the contest I had to have people there so they would say when can we buy some zone if you gotta meet me at the broker so I would make that all of them will come up Mingo but what the fuck's wrong which I just paid that Mouse to get in it you got think they're off the price of the pills don't worry about it I got you covered I had such a high profit margin it didn't really matter so I would sells a next people in the hundreds twenties tens cokeheads love those things so what was I was a cokehead I love I could eat 10 of those what does it do not you the fuck out like how like you're gonna pass out you could die like that one people Obie that's what they eat fucking xanax and they fucking I thought it just relaxes you it relaxes you but if you eat 50 of them you're gonna die I was eating 50 you eating 50 and a day dog hey thirty of them in three days in Beaumont it took me five days to recover yeah I told your L Dean in Beaumont Texas in nineteen in 2005 for me in thirty ten milligram valium that's a lot the problem with that shit me as you ready this is what I realized twenty thirty years I was an open mic I was selling them I was David shake that didn't dude didn't get high so for me to be around it I would pop those Annie bars and I would be I'd be good enough for me so I was used to popping like six of them I had my tolerance up their fucking high and bonds you liked it because I would drink with them I would drink like one or two drinks you feel tremendous that's it just wanted to like how do you feel like fucked up fucked up two drinks and a couple zani bars you get fucked up this is before there's Annie blog you're not supposed to drink on them right no no but I walked up and then I do call me any twos to valiums and drink with the waitresses I was an open mic a guy right you know but the point to my story is that if you eat ten milligrams of Valium five of it your body utilizes five of it the other five go into your fat and your body holds onto it usually there's a science you forget are you dealing with here so what happens is when you eat that shit it sticks into your fat fairy tale I would get high fucking not the xanax would come out of your favorite agitate the fat and fuck it it would educate the xaniix out of my fat if you jog would you get high oh fuck yeah does your body start so go for 12 years at the 7-year mark I'd be working out from find the time and I'd bump into a coke rock it just went through my system and I get all paranoid and creepy for a minute like I was still digesting shit right the years by it I believe that those bars and all those little is anything sticking to your fats and then they get me tired the next day yeah don't get me tired now like if I eat six or longer tied one of them I mmm I don't need them until and then sometimes I remember to take it out and put them in back in the thing sometimes I just draw them in the hamper one of my friends would take some says that when you get off of very highly addictive well he also said that when you get off of them it heightens your anxiety like a rubber band effect that's what he was saying for him personally I'm gonna tell you what I do realize what these fucking things these things are the worst things I ever they hear things does it just the worst thing why because my hearing was better before I got these really you told me something once that when you're doing when you're doing the jack when you're doing the bye-bye nyet to get you stronger that your nutsack disappears so when you go off the by Bonnier if you're doing steroids your body's endocrine system shuts down so it no longer produces tests dogs is that true yes you both are your balls shrink is that true no the balls don't really shrink okay so but they don't work anymore since this is not putting any work I feel with this ever since I got these hearing aids to clarify my hearing mm-hmm it's made my hearing weaker it doesn't make my hearing is it true words anymore I mean aware of the fact that your hearing gone bad no my hearing was not going bad Joe Rogan I was hearing things out of place I was hearing the wrong thing I went to dinner with Joe Rogan it was fine of you and I had a conversation if you brought your wife I'm gonna have a hard time that restaurant you weren't here I wouldn't hear nuttiest I would just hear Jamie's table on the other side of the room I could hear his conversation more than yours really and I could hear this the silverware hit the table and I can hear the dishwasher washing dishes and every time his Fork would hit the fucking thing I hear that shit every time I four kids at a restaurant I would be every time I was at a restaurant if it was me and you having a good time what'd you throw Ari and Duncan of the mix I'm just basically yes in you to debt really yes that's how bad it what is that called was her name there's a couple different names for it you know and then somebody told me they kind of had it I go why do you wear those no like I don't know fees I went to concerts to the point where they heard too many things I just needed to narrow it down hmm so I finally figured out what these I don't have my mom low does it not you hear fucking everything like I was getting high and fucking hearing everything you get yeah you get high you fucking hear everything so they have these new air pods now that of uh they have sound deadening so it's uh they sit in your noise-cancelling so you put them in and you can either turn noise canceling on or you can turn them into transparency mode and transparency mode the microphone actually picks up the stuff that's outside have you tried that yeah Jamie yeah so it makes things sound louder than they are like you can hear things better in the way it seems to me you know I don't have any hearing issues to people that maybe to have you don't have hearing issues whatever it might make it sound better yeah yeah I don't have any hearing issues but when I put those things on I could hear things louder I can hear stuff like further away it's like I don't think I can hear them talking if it wasn't for you know noise cancellation works there's microphones on the outside that like flip the frequency and it cancels it out oh that's how it works and so by flipping it over it's just adding to it hmm does it what is the number this is like one and a half times louder than it normally would be is there a no when you add three DB which is not a lot that doubles sound that's like it's the intensity of the sound is more it's double D it's really hard it's like a math quick equation with sound it's interesting because that's one area where Apple has just stolen the show when it comes to Apple versus Android like phones are pretty comparable I haven't tried them but I've heard that Samsung maybe has a galaxy bugs close to it or they're very people like them also they're very good but they don't have the sound cancelling they don't have noise cancelling and the the Apple ones did I think the sound quality has been reviewed as being better to their they just they have they figured out how to make it like you you just open it up right you pull it out of your pocket you open it up but it asks if you want to connect you press button boom and connect stick it in your air and the air perfect and for me it's so much better than a hands-free system when you're driving in the car I just have it in my ear and a double tap on that instead of it going through the whole car and hearing it in the speakers and everything I just hear it in my ear like I would a normal normal conversation that would have with air pods on there's another level you could probably get into that I don't think you have any air monitors which I know like Burt has yeah Tom and Christine you have those at the UFC when when I go into the Octagon I'm doing an interview I have a ear monitor and you can get really good ones for music they have like eight different speakers in that little tiny thing yeah well I have a pair of sure headphones for they work on my laptop they don't work on iPhones anymore obviously but they have drivers in them and they're like suit they're like this clear coating over silver cord they're like pretty high-end fuck they sound good but you know it's for the little ones you carry in your pocket like air pods that's like goddamn genius invention way more easily replaceable for 50 bucks than a 3,000 yeah easily replaceable and they just work so well their work which of these air pods and pies yeah these little things there's two kinds there's the content of noise canceling and then the other kind most the time why you actually have both but most the time I use the the regular one because it sits in my ear better the noise cancelling I forgot to jam it in there a little bit but it's great you could talk to people while you drive and it doesn't have to go through your ear the system in your car you know if you have a you know a Bluetooth setup you don't speak you don't hear in the speakers music music you know you said something to me and I realized like that that's something that I do and when I do it I probably have some of my best results is you were saying a couple years ago you stopped listening to music driving to the store absolutely yeah my car that I have some of my mom some of my favorite sets after I Drive there's a car doesn't even have a radio that little Porsche that I have the red one because it's so is old and it's like real loud it's fucking and it's real mechanical and I'm just I'm so engaged with it but that I went by the time I get to the comedy store my brain is firing right I've been doing something with it I'm not just pressing autopilot and just sitting back and relaxing on my way to the store and riding on this fucking cloud like the Tesla with that little Porsche it's like you're right you hear all the gears you feel it when you're shifting gears it's like you're engaged no music when you get there you but your brain is fired and you could think about stuff while you're driving there instead of like I like listening to sets I listened to a lot of my sets but I also like the guy like doing that before shows listening driving to a show and listening to a set but I also like sometimes not listening a shit just letting my brain get into a good creative place just go over the bits go over what I like about and what I don't like about just make make myself concentrate on them with no paper no nothing just drive it and concentrating on the bit today and go through all his emotions until he drove himself to tears just to check himself for the day Wow and I said how can I do that as a standout I don't need to fucking cry I'm not in the business to make people cry so I'll need to cry I just need to be the best me do you know that I went to Anthony Robbins right you know I'm a big Anthony Robbins mm-hmm you know that right I know you have talked about Anthony Robbins before that I went I do believe in a lot of what he's saying yes I think that a little bit I mean dog when I went to see him I was a burglar I ended up a kidnapper something happened he got through to me and I'm saying he made me fucking he works to another level so I ain't mad at Anthony Robbins you um saying I got caught I fucked up Anthony was on the right pace I used to listen to his cassette I really do believe stimulus take you there something that you do to take you to that mind okay he believes that there's something that we do you can put yourself in a put yourself in that space you know and I really believe there's something to that yeah for sure okay the reason why sometimes you're calling me and you're like joy what are you doing I'm being honest yeah I'm telling you I'm watching Pavarotti I'm watching the most most obscure people who are performers why wouldn't you tell me that why are you lying to me because not you go you know what are you doing in there I'm right am i right I'm watching BB King life from writing watch it BB King live from Africa and I'm watching BB go into a place that I could only dream into going but I probably been in my 28 years of doing comedy I've been in there 200 times I want to learn how to get there more so I believe that on the way down to the store some mornings I do it just drive without the car on and think of a specific time in my life bad a good break down this situation and see what happens I'm not breaking open a scab and I'm not going to see a psychotherapy I just want to see how I feel about that situation today hmm you know I always do I always do that like reflecting right time alone right right now I'm thinking a lot about falling in love with Tommy the shit I did Stanhope coming over to my house as a feature act first and I was an MC at the broker on Tuesday nights 1991 Stanhope comes as a feature if anybody ever did that run you knew that the triple one started Tuesday and Boulder and Wednesday you had off and then Thursday you had Craig Colorado I was divorced but I had a condyle two bedrooms two-and-a-half bedrooms condo if the comic was cool on Tuesday night I didn't bite him to sleep over so you wouldn't have to pay for a hotel mmm he only made 35 bucks right they gotta pay 48 for a hotel crazy so if the comic was cool on Tuesday night say hey man if you wanna spend the night tomorrow give me a call tonight you got the hotel here but if you won't want to drive to Craig to spend the night first time Stanhope came he was a fucking feature after the second time that motherfucker came he stayed at my house I walked him to his car and brought him like food down he had an apartment he had like a one-bedroom apartment in this car and I'll never forget saying what the fuck is this and he's like I'm homeless we got a do if you wanna but he was a real Road Dogg yeah he live got his car a real Road Dogg yeah so I took his fucking advice you know that fucking and jeweler 95 or so I'm getting the car I'm gonna stick in the back just like him I had a frisbee in there a basketball I had everything you could have in there remember those things that you put in your radiator the metal and if your radiator blew fix your radiator I'll see ya oh when you broke that shit yeah I'll fix a flat takes a flat oh my god living out of your car on the road as a character building it's a what character building my god every comic that I know that ever did that there's some of my favorite people gone through some shit you know Road gigs man people that did road gigs that's a different world man I remember when I was doing Road gigs sometimes the booking agent particularly if I was a middle act they would bring in a headliner from New York a lot of times with these guys they were club guys like gotta forget the guys name but he was a old club act who worked around New York City he never really did the road just did New York City and he and I did a gig together in Burlington Vermont and you could see this is like a rare thing for the guy the guy didn't have a car because he lived in New York and didn't know how he was gonna get around he had to have someone drive him up from the city wanted to get a ride with me it's like man I'm not giving anybody a ride in Vermont that I don't know like that's just too weird you know this this gig doesn't pay that much anyway but that those guys that didn't do the road when they did man they were like a fish out of water they'd like New York City jokes nobody gives a fuck about New York City when they're in Burlington Vermont oh they go right through the whole reliable there were so many comics though in New York that they would work the crowd because the crowds were on top of you the crowds are on top of you in New York you know the stages are so small because real estate was so precious that the club was stuffed people would be stuffed into some of those places like stand-up New York remember how small that stage was or Boston comedy you are amp with the ear yeah nothing fuck with you know it just gets itchy oh I remember the fucking New York Comedy Club was on 74th Street I don't remember yeah the 74th on the West Side just a little close to them yeah that was stand-up in New York the old one it needs to be a New York Comedy Club guy in 91 that's who took me in in 93 I forget what his name is is very decent to me that's how I ended up meeting Mikey Bocchetti who is now Artie Lange's hey how's already doing is he doing I checked his you know what I said he was suffering from anxiety anxiety yeah I went when I went to New York I was scheduled to his podcast that Wednesday and he cancelled he's not using he's not using no he did a podcast with me at the Legion of skanks place it was amazing he was great it was great to see him sober and so so alert present so they're so honest and fucking hilarious he's like as funny as he's ever been fucked up nose laughing about it doesn't do fuck talking about what he did he snorted glass snorted glass his girl broke up these pills with a fucking salt shaker and cracked it and got glass in snorted glasses nose is bleeding and he also got knocked out by a guy who he owed money to guy who he owed money to hired some kid to collect and the guy punched him in the nose and smashed his nose and so he had a double whammy happened two things at the same time smoking a snorting glass and then that brute dude he was so funny he was so funny and he was so alert it

mmm when you when you're going through it you're not seeing it yeah once you've done it and you have the balls and you look back they're all hilarious I went through it they're all hilarious but you just keep getting into trouble isn't it funny though that that's a human pattern it's a fun it's a funny pattern there's so many humans falling with heroin garage the cops came down it's things that would never ever happen under you know circumstances but the funk of the drug it just hits you at one time where remember that everything listen nobody drives to an open mic with a Lamborghini you know right you never seen nobody pull up to an open a Lamborghini nobody does cocaine everyone the second time does they had a bad time doing it right you do have a really good time at first or it seems like you having a good time your body left an opening somewhere you know just hurry your immune system did let in Quran of it then sometimes your soul just has a weakness somewhere and that's when the coke or the heroin comes in mm-hmm I know really but how crazy was I caught up in this shit so then he went down this fucking just hole you know and that's what rehabs do they catch you they slow you up they try to identify the problem with him was this father was it the firing of you know the radio god no he had the problems way before that he had problems when he was on MADtv what set him right you know that's what the rehab does you know that's what we what sets you the fuck off and you gotta get yourself away from that I found that what set me off over the years you know there

as well do 10 what's the difference so instead of taking four boxes I started taking like tens like I would walk out of there Joe Rogan like a CD fucking thing and one day I walk out of here we go hey you stop right there and I'm like what are you talking to monies they come back with those CDs they're chasing me and Boulder mm-hmm in the parking lot of Crossroads Mall Here I am getting chased one security guard in the car and the other guy on foot I could beat them both up by the way I could beat them fuck or both of them but I just can't have no problems so what am i doing I'm whipping CDs at them as I'm running and the guys okay stop that what made me think I was gonna get away the police is coming and I have a stop and give him a fake name and fucking you know hearing him out on fucking bail why am i robbing fucking seat why we addicted to it to the thrill I was addicted to snorting coke and getting my dick sir do you think there was a little bit of an addiction to the thrill of stealing - oh I loved all that cuz you loved all that doing that shit later on with like lighters and shit oh I love all that shit if I'm not in trouble for something listen I just smoked three joints for you here well the Kiley you know you look fine don't do not know more well it gets you in a good place but the reefer lets me know I'm still nothing has changed about me well I could be an a a right now I'm be clean and sober I don't do enough to warrant being fuckin on sober mm-hmm this just lets me know I'm okay it's like a teddy bear it's like when people suck their thumb that's all this is from Miri for now it doesn't really get me blasted no more yeah I just told you that let's not give you all these capsules you won't see daylight till tomorrow okay oh what's in there a B is fucking a little bit oxygen THC how many you takin I can pop two in the afternoon 200 milligrams then take another 200 tonight and I'll be okay once no I got this new thing called quick Zee quick Zee quick Z what is that it's a little towards container if you want to sleep you come see me quick Zee quick Zee what's in it melatonin like triple and they did not put you to sleep naturally mm-hmm they've put it in there plus a hundred milligrams IV the sativa indica or hybrid marijuana whoa and you drink it dawg your first night I drank it I found myself usually I fall asleep like you do like this writing reading the computer and you like this yeah that's a B is this one I'm away from the computer right I actually back away and then slump have you done that one joke yeah sure I've done that once you have yeah last week no two weeks ago I got so fucked doc cuz I thought I was only go to New York and die from the Corolla but I actually drank that shit I ate two pills oh my god I ate two of these first nothing happened like I'm like nothing's happening I drank the fucking liquid and something started to happen but it wasn't going fast enough it was like 10:15 I wanted this time when we go to bed so I pop to morning oh oh my god I all hit me at once like a Larry Holmes fucking left hook that night I woke up on the floor I fell off the chair and the heater woke me up I have a healer my office my birth my back was on fire my fire trench I went into the kitchen I opened up the refrigerator I pulled out a half a pound the deluxe boy at Jesus she had just bought an American cheese I took a pack of saltine crackers cause in my mind I might even bread I'm okay I'm not eating bread I'm ahead of this motherfucker the whole thing took off my mass it was a big chunk of American cheese in the sleep mask once - oh my god what the fuck I fucking went out my wife's idea was for the morning I went to bed at 4:00 in the fuckin like I woke up at 3:30 and was like what the fuck happened I must have went down at a quarter to 11:00 I'd been I probably was in this position for an hour and I just fell off the fucking stool and just laying on the floor nobody saw me that's how drilled I got that was I think that was the Wednesday yeah that was the 10 I don't like to smoke and go to sleep I don't like to eat it and go to sleep I just like to go to sleep when I go to sleep but when I when I get high like if I get high before bed I have to get out of bed I gotta grab the computer is that's what my best ideas come my real yeah my best ideas come like the first hour after getting high like the rush there's like a rush that happens a rush of wild thoughts that happens for like the first like 40 minutes to an hour right after you're high it's like that's when their pop they're just popping into your head they like come on man let's dance like you got to get up you can't just try to sleep on that like when those little moments hit I start getting ideas like oh okay this is a time you got to write because you know how many times you just go through your day and don't have any interesting ideas and all sudden you get high and they come out of nowhere it's like the most underappreciated engine for ideas ever it's getting high it's funny how when I get home at night I always think of something between the two stages something always happens between the main room and the original or vice versa and something always happens how I could do something a little better than what just happened so when I get home yeah I do take a piss I wash my hands I that's the best time to grab my thct going mm-hmm home ot with the CBN's shit they have little breath mints now they're follow breath fuck you up trust me oh my god that called sleep the product is Mikey como and that's um the tea I drink is called tranquil and it's every time I got a repeat chamomile mmm and the Yorba root oh yeah your muscle your bhumata your mamata is a stimulant well then it's the cousin in my sleep whatever is your but somebody and then you have three milligrams of THC 10 milligrams of CBN and like all those other things that put you to sleep they got everything no melatonin but Dec fucking pills it's like a container that like takes like a little tin like a tin of little tiny breath mints oh you better be careful with those two or three that's it yeah but I also had like 300 milligrams musically the other things no no no no they I went to Las Vegas the last road gig I did was Las Vegas with those they work don't get me wrong it's not the same thought the THC that kills its to CBN Jamie can we find that with CBN is I don't know I'm appalled terpenes and right it's one of the dirty cousins to CBD what is it terpene officially one of the things things in it anything that's like what it better use a great word when you could use the term confidently and you never you could say terpene confidently could have annoyed no that shit terpenes are what you smell large diverse class of organic compounds produced by plants insects plants so it's just a component of the plant right good for the same stuff CBD is so CBN study benefits include pain relief anti insomnia promotes growth of bone cells antibacterial anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant a petit stimulant very interesting so it sounds real similar to just THC or CBD so just another cannabinoid is that what it is yeah there's some new ones there finding out - like I've gotten THC a which is not psychoactive and there's some other new ones that they're the science is getting do CBD is fucking great for you really it's great for you it really I feel the difference I don't see any downside I'm not seeing it I'm looking for it right I'm trying to find out something this stuff does to you it see just Google what are the negative effects of CBD I've never heard of any of you I have a plate for him now I've been using CBD cream oh it's amazing cream yeah my legs yeah what the Vegas my hat it my skin got dry went somewhere we start using this done side effects include nausea fatigue and irritability no I doubt it I think you're just talking to pussies yeah blame it on that CBD man and made me have fatigue I was irritable because the CBD no you know what you should have if you take like more than a thousand milligrams of CBD at night when you get home you work out if you legitimately have an injury like I know it rest the fuck out of me at night like I like all that shit I'd rather take that shit than hit opioids like at this point in my life well then xanax ambien the ambien makes you do crazy shit makes you get addicted it makes you say crazy should do yeah it makes you say do dumb shit at night and make crazy shit too so mm-hmm you know what would be the way we want so I go off the deep end I make a race is common or some way that I can live with that ambien doesn't right you don't really sleep though it just kind of puts you away for a little bit or you don't go through a full sleep cycle right who was telling is that true you don't go through a full let's see what get this right ambien doesn't allow you to go through a full REM sleep cycle really I don't think so I think it's a different cycle because when we had Matthew walk or the sleep expert it was when he was doing very informative podcast the best yeah and the one listen let me tell you something your podcast for Monday the 9th of March of the 8th of March that was the best podcast of the year which one that's the one about that one broke down the coronavirus oh that's this guy one foster home after all is the bed that's the one that put the fear of God into me that's the one that opened my eyes a little bit more why people were reacting the way they were yeah yeah there was a there's a wake up at all wake up call big wake up call we got hard to find because I would also imagine that any negative effects would be zapped by the pill industry online the Google it you know somebody says like I may be at high dosages it might affect it but the very first thing I says it says effects of zolpidem which is ambien had no effects on REM sleep really so I don't bad second interesting that's not what Matthew Walker was saying no I know that I want to said marijuana doesn't you know you don't go as deep as you supposed that you think it's supposed to go there but you don't go as deep as you why don't we Google does ambien effect do you get real sleep on ambien how about that that's I mean that's I have to dig through like what would you like me to look I guess because it's a good question for every first things that come up are just like blogs about ambien and like yes I get sleep this is the very first things I have to go through 12 pages probably a result mmm yeah we'd have to figure it out what you know what I need to talk to well I know that Matthew Walker was talking about the negative effects of it but I need to talk to someone else and get like get the the rap down or just listen to what he said about it just get the rap down because I know there's something to it where it doesn't totally it's not the same as just sleeping eight hours without it you know the same amount of recovery or something it just seems like anytime you could take something it just knocks you out like that's a chemical just put you out that can't be good it can't be good for there's a chemical you take that that crashes you that's not good you've done something I mean you're gonna recover once you crashed but you've done something very strange you've taken something that shuts you off just to me that when I'm up I'm up am i mop my up oh okay well I'll get up and then when I'm tired I'll lay down I'm not taking anything and people like well I need it for work okay I get it you need it it just seems to me that if you want to be healthier taking something that just makes you go to sleep is not let me up here yeah it's one thing if it's a natural alternative that just relaxes you and a lap but something that knocks you the fuck out and when you wake up you're in a gunfight with the cops because that's what ambien does you would Kevin James woke up in the middle he I talked about it on one of my specials he made a fucking turkey went to the grocery store when I made food and people came home and they're like what the fuck coot he's like someone broke into the house he thought he went to the supermarket and bought food and made a meal and he thought that someone broke into his house and cooked till the people are in the middle of a drive on the highway they wake up they have no idea how they got there they have no idea some people when they're on ambien they just ambien walk they do all kinds of wacky shit I think people have committed murders when they're on ambien I think there was a guy see if that's true so Matthew Walker says that if you're not getting the restorative benefits of sleep from it yeah you're not getting true sleep they switch off the top of your cortex the top of your brain explaining Derk magazine and put you in a state of unconsciousness that's not sleep that's cryogenics Walker the sleeping pill sleep does not have the same restorative powers there you go immune boosting to emotional resilience so of course the other stuff that you read was shells by the pill industry trying to fill up the Google search folks stay up when you're tired go to bed my advice to you you know when they didn't need sleeping pills back in the fucking pioneer days take a wagon across the country and fight off Indians all day you could just go to sleep man you just sleep you're tired dad dishes all day you're taught you're exhausted I've always used Brie for the sleep I've always used three for the sleep a and B I've always used reefer to slow me down a little bit I know for a fact and always slowed me down my mind has always been yeah fucked up like that so something they should have treated it was something early on they didn't catch it they didn't all existed now I know how to calm myself down self-medicate you know I know how they smoke too reefer I brought really dig the the meditation the last two weeks so what saw where it took me from where I was at the word took me from helping me it do the main thing was which is accept acceptance is the main thing in this whole thing that's going on right now once you accept it you'll be you'll lose 30 pounds of weight you never lived 20 more years accepting this that you didn't fuck up and nobody around and you fuck up you didn't fuck up Joe this is just didn't fuck up cuz I shot somebody at the store I acted bad at the store this is nothing to do with us Frank you know this is something from life we will all bounce back from this might be a year might take two might take six months you don't know what's gonna happen I know that it's gonna change people's lives for the better people gonna go you know what I didn't want to work on a fucking office anyway yeah you know what this is gonna make people think from outside the box which is something they needed yeah so there's both negative and positive from this whole situation how it works for you is appeal how it works for you it felt gonna be a few G well every time there's a moment of adversity you can you could recover from that 'vote if you can recover from that adversity you have an opportunity it'll grow it's always there but it was the quote that Raphael Lovato quoted that inside every seed of adversity is in and or inside every adversity is a seed of an equivalent benefit who was that Think and Grow Rich was that guy's name again god damn it this weed in your memory was being 15 Thornhill yes Napoleon Hills book very interesting book Raphael Lovato jr. he loves that book that book to him is like that's like his his one of his motivational books Joey Diaz let's wrap this up with 3,000 it's always great to see I'm glad Jamie great to see you brother you know I know Jamie's dying there's no sports I've been thinking about him a lot lately what are they doing are they gonna just put everything aside for a little more betting on the weather right now they're like NASCAR is doing like a virtual League this weekend that they're starting up with some past drivers and whatnot yeah oh my god oh my god you know what I was thinking of doing like some old of the oh my god I want some but fucking UFC Unleashed came through from Kojo II they showed all three Chuck Randi fights right now another very interesting well you know Chuck going in they're not trained and take a little light get fucking little em and shit stopped him and then him coming back catch them with that shit right and then I'm coming back again that's been great I wish you could narrate them like the idad was like why can't he fuck him I should call him we should talk to him you know when you and Eddie get together and do them because I even go eat that's great right now to get like old fights and put them up it's not a bad idea no my god this is the time to do it we should have a fight companion for old pride fights like yet some of them I have dad so we should do like I like I love to go get schooled on Overeem yeah beginning the Japanese guy which one the one Sakuraba Sakuraba I've done O'Gara Brothers oh they're like that's the education I need next yeah that's a great idea you see if I companion with like some of those great old yeah cards yes yeah we'll pick out a card pride dynamite or some shit there's so many more I put together a card oh just like top ten fight oh yeah we could totally do that but it's the best way I think would be if we put it together where they could sync it up like the Dark Side of the Moon and then watch the whole card with us so we're gonna press play right now it's starting here's the first round and three two well you know like that this is like we do with a regular fight so they could they could be synched up so they're watching it with us yeah you ever see came through last week it's a great idea the that McGregor had everybody on both fights that they ended up with khabib Diaz didn't ESPN have something like 11 hours of yes yeah they ended up with khabib here's the thing about a mcgregor UFC fights for some strange reason and I'm not sure why they're as entertaining to watch the second time as anything of everything I still have be as McGregor on my pay-per-view and could be McGregor dude I've watched Zhang Wei Li and and you wanting a Jay check I've watched that five times yes I have I watch it on my TV at home I've why it's like watching them cut gems it's so good and even better that was so good that was so nerve-racking that fight was so crazy I've watched that fight of gang at times I watched the style bender yellow Romero fight at least two times I watched John Jones Thiago Alves I watched at it I mean Iago Iago Paolo Paul no no no no Thiago Santos Jesus Christ cha-cha Alva's welterweight weed I blame the weed but I watch that a bunch time wants to Dominic Reyes fight a bunch of times I watched that fight at least four or five times watch that fight with a fine-tooth comb and I know I still can't call it that anybody says that this guy wanted that guy won that fight that's open to interpretation that third round is open to interpretation no question Dominic gray is one the first to no question John Jones won the last two it's that third round is that third rounds like to make it even that seemed like you know it's hard to say that's hard to say round I kind of lean towards maybe Dominic Reyes did enough to win that round because I think he landed more volume in that round but John controlled the center of the Octagon John put was starting to put pressure on him John was starting to catch him and especially towards the end of the round which I was for whatever reason score higher the end of the round to me is like this is when shits starting to change and then one person might have got a relief from the bell or the other person was gaining an advantage that's what it seemed like at the end of round 3 it seemed like John will start again and advance watch again I won't watch it's good it's a good fight man Dominic Rey is a bad motherfucker he put on a show he think about what he did and how come he stayed in front of the goat the guy was beating everybody John Jones has beaten everybody and Dominic gray has put it to him got it so close that there's a real argument that he might have done enough to win the decision I don't necessarily agree with that argument I think I almost kind of agree with a draw if people saw the draw I could almost see that third round being a draw but I like John winning because John was stronger in the fourth and fifth rounds I think it means more I think it should mean more I know it doesn't but it should it's like the fight was going his way he was starting to take over that's what you want to see I mean you want to see the guy was trying to chase the other guy down and and beat on him at the end of the fight who's doing at the end of the fight well the end the fight was John Jones but still he impressed and quite impressive but you got to think the Thiago Silva not Terro silver Chagos Santos fight Jesus Christ Joe Silva was another bad motherfucker from Brazil but the Thiago Santos fight was a split decision people forget that I mean I don't necessarily agree with it there was a split decision I thought John won but it was close enough that one judge disagreed you know one judge incompetent or confident you be the judge gave it to Thiago Santos and you know Thiago Santos put on a hell of a show it was an amazing fight but I'd you know John still the greatest of all time if you look at all the guys 2d beaten Anthony Smith OSP lyoto machida Rashad Evans just go down the line Rampage Jackson just go down the line Vitor Belfort just going on the line everybody John beats everybody Daniel Cormier twice stopped in the second time Shawn beats everybody John beats everybody so for Dominic Reyes to put on a show like that see this is why this coronavirus is so fucked up for MMA a that people can catch and get sick and their loved ones can catch and get sick of course but be goddamn there's some good fights that need to be made and how they're gonna make them what are they gonna do Tyson Fury's they're pushing fury and wilder three they're pushing it back they have to they don't know what to do though I think they're gonna try to push it back to July or something right to fall that's what it was in July yeah that's right there's a fight in Vegas in July I'm supposed to be at the Park Theatre in July in Vegas you are the day before the fight yeah that the one that's next to the MGM I'm at that place that place where they do the weigh-ins I don't who knows what I'll be able to even I don't know I mean max Holloway said it best it is what it is let's get the folks right it
