oh hello freak bitches yeah that did that is a real sweeping brush that people from both sides like to use right the people on the right like to use it on liberals the P the liberals like to use it on conservatives we like to paint people like real obvious put a you know put them in a box make sure we categorize them yes I mean I'm surprised I said well I think I got I think I might have accidentally started a little bit of it I said look the all you have to realize is there's just a disenfranchised part of America that feels like they're not being represented and then immediately I think Sarah got jumped on me and she was like oh you're talking about the racists and I was like I don't know you can't say that you can't say that like I voted I'm not come by the way I voted for fucking Hillary so I'm just setting what hat what I'm noticing out of an election so but I you know I thought it was good of her to stand her ground and tend to hold and just say her point not try to backpedal and and I appreciate that but well you know so the problem is the problem with that saying that anybody that voted for Trump is a racist the real the real problem with that is because the only other alternative was Hillary and Hillary was very flawed that's just the way it is you know it's not it's not an anti woman thing to think that someone who has all the ties to corruption that she apparently does you can go into it all day long if you want to you want to like look at the Clinton Foundation or any other crazy shit that those people are involved with it's kind of legal you know I mean she's not really breaking any laws so you can get away with doing all that stuff but all that is learned oh like deleted emails and all that like what are you doing like what is this yeah and I think I think there was a large portion of America who just didn't want to share their opinion because they didn't wanna be called a name mm-hmm and there's there's real concerns too and people don't want to say this there's real concerns about her health realize she hurt her head in 2012 because she blacked out she she blacked out fell fainted and hit her head really bad like really bad and apparently she was fucked up for like six months and this was 2012 that's only four years ago man and that's a really significant head trauma and she was very eloquent in the debates she's really articulate I thought she kicked his ass in the Bates I honestly did yeah I thought she came off smoother especially that second one like he would say some crazy shit and she would smile you know I thought she handled it great and she was so much more eloquent and so much like so much more so much better economy of words the problem is is just it's so hard to to trust that she's telling you the truth you know there's just too many things that she's been like the difference between that Comey guy what he said she had done with her email and what she said she had done and you play them back and forth you ever seen the video they do that it's pretty shocking you know what he says it's very different than her descriptions of what he says you know what he says is like she violated some laws and what most people thought in the apparently in the FBI it's one of the things that people got upset at Comey apparently from this article I read at least they were saying that the people in the FBI were very disappointed because they thought that he should have press charges they thought that when they looked at all the evidence and all the stuff that he talked about that he admitted that she had done that you can't do with classified data she had violated all these laws like if you were a regular person if you were a regular enlisted person and you violated those same amount of loss dude you'd be fucked you would be fucked Phil don't really put you in a goddamn cage 100% look like not this sounds silly but she just like they said hey we'd like to your emails and she just got rid of them all she deleted them all she deleted 30,000 emails and she did it after a subpoena at least some of them were so I didn't know his actual subpoena see how many find out how many emails she deleted after the subpoena I don't know you know the absolute specifics of it but it's just it's my point is it wasn't like she was this awesome alternative you know so people that want to change and they felt like what Hillary represented is a part of that big system as well as she says her words and is stately she is and she's a much better representative of America in some ways than he is yeah but she's just too tied to corruption like all the stuff that she's done like all the the experience she has in government all that should be on her favor in her favor but for a lot of people it wasn't this time for a lot of people who like this government just too intertwined with these businesses that support it and pay it money and they they're going to all these different foreign countries and getting paid exorbitant sums of money to talk it's like Bill Clinton was getting like half a million dollars to fly to these countries that are headed off all these like like serious like civil rights violations on their people yeah there was like something that Clinton had done we kept trying to push this one through see if he could find that there's this one like dictatorship that he wanted to go into he wanted to go and do speeches and they were like no you can't go there like that we you're not supposed to visit that place these people are doing things we don't look we don't agree with and he's like yeah I got to go over there and I'm gonna do do speech so let's just try to get like you just want to do that speech you just wanted that cheddar that's I think it's uh what's interesting to me now is the the population on Twitter at least of people my friends that voted for Hillary that are now just saying fuck fuck the rest of the country fuck I'm gone out this sucks it's like you like did you see that the Canadian website the immigration I was like broke it crashed broke all the Americans were like fuck this moving to Canada has anyone ever done that though fuck yeah you think fuck yeah especially Vancouver oh yeah warm because like Seattle it's basically just like Seattle Seattle but I mean like weather-wise yes part identical but there's something different about Vancouver the key that Seattle doesn't have what's that like almost like this um like colonial like richness this European richness but you know that bridge driving into Vancouver which got big lions and yeah and you're like aha this just looks like Lord of the Rings II yeah it looks like it could be in Germany and everything's a little more lush or a little more overgrown hmm I don't know Seattle say I'd like sad I love Seattle but the downtown's look similar because still like the downtown's in Vancouver the food's always seems just a little bit better than Seattle did you ever do oh man that's a tough call they're both pretty fucking awesome you can't have shitty food in the Pacific Northwest yeah you know like Oregon like Portland Portland's another place they have some fucking banging food darling do you ever go to that you ever do go to that little taco truck service yes do they have a Thai cheeseburger it's a cheeseburger with that like satay sauce that peanut butter sauce yeah holy shit and it's super spicy it's got sriracha in it too fucking low god damn it's good Bill Clinton saut State Department okay for paid speeches related to North Korea and the Congo he wanted you gone go he's an animal they're cutting kids hands off of the Kabul I respect his game I respect his game he's like there's a lot of paper for me over there I got to go get it I guarantee when he when she had elected he was like fuck I guess she'll be around the house a lot more look at this it says the FBI about the the deleted emails between March 25th and March 31st three weeks after the subpoena the campaign now says it only learned when the emails were deleted from the FBI report hmm Wow how many emails oh my god thirty thousand 490 work-related emails on December 5th 2014 and chose not to keep 30 1830 emails she deemed personal well that's interesting chief by the way do you know how difficult that would be I have 33 unopened emails 33,000 on the open emails on my thing and sometimes I tried it's just like spam and I try to clean it out and it's a fucking nightmare yeah it's not easy to clean now yeah you're like select all delete but then you still it only takes really like 800 yeah so if you've been paying attention to all these people's reactions everyone's trying to like to figure out why why Trump won it's really fascinating it's fascinating to see people freaked out it's it's fat people at crying people are fucking crying oh they stormed out of a school in Arizona the kids marched out of a school to protest the president-elect Wow whoa this is crazy now but there is a weird like there's a weird energy when Trump gave his speech last night it was almost like the bully saying stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself like he was like he was like now we can be like it was kind of weird because he has not been like super inclusive and then all of a sudden he's like we need to heal together and you're like hey you totally feel that way but like part of me goes on there's there a part of him that fucking hates everyone that doesn't like him yeah for sure yeah he certainly mean he's look he's a super businessman and super businessmen they're like their game players they play in a game so if you move towards them you know and you make a move they want to make a move to County your move and fuck you up but that's Donald Trump's personality that's why he Sue's all those people that you know he's involved in altercations with yeah he just fucking squash his shit he doesn't he doesn't like you know if people are talking shit about him but that's when once he become president like you got to let all that go like you have to yeah you gotta let all you can't be tweeting Jon Stewart at 1:30 in the morning calling him a pussy she watched that video oh god yeah it's hilarious you can't be tweeting Jon Stewart at 1:30 anymore and calling a pussy when you're in your sixties what the yeah you can't do that can't do that anymore you definitely now now that you the president please stop doing that it's just don't do it you can think it but don't do it and even if you think it why even bothering what do you care they gotta get rid of his Twitter immediately nope he know he's been eaten let them keep tweeting who cares why not oh dude political correctness just took a missile to the dick now do you think do you think that's good or bad for stand up on unquestionably good unquestionably good in every way shape or form really yeah it's good because he's gonna do some goofy shit he's gonna say some ridiculous things a week I mean it right now you if someone if you said something like I like to go up and grab them by the postseason everyone would be like I that has to be acceptable because half of America is not offended by that do you see I'm a believer in that the president in a lot of ways shapes the mindset of the country because it's just an natural thing that happens in tribes you know if you have one fierce tribal leader in a tribe guarantee you the Warriors that are in that tribe will also be fierce cuz they'll be under the guidance of the the one wild fucking guy I mean that's how I mean that's how like fierce armies get put together you have to have a badass fuck in general well when your president is this guy who rarely gets riled up about anything he's not emotional at all he's super articulate and really well-spoken and he's a great orator that's Barack Obama right I mean that's what you would think of when you think of like a presidential person he's probably the most presidential guy we've ever had as president but then you go with Trump like he's not doing that at all like he's he's just rocking in a totally different way a hundred percent yeah he's doing it like a businessman you fuck with him he's gonna fuck with you back you know you fucking piece of shit Jon Stewart you pussy it's real little evil way to do it 1:30 in the morning but that's the kind of guy that can fucking finance campaign for president all on his own and win yeah that's crazy I mean what forget about whether you think it's a good thing for the country or bad thing for the country it might be the greatest success story ever it might be like the greatest upset of any contest ever a hundred percent there's no bigger upset ever right like what do you think the odds were when Donald Trump first entered the race in Vegas that he would eventually become president we think the odds were I remember watching um Seth Meyers State of the Union address and he said Donald Trump's here Donald Trump said he's voting he's running as a Republican I thought he was running as a joke and I doubled over and I thought I remember thinking to myself what what what an idiot held he could never be present I literally thought he could never be president and then to think that that's a fucking reality yeah it's interesting has any celebrity other than will Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan's when I was curious about because they said that I don't remember the election I was too young but they were saying that despite the fact that he had already been governor because that was I kind of like he had been in office they were shocked that anyone would vote for Reagan they thought he was a fucking joke and dude he destroyed Mondale like I look at those county-by-county polls where they show you what the counties voted it's really fucking interesting because you like look at Ohio it's all red but Cleveland's blue and like Columbus is blue and Toledo's blue and so but they but the thing is all that just outside the city everyone's voting for Trump but in the city people are voting for the broening Democrat but you look at if you look at Reagan's it's I mean literally it's all fucking red
