haha hello freak bitches I might have to spark up a joint fess up so you just want a real deep real quick thought I was hoping I was hoping to go that way do you want some you smoke the weed I could do it for the first time I'd be willing to ever well I don't know if I want to give it to you for the first time and I want you to freak out you don't smoke pot at all the truth is I've smoked pot once ever it was in first day of college but I never stopped so that's really just once oh I understand so you smoke pot all the time so you did it once and you just kept going I'd be willing to try the second time is what I'm saying I understand understand I'm sure so what has like what has life been like for Scott Adams during this election you uh came into the well Europe obviously always well known for being a creator of Dilbert but um a long selection cycle all of a sudden there was I had you know people that I was in contact with they were saying else god I was a trump supporter and I was like what Scott Adams the Dilbert guy is a trump supporter because you know everyone assumes you meet someone and they're in the creative business you know you're in a creative business you're you write a comic strip you would assume that you would be a left-wing guy like almost almost immediately well I'm neither left nor right I'm sort of all over the place my my views didn't match you know either the major candidates not anything so you're a free thinker I like to think I'm right and everybody else is wrong hmm I would like that to know I'm actually um my larger philosophical grounding is that is informed by my experience as a hypnotist I'm not sure if you knew that no I didn't know you're a hypnotist so in my 20s I went to hypnosis school and became an actual trained certified hypnotist Wow and one of the things you learn as a hypnotist is that the world is backwards to the way people normally perceive it so normally you see the world as hey you know 90% of the time people are rational and doing rational things right but tempers of the time we do go nuts and we do stupid things and it's because something happened this part right that's the normal view of the world the hypnotist view of the world is opposite the hypnotist says that 90% of the time were completely irrational and we're just making rationalizations for why we did things after the fact 10% of the time were rational but that's only when there's no emotional content to the decision you know you're balancing a checkbook or you know trying to pick up you know the best route to some place and so that's how I see the world and so when I look at either the Trump supporters or the Clinton supporters to me from the hypnotist perspective and someone who's studied persuasion for decades I use it in my writing I see both sides as completely ridiculous boom both of them are grounded in complete absurdities they're just different yeah but nobody knows why they're deciding the the real reasons that people make decisions are fear identity you know they have some aspiration they've they've got something they're trying to solve there's something to try to work out but the reasons we give are usually completely false and the kind of the grounding for this is that if you think about evolution I assume you believe we evolved yes there was no requirement in evolution that we ever understand our environment the way we imagine we do and here's an example of that you could believe that you were a monk you know you're reincarnated from a 10th century monk like Steven Seagal it does he believe that yeah he's like a Buddha or something from an actual yeah like he actually got it bestowed upon him by some Tibetan character all right so let's use Steven Seagal so Steven Seagal can be standing in a grocery store next to let's say a Muslim who believes that his prophet literally flew to heaven on a winged horse those two people don't live the same reality but they both buy grocery is that both go they cook it they live they survive so it turns out that understanding your reality at an actual you know I really know what is objectively happening and I get it I've got a mental model that's quite accurate we don't need any of that so it would be deeply unlikely that we volved such a specific skill that's completely unnecessary as far as we can tell you know we do need to know that BFI if you run into this wall you know your head is going to hurt so there's some basic stuff but we're probably all in even interpreting that experience differently so there's no reason to think that the way I think of it is the way you think of it so I see the world is this big irrational ball and I use the hypnotist persuader skills to back up and try to deduce you know what's really driving things and when people said I was a trump supporter what they meant was they may have only seen part of what I was talking about I was writing about his skill as a persuader and what I mean is that I noticed in him the skills that I've developed over her decades for persuasion but I had a higher level that I've ever seen meaning that he is the most persuasive living human I've ever experienced and I mean that in terms of actual technique you know he's full of technique and it's all the time I'll give you some examples that first time I noticed it was the very first debate when megyn kelly was asking him the question about the insults he had allegedly said to women not allegedly he said them and this is a setup that any other politician with his setup is totally trapped because they can either try to like deny they said it and then somebody has a videotape and that doesn't work or they can say oh I didn't mean it there's almost nothing you can say you're just trapped and that would have been the end of his campaign first debate should have been over and if you remember do you remember what he said no I don't she said you said this this isn't this about women and he smiled they sort of looked at the audience it looked like or the camera and he said only Rosie O'Donnell and the audience erupted in laughter completely unexpected and a place inappropriate provocative and and what I noticed was the Rosie O'Donnell is that is a visual image that everybody shares right you got a picture of her see me say the name and for his base that he was catering to it was an unpopular image and one it would just suck all the energy away from the question which was toxic and really you know you can't touch the question you just have to suck all the energy into another part of the room and wait for the time to run out and that's what he did and it became the headline lobby you know certainly it highlighted the things he said about women maybe more than it would have but the way he escaped that got my attention and I thought that doesn't look normal alright that that's a that's operating at another level and so I looked for more examples of it and you could see it everywhere and it was especially clear by the time he started saying well the other visual things he does is he says build a wall and you can just imagine a wall when he says were we're paying too much ransom to a ram for those soldiers he says we paid you know four hundred million or whatever the number is he goes imagine that money piled up it'd be so much money I would fill this room you can't even imagine that big pile of money he always goes for the visual because we know that the the visual part of our brain is the dominant part and if you can get its attention and get it on your message it talks the rest of your brain into anything you want it to when he talks about Isis he goes visual also he doesn't say they are bad people whose religions you know has been distorted you know the type of thing you might hear from Hillary Clinton he says they put you in cages and they drown you in the cage they chop your head off I mean you can see that your plan my head so everything he does gets more attention than everything everybody else does because he puts it into a provocative picture so that was the first thing I noticed then when he got to Jeb Bush and he needed to defeat Jeb because he was the strongest competitor so if he couldn't get past him there was no point and he went after was strong and he went after him fast and he went after him with the low-energy kill shot so I I call these linguistic kill shots it's not just an insult it's not just a clever nickname and we saw Clinton try to come up with clever nicknames add no and no purchase whatsoever like dangerous Donald you know it just didn't work but look at look at low-energy Jeb here's how its engineered its engineered for confirmation bias meaning that you want the future to make this look like a better nickname every day and you want it to match his physicality so before I ever heard low energy Jeb I had a good impression of Jeb Bush like I thought when you looked at him Jeb Bush didn't you say to yourself this guy looks like a cool character like no if no but he looked like he was an in control calm reasonable exactly the person you'd want if that if the nuclear question came up if there was some big decision Jeb Bush isn't going to get excited if it seemed like a competent CEO competency exactly and as soon as Trump said low energy could you see him and the other way he was low energy and he will always be lowered and she lyin Ted a lyin Ted lyin Ted was beautiful Ted because you knew that because he's a politician yeah sometime in the next several months he's gonna say stuff that you can say is a lie whether it is or not Roger doesn't have to but more importantly Ted has a physicality about him that unfortunately he's got beady eyes and I've said this before if you're gonna cast a movie you know we need a guy who's looks dishonest right it would be his face right and unfortunately I mean I don't know if he's actually dishonest I'm not gonna make a judgement so came up with the Zodiac killer thing was that a Trump fan or was it Trump himself that started saying that Ted was the Zodiac killer uh I think that probably started with a fan but so the other thing that's fucking harsh man you'd be giving speeches are you the Zodiac killer people would scream it out like imagine having to deal with that and did your father kill you know somebody yeah yeah his father was maybe his dad was the Zodiac killer is that what the cause is ODI killer was like the 70s right might not be old enough oh so crooked Hillary crooked Hillary same thing for cotillion is a brilliant one so she wasn't physically you know as limber as a young person so she you could imagine her sort of a little bit crooked physically and you knew that there would be stories coming out in which people could say well there's another example of that crookedness you see but you thought that a physical sense like the way she looked all I thought about his corruption I heard crooked Hillary I saw her like with like a burglars mask on trying to sneak away with bags that had dollar signs on them yeah yeah that's what I saw you know if you look at any one of these individually his nicknames you you could say well it's sort of random he just got lucky but if you look at a ball they all have that physicality they all have the the priming so that you know you confirmation bias will kick in whatever you see after that will just fit the label because it's the first thing you think well he's a performer you know you you can say Donald Trump is a businessman he most certainly is even most certainly is a real estate investor but he's been a public figure for decades and when you're a public figure you're a performer he's performing all the time and he's also he likes to win and so when he's engaging in people he makes it personal so he's gotten very good at what's called playing the dozens I know I'm playing the dozens is tell us it's a insult thing you know like you can like one guy like guys in the hood in the inner cities this is a start out as a black term but guy it's essentially like a version of your mama contest like some guys are way better at your mama jokes they're way better at playing the dozens you're way better at shitting on other people around them and it's for the entertainment of each other it's a huge thing amongst comedians we shit on each other constantly left and right but it's generally encouraged and we all enjoy it you know but when a guy has decades and decades and decades of this like Donald Trump but a very high level because he's known to be a billionaire investor who puts his name on every everything in still win big which I talked about developing systems for succeeding one of the systems is to and you do this to stack together what I would call ordinary skills until your stack is different than anybody else's so in my case I'm not a great artist you know I didn't take any write writing courses but I'm pretty good at drawing and I'm pretty good at writing up a little bit funny so I put them together and I couldn't do a comic strip because it's rare that you get somebody who's let's say in the top 10% of three different things but it's not hard to be in the top 10% of things if you're if you're going after them so if you look at Trump he wrote a book on negotiating so he knows business he knows negotiating he knows public speaking he has a sense of humor a really good one he's quick on his feet now he knows politics you know from both the inside and the outside he knows Twitter if you you know I could probably go on and you would say if you looked at any one of those things he's not the best you've ever seen he's not the best public speaker the funniest person etc but there aren't many people who can do all of those things in the top 10% you put as a public speaker I don't think he's nearly in the top 10% I think he's I'm just being honest I think he has very poor efficiency of words like he uses he repeats himself when it's not really important and when we repeats itself what what I usually see is like someone searching for the next thing to say you know I'm saying like he'll say you know I'm gonna be honest with you I'm gonna be honest with you okay I'm gonna be honest with you here he'll do that in a way that is not it's not efficient it's not efficient but it's persuasive it that's way sometimes but it also know repetition repetition sometimes sometimes and sometimes it's clunky yeah I feel like he I feel like there's a lot of times where it's his style to do that and he's done it before but even like in delivering lines you've got to know when did not talk like here's breath example when he said that he called the president up the President of Mexico up and they had the conversation about the wall and he said the wall just got 10 foot higher he's like yeah that's what I said that is what I said like he repeats outside he should have just let it hang he should have said the wall just got 10-foot heart they would have went crazy and he got a walk back and forth and just sucked it in but he kept talking that's not the best speaker like Obama I feels way better public speaker way more efficient with his words way better control of the sentences that he speaks me but it's more professional I think you're judging on a standard that I probably wouldn't use so I took the Dale Carnegie course teaching you how to be a public speaker and their course taught you zero technique mmm of course on public speaking in which they taught you nothing about technique the things that you're saying is doing read not necessarily technique well let me just finish that's not sure I'm sorry what they tell you is just confidence and and if you were happy and confident you would almost always do well even if you make mistake you just correct so he strikes me as the confident Dale Carnegie type of speaker the person who's selling an emotion right it's an experience you're not going there really to get information it's it's not really you know well-crafted jokes you're looking for you're going there to feel something and you can't you can't deny that 30,000 people in this stadium with red hats on you know they were feeling something so in terms of delivering and emotion top 10% hmm interesting um well I think that for absolutely one thing you could say is he knows how to do the Donald Trump thing and the Donald Trump thing is very different than the rest of the politicians think the Donald Trump thing is not humble the Donald Trump thing will tell you about his past successes and use them to tell you how he's going to be successful in the future the Donald Trump thing when confronted with certain things like the thing about it you know him saying something about Hillary lacking stamina and the Easter goes off about having a winning temperament I have a winning temperament there's not a lot of people who could do that in that sort of a political forum like if if say Mitt Romney was running for president he started saying I have a winning temperament they'd be like oh mitts gone fucking crazy right I mean remember how Howard Dean got knocked out of the race just for screaming he just screamed at a rally and it was over the wind came out of the balloon but you know you know what Howard Dean did wrong what he only screamed once it's all it's all about contrast well he also didn't make fun of it you know he should have come on and he should have done something to make fun of it he should have had a speech where he talked about so I got a little carried away folks I know like he hid from it it feels like he could have fixed that yes yeah I had that authority at the time well if it what the problem was it was contrary to what he was selling you know he was selling this buttoned up package deal and in the middle of that package deal is a fucking pro wrestling fan screaming from a suplex you know you know like Hulk Hogan suplex is the Iron Sheik and ah I mean that's what it was like I mean that's not the guy who you want to have the button so if you heard of these studies and I think this has been replicated and fairly reliable that if you want to addicting let's say this yo your show if you gave them a really good product every time it actually wouldn't be as addictive as if once in a while it wasn't good and they had to sort of like wait and anticipate oh there's that good one again right so unpredictable rewards are far more addicting than predictable so a Hillary Clinton who rewards you every time and it but is just about the same is not going to be nearly as addicting as Donald Trump who disappoints the fuck out of you you like god I was just starting to like you why did you say that that way right and then two weeks later he comes out with something you say shit I love you again and you know so it's he's got that addictive pattern going well I'll tell you what once all that grabbed the pussy stuff got out of the way um he was doing a lot of speeches in the rundown the last few days and I watched a few of them on television because I almost felt like even though I knew I was going to vote I almost felt like some sort of a spectator like this is this cannot possibly be real to speak to your software simulation idea in the beginning that a lot of people share by the way it's not just crazy Scott Adams and me but there's a lot of folks out there that think that we're living in a simulation right but as he would give these speeches and there were some of the speeches he gave where there was these moments are you like if someone could tell that guy to keep it at seven like where he's at right there and talk like that always and avoid all the crazy shit but man the crazy shit is what you get like that's that's the thing about people like Trump or like any powerful super Dominator type character like that uh you have some flaws a lot of them look what he kept saying all the time he was always saying he was the energy guy yet again I look at my crowds the other one has no stamina this one's you know Low Energy he knew the facts didn't matter he knew the policy didn't matter and by the end I think everybody agrees they didn't I mean by Election Day not a lot of people were saying away now I shall like that TPP stand nothing like that was happening there's no issues no issues it just just came down to which one you hated them or
