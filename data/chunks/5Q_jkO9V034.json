five four three two one live and we're live mr. Carmichael hello my friend mr. neighbors hello children run Jamar I know Jamar welcome Thank You Man no you were coming but glad to see you me neither May May made me come I'm going to Joe Rogan perfect perfect what the fuck is going on man what do you want - I just got him from New York like two hours ago and now I'm here I feel real I don't know I feel like you know you obviously like a homeless men smoking a cigarette yeah and he just feels like real Zinn and this is his that's how that's how I feel emotionally right now really yeah really homeless dude smoking a cigarette got a weird analogy I feel it's great it's really great trying to figure that out that feeling it's like I have everything that I need right now in your life have every pee Anani yeah but you've been killing it for a long time man you know I you were killing it when I wasn't at the store I'd heard about you when I was I was gone I had heard about you I think Ari is one who told me about you oh yeah you know and then I found out that Spike Lee directed your specials like what what the fuck is happening with over at The Comedy Store he's directing comedy specials that was a fun one cuz it was like just such a immediately I was like it has to be in the o.r nobody filmed in the or and so like you know get in everybody to agree to that yeah and then like cuz even spike was like but the main rooms right here mmm so big and it's like but I don't do the main room I do or yeah the main rooms pretty good - I used to I used to be prejudice against the main room I'd be like yeah that's too big it's too showy it depends ours dirty and grimy it depends on like you know the sides are full or open and what the the the room can change depending on like so many factors of like seating and whatever just the sound of it well the room really changes when it gets empty late at night like that's a strange room I like Brody's doing those midnight spots those have been some fun spots to last just when Brody's just that was like I used to Tommy used to make me uh follow Brody like all the time it's a that's such a fun interesting thing to do too like because what what else is left right at that point you know headspace yeah it's in there in such a different place that it's just one to piece it back together and ya figure it out Jamar you get a lot of those freaky spots yeah man you ever had to follow Brian Holtzman [Laughter] well he's just so crazy he'll say so much crazy shit that the audience is just like stunned yeah it's like Brody times really never see Holtzman funny as fuck yeah I don't I don't think I have yet oh my god dude Holtzman said some of the darkest shit I've ever seen anybody say on stage he went on stage after do you member Susan Smith that lady that drowned her kids she was a lady that she drowned her kids I forget like what the context of it was Holtzman went on stage like two days later like I heard those were bad kids I heard they sat that close to the TV they never put away their blocks they fuckin spilt their milk those kids will not be missed when you say that maybe I have her brows dude September 11th Mitsy wouldn't let him go on stage off stage potential like riot well he's a really funny guy in a really good comic but he's never been a professional like his whole life I've been doing comedy forever when I came to the store in 94 Holtzman was already there and he's never been a professional he's always had a job he's always been he was a dog catcher he was a meter maid like a bunch of different shit you know he's never never really branched out yeah Eleanor's telling me you fought Martin Lawrence is a bodyguard you call it that you could say I would say Martin Lawrence's bodyguard beat the fuck out of Brian Holtzman Martin Lawrence was heckling oh and Holtzman's on stage he's saying crazy shit people in the room and Martin was heckling apparently and Brian got offstage to point out that it was Martin Lawrence he's like look this fucking rich famous motherfuckers heckling me Oh gets knocked out by oh it was in a parking lot it was a showcase the stories get twisted stories get weird after a while yeah but yeah that was those were the dark days of the comedy store that was like I want to say that was like I don't even know if that was the 2000s what is it now I haven't really been in and like I've kind of been but I like is it now like still that place where you go experiment try out I do yeah Jamar is actually though I go to see Jamar wait like when I go it's usually there like it like whatever 1:00 a.m. shit right that's like great I just hit him up me like hey I'm going up I'm gonna do some crazy shit you coming through oh yeah I love it one o'clock sets it's a different world it's a different it's experimental it's strange it's kind of sad there's a little bit of sadness yeah yeah those late-night cuz you like you looking at you watch like why am I not at home why am I not asleep I remember that feeling my first time going to the economy store just being like what like why am i sad like just like this thing that just weighs you like I I remember feeling kind of like worthless no just like kind of like the prey just it really feels like a ghost is choking you up it's like a weird ghost I'll have me a pic pick one there's a lot of ghosts in that room and they come when everyone's gone that's when they show up you think for oh no no I don't think for real like you'll see them but you definitely feel like weirdness ya know there's a weird especially when you bomb you get that cold well you know he bombed there too there's some classic famous stories about prior bombing as he was filming live in the Sunset Strip like some of this logic had the footage oh really yeah the show Tom had like the footage of the that show oh the show we was prepping like was getting ready yeah well no no like the show we're just they can go like you know even want to see of them yeah well they filmed that you know that strip show where he had to come back the next night and I kind of redo it he just had like he was just he you know operated from such a place of just like it was so hot it had to be honest to him I think and he had just hadn't gone up in a while and was on stage and was just like in the room and just sat in it just he just said there's footage is crazy see me that Wow yeah it's really who's got the footage well it's in the doc you can see it in a document like a little bit but I think it's extended for that I haven't seen the extended footage if that exists but there's some great old cassettes that I bought from like a gas station there were red foxes comedy club red fox had a comedy club and Pryor would go up and just fuck around man just fuck around and there was many of them I mean there was like seven or eight recordings Mavericks flat I think it was right that was the name of the company I think so awful like Crenshaw or something over there like like oh where the club was yeah I don't know I got him when I was living in Boston I was living in Boston and I found them like at a gas station they were for sale oh yeah and it was crazy because it was like it was small crowd you tells a small crowd and prior was just fucking around man he was just he was ad libbing you could tell that like it wasn't structured and some of it was really funny and some of it like kind of fell flat and yeah and you could hear that the clink of glasses and shit in the background it was just so real rich you know Richard Pryor back then he was doing something that it's like he had figured out a thing that he could do that other people hadn't figured out and that thing was like just be totally honest and also just explore ideas on stage in front of people like not even have it mapped out yet just just fuck around and find what's funny and he'd be smoking cigarettes and just talking and he figured out a way to turn and then you would see it boiled in to like Richard Pryor live or live on the Sunset Strip or any of his specials you'd see it boiled down into that yeah yeah doing it for tell it you know he performed for television really well um and that's like kind of an element that uh I think people kind of forget that like how well of a it connected with you watching it at home like you know even me 20 30 years later after it's filmed and just watching it with my dad it it's he plays really well here you mean like to you it's like you can feel how personal how honest it is and like so when it was like boiled down it was just he was also captured really well do you ever see him live no Pryor yeah wait how do you think I know he was alive doing stand-up 10 years ago yeah maybe a little bit more maybe 15 years ago when he died maybe it was more than 15 years ago but I'm thinking about it did you ever see him live yeah I had a I had a follow him like five weeks in a row really where like a run in 2005 he died okay so was more than like a run he did a run before he died it was probably right before then actually I want to say it was like the late 90s early 2000 somewhere around then he was real sick and they would have to carry him to the stage and it would take like five minutes for him to get to the stage so that he introduced him and the comic would get out of the way and then chewy and Marilyn Martinez his husband would help him walk to the stage they would hold onto him take him to the stage and would take forever it was a slow process and they'd get him and they'd sit him down and they'd crank up the mic like this because his voice was so soft people and yeah yeah and he would do stand-up well do like 15 20 minutes and then I would go on after him almost every time it would be me and just eat shit first of all nobody knew who I was a second of all they just saw Richard Pryor and they're sad because he's fading away yeah right in front of everybody yeah it's an interest to feel like you never before is like a British type and a mission Ben needed more you know 15 minutes people go smoke cigarettes come back what year did you start doing stand-up 2008 yeah so you missed it yeah did you go to clubs at all before then to look around no well two nights before my first time two nights before your first time I went to the comedy store Wow yeah did you my first day in LA my first day in LA I saw the whole show 9:00 to 2:00 a.m. Wow you sat through the whole show the whole show did the open mic that Sunday whoa that's an experience man the people that do that man that's like running an ultra marathon like see ya know when I am - - it's interesting I can watch em I can watch it you know I can consume like a high volume of it in in a lot of cases like you know I'm I've always been interested in like whatever people are talking about you know like and it was just an interesting sampler like what's fascinating about the store there's the 15-minute blocks that you're seeing these completely different viewpoints mm-hmm 15 minute chunks you know it's like if you sit there for long enough you sit there for like a couple hours and you watch that many different people you watch eight different people go up it's like it's very weird yeah it's a the strength of it I think for like what stand-up is especially like right now what it helps is it allows you to think of yourself in context um and that's kind of that's that's more important now than ever especially what stand up if you're on and you're competing against the 3,000 other specials that came out right right it's in context of you know kind of mass consumption so if you're going up you know in the middle of a marathon show you're going up in the oh are in the middle of a show and they saw eight comics before you they'll see nine after you or whatever right you have to like kind of sketch a place in their minds in context of everything else that they saw that night it's really important so are you going like are you gonna like okay so what haven't they said well no you can't do that because they you know media so it it forces you it's not saying like you know it's not saying change who you are I think it makes a more dynamic version of who you are like because you have to be memorable in the in context of all of these people and these different styles also you know I think what you do cuz you're whatever you make and you release into the world you are also releasing in the context of other art that people are consuming right so like even if you release your stand-up album you know a lot of times we will buy stand-up albums by standup albums you know and like so they listen to you in context of the other stand-up albums that you have like it's it's a strong comparison culture stand-up has write it like hip hop where it's always in relation it's not this is my favorite rapper is this rapper is better than that rapper right right you know and comedians and consumers of it you know it's a lot of Association so it's like you know it should force you to be you specifically you that's needed more than ever before right you know like like you need to be yourself completely or if your character that character needs to be hammered the fuck down yeah and who you are changes depending upon your environment that's one of the things about the store like since I've come back to the store it's tightened me up it's made me better coming back to the store because it's like being in that environment being in that pressure cooker we're around all these other creative people and everybody's constantly getting after it ya know it's great it's a really good kind of artist colony at its best it can operate like that we even just kind of run our own his best like I remember nights when we would run in between rooms even before get in spots just to go see each you know each room different comedians and you just kind of absorb it and watch it and get excited about yeah you could do three different sets in that place and have three different universes like you're in the belly room then you're in the main room in the oor that's three different world yeah they really are yeah completely different it changes people to like that's one of the reasons why Kinnison became who he was because he was doing those late-night spots he was doing those same spots that like Holtzman gets those those late spots and he just had to capture people's attention so you just go out there screaming yeah I mean I really I mean he you know speaking of existing in context of area he is the like that is a style that's just completely created from frustration yeah of the other could other comedians create Sam Kinison other comedians and ex-wives you know and Xbox I mean he he had like I mean everybody had ex-wife jokes you know there was a lot of that take my wife please you know that kind of shit mm-hmm there was a lot of wife jokes and ex-wife jokes but Kennison what he did was just screaming you know it was just it was just raw and you looked at him this is a little fat balding guy and you're like oh yeah he probably had a real rough time of it the what you just believe is hatred that video is watching no Sam Kinison it was like really late night and maybe it was like 1 o'clock in the morning he was like every comment just gets worse yeah well he also came from he was a preacher so he had this ability to just rant and rave from project and he knew the retina and he knew that the fucking he had this thing that he would do that was very much like like a revival tent like one of those tent preachers I remember watching him on a merit with children with my dad that's why I personal it was brilliant on there was he on a show where he played like someone's conscience yeah yeah it's funny how you discover people like you see him on there with children anyway he shot a wall way shot they fucking fix though the sign at the Comedy Store I was so depressed when I came back I'm like always fix the Kinison hole why would you fix the bullet hole he shot shot a hole through the fucking sign in the parking lot you know that sign that's near the the back walkway the one that you know in the corner they fixed it oh it's not there anymore why did he do it it's he's crazy oh he had a gun I think it was him and I swear in some sort of a fight he pulled out a gun and blam he shot the sign he tried to shoot dice I'm like no I think he just wanted dice to know that he would shoot about he's coked out of his annex preacher by the way it wasn't it was not that was on at the same time the show is called Charlie Hoover really yeah Wow I remember him standing on a show I remembered the image of that he was like the the devil conscience type character right is that what it was Thanks Tim Matheson is oh wow look at that is it Tim Matheson the guy from Animal House right yeah yes bill I think why I confused it Herman's head had four people in his head and Madhu she like there's no more there's a reason we're scrambling for the name they have for him with Alex Jones look give those back to those images he just had go back to the images scroll down scroll down look Alex Jones is in the middle of that that's not even Kinnison Wow that's Alex that was a great head shot him screaming yeah no he was uh he's the guy who got me into comedy really in a lot of ways cocaine Sam Kinison family entertainment our hmm yeah he got me into comedy cause I thought comedians were I thought it was like people who go on tonight's show and had their sleeves rolled up you know ever notice here's a crazy thing folks yeah like that I enjoyed watching that but it never seemed like me I couldn't I couldn't see myself doing oh it's people got to stop doing that they got to stop doing it like why are you doing it your Tonight Show set and your Colbert's not even they block is so fucking disrespectful they block shoot these things he's like like it's they'll do like ten comedians at a time and he's not even there and they'd like throw to it as if you know like he's it's the rudest thing I've ever heard and the fact that comedians still go on the show and would still do it is insane to me wow I didn't know that's it that's the sane of it so how many they do in a row I heard like 10 I could get the number but he's not there it's not you know you're just doing like this show in front of this audience in the studio and it pretends to throw to you and you know see you like you there and it's like this thing that's like there's nothing there no well it's again man like but it's on it's on us as much as it's like you know of course they're gonna do that they're gonna do that to any you know any genre of entertainment that would such a thing to happen they will do it to you right you know they're not gonna do Briana's doing a these these things are so contrived like it's the same set you come out in front of same curtain people put on the same outfit that they didn't wear yesterday and with never wear again tomorrow and they come out and they pretend to be a comedian from 1993 who the fuck are you who the fuck are you what are you fucking doing for a set to get passed around to a couple of agents that want to come see you that you yes I was talking to feel Vaughn about this we were talking we were talking about like whether it's worth it being on one of those shows oh no it's never it's never worth it capturing yourself not as yourself right it's a waste of your time it used to be worth something this is why it's confusing because there was no venues before so when Johnny Carson would have you on The Tonight Show yeah yeah no and that was listen it served its purpose it was very important at the time it was an outlet where there weren't a lot of outlets and now those times of God we do it yeah especially unless it's like but you know what that said you know Kimmel built he built like a club like to enhance like the audience travel from the studio to the club and the comedians would do it there and it's like oh that's like an effort you know to mean like an effort to create like a so yeah it was like a space a separate studio that like you know I believe that still don't I don't know if I've seen like a camel sex and upset recently but but but there was like an effort you know I always really appreciated that about like like camel like you know at least try like I don't know just try there are too many options and for comedians to go through the same filter of capturing themselves in a way that's not authentic to them so you're saying that if I go on Colbert I should do it with my shirt off if you want to purpose you don't mean like like you should you should do it like you do of regular set in the belly room yeah well I mean because it's like you know if stand-up is art right if it's it's or if it is an art form then it's supposed to be like the medium is supposed to come to the artists unique to you not the other way around right you know because even even on those same shows you know if you see a lot of music performance like the staging is different it's specific to the audience you know in the context of a show and a black production and you have this space they fill it in the way that makes sense to the artist yeah and then it's like stick it up it's like you could just go to a slide show just the exact say think you know I guess when a musical artist gets on Colbert one of those shows they're already kind of famous right they already have an album out and when a stand-up gets on those shows they're trying to get seeing him like maybe you don't have a special yet maybe just you showcased and they picked a few people you've done any of it I don't do any of those yeah like I I was gonna do Letterman wild Letterman was on Letterman and I remember like sending a set in or whatever and they responded like okay you know we could do it but could he do his jokes in a more traditional setup punchline format and I remember just like emailing back well I'll just do it when I'm famous I'm just not gonna listen to this bullshit know people they change that's the other thing they change us again compare yourself to a musician imagine you're a musician going on and they're like we like this song but could the bridge come first right and then you do the you would be like go fuck yourself right and comedians allow like you can't say pop-tart if you say Papa exactly comedians allow a lot of shit say pastry can you say pastry but that doesn't make any sense well we just trying to hit the road run toaster strudels trying to hit the roads right no man do you man I wouldn't do it even back in the day it didn't make any sense to me they would go you should put together a five-minute set for this a night show and I'm like I don't want to do it and they're like you should do it like it's it's good exposure this is like the fucking 90s right when it actually probably meant something I was like I don't I don't see it happening I'm not doing hey it's it's not stand up you're you're you're taking a little piece of a stand up a short set is 15 minutes and in 15 minutes I might cover two concepts you know yes I need time yeah I go over things like I get thorough if I'm if I'm talking about a subject I get involved in that subject I want to I want to bring people on a journey and I also want to be able to set them up I want to be able to explain how I think about things so that by the time I get to something controversial they already have a sense of how I approach things you can't do that in five minutes in five minutes you just gotta just get into it yeah and it's it's a very condensed homogenized version of who you really are man just do it just do a late-night spot with a five-minute set up and leave just aside yeah just the setup shake yeah I remember I saw Louis do one louis c.k did one one of those Letterman or Tonight Show or something like that and I was like god he shouldn't even do this because this it's not it's such not a good representation of what he's capable of well some people are like Jerry Seinfeld should do yeah yeah he he does I love Jerry's uh like Tonight Show sets yeah and he's like what like his make sense yeah it makes sense it makes sense it's like perfect for and is like it translates very very well well when I watch those shows today I'm like why are they still a thing when I see a late-night show and no disrespect to anybody who hosts a late-night show but to me it's like it's like they took a boat and tried to turn into a plane in 2018 but let's pretend it's not yeah we'll be right back with a commercial hey we're commercials commercials and things but today everybody watches HBO and Netflix like what am I doing here sit into a fucking commercial I get um it may be weird like cuz I actually I enjoy advertising do you do yeah yeah like a lot I'll stare it like billboards i watch commercials watch like oh because I do think it speaks to what like America thinks we are hmm as a culture right I mean it speaks to what they think and what they think is going to work and so in a sense it's like like in a way in the same sense like you can gauge a lot from a person by the types of questions they ask you you know you engage a lot from like even a climate by the type of commercials what they feel is because they're trying to appeal to everybody so this is what they're saying this is what we think everybody is thinking right now yeah you know or how everyone feels or what they want and like but I love like I'll watch it and even like The Tonight Show and those are these things I mean look you know anything in function at its best is fun it's just you know the where it hits a wall and just what we're saying about comedy and what we're saying about a lot of things is like when a thing tries to be something that it's not right you know when it feels like these late-night shows when they're just doing fun things that they think are fun and interesting I love you know Kimmel always every year does like the parents to tell the kids that no Halloween that they ate all the Halloween candy yeah and the kids reactions and stuff like I eat that stuff up I love that sketches are fun but but like when it you know when shows pretend to be you know 1989 it's just like when comedians pretend to be of a different era or pretend it just feels false and I think that's where you check out yeah it's just unnecessary at this point you know because the internet you you just have too many other venues yeah well you it's a lot of options yeah a lot of options yeah and the vent like Washington and it's so much more satisfying it's like watching a comic on a podcast you gonna get his chance a chance to see who the fuck they really are yeah instead of some weird set in front of some audience that got shipped in from Burbank and they got applause signs and everything it's very surreal when you go to a live taping and you watch that it's really surreal oh it's very like and I'll sit I I have like you know it's always we have weird late-night because I like I'm bad at being like the you know celebrity type of thing like I'm just in it and just like looking at it and when the crowd is giving an unnatural reaction to things is just like what are you right you to introspect if you're not gonna just dive in like hey no but hey bro what are we doing what is this like what do you is this rewarding for you thank you we'll be right back that we'll be right back shit like where you going you probably put the advertisement model of shoving an ad in every 15 minutes to shoving a series of ads in yeah how the fuck did they ever do that like had well I mean look you know unfortunate reality or fortunate reality I guess depends on you know what company you work for is I mean that's it's an advertiser's medium right and everything they'll find a way to put the commercials even with the internet you know like yeah YouTube becomes traditional television those like they all did the internet commercials are longer than the TV commercials maybe two minutes you can skip them do you get two minute ones now don't think I like don't think I like minute just like ones you know excited when I see a 15-second one I just sit here gonna sit through Ron Howard's master class so good huh but they even sometimes you'd be like damn this is too long even if it's 15 seconds I'm looking up commercials and I hate having to watch a commercial to watch a commercial or like some type of you know to be like some type of or like a trailer to something I'm like oh now I have to sit through this trailer to watch the trailer that it's true that a commercial does kind of show you what what they think the culture is about right now yeah yeah what they think people are interested in right now yeah like what what a real manipulative mainstream version of what the average we think I mean is they did we depress - well a lot of people are you're not depressed by some people are you know a lot of people are like what percentage do you think I mean it's probably more than 20% of Americans are depressed yeah let's just say guess what a recent poll shows it's not gonna give us a real good idea but I'll say 20% 20% of Americans suffer from depression what do you think the form of the press always saying specifically depression are we saying like mental not illness yeah because depression is defined yeah because I'm just saying it's the reason it's hard to quantify is because it's like it also is the thing that comes in phases or post events like specific like depression you don't I mean that's all I'm just wondering how we're and I can't believe it's not as easy as man get over that shit like it's hard to like it's like wow you got a cancer event based thing like if something has happened that sparks like sadness yeah I forget that there's more than one reason to be the first white 6.7% six sixteen point two million adults in the United States at week equalling six point seven percent of all adults in the country have experienced a major depressive episode in the last year ten point three million US adults experienced an episode that resulted in severe impairment in the last year Wow fifty percent of all people diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder it's estimated that 15 percent of the adult population will experience depression at some point in their lifetime like post but what does it mean though like if your dog dies what does that mean you lose a job girlfriend breaks up with you yeah yeah yeah play post event I went through I remember going through like a real kind of dark period after losing a friend like happened twice of just like and and I'm very much so I I get the Gemara mortality of just like depression right that's a good question yeah I don't know ethically like where the line is as humans like it isn't it just highs and lows highs and lows deal with this don't deal with a you know deal with that what the happiness deal with it's like it's highs and lows but it's is your expectation of what the next phases that your expectation like it's all there's also legitimate issues that people have like with mental problems their brain doesn't produce hormones yes there's these people legit serotonin and dopamine shoes oh you don't have friends your friend fuck you boss no you're fired and you know got a wife okay and your dogs gone where's your dog Oh your friend took your dog be my favorite episode of Frasier yeah people have a rough man some people's you know some like some people have leukemia some people are genetic disorders some people's brains don't work right and for whatever reason whether its nature or nurture there's something going on that's real bad and you know they're just they're in a whole re-described it really well he did a podcast recently with me and he talked about he went through a serious depression episode where he was suicidal and his brain was just the way he described it's like it was broken and I had to get it fixed and he started off on medication and weaned himself off on medication but when he was on the medication that's also when his career took off and when his career took off I mean alleviated a lot of the the what a lot of his issues were was also just like an unfulfilled life frustration expectation unrealized and then on top of that compounded there was like legit mental issues yeah that would bother him I guess I was just unclear on like what depression actually is like I'm like because now as you say that something like maybe I have felt that everybody feels highs and lows right about that you're first you're right about that but you also exercise a lot and I think that probably helps yeah I'm yeah just soup it myself up in my head and shit well no exercising just releases releases a lot of that bullshit that people carry around a lot of the what makes people feel terrible is that their body is fighting against their brain their body holds in so much tension and they're they're so fucked up and they never get an endorphin release and their body's like an overflowing battery like oozing out of the sides you know and I always like but people don't meditate like they don't work for people like that shit works shit kills it for me how often you meditate everyday like how much time 20 minutes oh that's good man look that is a beautiful thing if you could force that into your schedule and and make sure that that's a part of your life I got it from Seinfeld and Oprah and now TM yeah yeah like ya know it's I mean doesn't me activate something that knows half which is like so we're supposed to kind of do that though it allows you reflection and also what I think it does one of the really good things that meditation does is it stops momentum because it's like a momentum of shitty thoughts and bad ideas and bad decisions and just anxiety and all these issues that could fuckin just accumulate inside your consciousness yeah and they never when unaddressed they continue to like push hit you from the back and it's like you're just constantly the state of momentum of all the bullshit that's going on but if you have a time for real reflection and just pause even if you're just concentrating only on your breath one it seems to stop that momentum and give you a chance at like a renewed perspective yeah remember a time I had a spiritual awakening in your house I was watching like a Seinfeld interview or something he was like yeah he'd do it twice a day and something I was like let me see so I went there I used to live with him so I used I went downstairs in my room I meditated and I came back upstairs notes like he was sitting on the couch smells like I was like garage nigga I just had an awakening he was like what happened I'll know man but the first the first message I got was a you can't save the world but you could help he was like okay so when you do it what's your process like what is what would how exactly do you practice TM I sit there cross my legs in through the nose out the mouth in through the nose out the mouth you get into the state also though has the ability to completely clear his mind like he's one of those people that uh it takes me anywhere from 20 minutes so like an hour to fall asleep you know like even if tired it's still like alright there's a mall Jamar could immediate like immediately just like all right I'll being an awake is over all right and then just fall asleep like instantaneously he can clear his head really quickly I like focus on one thing so so you go in through the nose out through the mouth and what are you thinking when you're doing that nothing nothing just are you thinking about the breathing well I think about nothing and then if I have a task or something like a floppy like you could do affirmations you know like like hey man I wanted I want to be great on stage tonight or or I want to I want to get this writing done or I want to you know I'm saying or you can hype yourself up and shit like that like um your intention it's it's just that whatever intention that you want to do you know I'm saying you set that hey I wanna you know whatever the fuck and then it'll be easier to complete that task for me I have a DD I'm bad at focusing on things but that really helps me you have a DD but you don't have a problem annotating yeah because it because it's the lazy it's it I can grill get it being lazy and it's kind of lazy to write like meditating that's kind of like if you like mushrooms and all that yeah you know it's it's perfect for you like it's getting high off your own DMT that's what it is it's just your own DMT the spirit molecule that's it I don't know if it's that I don't you know tripping right it is it's a it's it's kind of you ever do it right no I going through phases where I've like tried meditation I shower for an hour 15 minutes so that's kind of just kind of walk around and think yeah yeah I kind of you know I don't know i I've tried it but it's not oh but you work out though and it's you know those endorphins that you you can just do that you could also do that by just sitting there and just breathe and you know focusing on the breath and and all of a sudden your mind starts going into an altered state and then you'll start yeah I meditate I just don't meditate every day but I definitely feel it I think exercise does that especially cardio and especially yoga something about yoga classes that just forces you into this state of mind we just are you're only concentrating on the movements that you're supposed to do and so if you could clear your head and stay focused on the movements and not delve into you know your bank account are you fucking credit card debt or what's wrong with your car what other bullshit you have bounced around your head and you can just take the time to concentrate only on the yoga it has this like cleansing effect it it really makes you be like my fuck does it yeah fuck that shit most things most things are not worth freaking out about most the vast majority a good question remember reading is just ask yourself what problems do I have right now but genuinely like problems and the answer may not always be zero but it's usually surprisingly small when you think about like the immediate you know not the you know the base level of Maslow's hierarchy right you know like like if that's taken care of usually it's like oh I don't read you know there are things that are ongoing things to figure out but like things that you could define as like a problem and then just kind of staying in that space yeah like you know like a control issue like what's a real issue well where there's like immediacy like you know and and when when there are real problems you know a lot of times you you handle it well like it instinctually the things like a lot of times people get calmed in like those intense situations but you know like they can handle like real problems it's the anticipation of problems and the anticipation of solutions that that's what drives you crazy it's a very good point yeah that's a very good point yeah a lot of times real problems they also sort of enlighten you to the fact that most of the time your problems are bullshit you know you break your leg you're oh this is yeah that's it immediate yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and so just staying in the space of like you know all right I can you're in a control center you go you know you know what else what helps me is like because yoga is hard to do doing things that are difficult to do make things easier make other things easy working out hard workouts make other things easier yeah yeah running hills kickboxing anything so it gives context it gives context to everything makes Hollywood interactions easy yeah you know what I mean like it gives context yeah what is the struggle yeah it's like well it's like you know some of these by the time you get on stage you're like well my body thought it was gonna die this morning yeah yeah this is fine yeah no this tag doesn't work do you guys know very many people who do you Jitsu no and by very many I mean you know skill people ever because they're getting choked all the time did fighting for their life every day so there's so much trained killer is trying to break their arms if the experience is not that been cool then it's like whatever man yeah we you know the world is pretty soft right now it's it's easy to get upset about nonsense if nonsense is the only thing that you have that's a difficulty in your life well it's that and it's the reward for complaints mmm it's like a culture that we are rewarded for publicly you know yeah for having a public completion me um well rewarded in the sense of like you know you get you can get attention for you can get attention for light yeah but I'm just saying by publicly airing you know agreements about a project and I'm speaking especially specifically about how we responded content is like by publicly saying this you can speak to your respective group and you have an immediate reward for it so it's like you know it's like I don't even know if we're more sensitive we're just more outspoken about you know things well cuz we have an awfully more outraged they're looking to get outraged that's that's a really common thing now that just didn't exist if you did but don't even think it I don't even think it's outrage you know what I mean I really don't think it's outraged as much is it because outrage we've seen what outrage looks like at the when at the peak of like the black lives matter movement with more people at a course by people outraged yeah but that's in the streets but that is what I'm saying but that's what that's what outrage is and I don't want to confuse that with like you know a tional recreational outrage right and it's really important to draw that distinction right and so it's like it it's again people are vocal about things some issues real a lot of things we start getting upset about they're like certain we get upset about certain cultural appropriation things of the week because there's a sushi restaurant on a college campus right like we get caught up in those things but in and not focus on you know like I don't know it's like real outrages the thing that corporations are afraid of is an outrage it's trending you don't want to trend negatively for like whatever period of time when when people are upset with you and that you've done something genuinely wrong they'll show it be on it will extend beyond it make sense yeah yeah I think that a lot of what outrage is is like comedian trying out jokes you know you try out jokes and 30% of them are just straight bullshit he try them they stumble out you gave it a shot or you ad-lib something in the moment on stage and even after you say like what the fuck that I just say yeah I think there's some of that that people are trying to cut like I was reading this article the other day about some woman who's saying that yoga is supporting white supremacy because it was the dumbest shit ever some Indian lady she was saying the cultural appropriation of yoga by white people is supporting white supremacy and you know it's really fun what are we doing exactly what the fuck are we doing but that's what she did is she tried a bad joke you know yeah she's uh she works on out she's a professor who some bullshit college where they're just just drowning in liberal arts and she just figured out a way to say something outrageous that she thought made sense in her own weird bubble but this got published in a newspaper and then the whole world went just collectively what the fuck are you talking about yeah but that's what it's like it's like you or I trying a bit late night at the store you do it you just just riff something and it just goes into a corner and just get stuck when them Roomba vacuum cleaner things is bouncing off the Y like this is not working yeah I got a bail out of this yeah it's a creative force she's like she tried to make outrage where it didn't exist and sometimes he catches right like hoop earrings like girls can't wear hoop earrings any more scared to wear hoop earrings because they're getting called out for cultural appropriation by which is hilarious by latina chicks this is particularly latina chicks are set and it's just all social justice warrior bullshit but what's really funny is so I had a because I'm an asshole I had a Google it well who the fuck invented earrings the Sumerians the the oldest version of hoop earrings is for 2500 BC Iraq so Iraqis are the only ones who really can claim cultural appropriation on people wearing hoop earring I'll not Mexicans some Mexicans settle down leave those white girls alone because you stole it - I thought that was black girl shit is everybody shit it's like who invented pants you coach you appropriating you're wearing pants who invented pants you're on a Korean phone bitching about talking about my hands deep it's crazy people losing their mind they're looking for things get outraged at and so that they're trying jokes they're taking swings you know the giant pitches out there you know yes pit balling well I mean and eventually if it's like if you you're gonna run out of ways to approach it you know I mean like you've run out of run out of places to stab the thing well they try some that don't stick or some stick for like a couple days like remember bossy they're trying to say you can't say bossy no I call girls bossy it's sexist cross girls bossy don't call him boss be sexy it was a thing where they were trying to stop the use of the word or the phrase bossy they were saying bossy sexist yeah see but like where did a when when did a wind it can't become a bad word it depends on who's like what is that heard the heard it used into like I mean nobody I didn't grow up around it I didn't hear people saying it so I'd only think I heard it used until like I mean I was ya know it's word that when you used it you fucking really were angry yeah yeah it's just I don't know where it came for it's like the new bitch it's not new I mean it was around a long it's been around so I was in high school but you called someone a cunt in high school I mean you were a fighter brother shit would get deep you couldn't be say cunt you could say bitch you're a fucking bitch fuck you you're a loser you know like yeah you're caught oh wow what the fuck did you just say asked yeah I I didn't hear it a lot and I could never imagine myself casually call him some money yet cunt but if you lived in England you could Australia they call someone a good cunt he's a good cut oh so it's a nice word yeah he's like he's a he's a he's a good dude he's a good cunt like people have friend israel edison style bender he wears a shirt that says good cunt and he wanders routes from new zealand they don't people they think it's good set people get upset about it he's a savage you better be careful get upset with him okay yeah he's uh I mean he's he's from another country it means a different thing New Zealand if you say can't in New Zealand it's it's like I mean what's the equivalent will be equivalent of cunt the way they say it I good dude he's a fuck good fucker he's uh he's a cool motherfucker he's a good cunt were you asking because no one says shit but they sell good cunt hashtag fuck censorship hashtag make cut great again well I was gonna say is it that was just like people's reaction to it just kind of bother ya yeah I'm like I'm like that's a it's a terrible about not a terrible bad word like that word sucks like no motherfucker you don't like it's fun to say you know rhythmically it's just trash it's like I'm but I was going awfully interesting shit trash I don't know if you went to Australia though they would say it so many times it would just slip in yeah it's normal yeah I guess yeah it is just it's just one syllable like it means dude over there sometimes like and this fucking cunt he goes over there and they'll start talking about it like this fucking dude they'll still literally say it in the same way you would say this fucking guy yeah it's just a different thing look they're all just sounds that convey expression the world problems when you demonize one you say you know you can't say the c-word anymore don't say to see you well yeah I mean again it's just like I just want us to have like adult arguments yeah right well it's hard to have adult arguments even forbidden words well yeah well because that's like the shit that your sister got mad at you about growing up right you called me that you know is kind of like that's the thing it's a I mean you were saying intention earlier but I mean it's always like intentionally what do you mean but I get it I get in like these types of my mom Southern Christian woman in any curse word that I say any curse word is very she she doesn't she doesn't like it and I I curse around all the time yes I always do just because a we get into the argument while simultaneously respecting you know her views and beliefs it's also like you know these cuss words redid your fucking kitchen lady I love watching her like react to it like it's like fun yeah yeah because just like all this through the filter of you like really you know see I grew up non suppressed my parents were hippies and they didn't give a shit what we said just I couldn't really say it at school mm-hmm but you know there was no like language restrictions in my house allowed to say anything that's great it was weird as girl that my friends would come over the house did you say fucking from your mom I can't fuck it I used to you were did you go from people that like used to just talk shit back today mom is like it was never did that you know it was fun my favorite moments of life is just like we can't I came to his house after school and his mom's name is Patricia and she was just like I'll take out the garbage he was like go to hell pet like my mind was blown this Elise told his mom to go to hell it was like amazing and she just argued back like it was like oh yeah I was single mama was a dad around uh he knows that but it wasn't around like things up for me yeah yeah but it was always really amazing it was amazing that's a struggle that who's the man when did you start cussing around your mom um no I probably started a I'm a moved out I was a teenager so I probably I mean she's hurt me to say it kind of threw up but just ain't like not stopping it in conversation it's been years I mean I just always just kind of low-key still afraid to come from yeah Kirsten from Omaha I cut in front of my niece and nephew just how old are they all of money I have a an 11 year old niece a nine-year-old nephew a couple two year old twins a 3 year old niece like just and I am myself and speak exactly how I normally speak around them you're an adult longer than you're a kid right you know and so it's just like why am I going to pretend the world sounds different look I I'm with you but whose kids are they your brothers you see my brother your brothers and sister everybody cool with that or they get upset uh I mean they go like a couple sometimes but it's also they get it they got my brother there they're very understand while they they get it they get that it's just like how people talk it's how were yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm anthing that's important again like you don't want to that's the thing man just like this you know you fucked up if you're at a job where not only cannot swear but you can't swear off job with the people you work with or there's that hell or they'll get yeah you can get trouble yeah you if there's certain jobs where people have where they they got off work and they went out with some co-workers and they told a dirty joke or start talking shit like that'll get back to human resources and they'll be fired bosses are now following their employees on line and said like twisted that girl that got fired from NASA fucking hilarious from NASA yesterday fuck I got a job at NASA and some guy tweeted her he said language and she said suck my dick and balls I work at NASA yeah and he said yeah and I am you know one of the people that oversees something at NASA and then well she was about to be an intern working at NASA oh look here it is everyone shut the fuck up I got accepted for a NASA internship and look he writes language she says suck my dick and balls I'm working at NASA and he says I'm on the National Space Council that oversees NASA first of all that shit is funny talking about that ya know III I could I could be convinced you know I was we didn't for a long time now I'm convinced I have no fucking idea yeah really it's I don't think we want to the moon makes you think off of base it's not rooted in science how much how much have you really paid attention to because I went down the rabbit hole I know many many years I sawed off kind of like it's always like the social kind of where there's smoke there's fire type moves of just like you know us being in a race and no countries come in second we're uh you know other space programs not catching up to 19 what 69 72 of American technology you know I mean like every time we went was under the Nixon administration that's a good one these types of little things that just make you go like you know like a flat earther but it's you've watched the press conference when they return from the moon no wait wait what's the clue in there the or what's this thing they look super depressed they look super deceptive they look fidgety yeah and they're they're they're talking weird and they're saying shit they refute later one of the things they said Michael Collins who's actually never he's supposed to be in he'd never landed on the surface of the Moon Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong did he stayed up in the orbiter and they were there asking about stars and he said I don't recall seeing any stars and then years later he wrote in his book about how magnificent stars looked there's a lot of that shit but the press policy that if you want and this doesn't mean anything I'm not cop but if I was a cop and I was interviewing them I'd be like these motherfuckers are guilty something is wrong here like they they seem like guilty people and you could look you could say hey man they were probably psychologically distressed they were probably dealing with the the pressure of having come back from the moon and all this fame that they had never experienced their whole life they're their astronauts their scientists and now the sudden they're standing in front of all these people and everyone's asking questions and they feel super nervous but like noddy's niggas was lying let me tell you everybody my favorite thing is when you and because I'll say it very casually and people become like you know Patriots and rocket science this is wanna show you like how we went I'm like you don't know either well this shit is bullshit because it wasn't you and it wasn't me yeah let's stop so we probably lied about it and we lie better than any other country on earth and I'm proud of it there's a lot of weird shit with the fit video footage there's a lot of footage where it looks like they're on wires so there's like dangling from wires and then they bounce back up from their feet in this weird way it looks like they're being yanked up from the ground there's a video where there looks like they're on trampolines looks like they're actually put it up it's the video that I found google astronauts on trampolines is a video on YouTube and you you're watching them bounce around you're like wait a minute wait a minute you guys are on the fucking moon and you're hiding behind the lunar module like you can't see their feet you can't see how they're doing this but it looks like either they're bouncing on something or they're being yanked up in the air or it's 1/6 gravity and it just has a weird effect on people but look at this watch this like how strange is this see look he just lands but doesn't I mean even the way he's he's moving it's like he's being dangled it's very strange ya see him bouncing around but that also could just we did we like playing golf with bouncing around like the moon landing set was built by the people who made Discovery Zone but it also could be just jumped up and fell that's so strange but it also could be this is just what your body does at 1/6 Earth's gravity you know there's a whole don't know you know it I'm excited to see this one's weird someone else going back to the moon and then if it matches this is from a movie I forget what was the name of the movie was but you could watch some of the go they show some special effects that used in movies but watch some of the weird shit go a little bit further ahead of this Yeah right there there's some of the weird stuff where you see these guys like fall down and then it looks like to just get yanked back up by wires it's very strange yeah I mean but the press-conference strange yeah it's it's not it's the social aspect of it because it's like I won't begin to know like how the flag is supposed to look in the waving and the shadows and the thing that like a lot of people argue about I it's just the political and so it's like I kind of think I know when the government's lying about something you don't mean like it the history is there watch this watch that guy stand back watch this watch how he gets up like you've gotten yanked up there's a bunch of those there's a bunch of those that makes it look like there are wires pulled back up to their feet very strange but again have you ever been in one six earth gravity I haven't no know what that may be maybe it just looks fake because when you're in one six earth gravity that's just how movement yeah do you think we never ever been live like a up until my my conspiracy belief is specific to thinking that a man has walked around on the surface of the specifics of that crashing you know lunar whatever that's all 100% yeah of course it's specifically man moving like this one yeah it's specifically that you don't think anybody has ever done this I don't think so now in life like everything I don't think I'm the press-conference some clips weird clips from the press conference because the press conference a trip you are and see and see just like other you know countries who have the means to do it like their intention about going yeah play place a mess place a mess and go big scream look how sad these guys look so weird watch this was our pleasure to have participated in one great adventure it's an adventure that took place not just in the month of July but rather one that took place in the last decade [Music] we all here and the people listening in today had the opportunity to share that adventure over its developing and unfolding in the past months and years it's our privilege today to share with you some of the details of that final month of July that was certainly the highlight for the three of us of that decade they just went to the moon and they all look like they just saw that Neil it looks so fake but again that could be this extreme nerves people that don't know how to handle being in front of press it could be introverts that are forced on the camera yeah it could be a lot of issues if you went to the moon and they you came back and you were sitting that press conference would you be at the fight like what would your what would your actions be would you be like yeah yeah or would you be like more light like certain it would be it would look like like like a Lakers press conference after they was they bring back like a rock or something in it oh sure they brought it back a lot brought back many rocks but some of them turned out to be petrified wood they gave one of them to wait that's a real yeah they gave a moon rock in 69 or 70 to this the Prime Minister of Holland whoever it was whatever whoever person runs Holland and years later they analyzed it in his petrified wood it was not a moon rock in fairness in fairness I do get there like by the time we got to Holland the gift baskets going to change when I given away the real moon rock to Holland yeah like that like you know right England gets a real moon rock yeah France gets a fine yeah dude so do you think about this Mars mission look that's all real look Rovers are real it's all the the technology is proven and legitimate and I don't think I'd ever faked anything today yeah like you could fake things in 1969 if they think if anything for sure what they did is it's been proven that they faked some footage for sure some photographs my quarter over the original again those little things like it's like you record it over the original you know world where even the importance of syndication was known I think they also lost the telemetry data which is like a binary hard ones and zeros that show the distance between the Earth and lunar module at every step of the trip they lost it yeah they lost that but you know then again you got to realize like people died and people are responsible for storage and no one's paying attention and there's funding and the funding gets pulled and this there's plausible reasons for some of the files I mean there are episodes of blossom being guarded and a vault somewhere in Burbank episodes of blossom you could get fucking money off a blossom you can't make any money off of these goddamn moon landing clips look there's some people that absolutely are convinced that we didn't go and I used to be one of them and I would love if they prove that it was fake it would make me more happy than anything else in the world you know what I may be very the the thing that keeps me holding on and maybe we went is a torte NASA once and they were nice those aren't the same people you know when people say like no lies okay but those were NASA from 1969 these are different humans yeah you know you're talking about 48 fucking years ago these are completely different human journeys they stand on the backs of liars yeah well mr. NASA so we can there and let us ask questions if you don't fucking lie what you say about the tour thank you my stopping by mr. NASA and allowing us to ask questions if you gonna walk I don't think they think they're lying I don't think they're involved if any if there was a conspiracy like say if they did fake the moon landing no one today who's alive was a part of that yeah except Buzz Aldrin he's the only one still alive but you know he he just said he punched a dude in the face yeah punched some guy what he said he was part zebra bart sibrel made a move I had dinner with him with the guys ebrill yeah yeah dinner with him many years ago and back when I was a full blown moon non-believer uh-huh and you know I'm contacted him got ahold of them took him to dinner and I like that you use your celebrity for good just like these real specific pockets of people that you just want to talk to you can see someone doing interviews you could see someone in an edited format and you kind of get a sense of who they are you don't really get a sense of who they are until you actually talk to them yeah you and him sharing a plate of pasta what was this what like what did he did he give us give you anything that's like gives context so like that moment or like just like why did it he was convinced he was absolutely convinced that it was a hoax and he what he was convinced was that there was a space race between US and Russia and that it was it was essentially a militarized space race and what they were trying to do is prove military superiority if you had the the rockets that could get you to the moon your technology was superior yeah and the way he framed it is like the United States had control over what was aired they put it on television and no one foresaw the future no one foresaw that one day you would be looking at these clips on YouTube and analyzing them and doom putting them in slow-mo they didn't even think that was gonna be a thing that works yeah and they were gonna show it black and white and they were gonna have it 3d projected so that you would projected on a screen and then people who were filming it would have to film the screen like they didn't even get a live feed when it was airing on television it was airing people filming the screen that it was being projected on so what yeah yeah they broke it down so it looked more and more grainy and fake like they if you were trying to do something that was not done to the technology of the day that would possibly obscure some fraud they did it all those ways there's so many things that they did that you you would go it's it's in and when in terms of like conspiracies it's a conspiracy theorist wet dream because if it is a fake it's the biggest fake of all time and there's so many things that are squirrelly about it there's so many things doesn't mean it's fake yeah but there's so many things has anybody been to them no no one's been to the moon since 1969 to 1972 those are the only trips they did seven attempts six of them successful Apollo 13 was the one that wasn't successful that was that big movie they landed on the moon and then came back seven times two hundred and sixty-two thousand miles away now here's where it gets crazy or plus or minus depending on where the moon bar what's crazy is two hundred sixty two thousand miles pretty far I'm thinking about oh that's three zeros what map or you see that no other human space mission where humans been a part of it since then has ever gone more than 400 miles from the Earth's surface is that where the space station is all the Space Shuttle missions everything so the guy you had dinner wit did what for Buzz Aldrin to Sock'em he told Buzz Aldrin he was a liar he said you're a liar and a crook and Buzz went after that it's I mean I'd imagine I don't know I don't know what he's doing no I mean the driver I mean immediately after no no the guy Bart's ebrill but I mean immediately after the punch is there any type of like I think he tried to press charges and the cops told him to go fuck off I think was one of those okay it was it wasn't the best punch either go to the hospital from that punch and buzz was like in his 80s at the time but he tried he fought he harassed a lot of those guys he harassed a lot of the astronauts and tried to get him to swear on Bibles he'd bring a Bible this Bible that you wanted the moon yeah I mean it was there was a lot of it's not a weird shit there's a another one that's a 25th anniversary of the Apollo moon missions he gives a speech at the White House in front of this group of honor roll students like some of the best students in the country mm-hmm the near arm John gives us real weird fucking speech it's like we have here amongst us submit you want to hear it what makes it weird when you'll see it you'll get it it's just real it doesn't mean we didn't go to the moon it doesn't mean by the way it's fucking weird it's really funny because I presented as like yeah I don't think we went and and I didn't even have half of what you're giving oh I'll give you away more it's like what's this you gonna watch this and held back tears as he spoke these brief cryptic remarks this is from a funny thing happened on the way to the moon farts ebro's movie but this is a real thing that happened among America's best to you we say we've only completed a beginning we leave you much that is undone there are great ideas undiscovered breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truths protective layers what he is okay does that mean a little unfair - it is when you add that fucking waka music to anything everything so incredibly creepy but true but it does sound like one of truth you can't get more cryptic yeah and you also can't get more it almost kind of sounds like he's like into the child who actually figures out how to go to the fucking moon there are great breakthroughs for those who can remove one of truce protective layers what would you write what would you rather the the moon confession or the r.kelly confession if you had to pick one actually made a song the r.kelly yeah I don't need that confession I'm good think the law is gonna have a piece of that you know our Kelly seems to be pretty Teflon but the moon confession would be fascinating I would be excited or like a moon like I don't know just I guess it's not on them to prove that they went so I'm saying like you know just some type of voice yes well 1969 it's a different world Nixon's president I don't know if they did lie I don't know yeah I used to think I knew I do not think I know I mean it's foolish I don't know jack-shit about astrophysics but I know if there was a lie you know if there's any president we would guess would be down it'd be Trump well no I'm saying well I'm saying like I'm saying like Nixon just like it is a perfect storm of like oh yeah it's Nixon yeah oh he's the most deceptive president of all time except the current one yeah so yeah it's I'm it it's very interesting I shut down a lot of barbecues what's that about just bring it up like now you have more information and by the way this is a fraction of the shit that I thought dude I did research yeah four years yeah I debated a scientist on Penn Jillette's radio show about it how did it go pretty good for me even though I don't even agree with some of the shit that I said back when where does that argument end on just the agree to this it was a time constraint I would do it far differently now I think far differently now that I did that I would not take this I know we didn't do it approach because I don't know we didn't do yeah no I and that's the thing I very casually go probably not yeah but it just the the things that don't add up to me don't add up in a way that just makes me go yeah do you know about the Van Allen radiation belts you know about all that I not enough to like there's a is a belt of radiation like a doughnut-shaped years of it just naturally surrounds the earth oh you know what I'm thinking about I'm thinking about the nevermind I'm think about the belt of from years of like satellites oh yeah yeah there's that shit too but there wasn't much of that in 1969 now what about it the Van Allen radiation belts is intense band of radiation for miles that that surrounds the earth that you would have to go through to get to the moon so they apparently though there's a hole that you could go through in the top where the the radiation belt isn't there but the idea is that there was no shielding to protect them from radiation they just were in this aluminum tin can you were touch or lunar module if they have there was a science exhibit I went to once that had a replica of the lunar module and you could put your hands on it it's like well this thing is really made of coke cans so weird looking there's also like photographs that are fucking wonky lights that go at two different angles they say well that's possible due to you know uneven terrain and you know things reflecting off of things all these different variables I really enjoyed just like playing around and Wow shuttle yeah it's like I'm you see I have this is this is you seen these you're another dude that walks around with a phone with no case on yeah this this is me on the you don't put a case on your phone dude no these jobs died so that we could feel with sleekness you're a risk-taker I like the feel of the phone that's what people do in the OL deGrasse Tyson was sitting in the very seat 24 hours ago said the exact same thing yeah he is with no case on either he's one of the reasons why I dropped it talking to him and I can he went yeah the idea well you know he hasn't he's dedicated his whole life to science no but I know but I'm just saying like it to the like the way that like that's part of it it's part of like the kid growing up this is what he's not an adulterer in conspiracy theories he's got too much other shit to think about that's real he's thinking about actual real science like he doesn't have time for that nonsense but he will illuminate you on why he thinks it's stupid and it would be an incredibly difficult task to fake that but it wouldn't be as difficult in 1969 as it would be in 2018 if you tried to do that in 2018 basically America I mean the Tuskegee Experiment existed you're gonna mean like it was just a six in his it went over what twenty years it was like a I don't know the exact no but it was like 20 years of history where this is happening and like not like so many things can just kind of happen under the did they give people syphilis or did yes given black men syphilis like it just like kind of like I don't even know what the research was exactly if it's like monitoring its effects or I think that was exactly yeah and and it was just yeah like 20 years at a the Tuskegee Hospital there are real conspiracies unquestionably undeniably real conspiracies like Gulf Tonkin what got us into the Vietnam War they pretended that a ship got attacked by North Korea or by North Vietnam and was at North Vietnam whatever it was by Vietnam in the South Pacific and this motivated everybody to get into war with Vietnam never happened fake made it up Operation Northwoods 1962 signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff vetoed by President Kennedy it was a a signed order where they were gonna plan out fake attacks on America they were gonna launch a drone jetliner and blow it up in the air and blame it on Cuba they were gonna arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay they're gonna pay them arm them to attack Guantanamo Bay and then it would give us the motivation to go to war with Cuba this was all signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff they're going to sacrifice American lives they're gonna kill Americans they were gonna have people attack Americans and they were gonna blame it on the Cubans and they were orchestrating it all to get people motivated for a war with Cuba and President Kennedy came along and said what in the fuck are you talking about and he vetoed it stopped it in a year later he was dead it's one of the things that he one of the things that he did that lead many people to believe that there was a conspiracy that you know he was murdered that's a good one too the Lee Harvey Oswald case is a fascinating one Lee Harvey's murder is the it was like a motion picture like like just with the director like a b-movie director yeah yeah really was a leader Lee Harvey Oswald's captured by the cops he says I'm a patsy you know this just I didn't do anything and they're they're walking him they're holding on to him by the way he he's behaving like a guy who got framed he's not behaving like a guy who just shot the president and they're walking with him this is after he you know said he was a patsy they're walking with him through the courtyard and Jack Ruby who was a mob guy walks right up to him and shoots him in front of everybody Jack Ruby was a nightclub owner who was shot to the mob look at the shot yeah watch this he's walking they look how they have them too it's almost like shot bang just walks up to them they grab oh hey you cut it out there mister it looks like it's playing on Turner Classic Movies it does but you could add music to this up stress the ones to edit like give me some volume Jamie and play that from the beginning see let me see him walking again give me some volume let me hear this then walking him through look out the cops are like way on the outside - I don't get shot look there they look out there hold it over there's a man with a gun never shot another round she was one round kills him and that's it very strange I mean even where did he shoot him the guts you know like in the movies it's just weird even wait drew is go was very like yeah I think I think there's probably many people involved in that murder very very very likely you know there's a pruder film didn't get played on TV - 110 years after the assassination you know who played it Oh Dick Gregory the film and he brought it to the Geraldo Rivera show in like was it like 1970 something as I think the the murder was in 63 yeah and I think he brought it on the Geraldo Rivera show 75 how about that hey man and you know what and knowing that it played on Geraldo more than makes up for the Al Capone's vault Geraldo used to be legit - a guy people don't realize Geraldo was super legit it was amazing the aggregor was amazing I mean he was an activist before anybody even knew what the fuck that meant and as a comedian for him to be appearing on this show Geraldo Rivera beautiful hair God look at his hair and dick regularly looking young and handsome and he brings this out and explains to people hey it is highly likely that the president got shot from the front and look at his head go back into the left you see his brain spray and the blood spray out of his head mm-hmm it's crazy when they played it people were stunned and you could clearly see you know him grabbing his neck like you could see the whole yeah it's a fucked up video and it's amazing that if we didn't have this video we would probably have a completely different narrative for what happened to Kennedy one guy with one camera opened up the possibility there was a massive conspiracy that killed the president and it led to the release of countless books and so much speculation how how many file like they're still like what's the time stamp before all like the files around the case well some of them were released fairly yeah they came out like last year maybe even this year and I don't even remember it look at that boom back into the left I don't remember what the conclusion was I just missed it rewind it yeah so grainy yeah here watch back into the left watch your Eddy here comes the spray oh shit yeah the way his head throws back it seems very likely that he was hit from the front however it's also possible that he was hit from the back and that his body just spasm that way yeah you don't mean no one really knows yeah have you seen Jackie the movie Jackie now it they captured he captures like that moment you know it's for the film but it in such a like it's a beautiful really beautifully captured moment that he got plays throughout the film that's like you just for that alone I thought the movie was beautiful and very underrated but I but I ate captured it really well yeah it's a it's a crazy moment in history you know they assassinated the president it was caught on film but again if Dick Gregory didn't get that video footage to Geraldo Rivera is this in the movie oh Jesus yeah it's it's crazy was she picking up his round that's not true you know Lenny Bruce had a whole fuckin they tried to say that she was picking up his brain she was running away she knew he was dead and she was escaping she was climbing off the back of the car to escape and then the Secret Service is behind her and they you know he tried to help damn yeah well no crazy dude there's also the difference in the autopsy the autopsy in there the autopsy in Dallas the way they the way they examine his wounds in Dallas versus the way they described him Bethesda Maryland when they flew him to that hospital completely different really yeah yeah they turned the entry wound into the neck which way they said was a bullet hole they turned that in a tracheotomy wound they changed the way they thought the entrance wound to the head was yeah there's a lot of weird fuckery that went on between Dallas and Maryland and then there was also generals in the room that were there that wouldn't allow doctors to come and and do certain parts of the autopsy there's a lot of weird shit Wow I mean also it's the president you have to realize the president knighted States is shot it's top secret yeah no I just like to yeah I have the files lined up but then release both but when were they released like there's a great book on it the books called best evidence if I get a guy named David liftin and I fucked up once and read this book before I went onstage I was I was working in Philly and I you know on the road yeah is like you know I was young and I didn't understand like you got to put yourself a good frame of mind before you do stand-up and I was reading this book freaking the fuck out I was like oh my god they shot the president this has really killed the goddamn president and I went onstage like super bummed out because I was there for the whole weekend I'm like I read this book and she's like don't read that book tomorrow before - I went up I remember one time I mean this is the craziest I'm at Baltimore comedy factory which is already you know just with my style in that Club already shouldn't be a thing that happens and also my friend Angelo just passed away and I was going through it's all about like kind of knows the prayer I was like trying to make sense of that coupled with it was that right after like Christmas and the holidays I hadn't gone up for a few weeks so being rusty depressed at the fault of our cavity factory you know is a combination that led to like it almost i remember experiencing it from up here you don't even like it's one of those things that you experience where you're just like you're just kind of looking down at it just like terrible yeah no it means that especially if you you know if who you are in the act is so reliant upon having fun yeah or or truth to you know the presentation is a certain has a certain amount of truth to it right where you are right now yeah yeah which is which is also a thing I always have to guard for me because it's so a really absorb absorb absorb so like I'm reacting to it by an by exactly how I feel right right now I worked with jb smooth once we were working in a club know a college in new jersey it was real hard to get to and this is back before GPS you know we just had directions written down on paper you know and he was real late like a half-hour late plus maybe even more the show was supposed to start eight it was already 8:30 and he wasn't there so they said look just have a seat in the green room and wait and you know when he gets here we'll put him on so I go okay so I have a seat in the green room and I'm watching this show and it's a documentary on these fires in Malibu that devastated Malibu back then you know and and fucking burnt all these houses down and these people are weeping and crying and they're looking for their dog they're like rusty where are you rusty and then this guy he's a firefighter and he comes out and he didn't even lose his house he was just taking care of all these people that did lose their houses and he built this house and it's like his life savings and he's just and his neighbor's house is gone his house was spared he's just we being this guy's just openly weeping hmm and then the director of entertainment whatever it is for the college comes and goes well JB's not here yet so I guess you'll just go on first and when he gets here you go I'm like okay so we're gonna bring you up now okay I was like okay and I just went up and just ate yeah yes so depressed yes I mean thinking about this fire and all these people burning dogs and you know did you talk about that oh I was terrible comedy is that the moment when you're a young comic you only been doing at the time I've been doing comedy like for years when you when I would go down with the ship four years in there was no coming back like once I mommed if I was if I was doing pretty good and then I started bombing there was no recovery yeah I never recovered this is just like there's no I've already given you my best I just didn't have that I didn't have the mindset I didn't know how to recover you know how to step back and reassess anything about these fires I was so depressed why it's a lot you just can't watch something like that before you go onstage yeah I mean and then not really also you know it's also that learn thing of how to find the best of where you are yeah type of thing but like yeah before having that stay out of the weeds man don't talk to anybody that's depressing anything depressing yeah what people like to talk like more than that I'm actually more affected by you know I remember like starting out and going on to clubs and like people you know the Booker or whatever likes to come in and give you the rundown of the room and the whatever and I'm really bad at that I'm bad at like don't give me the imply a game like allow me to react to whatever is out there whatever is going on and like you don't need that thing like let it get in my head as I'm in my head you don't want to hear okay there's a bachelor party in t2 and they're really rowdy and we're gonna try to talk to them first so just just it's like what I'm doing yeah yeah they'll tell you this as you're being introduced to hold your arms yeah draw just one like let you know we've got it we're gonna handle it the bachelor party trough intern like they do it on I mean if you don't you know you're doing press for certain things like most things like try and do like a pre-interview and the thing and it's all just these things that like just rings out anything in spontaneity squeezed out by those query interviews just doing it with a producer and like you have any stories funny stories no the worst you ever gone on wanting those radio shows where they want you to do your bits oh yeah yeah they're soldiers somebody record there's some great 6 a.m. be in Indiana just refusing Bob and Tom show did you do that I think I did Bob and Tom I'm sure they're Bob but I'll see that to know the five producer lady got very angry at me yeah yeah yeah it's like why would I why would I do that yeah I think was Elena you might have been dude but you know like it is that but a given it all goes to light perception like they what people make of comedians you know you know what the expectations are when you go out and you do these things like what people's expectations are like you gotta like you you it's up to you to like change it yeah like it's a change that thing it's just like alright well look hey Bob and Tom yeah nice guys people do the bits there's just not a thing that I do yeah we'll have a conversation yeah tender the conversation can be interesting yeah that's crazy yeah and it's like you know again like it's not even that they do it it's like it has to be tailored to you you can't do the thing you can't just fill into the mold of comedian right you know it's just gonna make the exact same thing over and over well the art forms just very underappreciated because it seems that we're just talking you know I talked to you talk I talked yeah you know it's not like we all play guitar so you see someone go up what you're sure back home think they could do a pretty good yeah exactly cuz everybody's been funny at one point time we've all hung around with somebody who said some hilarious shit and you know and that feels good right it feels good when they do that that when they say that and they get that feeling like damn I just made everybody laugh yeah Jason probably felt that before we ever did comedy so they see you onstage and they see you killin and they say I could do that shit he's doing that but he's doing what I do I could do that and they get it in their head of their head Jamar could do it why the fuck can't I do it they get in their head like he's just talking he's not doing backflips what you're doing his stuff they do I had it I had a cousin like you know I'll bring the area near me you know cousins out whatever I bring them out to like the club sometimes so whatever bump to an open mic one time and you know I go up and my same and so open mic man if y'all want to go up I was like you should yeah he's gonna see my boys do it or whatever so uh my cousin Jeremy was like yeah I'll do it and uh he said I could do that shit he gets up and he does good it's a funny dude you know and all the art that do that shit every day for ten years some people are good I'm sure you know some comedians started just but I can do this shit and you know in light and that can't happen it's just that uh if you are gonna do it like like anything you know if it is like what you choose and it's just like make sure that the articulation is yours and interesting and you know I mean like I think that's kind of the goal like what however you get into it or whatever inspired it or whatever like if you are doing it do it yeah you know like do it and like do it at its highest level if you can yeah it's just I think stand up like you were saying it just doesn't get the respect that other art forms get because there's no there's no like if you see someone play guitar or play the drums or something like that you don't have any illusion that you can go up and do exactly what they do but a lot of people have the illusion in their mind that they can go onstage and be funny because they're just talking to even or even just be interesting today and you're gonna be have to be anything in a room but it's but a lot of it you know part of the the reason for the perception is the things that we accept yeah you know like it really is that like a lot of the things that we accept contribute to oh yeah like you know we make it like we allow ourselves to be presented like you know right for justice right yeah well in us also it's one of the rare things that anybody can try right you can go up open mic night and yes cry yeah and you know while you're up there doing stand-up somebody who's a professional might drop in and pop it you know Chapelle might show up and do a set Jeff Ross might go up there Dahmer era might show up people show up and do sense and share the stage with you it's your first day that's a rare that doesn't take place in music or anywhere else well you get an open mic night and there's 30 people on doing three minutes yeah and yeah anybody could be one of them yeah it's weird soulless people yeah a lot of homeless people a lot of sketchy fucking weirdos a touch the same mic as you doesn't change nobody cleans that Comedy Store Mike you got a intense immunity no one's taking a Clorox wipe fuck is clean and anything at that place they barely clean the tables that place they just deliver drinks to keep the party rolling that's part of why it's so good I think when they changed out the improv and they swapped that lab for that back bar and they put that bar in there and it's like it seemed like they like removed a body part it's like yeah how they got it now yeah it's but I mean in the way that like I got the energy went away yeah it was this kind of a kind of Miami infusion I feel like a nightclub it was an Encino restaurant bar that's what it was like yeah yeah like just with the sofas and they're just like like like you know what this this room needs a place to people to lounge more yeah it just well it's kind of they kind of figured it out now they got the little shows that they do there yeah it's kind of interesting but it used to be cool it used to be like a room like a separate room yeah that was just comedy and Ari Shaffir 'he's whole story tellers show started out there that's where he would do it he would run it there because it was like a 7080 seat room wait you're talking about the lab the lab yeah yeah the part was the bar was the lab cuz they redid it I was talking about the mate like the may the redoing of the main room the the lab room yeah I remember that that that could have a really good energy when went ahead like that really pink curtain yeah those those like that yeah I remember I feel like I remember doing like a Montreal showcase showcase it that was like my first and only what not did its way that you later that week yeah The Improv is a weird spot like that hallway when you wait and go on there's nowhere to hide no okay man let me talk to you about something like I'm going on stage right now I gotta go hold on let me get a selfie like yeah did that they could touch you like right before you can you know that never happens with Gary Clark he's never about to go on stage there's some dude in the hallway yeah so that's part of the reason why it's interesting it's part of the reason because you're you're like one of them but it's also part of the reason why it's a it's a fucking weird art form yeah no it is it is it's a we and that is the best it's so interested in like yeah you get a lot of perspective and thoughts are you doing a lot of sets these days wouldn't you haven't gonna really haven't gone I've done maybe two or three sets in the past year and a half that's great maybe maybe that and the last time I was like did you do like two minutes and walk off yeah it's just not wit it's not where ideas are going now where's your ideas going now I felt like it's a lot of fun projects and like some television stuff that just feels more normal to you yeah it just feels like the way of it I mean even you know before I mean had like a TV shot would do a lot of thoughts would just go there and I wouldn't do stand-up a lot during that and like you know I like to just focus in like put the energy where where you feel the most creative and so that's why I'm acting you could go up and you could I know something about stand-up right now you know it's it's simultaneously like oh man there's really amazing things happening and just kind of as a whole it's just like a certain uh I think it's going through like this growing face like this kind of identity thing right because it's like I feel like there needs to be kind of this overhaul and even one in its presentation and to what the expectation of performer audience and because it's a lot of like oh no I I'll go and I'll see a lot of like you know Trump stuff and a lot of things but it's like not like new perspectives and it's like you know it's a lot of civil rights leaders and so you know a lot of things and and you know and not even good civil rights leaders just you know talking points right and just kind of preaching - it's a lot of reaching the choirs and it's like you know the whole thing is this unique articulation and like this unique thing that you're supposed to be bringing it's Show and Tell like it is like hey I have this thing I have this thought that I think is unique I have this way of presenting this thought that I think is unique and and now and again it's profitable right now this is the bubble where it is right now right if you go up and you you know speak for your group for you speak in this type of way you can get it rewarded for it and kind of these immediate rewards I understand it but it really does kind of choke the art form it chokes what's interesting about it yeah there's just so many people trying to stand out it's so difficult to do that and they find these paths and one of those paths is to be someone who's like really more and righteous and you know has something to say but it's also it's under the illusion of being rebellious and edgy yeah it's under it's under the illusion of these things because it's like you know there was when Dick Gregory said the things that he said in the things we said there was real danger in a conservative country there's real danger to a lot of things they said you get on stage and you're like fuck Trump it's not in Los Angeles in New York City yeah you know how owning your skills and it's just like oh well good for you that unique perspective you bring about how this is the worst of times yeah it's there's definitely a lot of that there's a lot of voices you know but there's a lot of great stuff to know there is they are unique you know experi that that's the thing it's just with anything it's it's flooded right now do you plan on going back do you have aspirations or do you have a thought your head or do you just go with the flow it's kind of go with I mean if I if I feel and I and like thoughts come out that fit or if I find a way to do it like a thing that maybe doesn't necessarily fit and with that then maybe I would do that I'm open to it I just don't know yeah I don't really know what that is right now so it's beautiful that you have that sensibility that you just this is what I'm thinking about this is what I like to do right now yeah and I've been in more music studios in the past two years and I've been comedy clubs really yeah what are you doing with music it's just kind of they're just like just hanging out well just I like I mean I like to talk about it and use like how to discuss it and I you know I've been like enough to kind of be around some like artists that I admire and just like listen to that creation part like I like the immediacy of that process like a lot I like that is what I was saying what I like about even here it's like it's it's an art space that you have here where you can kind of create like in this immediate space and like exactly how you see it comes out in that way and you can record it you capture like that yeah and and when your mind is in that space you know you need to only do things that it can be good at yeah yeah it's a it's a it's a good you will you it seems to me as an outsider is that you found like your natural path you found a natural path like if you've you've made it in you become successful if you're well known now and you've got freedom and you just like what am i into well I'm doing what I hope like all of us are trying to do late the the one thing that I've always done is exactly what I want to do the current and it's not just by day it's not like you know and then I told it's just by saying not doing the things if it doesn't match then not doing it you know like and trying to have a vision of what the thing is and just making Matt right and so like that's what like comedy at its best again the the medium finds you like it comes to you you don't go to the medium yeah you know like like the medium is meeting you like and and so many people are just like conforming and just the it becomes the same thing I don't know it's a weird time well that's a good outsider's perspective like you you're an insider that has almost an outsider's perspective because you're looking at it like you step back a little bit and watch all the the fucking hamster wheel watch all the scrambling riding around there's a lot of that meant it's a lot of fake horse shit going on it's a lot of people grabbing at straws yeah it's a lot of no it's really noisy yeah so many opportunities are so many venues there's so many comedians and it's also comedy so hot right now it's like it's such an exciting time for stand-up that there's so many people doing it was so you're automatically gonna get just like when you're trying out jokes a lot of them suck well when you try it out comedians I mean this might be in terms of like success to failure ratios one of the most brutal art forms you could ever attempt to be a professional at yeah yeah no definitely it's I mean because you go you're going out there kind of naked with the thought and how many guys from your era like when you start doing open mic nights are doing well now um guys uh guys are uh right now really finding their kind of space and guys are starting to get TV shows and they're starting to get like guys that I remember seeing it like mics are really starting to do like it's in the past couple years is really like kind of here I I was on this weird kind of weird path trajectory type of thing I kind of was just on the side of it I feel I feel like in this weird sense and things kind of happened inauthentic kind of found an infrastructure that worked for me really quickly you know to me but like a now around now is the time I think that a lot of things are starting to happen for like guys that I've been around like if you were around 500 dudes when you first started that you knew regularly maybe three are working now yeah yeah right yeah legitimately look if you counted all them up over the first 10 years of your stand-up career you got maybe three that are doing X Y a that are doing what they want to do yeah you know two that are doing what they want to do yeah maybe it really is that yeah it's fucking brutal a lot of comedians operate in this space where it's like they don't know they can do what they want to do right that's a big wall yeah it's a big wall I've seen a lot of people stop it that well people that can that are just like still trying to figure out how to write the confidence to act the confidence to act on your actual instincts to to do what you really want to do which is so crazy because comedy you would think that we'd be the ones that are closest to it because it's so instinctual and it's such a reaction you know like a lot of things you do is such a real like when you you discover you funny through like when you you discover you can sing by preparing to sink right you know you go and you prepare this thing you know your voice and you give it a shot and you you discover you funny but just like oh what that would write write write yeah you just got you a funny the way you know by like a hunch that you know like that you have so like it's so instinctual that you would think it would be more of that like following your instinct following your gut yep forging your own but it's also it's so scary in the beginning that once you find shelter you you hold on to that yeah that's why those you know the saddest comedians the ones that they do stand-up for five years they develop a half an hour and it never changes yeah you found it cling to that bitch like a fucking life raft yeah yeah people this event you know people don't talk about how comfy glass ceilings are you know they're really yeah listen I gotta get the fuck out of here yeah this is great what do you got go on you promote anything you got anything happens oh oh drew spray I gotta talk about drew special Joe Michael I meant to send that to you to me now you know it comes out this weekend comes out Saturday it's really funny it's a comedian I love I'm excited for people to see him directed a special did it without an audience without an audience yeah yeah where do you do it we shot it on a stage just like I know it's aged we kind of created the environment Wow yeah my i i i think the thoughts work removed from it and I'm really excited to really excited to capture it like that Wow yeah I don't even really know what you call this thing but I'm really because it was like when I first saw him I this is a trailer yeah after a while like the thoughts get weird I want to date someone I don't love I love my mom she's single soon not that it matters people are like what and really [Music] [Music] August 25th that's that's interesting you know those shows those sitcoms that they when they first started doing single camera sitcoms and they started doing them without an audience people
