the girag an experience I'll tell you what we bring up a lot I hope I haven't overdone it in the shows but I'm fascinated by this idea that we're never going to go backwards yes you know when you talk about you know this modern world and you look around you think okay basically since the Renaissance it's been all if this is the stock market we've been going up ever since the Renaissance and the idea that everybody has is that and we're never going to go backwards we're never going to go look at a thousand years from now and see people who don't know about DNA sequencing anymore its planet of the apes right where you've gone backwards and oh the Statue of Liberty's partly buried in the sand and I mean we we but every other culture who has to yeah but every other country in the civilization history the world has thought that I mean you didn't think the Romans were thinking god it's great now pity it can't last yeah but we learned from them we know but maybe we can and not just that maybe the whole globalization the fact that everybody's connected will change that dynamic but I think if you're gonna if you're trying to learn from history one thing history shows is these stock market up tix in the civilization stock market don't last so what is that well we like to think we're more special than all the other animals first and foremost so we like to think that you know even me I'm guilty this guilty absolutely as charged we'd like to think that we are eventually going to cheese achieve the highest levels of understanding and that that's the trend that things are going and eventually going to work everything out and we won't have war someday in the future and that somehow or another we are basically human beings are basically good and we're going to work this out in the universe can reward that but I got one word one word that refutes that dinosaurs okay the whole world was fucking run by cunty heartless lizards cold-blooded monsters without a fucking speck of emotion that never wrote a fucking thing down didn't give a shit about culture would eat their babies would eat anything that stood still that's what dominated this earth for the longest time and if it wasn't for an asteroid impact very likely would still be a version of that animal still running shit bad cops looking at Asner yeah exactly bad cop shows are one of my favorite things of all time so much so that there was a show called della Ventura I remember the name of the know my manager also manages Kevin James who's the king and queen right and they were on the same network as danny aiello when he had the show called della Ventura and I had them get me the tapes because that you couldn't find them I have that Trevor like the original masters nobody'd be a chance to be jesting so about a great show it's horrible and awesome at the same time I cherish these tapes I have people over for delavan to are watching parties in fucking Iraq you bump them over to a digital I have to do that you've ever they wear adela Ventura I'm sorry it's so bad so off you only get so many runs on the tape so you got it you got the transfer that you know I haven't watched some in years I'll blow over 280 I can I have them like in a sacred spot have candles around them and we shall keep them safe I thought it would be a really good idea my first season MacGyver DVD box set I was like fuck were you we're gonna meet that was any caller let me tell you about my gramma MacGyver is infinitely better than della I mean it's not measurable della ventura is one of they were shows the world has ever known that's where leah an old man beats up every young punk that crosses his I'll he's the best at everything he does the gran torino fucking you will drown in danny aiello ego will drown you will never make it out alive anyone good and do the right thing so well he's right listen ray no bullshit I don't know who made the script and I was fucking happen not show I'm talking my shuddhi I'm talking show maybe Danny thought was a subtle comedy but he's an amazing actor there's no you can't take that away from the guy is an incredible actor and so of course he has a bit of an ego he said he's fucking badass he's badass actor but still that show was so bad it hurt your feelings it was so bad you would watching you go holy shit like place pools clip he plays pool with this guy this young punk and he fucking shoots in every ball and the guy goes here the best I've ever seen mr. what you see gonna goes my secret don't miss it's the best worst show ever you you fell on this fall in a fetal position and then break your own fingers because you're squeezing them so tightly so embarrassed let me tell you about the first how many episodes I don't know I don't know there's had two seasons I think I think it went to see they might have been just one season I'm not sure have a nice box of them the first season of MacGyver to watch it is three quarters voiceover random jungle shots like helicopter over the jug with like and then I broke him out of prison it's like him no way she's got shots and then it's like next voiceover it's the most bullshit thing that bad they could have shot the entire season in about four days would if okay let's say I don't know anything about your personal situation but it's let's say you're in love you found the girl this is the one you want to marry okay and you have the opportunity for one day or one hour let's say an hour to feel what it's like for you to fuck her and she gets to feel what it's like to be you having sex with her so you you feel what it's like to be her getting fucked by you and she feels what it's like for you to fuck her do you think you could do that do you think you'd lie there and get fucked by yourself I don't think I can handle an hour I don't think I could handle an hour of what I'm dealing with you think you could do that you think you could deal with like kissing you and do you think you'd love her enough to let her be you for an hour and you be her I really really love myself so I'm pretty sure that if I got fucked by me and if I was a check for an hour I probably really enjoy it I'd probably be excited if I was it if I was a chick I'd probably be a squirter do you think you give up the booty would you go anal would I give it if you were a chick taking the ass from yourself up for me yeah I mean from yourself yeah just spit on your hand right you're a seller acknowledge you is back and open it up wide for you I don't know if I'd asked him out for yourself that's the real question how much do you really love yourself because you probably don't love yourself enough to go after ass to mouth on yourself fuck but if you watch porn girls who don't even love guys are willing to go ass to mouth right so consider well the Christian commands are getting like 2,000 bucks to do I also gasm 5,000 uh fuck myself if that's all it takes for you to go ass to mouth we can have that arranged well the way he has to be fucking so bright yellow card will just make a mask we just make a mask would just make a mass that looks just like you it's not gay if it's yourself how about we make a mass looks just like you we put it on a girl with strapon so it is like you're fucking yourself not enough now definitely no you need to be the girl now need to actually be a girl because then you'd say yeah I'm I'm not even me I'm her and you look down you see your penis and you go oh no no I'm still a guy fucking game of my playing i know im so confused I don't know whether I would fuck this thing or I would and I don't know what's me what's not you son you're broadcasting itunes oh shit itunes recording to server get the fuck out of here server
