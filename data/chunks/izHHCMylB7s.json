hello freak bitches we've got to be able to think more nuanced about these things and instead of going well I don't trust Fox News therefore I don't trust any media therefore I only am going to go to the site that keeps as you said reinforcing what I already believe oMG GMOs are horrible calm that's the only place where I get my news well now you're in an echo chamber yeah that's a huge issue and the other thing that you brought up there about political about financial all the different motivations all the different things the variables that's also stuff that you have to try to pay attention to and squeeze into your head and that's the thing it's impossible we need someone like you to sort of break it down someone who has a background in this particular area to break it down in a way that we can understand lokay I'm comfortable that Cara Santa Maria is being honest with me about this particular aspect of depression in neural chemistry he's this is her experience this is also what she knows about the science behind it because I have no motivation otherwise nobody's paying me to say this and I think that this is why we as you know the listeners of the Joe Rogan experience the listeners of talk nerdy with Cara Santa Maria the the people who are really involved in the next movement of alternative and new media it is our responsibility to continue to support these kinds of programs and to continue to speak up and become engaged and involved because if we're not happy with the way that traditional media is handling things because they're playing to the ratings and they're playing to the lowest common denominator we can't be passive about it we have to support the news outlets and the organizations and the podcasts and the web shows that that we support we have to do our part to make sure that those things don't fail because the unfortunate thing is we don't have the backers that they have when people look at someone posing with an African animal like a lion they I think people look at and they feel like they see a dead movie star because they don't know like all you know of that animal is sort of wildlife documentaries and then cartoon versions and the Lion King it's like you feel like you're looking at that in America we drive down the road and we see just like contorted pulverized deer carcasses yeah you can't escape it yes yeah and so I feel like it's never gonna be as offensive you know what when someone sees a dead deer it's not as shocking to them as be like it's the animal from the movies right right and they killed it you know anthropomorphizing of an animal's of real estate when it really feels to people more like I remember a friend of mine who worked in the environmental movement I shouldn't say that because I she was a conservationist okay this is working the conservation movement and she complained about half jokingly about charismatic megafauna so that so much mental energy of Americans gets tied up in the preservation of charismatic megafauna and those things become such money sinks that we miss opportunities to understand like this vast suite of other creatures out there that doesn't make it onto calendars and she was guy if I remember I think she was speaking of the amount of research dollar and dollars and public interests and things that go into wolves like understanding wolves you know and there's all the other animals that she calls like non charismatic megafauna you just can't get someone to like care about them yeah yeah we'd say it's more chaotic now than it has been in recent memory I don't think I don't think that's it that's not a big statement is that what happens is it was just an ebb and flow when it comes to these sort of situations when when it comes to like what's going on the world power struggles then the power struggles that resolve and then new resistance builds up I mean is that in your experience how things go well I think you you minimize the chaos by being consistent and what do I mean by that is is it you know in as foreign policy as an example if your foreign policy message is consistent and and strong and clear and there's no misunderstanding by either your allies or the people that that are against us then you can minimize the chaos that exists if it's not consistent and there's confusion over where we stand and I'm saying we because you know okay fine we're still at the top of the food heap whether people are comfortable with that or not I don't know but so if we're not consistent in that message then there's confusion and that's where you start to get problems because you start to get people probing at the perimeter trying to see what exactly is going on what they can get away with we start getting less leverage I mean you know we're getting situation in the Middle East now where countries are acting completely without consulting with the US you wouldn't have had that 30 years ago you know it just wouldn't happen like what wouldn't yeah Egypt acting in in what they consider to be their own best interest the Saudis the Saudis are enormous ly pissed off at us still over over what they view as the current administration's failure to you know work with them to try to resolve some issues out in the Middle East and they feel as if we've sort of abdicated responsibility now whether we have or not whether it's the right thing to do or not I'm just saying from a policy perspective you know if what we want to do is be isolationist then be very clear about that say this is all we're going to do these are our parameters that's it so everybody knows good well good with it fine get on with it but you know the mixed messages of the problem I was selling mescaline for a little while this guy this guy Andre the blackest black er than your coffee and tough and he was like in and out of juvie homes and so he got me to sell it to my friends so I would have a bad cuz like a lot of my friends were into the Grateful Dead and we go to a dead show and I would just sell like a hundred hits on mescaline and so so then one day I guess I didn't even own money like he would give me a bag and then I pay him after I sold it and time wasn't really up yet but I came home one afternoon and I opened the front door out of my house and I walk in and we lives in a pretty nice house and my mom is sitting with Andre in the living room having tea and she never met him she just he just showed up looking for me and I was like oh what the fuck that's uncomfortable that ended my my drug-dealing days ended right there yeah you don't want Andre embedded in your life Roger is banging your mom Oh because he would do that I know Andre and she's on mask I know Andre Andre would do it yeah he lit up her drink he had tea with her dropped a tab on her tea right now the doors are playing dude riders on the storm and you open the door and he just fucking hammering them from behind father yes son I want to kill you and I walk in and he turns his head and sees me and he gives me a look that makes me have to fucking leave the room eat mid-stroke doesn't even stop banging my mom yeah yeah you don't want to see this I don't want to see that shit and I'm on mask a Jedi mind trick - these are not the droids you're looking for Andre working every angle someone like that banging your mom oh that's dark yeah that would be brutal let's go seeing his ass you know that prison ass you don't know what it's been through it's probably we got striated muscle tissue all four out of two looks terrifying right like you think about the amount of force he could generate with that ass oh my god yeah strong thighs cuz he's walking around selling drugs he's out on the street it's a constant motion while cardio and now he's got the back of it sighs ripping and driving you know that drive you get from the inside of your thighs when you're real fucking well he's doing that to her oh this is Charlotte but edit that part out
