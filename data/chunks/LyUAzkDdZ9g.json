boom and we're live what's up champ how are you oh great now you doing I'm great man it's a pleasure to meet you I've been a fan forever oh I've seen every single fight you've ever had so for me it's an honor to have you in here man as a giant boxing fan all the way back to Dwight Kyle we saw you fight in the Olympics so everything everything yeah yeah for real and I understand you you're gonna do an exhibition now well yeah I'm preparing for one you know you know Mingo I know going over to Japan and being able to go there and see the town home do whatever that tsunami sit on me yeah and the point of sending tsunami going over there and helping people and I think it why not do a exhibition right so it's like a benefit for the tsunami victims yes you look great you're in great shape still well thank you you know you never got out of shape well yeah I did a game yeah easy to maintain your e-bill easier to maintain the rebuild yeah but now at your age like what most last time you had a fight was like 2011 2000 so it's been like eight years which is you were thinking of competing like deep in your 50s though well yeah the thing is is that I'm always trying to stay in shape but really didn't want to get hit again right right right like that but and that's but exhibition I could do exhibition who is the exhibition against I don't know yet I'm not I'm thinking about you know I wanted to be ready both got me here but now you could do with somebody you friends with right they know that they not gonna hit you too hard you'll hit them too hard right so it'll be more of a sparring yes a deal yes now how often you training now what you know I'm always trained eye shadow box I don't I don't I don't hit the bag but I'm I'm ready to do it now because I'm actually gonna be performing I wanna I wanna look good but but it is I don't want to get in a dog a dog fight right you don't want to get into a war right you just want to have like a little exhibition sparring match just a little just combinations not hate each other too hard that kind of deal well yeah we hit we can hit hard to the body right not here right right right now at this stage of your life you know it's been a while since you competed do you worry that those competitive juices might get fired up again we might want to actually fight again I know I don't think I don't think I will ever go back in because I did everything I wanted to do right I feel that I got as far as I've wanted to get and you know I I'm on the prototype Midway champ of the world ever but I'm still ain't got no reason to be mad with no bad about anything and thinking I had a great great career you had an unbelievable career yes only four time heavyweight champion of the world ever I mean I can remember way back in the day when you were moving up from cruiserweight to heavyweight you know and it was one of the rare times where we were watching back in those days and folks who don't know it was kind of taboo for boxers to live weights yeah it was and was Macke chill stone that got you ready for that right no no no Tim all Mark Tim all Mark and that shields don't got Spinks ready Chris yeah and I came after that and and Poynter coming out Maggie sheer stone everybody thought about the weight but Tim Homer will talk about flexibility all the things you had to do when you lift weights right yeah was everybody used to think before that that if you lifted weights a made you stiff yeah yeah and Tim was able to he did everything whitman to show me that I just missed Ryan Ryan but conditionings about you know heart rate and all this and then you know when you lift weight you just got to do more Brian it seemed like back then the problem was when people would lift weights they would get sore and then they would go to the gym and they wouldn't perform as well and so I bet he would say I'll wait to make you stiff they didn't allow themselves to get through a full program with a real strength to conditioning guy like Tim hallmark or Mac ISIL stone they were the first guys really the bulk guys up right it's all about confidence and yeah someone taken to another level you know and I think that at that time people just kind of in this level this is all we know and this is only for ego cos you have to work harder yeah if you go if you lift weight you're gonna have to work hard right brain you know with me I was able to bring a ballet teacher and I did hit ballet too did you really yeah that's the reason why I was I was able to still be flexible and and being able to be quick and all that and you know I I did all that but I ain't let nobody know I would do a ballet you know I'd like to see some video you doing ballet out there no we did not know did you wear a tutu no no no no you know I got stretched like a man in your tongue miss Kennedy that's not a name and so I kept her to the day that you see she end up slipping breaking her hip and because she she was like 70 years old when she would stretch him and have me doing all the splits and all this but it worked yeah well you were one of the first like supremely conditioned heavyweight boxers you know when you'd see you you look sculpted you know and you would be able to put that output out for the entire 12 rounds I mean you had those incredible fights at Riddick Bowe I know you guys are friends now but god damn did you guys have some Wars yeah we had we had battles I think the big thing because he kind of kind of bully you know in here big guy and he just always looked at me and said a good a good bit guy beat a good look guy in a time and every time we go in and practice I bust him up dinner but you know I'm four years older than him but he was bigger and but I was always getting yeah well you guys had some crazy fights but the craziest one was the one where the guy landed in the middle of the Ring the guy with the parachute with the what was that guys what did he call himself the famous fan that's right he had a fan that was powering his parachute and he literally landed in the ring that was an outdoor arena in Vegas is that what it was yeah she was a maid and held the fight up about thirty minutes that was crazy yeah at that time I had him hurt yes and like that and it saved him yeah well you had him hurtin and everybody got cold I mean you cooled off I mean it almost seems like they should have cancelled a fight well you know it was half of the fight you did they guess a fight they were had to pay us again what there's a picture up there like look at that what was going through your mind when you saw that guy land on the ropes like that well it shocked me and then because when they did the light started like this and Curtis Mayfield had just got paralyzed but same thing with the thing fell the old lights fell on them yeah yeah Curtis Mayfield he got paralyzed that was yes oh wow so you thought maybe the lights were about to fall well yeah and now we're trying to make sure that I can make that quick step get in I get out right right right yeah yeah so this guy once you finally realize that it was a guy on a parachute with a fan behind him how mad were you you know I couldn't keep my mind on him I got to keep my mind already buddy my mind you know you know you had to have a one-track - you gonna be real good we're gonna be the best you haven't had that one-track mind yeah yeah it's not something you could pay attention to but it was it hard to get your mind back into it after the settle and they had to clear the guy out and arrest him and clean the ring out and everything no I I stayed focused and my whole thing is that I you know I felt that I won the first half right I got there I got this nice hair why did it take a half hour to get that guy out of there you know you know you know rid of both wife were there she's pregnant she had to leave and all this sorry so many thing happened cuz the guy happened to come over Farrakhan and and and so all these people they don't beat the po-man in the head I'll knock him out like this out to me he got a really good beating for coming in I hope he did big yeah is he still in jail no no he passed now oh he's gone yeah well oh well I guess that's his legacy well you know you fucked up your fight that's his legacy wait you're right I won yes you did yeah I mean look man yeah you had some incredible fights but to me one of my fondest memories is you know Kevin James is from the king of queens giving a TV show me and Kevin James were at my house and Encino the night you fought Tyson the first one the first fight when you drop Tyson I'll never forget it because back then we knew that Boat Buster Douglas had beaten Tyson but we kind of almost thought it was like a fluke but when you were batter and Tyson and then you put him down and stopped him I'll never forget Kevin James jumping off the couch just jumping oh my god we're throwing our arms up in the air I mean that was for sure one of the greatest heavyweight championship victories in the history of sport it was just an incredible fight because in a lot of people's eyes Tyson was like this a bad guy he was like people thought of him as like a thug you know and you were thought of as it's like really good guy and many people didn't think that you were gonna be able to beat him so when you didn't just beat him but you took it to him you took it to him you know like early on in the fight you could tell that you had decided you were gonna push him around and you know once you'd stopped him I mean it was that was pandemonium in my house so everybody was going crazy they couldn't believe it well you know I know big air but you know you know I had you know I'm like you know I'm a Christian I but the point of the point of matter I work hard I train huh you know my mama said ain't too many things that you do well so son you know which one which one is sports you gonna do cuz I was a good athlete I could I but football and boxing what's my two best one but you know I play basketball I did baseball I did everything my mama said and enough time in a day to be the best at everything yeah don't censor so you got a pig one so when I play I play football in tenth grade and they put him on the bench yeah I start crying I remember my mother said you can't quit to the season is over so I had to play all night I play on that game they found and let me play in the championship game they see how good I was and asked me once I come back next year I said no sir he said why I said my mama's house ain't got to like this my mama told me you got to bet on yourself oh you're gonna bet on the coach right so in marching you bet know yourself right and teens boy you better know the coach you bet on the coach you bet on the other players and you bet on the coach of letting you play right right whereas in boxing they have to let you fight that's right now you may be asking somebody tagged him for you now when did you think that boxing was going to be your career was it right after that it's like around 10th grade oh yeah yeah you know after 10th grade I realized that you know you don't came down to one one sport yeah that I really do real well and so that when I I you know I just put everything in it well you were part of that incredible Olympic team too I mean so many great fighters came out of that Olympic team right yeah breelan Pernell Whitaker Rock'em Taylor I can tell you all of Paul Gonzales 106 Steve McCurry 112 19 Robbie Shannon 125 Mildred Taylor 132 Pernell Whitaker 139 Jerry Jerry and one four to seven with mark breathing 156 Frank take 165 Virgin here seven eggs a night Virgil hell and you then then hammer Tillman and Tyrell Biggs what a team yeah crazy team now I go Melo one civil huh bras amazing yeah and you besides Michael Spinks you were one of the rare guys to move up to move up and be successful as a heavyweight did you just decide like after you'd beat Dwight Muhammad Kali who was a cruiserweight champion and you'd beat you know some real good names at that weight class you just decided that heavyweight was where the real money was at well actually you know my goal I wanted to be the heavyweight champ of the world and and only person I I knew is Mike Tyson do it I could do it so so when Mike Tyson what everybody you know you know you know you people tend to make up excuses Mike Tyson it's a small person right yeah I'm to me he hit hard but he got short arms right and so I seen my book for whooping people that six for six five six six mm-hmm they I win by 20 30 pounds he beat the day like sauna right I figured it might could do it I could do it mm-hmm so that gave you inspiration that gave me inspiration my own thing is that you know you know you know I actually you know boys the cruiserweight division I kind of went through that and what's the next goal is to go up and you know and and I I chose to do it and a lot of people said man you crazy well you know you have to be a little bit to be in this anyway yeah there's no doubt about that right yeah so when you first did fight Mike Tyson was that like something you had always knew was gonna happen but once he got out of jail well it was like it was like this my mama used to tell me sissy now and we tell you come my good fighter who came wish him away they ain't never going to well you got to face it and so you know what and you know and everybody in everything that I've done everybody will always remind me you didn't beat Mike Tyson right and I'm like well you're right and I was but it's not like it was my fault right Frank since I seen like every time I got rid of phone something happened I said but one my fault well you you you ain't really the chimp do you beat him it was amazing that he was so popular I'm some special in my house I was you know when people get mad at me they tell me I can't wait til you fight Mike Tyson and so the thing is is that you know you know he was that person that I watched everyone is fighting and I realized you can't make that missing that many missed a bleep Mike right when you finally did beat him do you think when you did fight them and did beat them do you think that that raised your your celebrity and your notoriety to a different level not really I think that is it let people know that you ain't got you ain't got to be considered a bad person to be good and the ring yeah I'm saying because when you're the my own thing I could box and but everybody thought that because I didn't curse a lot I don't get in trouble that you you ain't mean enough to be the mean guy mo so bad I mean I'm a skillful fighter I took him on my body and I did everything right I'm sure you know a I you know in general I fought a lot of guys were a lot bigger and and but it's an art to the game it's really an art it really are it is it's not just one thing you just you hit harder because you got to be able to take some of the gifts off right well you always could take it yeah that was a big part of your your career when you had an iron chin I mean riddick bowe was a giant man and he hit you with some bombs and those wars that you guys had you were able to take some incredible punches well yeah all right with me I knew that I could take but can you take it and so the whole big thing the whole big thing my whole thing my old my whole big thing whip my is that what Mike had told somebody say everybody got a plan today get hit and he was right because you know if if you hit this guy worried about you hitting him he and he where everybody get hit so he got worried about it right but I knew if you hit me I'm gonna hit you back and so that was part of the plan was to let him know that early right it seems like that was when when you fought him particularly in the first run you pressed him and then but there was a rare moment to see someone like really pushing Mike back and getting Mike back on his heels well in honor of the game if if you like might get you back that may be it right right so you had to attack him so the whole big thing the whole big thing with me was it's things that my momma said she said let me tell you when you know when you know how good you are when somebody press you with what you're doing she said Mike low depress other people but the kid he hounded oppressed my mom said do it back to him do it back if you wanted to see somebody to stop doing something to do it them I was setting they'll stop people really don't like what you make what you do to somebody and somebody do it again you get ticked right like that so and so the thing was too we practice just plain pressure when pressure one pressure make him feel the same way that he make other people feel so that was the game plan going over the game play yeah was there anything surprising about that fine not not to mink about him won't know surprise cuz of the surprise make it like this so the thing is is to stay on him and admit him think about all these those things now once you stopped him in the first fight the second fight is the fight that's probably the most famous fight because he bit a chunky ear off and I saw it when you're coming in here show everybody that did you ever think about getting that fixed no no that's my identification I got my ID I just remember yeah that is right if you want to get into somewhere no I am look at my hair yeah yeah that's crazy man that was one of the craziest moments when Mills Lane looked at you and you were jumping up in the air and looked at Tyson and realized holy shit he bit a chunk out of your fucking ear right like what what were you thinking at that time by number I'm serious I was getting ready to bite the daylights out of him and I'll gonna bite him in the face I would bite his face I would no wait for the ear I'm gonna get the fat sup you know come you know are you friend to ghetto they say if you do something you got to do it worse than what they did right and so you know and I told my and talk-show I said no I said no I I won't pretend it like and like I was hurting real bad eyes but I'll come trip you up the place you read in your faith everybody know what I was gonna do I said button yeah this this prophet told us before the fight he told me he said look he's gonna do something in your face area but you got to stay focused cause if you don't stay focused god that's the only way he gonna get you so by him by email my ear when a man and I knew I'll get me to bite him back and and but my corner person started telling me and keep my mind on the Lord hmm and because the the prophet told me say only way he can get you to get your mind he he gonna do something to you right I thought he gonna hit me way elbow hit button anything like that button I never ever thought in my life he would bite Malia and fight a chunky Iran and it hurt so bad people some how bad did it hurt did you see how high jump no it was crazy just leapt up in the air yeah it hurt so bad and I said Dan I said Dan that guy my corner guy Tim hallmark we kept telling me to keep my mind on the Lord and I ain't wanna hear that you know even though he was Santa and I was man I was still I was just trying to remember that get him I want to bite him I was I really wanted to bite him back and and all of a sudden I hit my mind they always catch the second person right I'm telling anything in life and I'm the one that people always did some to they will always catch me and I'm the only one to get get caught all the time because they always catch me trying to get to get back so revenge is the Lord so you don't go get back cause you gonna get caught yeah I was amazed that they didn't stop the fight immediately when they came back and checked and he he asked me you all right nothing yeah I at least wanted to hit him right I was really upset he tried to bite you twice right well yeah it bit me twice he beat you bit me when we went back in and he thought I was gonna be scared and he seen I caught him with need to shot then he bit me again man and I jumped back and I'm just getting ready to kick him in a bow and a bell wrong and I went back to the corner boy and I was so doggone man I was really gonna get him and they stopped the fight yeah and then I got mad because they stopped the fight cuz you were gonna get him Bobby I wanted to get him back well it seemed like he thought that you were gonna get him and he was trying to find a way out well that's the only thing that made sense well yeah but the thing is the only thing that I guess with me and when I stand on is that I was able to forgive him and that's that has been the turnaround in my life to tend to make people people only wanted by the ear by nicer but I forgave him thereby said so what's special about that ass but everywhere I go around the world but the Muslim of whatever and people said wow this guy I can't but yeah how can you forgive when you already been the guy yeah I thought but you know but it's it's what is what life have to be if you're gonna survive with even your brothers and sisters because if you don't forgive nobody you're gonna be a mad person you're gonna find yourself locked up right right and it's gonna haunt you whereas if you forgave him it took a weight off your shoulders yes I'm Tim I'm Mike and I we do a lot of things together because that forgive this part this is cool to see you two together now I mean when I have seen things that you've done together I'm like wow it's crazy like after he bit you those crazy fights and to see you together laughing and joking around together it's it's pretty interesting Wow when you tell people you know when you don't choose your parents you don't choose your neighborhood you ain't choose your skin color you ain't choose to be tall too short but you know this is your statue and and to people to people who came from the gutter who box and box was the only thing I did real well okay and football and but the thing is that after all that look how much money we made doing something that we by doing it properly we make money yeah we made money and we can both you know raise our family and the way that we want to raise them how long did it take after the fight before you forgave them right I think that's about about time I I got into the locker room and everybody strut complaining I can't believe he did this assistance I said look I said did he bite you they said no okay I said he bit me right and I said now I'm gonna forgive it you know what y'all got to forgive him too I said what's it mean forgiven honey he bite you she bit me I said look I'm a forgiving Wow so you forgave him in the locker room right after the fight yes look up the thing is the thing is I you know I was really mad coming coming down and people throwing water and people man and they'll upset because didn't get a chance to see what they really wanted to see right like this and so they were man and they were upset and I asked you know me I think who in control God so I said Lord what did this thing all about it he said forgiving so whoever I want to forgive but this is what live we will the two very important people they're about to come to see and they need to know that forgiveness is a big part of life and so I was able to do that so in the point of being able to do that you know I I realized that it made my life better all over the world Kleenex yeah sure powerful it really is that's a very powerful decision and you know it's a very powerful statement you know to for you to forgive him after that I mean that really that probably did a lot of good for a lot of people to realize man if Evander Holyfield can forgive Mike Tyson after he bit a chunk of his ear off I mean that's a that's a strong statement of character right there well you're not the thing is I didn't know a little early then that they may not want to got that their work out well but but it's amazing how what time would do for you right right at one point of time I'm coming summer so would have happened Brian but because they gave me a little time to think about and gave me and and I was like and you know and you know with me when when things things don't go right I go back to the prayers Lord what this are all about right and he's forgiveness and you know and I wouldn't be Who I am is it when from forgiveness and some air bottle fell short somewhere right am i dead so you know the whole big thing is and and I talked to the week a week after that I talked to my we were we we said all saw a basketball game and in New York N and I looked up and everybody was screaming I don't know what they're screaming about telling me to watch out I'm like watch out for who I looked up Oh Mike and he had the big bad coat and he like this and so here by was telling me and wanted me that Mike Mike there he had a big bear skin coat oh you know yeah big fur coat that big fur coat and stuff like that he went to number shake hands and a week after a we got the you know I'm just so easy ears probably still sore no no I won't even the thing is with my ear my is almost like a testimony right you know it's almost like you win or trophy yourself that a person looking said man he became that guy so I seen that more people when they see me they look at my ear they're not they see me anything else my likes it you know not in anger they smile and said he became that guy Wow so when you saw Mike did you guys talk yeah yeah week after the fight yeah what do you say to you matter of fact yes is wrong with next door to my no we can't we came out we we come out at the same time you look he look he asked me is it all good I said yeah so we get on the elevator whoa we come down when the door open everybody was shocked so they were shot wonder why we wasn't fight right he's just you to an elevator that's just you to an elevator yeah so I and so at the sharp on they said man and we thought they will be fine and I told the guys man I said you know how much my life got paid in that plane how much money can you say we go pay for fruit was ever talk about a third fight wait yeah have people mention you know they they mention it right and but you know I'm the thing is is that they want to give a lot of money and they asked me to try to and that my own thing is that I kind of feel like it's kind of a bully for you to ask somebody to fight to fight you again when you know you're gonna win again right I'm sure you know so the whole big thing is I just and I didn't think they if Mike is might want to do it I would have done it but I wasn't gonna go ask all right I think you've been a bully when you know you're better than somebody and you wanna you want to play them and something that you know you're gonna beat up right right you know it's a challenge is how about a challenge exact thing I can come back and beat you but you know just to just you know you feel that you better and so I think it would be wrong for me to ask it right no that's that's amazing I mean but that just shows what kind of a person you are like that shows what kind of character you have and that sort of defines your career that you are the guy that did always seek the big challenges yeah you know you know when it is you know I you know that nickname real deal and I was like and people asked me I get that name real deal I said you know I thank God for all the anything that great it comes from God at all given time you know I'm you know I had a mom who who had a sixth grade education but she raised me she worries the for time here with Jeff in the world she stayed on me all the time and my brothers and sisters said mom you don't make a sister to him you let him go out you'll wake up to nothing my momma said he gonna be all right you just wait and see and and when I think about she never did give in to what nobody said about about me and I became Who I am and I'm just so I'm just so thankful day and and the Bible said all good things coming god anything that is good for you it came from God it sounds like you rely on your mom and you relied on your mom a lot for wisdom wait that's all I had that's all I had clothes my brothers and sisters and stuff all of my own thing all them white me alive they may like me a little bit my mother my mama I know my mama love me they like me a little bit yeah but it's it's amazing to hear that your mother was right every stop at every step around all of her advice all paid out I mean she knew there was something special about you well waking up my mom thought so my mama knew some especially by everybody but you had to do the work right and and the art of me is jazz mama had a heart attack my mom had a heart attack and so my mama at home with me to make sure that I'm didn't hurt this a but you know what everybody that my mom worked ten to ten with there right right so I was the youngest one so she had a heart attack when I was like when I'm about six or seven years old so I got caught in everything so I got more whooping than everybody so out all that whooping the good person showed up yeah you got more advice than everybody else yeah have you ever thought about doing mics show you know mike has a podcast now did it did you get pop did you get high with him no I but you know well you know I did we I did it last last month okay is it out already I haven't seen it I gotta check that episode out that's incredible what was it like to let sit with him at the ranch and hang out with him it was okay yeah thing is you know I won't answer the questions and he kind of eggs man look man I know you don't did a little bit more than that if I did I forgot it Mike I forgot it you let your past in your past you to move forward he's a different person now well yeah I think he is yeah no he is he's a he's a very interesting guy he's very smart man oh yeah yeah a lot smarter than what people give him credit I live now that's what they don't know about yeah I know that yeah no he's very introspective very smart and very humble you know the way he looks at life now like and he doesn't even think about his old days like he doesn't like that guy he doesn't like who he used to be it's very interesting when you talk to him well yeah and your past is your past that's really leave it alone yeah and he smokes $40,000 worth of weed a month well I guess you have to mind your head well you're involved in CBD now right yes and sports is yes how amazing is CBD it's incredible right is amazing how good is for your health yes and so many people have you know your kids tonight your kids don't even ask the how the problem and some of them come up with these problems if you then have this this this this this is CBD mm-hmm then yo kids wouldn't probably wouldn't be when function is properly the state function is amazing it got so much this stuff got so much benefit mm-hmm even though if you take a bandaging anything too much anything that's not good for you right but I mean I don't think there's any way you can overdose on CBD right it's all just healthy for it's just oil well I know it's all different things how much of it do you take a day for me yeah you know I rub it on my leg and some like that and I just now found that they go to all drops that is really good for you now I didn't know that all the oral drops yeah yeah yeah so that you put on your tongue yeah I love those yeah I did see I didn't know that now that I know that I'm it's taking me some drops yeah I to bolts I take the drops and I rub it on muscles as well and they say it's good for your memory and all this is now I didn't know that yeah now I'm a probably remember a lot of stuff well you you got through a crazy boxing career remarkably well I mean your health is there you look great and did you do have any injuries or anything that still carries with you after all these years no see that's the thing I juiced a lot I juiced it like my main man the best be juicing on and I did that i I ate very clean with stuff like that did you have nutritionists that prepared anything else yeah I thought I had some people talked about nutrition but hey I kind of ate the way that I want because but I knew but our very discipline and what food they eat and whatnot D when you were eating did you did your meal plan or did you eat whatever you wanted to like what was a typical meal for a Vandy Hollifield when when when Evander Holyfield when you were in like your your peak condition and you're training for a fight like what would be like a typical meal during camp well you like juice like I ain't like eating a light mint green mm-hmm so after juice right juice the green spinach kale that kind of stuff I do that I do that that's the first thing I put in there then I get a chance to eat what I want to eat I like steaks mmm and I add my like chicken a lot but you know the thing is I'm like like panels are like apples I like all this poop stuff that you cook the Bears and all that these are the things that actually kind of you know become people saying do you have any tingle in your hand your feet anything I said do I suppose you tell other people do that's what but what did they do what did they eat right right III really ate real clean real good well tingling usually is associated with nerve damage right a lot of times people have back issues and neck issues from years of fighting I think even Mike had some neck surgery for it because of issues that he was having with his neck but Mike did a lot of like he did a lot of bridges remember on his neck he did a lot of like bridges like wrestling's type type bridges where he's balancing on his neck and rolling around back and forth that's not necessarily supposed to be the best thing for your neck either oh did you do that right you know I'm you know I see somebody doing something and they good imma try it out so did you try it out after you saw him doing no no no but I'm probably be I start doing that way as a kid and football practice okay we rolled on the neck and all this is the fact that you kind of felt that you know you were strong is your gonna hold you like that and I did that a lot how much like how many days did you work like you got your typical boxing workout was sparring hitting the meds and then roadwork but you would also do strength and conditioning yes and like some serious physical exercise like how did you break up like training camp like how many days a week did you spend doing weight lifting type deal stuff and how many days were you doing the other things well yeah with the boxing part you know I do that you know five days a week and but and the weight lifting of three three times a week and but you know but I only have three work out a day three oh yeah three well because you know you got I said my condition coach was he was especially in conditioning mm-hmm so we don't we go do all he gonna each and every training he gonna do certain thing it was the most important thing was to box him we did the boxing part out first then then what type of run we're gonna do we ingest his Rangers run five miles you know we gonna spread some time he come up with the different the different methods that that that you have three workout a day but you Todd Brandi probably didn't work number fifteen minutes but you're tired that's a tough to up ten minutes right and like so so he had these these things that allow me to understand that whenever I get time this is when you know how good a shape you into what you do when you're tied right right and so and so and so you know so it's a it's a thinking program oh so then all I timed myself out and and and your knees hurting you and you can't do nothing the next day you get tired out the Tipsy men who went it over you you got all this energy like that so everything was about recovering everything about recovery right so you he was basically shocking your system with a bunch of different kinds of accounts and then allowing you to recover and do you think if CBD was around back then you would have probably used a lot huh I'm not for sure you know I'm not for sure because the whole thing with me is understanding what do it do for me right now I'm you know I'm not I wouldn't type of person that concern about you now I gotta understand we're gonna have what it gonna do for me right if it makes you do this but is they gonna make me do this yes see if it gonna make me do it it's gonna make me feel good gonna make me be confident and and I as I'm had to depend on this the rest of my life by start right I did so I remember and and and when with Pan American gaming and and I've read in 1983 so they they got the cow practice to pop everybody neck and and and put their men where they can fight good they want to see here about a win and I'm the only one when doing and and they said why I said cuz I don't have any money and they said well we you don't have to pay in the money I said yeah but I'm if this feel good I'm gonna need it every day and they ain't got no money so what I'm gonna do I said my mama told me I don't start nothin you carry paper so I so so I'm the only one that didn't go to the dude is known the chiropractor work or nothing because I didn't want nothing that I can't afford to do I and so of course when after the you know I when I turned pro coming from pro I was able to afford it then I go to Cal practice all the time now but why get something new that you came paid for then you gonna make up an excuse true why you didn't do good today because anybody cracked my leg I have nobody to do this or anything that is done you got the you got to be able to afford to do it was it hard for you to retire no I just want I just want to know that I did the very best what I didn't want to do I didn't want to retire didn't come back mmm and cuz you know I you know if you're doing I habitat do it right well my mom me do it right and make it when you start make sure it is over yeah and so you know I'm and I think after after one of my last fight my last fight I met the Klitschko brothers and and I asked him why they didn't want to fight they said you know it managed to er told us they yeah you don't need to fight him like this and like that and they they chose not to fight because he managed to it told that you know and but I I guess the most positive thing about the whole situation when I were coming back from Russia I seen I see the table Holly and Holly you know Holly wait you wanna he when he lost his marrow he would try to be for time mm-hmm and he said why just be happy for three why did I have to go forward when I seen that I said I'm on the top right why not I'm the best thing that ever bit I broke our leaf record why don't just this rest and be thankful and I chose to us because the fact that amount records are meant to be broken somebody gonna break it eventually right long bars and Catina Cocos you looking at you're looking for to improve the game to improve that's a great attitude that I wish more boxers would have because it's for fighters many times the highs of being a champion and winning big championship fights on television under the bright lights those highs are so high that after they get off and they retire they just miss it they miss it so bad and we've seen everybody all the greats from Larry Holmes to Sugar Ray Leonard all the greats come back except Hagler the Hagglund never came back and Andre Ward says he's not gonna come back either but Hagler to me was one of the most impressive because he's just after that Sugar Ray Leonard fight he went well god I'm done that's it I'm done I'm done I'm here that it was amazing but the fact is you know you're cutting two people yeah you know you don't have to talk when you a good fighter you know what right career pie ask me why you never said that how it goes I have to said that when people look at they start talking about I don't have to said that well that was a big part of you was your humility but confidence you were always a humble man but always a very confident man and as a fighter that's a very admirable quality like you didn't have a lot of haters or detractors when you were the champ people just appreciated who you were as a man all that go to credit my mom my mom used to tell me when she said zip the lip too much zip it up yeah you would never a guy that bragged you know when you see these guys like Floyd Mayweather that he gets so much attention obviously he's an incredible boxer maybe one of the best boxers if not the best of all time but just always talks crazy amounts of shit but that has also got him a crazy amount of money and a crazy amount of attention but you never went that route well you know because the fact is it wasn't about money yeah I'm telling you the love that you have and that you can account to say anytime somebody asked me something and not just me yeah my mama I can always account to these people that this boy's club but you know I tell people I said now I started going through the boys club at the age of six years old I said now I said I said I didn't choose my neighborhood that I chose a little bit I said but I said but everybody in that neighborhood told you ain't gonna be nothing I'm coming I'm some ass kid you growing up and you were telling you ain't gonna be nothing you ain't gonna be nothing and so going through that boy said the boys club start talking about goals what do you want to be I'm something you know now I'm that kid I can't lie and say they always ask me what do you want to be so yeah and all I just know I want to be great they say in what it's way if you don't do nothing you got to find out what you want to be graded so you you let you play basketball lets you play base for all these different things everyday you you know you an age group six I'm eight years old we could do all these different things woodshop you know they wouldn't let you do what you want to do you have to you know you had your the group a group of people you have to different at different hours different time you go to these different things make sure that you learn to see all the different things that you can be but if you know if you never was in and class and have rules to tell you to do what you want to do you may not ever become nothing I became Who I am because I went through that boys club and they they wanted me to learn all these different things so you'll find that drink or be great and everything but least you know when to be quiet when to talk when not to because you're not gonna be the greatest one and all the things that you do do you have any regrets when you look back on your championship career no no nothing not at all I'm hoping said you know I'm I'm a lot better than what I even dreamed of but whatever thought about and like this but all these things that I wanted to be I you know what the ultimate thing I want to do to make my mama proud I wanted my mom to be proud of me because my mama cry so much bye what what you should have did was it on and you know and and I just want to be one of the ones that I did what my mama said and she was proud of me and and all that and and and eventually it became that way well how could she not be proud of you well I'm in a four-time heavyweight champion I mean you're a van der Holyfield but you but you don't win it now when I came back from the Olympics yeah I kind of had to ego a little bit because I have done something that nobody else done at my family so my Bob I'm on my house but she want the house that I want to give her I want to put in a nice neighborhood she wanted been nice neighbor she said I want to be by the bus stop she goes I don't want to be depending on when you're gonna come pick me up at night I said my man good and good then we have bus stop call people they don't want everybody seeing what they got called people still my momma said but I don't want to depend on you cause I don't know when you're gonna come over here not I need to build a bus stop Wow so I was kind of upset because I want to buy my mama this nice house with me to talk about I'm gonna get a house that ain't nobody want to talk about it it's a big old old house but my mama didn't care about that my mama care about if everybody come home everybody got a room now I wanna I want to give her a three three bedrooms she want to get an eight bedroom for nothing yeah I was gonna call 250 on one I want one is called fifty thousand and so she wanna take the 50 thousand I'm trying to figure I want something I could brag about I bought my mum and but my mama said you know son she said son I'm not more than you I love them to these my kids just like I don't love you no more I love them right and so when my mama told me that I came to understand that she was thinking about if everybody came home everybody have a room right but you come in that three bedroom and they ain't gonna be enough room for everybody you but what was the size of the house that you built you built some crazy gigantic the 4,000 square feet what yeah 54,000 square feet yes why did you build a house that big what the thing is I thought about all the things that all the things that I didn't have and I thought about what I could afford and and I was thinking about Generation Y or not this I didn't build a house just for the family now I'm for the grandkids and I figure you know you know I I love my kids and I and they were gonna have some kids and then they gonna have to get I'm so you know you have a place still for everybody so it's practical to mean to me it was car you you only do what you can afford to do right and you could afford you make of fifty four thousand square-foot house Jesus how many acres was that thing on we had a hundred seventy five acres when that was done that must have been crazy it caused a lot more than it probably would have if I would have thought about it if I knew what I know today right and then you know it like what what was different that different hizzy I'm just I just got people to do it and and then didn't have no organization and getting professional people who know how to do it it's called the house calls me a lot more then then it should have it was a famous house because it was so big and so expensive you know cause you did somebody and then somebody get a little cheaper than you you counted kind of mad when you sold it you mean yeah yeah yeah how much did you wind up selling it for you know five million and how much did you build it for are twenty sure Wow that's a big hit well yeah yeah somebody got a deal well but you know but it's part of life you learn from your mistakes who's living in it now I got named Rick Ross Rick Ross the rapper yep really yeah that's crazy yep Wow good for him yeah Natan they doing the movie coming to America there are they really get them yes I probably a part of it you're in that right coming to America too right when is that starting a film uh coming up coming up about wicket is that Eddie Murphy as well yeah and Arsenio Hall's you all right man that's beautiful that's gonna be crazy to be in your old house yeah well you ain't crazy but you know I'm but you know I get invited over there a lot and they still call it my house no they feel better well you designed it right oh yeah yeah yeah idea did you put a gym in it oh yeah Jim I put it I put everything in it pretty much I I copied off Scarface you know that's only I don't want to movie that I'd say that you know you know people come up in a tough situation and I come all that they are right and so I I've taught them and one way another I'm not dead but I came up a tough way too right and so the thing is that you want your kids to have more than you have and something better well that's what I mean every great champion wants that they want a house that shows like this is where the heavyweight champion of the world lives and when you got a hundred and seventy-five acres in fifty-four thousand square feet and the way that house looked like well that looks like a World Championship house well I had a ring look like a championship belt - really yeah shape back a championship belt yeah is there pictures of that online know what I want to see that how long did it take to build that a year just a year yeah damn that's fast for a house it's 54,000 square feet well did not button they did Wow do you still live in Atlanta now no I live in Fort Lauderdale what are you doing down there well you know it's good for tax you know oh yeah sure Florida's great tax rules yeah there it is right now whoo you see the house from the roof that is a crazy spread look at the size of your pool yep you get lost in that pool like a championship but that's amazing yeah that is amazing now do you do you still work in boxing like do trained fighters or anything like that you work with anybody no I'm I'm part of the promotion I'm part of the promotion I found the thing is that I I don't exactly wanna coach no one person because I don't want to be that a Bursar's that if I'm in your calling they don't think I'm just gonna give it to you and then pretend to think that mm-hmm but because I know I know how it was when when I I'm getting ready to fight I was getting ready to fight George Foreman and Muhammad Ali came in the ring and and he waved his hand so he come and tell me he's at I'm for you tell me about you then he went and told George Foreman the same thing that's hilarious fighting George Foreman must have been a trip - because you're fighting someone from a different generation you know here's a legend from Ali's generation yeah if we like kind of different to me and so I didn't really want to fight Joy's I just wanted to fight Tyson and so my my business manager Shelly Finkel told me is that Evander it's my job as your business manager to tell you the thing about money he said you know I said I want to get to third and he said no I'm gonna get you a 50 million I saw how he said if you fight George first they gonna get you 20 he said but if you fight Tyson first and get 30 thing on key to talking to further right let's go they don't think you could be joy I said man I said joy - oh yeah but they believed Joy's gonna knock you ha that's on reason when you're twenty million dollar bet I can you quitting me about like okay because he's a fight well George even though he was old could still knock people out when he knocked Michael Moore out I mean that was crazy of course he knocked him knocked him out after as he lost kiss me he nam like a boy I cuz I lost gets much more yeah so it show you that he didn't give up on on history Brian his dream was to be the champ again yeah and the eventually got the oldest ever always ever got to regain the championship yeah and it kind of sad because I think I suppose be told us because I you know that big ol Russian that was yes yeah well I bawled him yes and and ESPN they scored it me live the Warren mm-hmm and they get a decision too valuable yeah no I saw that fight that was that was a bad decision oh yeah as in every sense or um you should have won what how old were you at that time how four six so you were a year older uh yeah yeah so constant Tyson I say you know I can tell that we had the best error that's because you the youngest heavyweight champ in the world I suppose but you know oldest I said what could I ever that is you had both of the people yeah young is it true yeah you know cuz at the time you the Bazin Tyson did this thing at 20 years old 20 years old and I had a lot of people they would talk about say oh you know what you know you did see you just a great either but I had a title with 20 I say no tell them what I would have been if I were bid some bets witty right I said you know I said I see you talk about a kid right I said I said a mid-weight heaven world at 28 years old and if I said well you you act so different 28 in a twenty year old you're gonna see some different lot more maturity yeah it's a different person yeah to of being 20 and winning the heavyweight championship of the world I don't know who could do that and not go crazy well because the thing is he was the most photographed person at that time yeah every time you look up you see my coat yeah she said Michael after me just and did a lot of incredible stuff too he certainly did what do you think about today's era of boxing's but particularly the heavyweight division I mean it's it's real exciting right now I think it's coming back yeah st. comes back you know Ruiz don't stick to the picture and and I like that because here's a guy you look at you may think he can't fight right fighters he can fight well Yahoo that Andy Ruiz can throw some combinations sure I bite and I was I was telling the friend of Mines I'll tell a friend of mine I said I said they picked the wrong guy hmm he said what you talking about man step right here ladies I see he just looked like that he can fight I spoke with it I say he the first person I have was that I say I never want to fight really yeah I said he would that he would that good I'm saying no now at that time I was huh I was a four to six so he had to be probably 19 and I just said and my dad my first time ever seeing a guy I said I want to fight like this how a glad that I retired after 46 he has beautiful combinations and you look at his body and you say oh that's a guy that's overweight but underneath all that fat there's an incredible athlete but that's what I'm saying yeah you know you just can't you just can't go by ha look these day cuz Anthony Joshua looks like a Greek god we're sure did I mean he looks like he's carved out of stone oh yeah he knocked him down that guy got up and knocked everything crazy and then you got Deontay Wilder who's one of the craziest heavyweight knockout artist ever I mean that guy has preposterous power you know and it cuz people asked me by him I said well you know what that's the only thing I can say he from Alabama to I said I'm from Alabama so in the water beats up I said but it's his confidence mm-hmm you know Deon he go in he go in and he fight his fight and and when he can see that shy he doing it and they're buddy-buddy he get wild at the end I think he least he know the guy hurt though right right he don't get wild before the guy gets hurt right I'll bet he'd know the guy hurt I said so he can he can take chances so in looping shot back then comes a guy hurt I was about Lee she's smart enough to know but I remember the time when he got hurt he got knocked down and all that and one thing did he show he had confidence cause people don't have company they get hurt they started trying to run right when he got hurt he came forth and that's the reason why he was able to survive that round then the next round he knocked the guy well or teasing him we're gonna have a rematch yeah I'm some that's the guy that it was Ortiz is no joke he's a dangerous fighter when that country not couldn't figure out why you were give another chance which shows his confidence confidence in show confidence goes the back of the man now ain't nobody even after that fight wanna fight or a teach the other day there nah imma wish him go away yeah because he's a good fighter and he is one of the most most clever fighters out there yes and that's reason I like okay you did one time okay you know why let him knock somebody else out and let him upset somebody before you come back and Ortiz is getting old but you know no one even knows how old he really is because he's from Cuba you know this speculation these fifty years old people don't even know right but he's an amazing fighter he's so skilled out of that Cuban amateur program I mean his boxing is just top-notch and he had Deonte in all sorts of trouble but you're right Walters showed that he could overcome adversity and then his power that's one of the more impressive things about him his power doesn't go away he keeps that power like deep in the 12th round when he knocked out Tyson Fury or knocked down the ice and fury in the 12th round it looked like it was over that's what I'm saying yeah this what you talk confidence yeah and I told him I said look man oh I see the only person that I know that tall and lighter than me let me fight to 30 pipe to 13 he was 209 when he fought Tyson Fury 209 the day of the fight that's crazy I'm like I said yeah that was confidence in all this yeah and I kind of shit you know but he don't worry about it right I'm limp you know I don't care see and that's what that's why I like it just certain people took me with me everybody said well you did they started talking about this care about that I could fight man yeah and you know what when he when he saw talking to people and people get scared up cuz he said look man I can fight I know what I could do yeah he know he I already got doing hitch with that big right hand or the left hand I thought that what's in cuz ya cuz I seen him when he hit this boy now the hook that will that 12th round it was a right hand and a left hook behind it snap Tyson's head back but I mean Tyson Fury is incredible two men that guy got up after that 99% of the people on planet earth would still be out cold after those two punches but I try to get people to see I see now the referee then supposed to let him get up most people most fighter would get up mm-hmm but the referee well dab on when you jump on you won't let you and said because because for you to lay flat like that for four or five seconds they supposed to do that right most referees would have called it off right yeah yeah well thank God he didn't well or you know but I'm out for sure come it messed up the whole thing he would have been the champ so now yeah but aren't you excited that he got up and then Tyson Fury wound up winning the rest of the round what wait yeah he did he done but steel when you do the thing right yo job will be saving a fighter right and I see so you think the referee should have probably saved supposed to do with it empty my own thing cuz I'm saying if it was anybody else they would've did it you know what bothers me what bothers me is the count was more than ten seconds what I asked what I'm saying that's what bothers me about what bothers me is I think it shouldn't be the referee going one two it should be a number like there should be like a timer they do have a time they have a timer this is how you know they they had to they have a guy with a referee thinking he count too right but if he's counting I want a number like a digital clock that shows you ten actual seconds I think they should have something like that still leave it up to the referee some referees like one two three other referees like one two and that's not seconds that's not seconds you just write to coach you know what called the even after them the referee wears a glove now look at and look at a lot of seconds yeah I did know when you look at he had about 30 seconds yeah at 30 seconds and then he said oh he even come acid but you know they wouldn't did that to anybody mm-hmm right I said but how about now now what bottle that mean was what bothered me I said hi to you I see if he going in the other country fight and they other than the guy doing him like this they stopping the fight right a lot of referees will to stop that fight I said hey I say stop the fight yeah I said no I said hi is it when somebody come in yo country and and and they and you give them the ups right something's wrong with this I said no I just think it was his it was such a big fight like everybody wanted to see that fight it was such a huge fight well you know obviously even though I'm saying you go in another country you know if that fight closed in the way you're not kidding right right you're not getting it right and you get like just like like oh I'll hit that guy the game the guy name is throwing a punch or some of the rounds I'm in be asked the guy said how can you win around when you land or punching that round the first he's ever done that is Willie pepper will have one round shields by being a slick defensive fighter but he was so impressive that people gave him the round anyway you know that's a that fight was that was a fight that begged for a rematch just begged for a rematch and it bothers me it's one of the things that bothers me about boxing sometimes is that these fights they don't they don't come to fruition and then if I mean he almost lost in his Tyson with that laughs that cut in his last fight I mean that was a bad cut yeah they could have stopped that fight I know yeah because but you know they they stop they stop it where they want to stop yeah so you got to understand who would lead this thing off to a point where that you got to get some honey in the game with me in the bar game I just wanted it to be right because then I know how how important it is for anybody who could they life online to be a fighter and won't you say aye aye it was fair I did as I did my all least I got my opportunity yeah well listen Evander I really appreciate your time I really appreciate you coming in here and like I said I've been a giant fan your entire career so it was an honor to meet you and an honor to have you on here brother thank you very much thank you Evander Holyfield ladies and gentlemen thank you sir bye everybody [Applause] [Music] [Music]
