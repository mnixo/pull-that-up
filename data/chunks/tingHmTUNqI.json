I didn't realize how good your hair is thanks I'm losing it but it's what's left of it so boom and we're live gentlemen hello Sean hey how are you hello Tom hello Joseph what's good you guys did a movie did you make a movie we made a movie guys do movies we do or movie guys how many movies have you made one well yeah you've made it how many of you made before I like six but yeah but we've made one we've made one what's your favorite one other than one that's right now which is definitely a favorite because you're promoting it right now sex drive sex drives it's the one nobody knows about yeah it's his first one nobody knows about it I mean it's just it was one of those movies that just opened and nobody knew about it but it was it was a really really fun movie maybe we can change that yeah I've tunes or Netflix yeah yeah it's all James Morrison's in it this is the one is this the one that you like when you made it you're like and maybe I'll go back to working fuckin construction yeah yeah yeah that's how I thought I thought it was over after that did you finance it or anything no no we made it we made it with summit pictures and it was it was it was amazing they they we were in town trying to get a career going you know trying to trying to make things happen we were making a TV pilot at the time which was a living hell and and we had gone out and pitched this idea to a bunch of places and nobody bought it so then in the middle of our editing our pilot summit pictures called and said we really would keep thinking about that pitch would you guys be willing to write it and I said you know what tell him I was really busy I said tell him we'll write it if I can direct it but I figured that would make him go away and they said alright and so we went in and we wrote it and we turned it in and they greenlit it it was this crazy this is this crazy process where we got this movie greenlit and I think we wrote the draft in like a month then we turned it in and they loved it what's it about it's a it's a it's a teen roadtrip movie it's about this these kids that it was kind of in the early days of the you know Facebook and all that stuff and it might have even been I don't know never track the might even been like sort of MySpace into Facebook that era you know but it was about a kid who meets a girl online and goes to lose his virginity on a road trip it's funny she is it is funny a Marsden's in it james marsden he's really funny Clark Duke and yeah good cast and there it is yeah Wow good I am but it was a really great experience it was really fun and then we we we tested it we did the test screenings and it just murdered like it was just and the studio got really excited and I thought oh my god like I'm gonna have a huge career and then movie came out and it didn't do anything I was like okay I'm gonna go back to Wisconsin and and not have a career at all so is it true that instant family you hired Tom because Bert Kreischer wasn't available yes kind of stammers don't tell me that man that's what I heard well and he was asking he was asking for a lot of money a lot more with him well he's like whatever marks yet so I want double so this movie is based in in no small part on your own life experiences it is of adopting an actual you adopted like a full family three human children yeah wow that's wild that's a that's a bold maneuver sir yeah well the ages six three and a year-and-a-half and Wow yeah what was the process well it starts and this is how it starts in the movie as well my wife and I have four years I didn't I wasn't making any money including when after I made sex drive and I so I didn't really feel like I could afford to have kids so whenever we talked about it I'd just be like you know not there yet and and then finally when I felt like I was doing better I'm starting to get a career together I just started to feel like I was gonna be one of those old dads you know like by the time the kid was a teenager I wasn't gonna be able to play with a old you know I'm 49 now I was 41 at the time and so man it's depressing anyway so I I made this dumb joke to my wife I said look why don't we just adopt a five-year-old it'll be like I got started five years ago and I'm like I'm you know right back in the game and she was like you know that's actually a really interesting idea and I was like no I'm I was totally kidding didn't mean anything like that and and then she went to a website and she showed me the website and then when I saw the website I was like oh wow you see these kids you see their faces you start to learn a little bit more about it and we just started having conversations and it it went from there now I got three kids in a movie and they're all siblings yes so they all came from one mom and would what is how did they get separated from the family I don't have a lot of details about that you know they don't really tell you right you know you know a little bit but not much I mean I know that there was that there were issues with drugs and and I think there was some kind of a fire at some point but it's all pretty pretty sketchy as far as what you hear you learn a lot about the kids themselves but not that much about the situation and what what made you want to turn this into a film like I would imagine that's a very personal experience yeah it was actually my writing partner John Morris because I had been about three years into it at that point and the beginning of it was a nightmare like like epic bad decision why did we ever do this really yeah it was it was really a nightmare for a short time and then when it came online and we became a family it really became the best thing that ever happened to me and you know when John and I get together every day we just talk about our lives a little bit that's how we get started so John had been hearing all these stories and one day he just said I don't know why we're not doing a movie about this because nobody really knows how this works when you go into foster care and adopt kids so we started talking about it and then there was the conversation of whether it could be a comedy or not because that's what we do we make comedies and John again was like most of the stuff you've told me is really funny so not all of it of course but that's and then we thought wow you know we could approach this as a comedy and we might be able to get you know a more general audience to get there their interest in it that because it'll feel less scary because that's the problem is that most movies that are made on this topic just frighten people and they make people think that these kids are all damaged and right reachable right thing you know do you worried that it'd be like that movie 101 Dalmatians that a bunch of people start getting foster kids now and just screw them up yeah we we were talking about Top Gun about how you know remember when Top Gun came out and everybody joined the Navy thinking they were gonna fly the plane the color of money came out pool halls boomed across the country made a giant impact on pool halls that one Tom Cruise movie and there's just really a lot of people just got scammed out of their fucking I think the crazy thing about this too was that like on the set you realize like when we're doing this you go like oh yeah I always thought of people who do that like you know they exist but you're like those are nameless faceless angels they're not real people right now if you're like do any of your friends a top I'd be like no I don't friends like that I think those are other people you know and then you start like on the set there was you know people visiting or consulting and there would be like oh you know they adopted or they run some foster care thing and then you're like I think this is actually something that people really do well even like dudes on the crew that somebody would come up you know who's in the electrical department be like oh hey bro I got adopted two kids by the way if you like really yeah you know or hey I got adopted when I was four years old you just would like once now you see it now everywhere yeah people are hitting me up someone hit me up yesterday like my sister is adopting four siblings this week Wow yeah it's nuts I mean like it's like something I don't know it's almost like when your friend gets a car and the we talked about that video that went around online of this little girl that realizes she's opening up a box and there's something in it that tells her that she's been adopted by these two people that are with her and it's really yeah it's impossible to not cry yeah I mean if you have any heart at all and you watch that little girl freak out and it's it breaks you up I think that's almost the test is for is what you were talking about about house because believe me I test if you're a piece of shit what's your reaction oh you're a piece of shit your sociopath yeah but no I mean there's that what you were just getting as far as believe me I'm not that guy that like I didn't feel special or and like any one of those sort of heart of gold angels you know we have a line that's in the movie where Mark just says that's for the kind of people that volunteer when it's not even a holiday and we don't do that yeah you should probably tell the audience that I'm not starring in this movie right now for people people are like so Tom starts no it's it's Mark Wahlberg here's a movie for like four and a half minutes there you go and then everyone Wahlberg stars in the rest of it that's true it's a good way of breaking it down it was only probably like 90 minutes that's pretty good it's not bad like seven scenes it's good scenes yeah mr. poster no you know you made the stand II though did you know that there's a stand II in movie theaters and you're in that oh really no one heard that word stand II stand II those are the big cardboard yeah those things were cause I didn't know that either cardboard cutout thing that's what I always call it cardboard cutout dandy is the real the real term is that the term in the industry is yeah that's an industry term that's a real industry term you like okay yeah wait so you cuz you were telling me this and I was like he was about to tell me before you came and I was like this sounds like this could be pretty good don't tell me save it for the podcast that because he's done that this is the most press John's done for a film that he's put out that did you go under they were like let's give you some advice on media yeah well first of all I'm terrible at it oh there's that because I don't do this is the thing when you direct a movie especially movies like the kind of movies that I make they're comedies and you know big broad comedies people don't really care who directed those movies and I'm good with that like I'm totally good with that but what usually happens is the studio the director usually wants to be kind of a part of the campaign so the studio will find they'll sort of throw bones at you of like press that you can do and I always tell them look if I can be helpful in any way let me I'll do whatever you need me to do but don't throw many bones cuz I don't care right I don't need to do that to kind of just pump up the ego of the director this certain directors just really want to be the next Quinton turn yeah yeah I can't I can't imagine there's some directors they really have to do it for well I mean I get it they don't want you to feel left out or whatever but by my first couple movies I thought oh I have to do this stuff and then I realized I actually had this experience where I was in this red carpet thing and they brought me up to this reporter and they said this is Sean Anders he directed the movie and she had this big look on her face and then she went thing oh geez and I was like nah it's cool you know and that's when it sunk in to me where I was just like oh they don't care they don't give you so that's that's fine with me I'm good there well there's such Fame whores and those they are those red carpet things they're so weird yeah those things are so weird and some people that is the highlight of their life walk in that carpet yeah I can't over here Tom your pose down right it's a really weird thing also paparazzi at the airport you have that where I've seen them where I'm at baggage and they're looking around and then they're like hey Tom and they'll ask me like more thing really they're obviously not there for me but they're like they're like we got time til fuckin whatever seth rogen gets off the plane so let me ask you something and then they're like alright nevermind here's everybody just blow you off happen only one time because this obviously doesn't happen yeah who's flying into LAX said I was getting off a red-eye and I was so just tired I look like shit and that and this guy these two guys come up and they just were so nice they were like hey you're Sean Anders right and I was like yeah yes I am nobody ever you know and so it takes me a second to realize and I thought it was so weird because they were at was right after it was shortly after daddy's home and that was like the biggest hit yeah and they were asking me about Horrible Bosses 2 and I was like why are they asking me about of all things or and I thought oh because Jennifer Aniston's in it so they want me to say something about Jennifer Aniston and just see if they can catch me saying something crazy right looking for a sound bite slip or something all they try to do it was so much it's weird and my wife is like what was that I'm like I it took me like an hour to sort of like trying to make you clickbait it's nice yeah well what's interesting too is it's like sort of an impromptu interview that you have to do right like if someone said hey this is guy's name is Mike he lives in Studio City he wants you to go to his house and he's gonna film you he's gonna ask you wacky questions no yeah Mike shows up yeah baggage claim and puts that camera in your face hey Sean jennifer aniston man what's up with the Botox what yeah fuck right I mean that's how they get like you wouldn't do an interview with them under any other circumstances which is one of like one of the weird things that happened during the Roseanne Barr things Roseanne Barr when her show was canceled and all the controversy was going on she was supposed to do the podcast and it became a big news thing right because she put it on her her Twitter that I'm gonna do it and we talked about it and then they tried to show up at the podcast studio so they had all these news people standing outside the podcast studio with their microphones we route it out in front of where Joe Rogan does his podcast and they thought for some reason just because they're there people have to talk to them right guys I'm here yeah talk too much they're made out of milk they're barely human the way they talk is the most boring version of an interview you'd ever get ever it's a tiny quick little sound bite and they feel it because they're they're like the cameras on I've got the microphone come on yeah ooh it if they said hey you know kW fuck yourself wants you to come in and and sit down for an interview you'd be like no I don't want I don't want to talk to them I don't have anything to say there you go I'll do all my talking on the podcast yeah well but and also if you're I mean I'm in the business but again I'm not somebody that does a tremendous amount of press or at least not until a couple of weeks ago and if you're not accustomed to that it's terrifying it's weird because somebody puts a camera in your face because immediately you're thinking like well if I just go you know what man fuck you like I don't have time for that work yeah then you're gonna so you just walk away from this so you just feel like you're all of a sudden somebody threw a cage over you and then Ivan we're asking you can I do this they're not doing it just hey Sean yeah let me ask you a question Sean you know it's forced it's forced on you yeah well not you know it puts you in a weird spot it's like all of a sudden you're in you're on you're on your heels yeah because your instinct is to be defensive if so you're you know I mean your instinct is not gonna be I'll give the most thoughtful answer to this because it's it's it's in the moment someone just dropped it on you so now you're like okay and your emotions might be kind of all over the place and you're not you're not stopping to like like having a conversation you're just sort of trying to figure your way out of it and how many people have ruined their careers or lives on those things just yeah just fucked up and said one thing just trying to be funny or just that's the thing because they'll misquote ated and then they get yeah and then they put it up and you like fuck what and I think through that it was just I was coming home from the airport I was tired I was jet-lagged Bourdain got a shitload of death threats because he said they asked him if you had a serve dinner to kim jong hoon and Donald Trump what would you serve he said hemlock was trying to be funny yeah and then he all these mega fucking morons protesters were there they were all sending these tweets like POTUS you know he's threatening POTUS and it was so strange yeah like where where's the Anna oh you know where is the Secret Service they should lock this motherfucker up and like you guys are crazy that's joke and that's the thing right there is that clickbait articles are they all make it'll say like so-and-so said this and they make it sound like somebody like called a press conference to say something ridiculous yeah and really it was like you like you said it'll be some offhand remark and then people out there that are judging they never have anybody walk up and put a camera in their face and they just think well I would never say anything like that it's like you don't know what you would say you're never in that situation it's bizarre it's very bizarre yes so how many of these things did you have to do to promote this film because it because this film is based in you know a lot of a large part of it on your actual life experiences of adopting these kids how many of these things did you have to wind up doing a lot because I did we did our press junket York and I've done junkets and usually I do like you know six or seven or 15 or whatever I did in two days I did like ninety ninety five so do the same questions keep coming out over and over again you start developing these canned responses well that's the thing you have to and this is a mistake and this gets back to what you were getting at before is that when I would do press on my movies in the past I'd go to the junket and people would come in and they'd ask you more or less the same questions and I always felt weird cuz I just felt like now I just want to have a conversation with you I don't wanna be like this disingenuous guy and then I would be sort of changing up my answers and trying to kind of get it just essentially just made it boring and I wasn't really making any kind of a point whatsoever so on this one they were like look you've got a message with this movie you've got things you want to get out with this movie you've got to learn how to do this so I would I went to like a day of media training and it was and it was and the worst part was I I've been fine before but I got this guy sitting across from me who's who's interviewing me doing this mock interview and then I've got the publicist and my writing partner and they're just staring at me and now listen I can't do it right the pressure is there who's teaching you who's teaching this media training here's were they right away like you kind of suck at this yeah absolutely I mean they were really nice about it they're like okay alright well there's some through some room for perfect oh my god really oh yeah no it was the worst you seem like an a is there to teach you well no well this this is the things I'm really comfortable with this yeah but with us just hanging out here talking sure but this is what I do is I Yammer when I'm a nervous talker so you asked me a question if I'm nervous I just kind of go and go and go and people like Jesus you know yeah so the thing is I got this guy stood across me really nice guy and he's the guy who's coaching me but I know I'm gonna give you like fake interviews looking how they quote you first he gave me he gave me a lot of really good insights and the funny thing is every rule that he's saying as he's saying and I'm oh yeah I do that oh yeah like everything he's saying that I shouldn't be doing I'm like oh yeah that's I always do things you shouldn't be doing I mean that the main thing it's kind of like we were getting at before that when somebody's setting a trap for you because so much of right now media training is just about don't go out and get yourself into trouble by going in and and just talking about some ridiculous area that because that's what people that's what everybody's trying to do now like it just as a for example I did a Time magazine interview about adoption about a year before we even made the movie really yeah and it was just because I was in the process of working on the movie and anyway so I the whole thing was just about adoption in my family and whatever and it was right when the Harvey Weinstein stuff was blowing up so ladies really nice interview and then at the end she says hey you know since I'm talking to a Hollywood director I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff and I was like no I enemy and I didn't even think about my answer because I don't you know I didn't know the guy was never around any of it that's sort of like more like fancy movies and I was like yeah no I don't I don't know I never met the guy whatever I didn't think anything of it I got off the phone and then I thought oh she didn't say what do you think about this stuff she said did you know about that stuff hmm it was like and yet I knew but I kept it a secret yeah those people and I just thought yeah I just you know yeah it's it's it's sneaky that's a sneaky way of asking too sneaky it the way to get you to yeah no yeah yeah did you know well if you don't enter soliciting secret from you listen I'm such a dumb shit I would have like you said before I think I think a year or two ago I might have made a joke you know and been like oh yeah I was there you know yeah that's pretty yeah Jonas was there you know yeah so so you know a lot of it is just just to kind of teach you how to just sort of stay on point so that you don't get dragged down these weird roads into these things that just that people are looking to get you in on clickbait so did you bring up that instance when you went through the training oh yeah did you say what should I have said did I think and really what they what they teach it was funny because believe it or not he said I'm gonna show you some clips of you know sort of doing it right and doing it wrong oh they have disaster Clips they say they do and one of them the file that you sent to Jamie before the show you guys will probably all know this one they showed me a clip of Quentin Tarantino sort of like getting really angry with this reporter that the violent thing yeah some guys asked that lady was like your films are disgusting and violent and he was like yeah they're fucking movies dummy like about it where was this actually I write it's the same one cuz the one that I saw was a guy oh I saw him with a lady but that was vyas at like okay so this is a different one then there was one of the guys threatening to kick the guy's ass I don't the one that I saw didn't go that far but I actually kind of liked what he said because he was like no I'm not playing that game with you I'm not doing he got up up but I was sort of like yeah you know yeah I mean I like the one with the lady the lady is like your movies are so violent awful and he's like a movie a make-believe thing it's not real violence like he really SAS is there it's funny as shit and then I also it was like he was doing you know she was she was like good morning Pittsburgh Oh like the entertainment reporter and then he was actually probably doing like satellite stuff everywhere and he was just like you're dumb so but I also saw there's that guy he's a gotcha guy too did a Robert Downey jr. it was like promoting a movie to I don't know if they showed you I saw that one right and the guys like yeah now your drug addiction he was like wait what it was totally to try to get him you know in a moment and Robert Downey jr. is not having it he's like not having to promote a movie yeah this has nothing to do with that totally yeah but let's let's get into your drug addiction yeah he was like during your darkest times like what are you talking about man Iron Man's out I'm not here for that well it's just like he ends it too they're so selfish oh yeah that thing is so doing the shit like that is so selfish there's such a sneaky little thing to do yeah what do they teach you that like in that moment of like Quentin they're just like don't don't get emotional well it's like don't take the bay and and more than anything for me because I look I'm from Wisconsin and I still have that kind of everybody's nice everybody has good intentions kind of I've you know so and I had this experience on my very first movie where I talked to this reporter because it was a movie about it was a road trip you know it's the only road trip comedy you know and it took this reporter and he says and he was just being he was being really cool we were just kind of hanging out after this thing talking and he's like so and gas prices were really high and he goes so yeah you know he's like you feel weird about making a roadtrip movie when gas prices are so high and I and I said like yeah I don't know I you know maybe if the movie tanks I can just blame it on that no one could afford to go to the theater because the prices were so high and I don't think and then this article comes out that just the guy literally said I was swarthy looking and it just he just painted me like an absolute piece of shit Wow and I was like that guy was so cool like he was so nice and then he destroyed me I've been there yeah I'm sure you guys yeah I thought new to me I remember one too that like who did it to me like when I was just doing phone like a phone interview for press before I was selling any tickets and the guy was like just like a really nice guy and totally twisted things and and made it seem like just like he knows what I was saying and he purposely twisted things around and then it had real no no impact but I remember reading that being like oh fuck this guy and and be careful when you talk to these people because he totally he knows what I was trying to say and I read this article it's like he misrepresented everything yeah well that's the only way they can have fun yeah and that's the only I mean if you're just a normal guy and you give you know normal answers and you're thoughtful and considerate that that sounds good for them right it's boring dude yeah so twisted around well it's not just it's not as profitable right it's more profitable especially if it's an online thing with an online thing you need a clickbait title you need a bunch of people clicking on that thing because otherwise you're not gonna get in the end revenue for it yes it's a very bizarre model where it's encouraging people to be deceptive and to make these things inflammatory and I gotta say I mean look I did like I said I did 90-95 interviews in the souq in the course of two days and virtually everybody was really cool really asking really thoughtful interesting questions so I don't want to make it sound like I'm ripping on the whole press over this but yeah there are these people and that's the thing is that if it was every single person that came along it would almost be easier because you could just kind of be like okay here we go right but you but you get like 30 really good you know reporters with integrity and good people and then somebody jumps in and and you're like oh and then then they catch you not looking because you're not looking for that guy they also get super jaded ya know it's almost like cops that have arrested too many people everyone's a crook like they just think that everybody they're interviewing is piece of shit and it's also like they're interviewing these Hollywood people they're thinking of you you had a big mansion driving a Mercedes all this money fuck this guy it's like this instant take on it Oh Hollywood director yeah great how's your casting couch yeah shit yeah true and it becomes the game I think too for them the game is like let's see if I can get one and we should be real clear this is not most people most people are nice yeah but it's just like one even if it's only one out of ten you run into that one you like fuck these things I don't want those things anymore no it's terrifying because you think about your family your friends like anybody who's gonna because now they're there is this in I don't know I know you guys talk about this a lot there is this culture out there where people are completely reduced to like one moment or one statement or whatever it is and that's all you are is that you know ever that thing that had that happened in that one moment and and you know you see it happening to people all the time and you think about so so when you're there and you feel like you're just a regular guy you don't feel like you know that it's really scary because you think about your kids and you think you know it's so it's a it's a scary situation yeah yeah well it's a weird time for these publications two minutes nothing taking consideration no one's really buying magazines and newspapers yeah like they used to it's hard to sell and so they're reduced to these online publications and they have to compete with a bunch of these click baby bullshit things and that's where the money is I mean even in New York times man the new york times is resulting to a lot of click baby shit now and you're like wow well do you guys have that feeling like when you're online that you're on like a click baked diet where you see things where you're like mom and i totally want to eat that right now I'm not I'm not going to do that get it now yeah you read that title and you're like I know this will have no substance yes well just the headline I'm fascinated to see where this goes because this didn't exist right these online click baby things didn't exist 20 years ago and now they're everywhere yeah it's like what what's gonna happen in 10 years like where is it gonna be like where is this going yeah I'm very fascinated you know very very fascinated to see it feels like a transitional time it doesn't feel like it can hold out like this forever that's true yeah yeah I agree because it hurts I mean and this is this is the reason why I think podcast culture is coming on strong because it's a place where people just talk and have a conversation and I think that fear of slipping up and people always like out there trying to get you to slip up or whatever has people not having as much of a free exchange of ideas yeah but through these podcasts one thing that does happen is people will take a very small clip out of context right and then write a whole article about that small clip with a big click Beatty headline like Tom Segura shit's all over people in Somalia and then you know whatever it is and you do that no I mean that yeah it was a different city I just but then you know it could be completely out of context yeah and over you know a giant overall discussion of a top of a topic that took place over 45 minutes and they'll take 30 seconds of that and put a youtube clip up and then you get a bunch of angry people just true that's true but the other the flip side of it is that I feel like in this time we're developing more of an audience that is quick to call that shit out mm-hmm so like well there are gonna be people that take the bait and be like what is it and get angry there's a bunch of people who are like really quick to recognize that that's taken out of context well it's because people like you and I and a lot of other people that do part talk about that right all the time right so people hear it all the time they see the examples of it and go wow that's crazy yeah some some of it is so egregious yeah you're a piece of shit like someone should pull your license yeah like if you were a doctor they'd fully pull your fuckin license right as a journalist you just like a lot of wiggle room with being a piece of shit yeah yeah yeah this is our journalists air quotes these the podcasts this this medium is just gonna grow and people are embracing more this long-form conversation well you know and understanding things by talking about it for a while well and the other part of it that I think Pete that gets lost sometimes is that you know like right now we're talking about like journalists but the great journalists are just as hurt by this this stuff yes as everyone because the people that are really out there being thoughtful really researching their material really talking to people getting to the bottom of things that whole journalistic work ethic that we all grew up hearing about yeah those people are just as threatened by this cheap the sort of attack journalism that happens because they can't even compete with it with a with a really thoughtful well researched story yeah and then somebody's like he touched a boob and then there's like they get all the clicks you know I was talking to Matt Taibbi who's a real journalist and Matt Taibbi was discussing the pieces that he wrote on Wall Street and the the crash of 2008 and all of the fucking shenanigans that went on with that and how much just crazy shit they're allowed to do and what they can't even what a Ponzi scheme a lot of that 2008 crash was and you when I was talking to him I realize like he had put a year into research yeah i learning like he did not come from a background in finance so he put a year into researching all the aspects of the savings and loan crisis all the aspects of the the this mortgage crisis and and how it took place and how they were how they were making money off of this and how they were you know betting on things falling apart and moving money around and how fucking chaotic it is and how crazy it is and then you think of how much time put on that and then in proportion few people actually read that and how little it affected the the actual economy itself like how little things change and how little people were outraged like his article I don't of your read the Rolling Stone piece on it mm-hmm fucking amazing but you don't work on that for forever yeah yeah but you don't care that much about it right you know I mean it's like those people never went to jail the billions of dollars just just disappeared it all got moved around and everybody abracadabra and they moved the Cape huh tada and then it moves on and you know and he details it in this amazing way and you realize like wow how many of those guys are left how many of those real journalists are left right and this is a I mean it you have to invest in something like that I mean he's putting a year into just researching what this is all about yeah it's fucking insane I mean and then instead you know it's like Kim Kardashian got her butt done again boom boom 50 times more people are paying attention to that well let me ask you this because I think in a weird way this weird time that we're in right now could actually be the rebirth of that kind of journalism that you're talking about because I know that that when when everything was getting kind of crazy and people were you know we were talking about all this I did subscribe to some you know like the online version of some papers cuz I thought hey I do want to support or you know that are actually you know people with integrity that are out there chasing stories and informing the world you know helping us out yeah also they fuck you over if you don't do it you can't can't read it like 10 new york times yeah good for you though you know I mean it's kind of half - I wish it was a little easier to do though they set it up with Apple one-click or some shit yeah I think it is now yeah it's kind of a pain I don't get that why I subscribe to a few of them and if I go to the app obviously everything's fine but if I try to read it through another link it's like are you all ready I'm like but I'm a subscribe it's kind of annoying yeah yeah cuz then you gotta jump into the app and then find the story again it's enough which is it but I get it I mean they have to figure out some way to generate a revenue there and this whole these last two years have been huge for the subscriptions on those I mean like grown by millions you know as as print paper has gone down those online subscriptions have gone way way up really oh yeah yeah yeah that's what they're profitable definitely definitely I mean I just saw that whoever the editor-in-chief of New York Times doing an art an interview about like their recent subscription model it was impressive I mean really went high well if you do good work and you I mean there's people out there that I have a hunger for actual real journalism yeah and also in-depth intelligent comprehensive understandings of what is happening yeah a real real well researched take not a particular situation when somebody does it like that guy did about like the subprime Morgan like you know and they spent all that time and they write that story I mean it's like reading like a good book yeah just can't stop reading I mean did you read that dirty Jon story and in the LA Times what is that man and now they're making a had like a mini series coming out about it I remember reading it and not being able to stop reading it and it was like an 8 part series in the LA Times about this guy who was a sociopath who would go on to dating sites and basically bait beau who were like divorcees who had some money he was posturing as a doctor and like would pretend to have this really successful life and just be a pariah that would like suck on to these people and this story went really deep about how this guy found this woman her daughters were like grown daughters immediately suspected things were wrong she didn't see it but the story unravels the way like a good book or like a thriller would you know would unravel in in the theatre so you're just like like the guy you know he researched it I forget his name they turned it into a pie caste and then now it's coming out as a like a short series that's the guy that's the guy that's the real guy Wow Christopher gah furred and man so it would be like part one in this series you'd read this and you're like alright worst part like you're like scrambling to read the next that's freaking me out because he's moving like his image is moving slowly oh yeah slowly pull that's a real guy it's a fascinating read Wow and I recommend reading it man I mean it is really good so was this guy a career criminal criminal he was a career criminal that hit it well but you know it's interesting that I remember reading it and and you're kind of fascinated how the daughters know like they just know they're gonna keep going back and like this doesn't add up but she's kind of lost in the love and attention and excitement right this relationship and he's just praying he is preying on her any empties her account I don't want to give it away man it's so good oh it's so good yeah is it it's you can get it right now you just they do you have a subscription or did you like it's a podcast a bunch of articles about how big it got released and podcast in LA Times there's all sorts of stories about it yeah well there's still I mean for all the people that are into just short attention span clickbait nonsense there's still and there's some sort of a market for for real actual real stories yeah I would say that that's what most of it is out there it's just that we get to so much of I mean there's there's such a stockpile of that stuff every day but when it comes to the actual stories that you're reading I don't know maybe I'm Pollyanna about it but I feel like there's there's a lot of great stuff out there I think there's there's plenty of great stuff can you think about the actual amount of content versus how much time you actually have to read there is great stuff but if you looked at the overwhelming appetite that people have for media it's for nonsense yeah yeah like I was watching the Wendy Williams Show yeah I never watched that show before Jesus Christ I watch that show first of all there was a girl in the audience that had a crown on it was hilarious the audience alone like he they should have one wish he married her Tom and I were a restaurant last night and a lady had just gotten married to herself feels we were both we found out but it's what's going all over them and some was like she's marrying herself this is their ceremony right okay never see guys doing that yeah my oldest daughter went over and hugged her and grabbed my oldest daughters the sweetest person in the world yeah yeah she was like she's so sweet that the lady who married herself was like your daughter's very sweet but I marry you too yeah let's marry everybody yeah but what we were just talking about but I use a window Williams oh my goodness oh is that when she fell down yeah she had she had a moment in the show how do you still down have you seen what I saw when Aretha died that Aretha had done an interview with Wendy Williams one time and it was fucking hilarious because Reetha Franklin was SAS and her a bunch like like an OG sassy it was really really funny man I hope you've seen it but she's just like like Wendy's like I have an idea for this project whatever in Aretha was like hmm and she was like so you want to go in on it and Aretha is like you're gonna write a check and she's like I was thinking you could she's like oh you ain't got it huh you ain't got the money that's what I thought she just turns around on her it's so funny it's hilarious read the Franklin just so just owns it you know she's been around she was like you're not having it at all well all the show is is Wendy Williams talking shit about people and all the girls in the audience they're talking about people getting custody and all she breaking up with her and it's like wow that's what there's a lot of people out there that have an appetite for that for sure I mean how long me obviously I fuck that they're long Jerry Springer stayed on yeah right look yeah that was a fucking 30-plus year run or something you know what's fucked up about that Jerry Springer is a smart guy yeah he's a smart guy I used to listen to him on the Opie and Anthony show I was like whoa wait a minute he was the mayor mayor since a gut-busting for a prostitute with a check so we all slip up from time to time that's how you got caught yeah which is hilarious like like checking account right to it yeah Alexis who's Alexis yeah it's pretty crazy man yeah it's I don't know it's I think there's plenty what does that set him Wow Wow that's what he was the mayor young fella he's like 40 years old back then but it's just it's bizarre how prevalent that that stuff is online I mean it's just there's so much there's so much click baby nonsense it's hard but there's there's plenty good journalism just plenty good writing yeah well I mean again like I said when it when I was doing the my limited experience in doing this the vast vast vast majority of the people that I've been talking to have been really interested in just talking about adoption and really interested in foster care and all that kind of stuff and it's been great it's been great talking talking to everybody and I think that when you have a topic like that too it helps because they're not really trying to crush you as much yeah right you know when you're talking to them about kids who need families and homes and that kind of thing right right right yeah yeah they have to be careful with letting their piece-of-shit claws out now you said that your experience with adopting three kids started out as a nightmare yeah how did it start out well it goes into it you know do you know you have friends that join the military and when they're in high school they think they're really tough and they're like yeah that's gonna be awesome and then they go to boot camp and they're like oh shit this is really hard and then they get on top of it and then there and then they're good again right but they have to go through that transition of like oh man maybe I'm not as tough as I thought right and then they get rough so you never had any kids I never had any kids hot dog got a dog thing did the dog thing you know take care of in a very small way friend who said that to me someone qualified a dog oh yeah talking about having a kid oh fucking kill you with a rock yeah and we know we we went from you know zero kids and you can't think well I babysat my sister's kids and that crap that that's that's the movie went to a whole movie yeah and even what happens is you go so so for us we we had a really interesting experience where we went to an adoption fair and that's that's in the movie it's a real thing where they because they you know their their budgets are stretched so tight that they'll have these outdoor events not every county has them but LA County has them where you where they'll bring a bunch of kids that are that are in the system and a bunch of prospective parents and they'll just have like games and stuff going on it's a really bizarre event and we went you know and you're there to meet kids you know to meet your kids and so we went there and we didn't want to have anything to do with teenagers because that you know just because we were scared we thought we're not ready for that we just want to find like some little cute little kid you know and and then the teenagers are all off to the side because everybody's afraid of them and it's the most heartbreaking thing you've ever seen because they know why they're there like they chose to be there and they know that everybody's scared of them so I was there and I was like oh my god this is the worst thing I've ever seen and we ended up sort of inadvertently meeting this teenage girl and her brother and sister and just they just seemed cool and they just seemed like really good kids and just scared scared scared but we wrote him down on our sheet and just again not what we yeah what we had planned out when we did this but we wrote him down on our sheet we went home knowing they were gonna match us with them because no one else was gonna put him down and we we get home and we find out yes you've been matched with these kids and we're like okay here we go we're gonna have you know we're gonna have a towel they were 16 13 and 11 mmm yeah so so we were you know kind of wrapping our heads around there the next couple weeks and we got to a place where we were like okay you know we can do this and then we got a call from the social worker and she said you know it's not gonna work out with them the they've been in the system for four years the girl she's really holding out hope that her mom is coming for so she's refusing the placement and so we tried to and and I was like I always you know when you hear that it's so just the same reaction you guys just had so my wife and I wrote a letter to send through the the social workers just saying hey look we get it if you maybe you guys just want to come and just do the foster thing or you know however you want to do it and we we just sort of sent the letter off we didn't hear anything and then she came back and she just said yeah it's not gonna happen and then she very matter-of-factly just said but there's these other three kids and those kids are my kids now who I love more than anything in the world really and that's that's how the next are these other three kids like oh all right and you you want there to be or I should say I mean I wanted there to be a certain amount of randomness like when you have you know biological kids you don't know you're gonna get yeah and go into that that event where you're sort of like meeting kids and it it feels weird and so when she said there's these other three kids we said okay and then they turned out to be younger you know six three and 18 months but I never forgot meeting that that girl and her brother and sisters so when the time came that we were gonna make a movie about it I really that was the genesis of the Lizzie character right I wanted to make sure there was a teenager in this movie because they're so misunderstood and in the process I went out and met with a bunch of families that had adopted teen girls and then met with a lot of those girls who some of whom are grown up and some of whom are still you know with their families and and this is the thing you know this the scariness that we're all talking about every one of these families that I met with just great stories like amazing great stories like hard times you know try it trying to make that connection and whatever but but everybody with the same story wouldn't have it any other way changed our life for the better met these incredible kids and this is yeah and now I'm yammering but how old are they now how many years have you had them almost seven years so my son Johnny just turned 13 Wow my daughter's nine and my other son is eight and how long was it between the phone calls like I had these other three kids and you actually getting them in your house what was it it was it was a couple of weeks because there were weeks that's it yeah no it wasn't long at all whoa but yeah it was because they called me said we have these other three kids and then and then there was going to be a meeting because they they they won't tell you much about the kids until until they really sit down with you and then they kind of walk through like here's you know whatever trauma here's whatever you know kind of so and again they did for in our case they don't have all the information obviously on their past right I can kind of tell you like here's how they came in what they know and that kind of thing so I wasn't able to go because I was I was I was at a work thing and so my wife went to the meeting and I was like listening to it you know and that was on speakerphone in the meeting and and there was this one moment you know and she's telling us everything and there's this one moment where she slides the picture across to my wife this is here's a picture of them and there's this long pause my wife goes oh they're cute but they didn't sound cute by the inflection [Laughter] you know you don't want to be shallow about it I mean your kids are kids and you know you're gonna fall in love with them regardless but you know like you can't everybody wants to think their own kids are cute whatever so it was funny and then when I saw the picture the picture was it was just a weird bad picture of the kids like my son who was six at the time looked like he was 11 and he looked like this it was just the look on his face or whatever hard yeah it's hard and loose and and we go over to the house and these kids are adorable so this is sorry I'm getting ahead of myself so so when he so we have the meeting and we go okay we're gonna go meet with them and just to be clear we didn't say okay because the picture cuz the picture was kind of like neither here nor there you know we were like alright let's go meet these kids so we go to the house and these kids are adorable and and it's the weirdest thing ever because you go to this foster home where they live and you play with them for like two hours and when do you ever play with any kids for two straight hours like actually actively play with kids especially kids you've never met before sure so it's exhausting yeah it's weird and and we touch on this in the movie that I was really scared when we were getting there cuz I wanted so much to walk in see these kids well up with tears no it's for real no these are my kids and just have that like cosmic connection moment and that didn't happen at all like it's more weird right so are you I'm gonna live with you yeah and well the little kids are just kind of like this is no it's actually weird in the other direction they're so used to kind of being passed around that they're just kind of like oh okay who are these all right you know and so we get in there and then the the foster mom in our case was like go to your mom and dad and I was like oh whoa you know cuz just felt so obtrusive to the kids you know yeah yeah and so we we would go there every day for five straight days we would go there when the kids were off school and we we'd go and play with them first in the backyard and then you take him to the park and then you take him to the park and you take him out for ice cream and you're just kind of like getting to know these kids that are strangers you try to change their names yeah first day soon as we walked and I was like a little one wouldn't even know though dude yeah that's true that is true that is true no memory you know a lot of people do in fact a lot of kids a lot of older kids that sort of have that will want to change their name not just their new fresh start yeah that they'll just want to you know really yeah yeah I I don't have any experience with that but I've heard that that sometimes I'll choose to there was a young lady that was at the screening last night who was who her picture is at the end of the movie she's like she's in Ireland getting her PhD right now this girl Wow adopted out of foster care and she's she's amazing yeah and and she she had chosen to change her name yeah I mean that seems like it would mean something yeah now that I think about it it just seems you know changing a name yeah especially as a teen but I mean I get it if you're saying like I want to put everything in the past yeah you want a fresh start really lock it down this is the new me I'm Kobe Bryant I used to be number eight for now yeah well and that touches on something that is really difficult when you're doing this as an adoptive parent is that you're trying to walk this line all the time where you you know you you need to claim these kids for your own you need to be the person who's like you're with us like we're we're with you we got your back we're behind you like you you you need to do that that's what these kids don't have right thing that we all take for granted right we have these parents that love us no matter what knucklehead things we do so you're trying to do that but at the same time you're trying not to impose your world on them because they're coming into it with their own you know personality in their own you know culture or whatever it is that behind them so you're always trying to kind of be careful and walk this line between just just completely bring them in but not trying to change them into who you are did the six-year-old already have things he was really into or sports or activity answer yeah he was well the funny thing is my son is really athletic and I'm really not so I know you guys are but I'm so Nami and me especially he's an animal but uh but no he's really athletic and he's just always been you know good with with all that stuff and it's funny for me because I wasn't that kid at all but it's great for me because I'm like he's able to do the stuff that I wanted it so badly when I was little I sucked at sports and I so when do we get at sports yeah and he's really good at it it makes me what does he play well he mean whatever he plays he just tends to be pretty good at it so he played flag football for a while and he's playing lacrosse now and he's played soccer keep him away from the cross and football we were just playing it with Brennan sharp the other day I had no idea how many people get knocked the fuck out playing lacrosse lacrosse oh my god Island man Island we were saying like there's a difference between this even in football in that they're striking each you're allowed to allowed to hit each other with the stick but they're also striking each other with elbows they're running in and they have the stick in their hand and they're elbowing each other in the face as they're running coming oh shit it's a crazy amount of force yeah they generate oh yeah these kids are getting flatlined that's because I had a Dale Earnhardt jr. here today on really nice guy great guy suffered twelve concussions over a period of four years racing yes and has like some significant brain damage because of it that he had to go through therapy for to help him like to the point where he was walking and he had to hold on to things cuz his balance is so fucked up couldn't couldn't just walk couldn't get off the couch and walk to the bathroom he had to hold on to like a table and a chair and hit a make his way through all of this from concussions and you know what they're getting in the cross or they're getting in football it's all the same shit yeah head trauma it's head trauma yeah so I'm a terrible parent my kids go to a very nice school it's a great school and we went to a football game the other day where the older kids are playing football and I'm just sitting there all the other parents are having a good time and I'm like brain damage brain damage there's some brain damage yeah there's some brain I'm like jesus fucking christ he's our kids they're kids running at each of the full clip smashing him eternal fall to the ground they see the kid get up slow and put his hands on the ground he's all fucked up I'm like this is crazy look how's about letting people I always felt like lacrosse was my high school head lacrosse too and I always felt like it was way crazier once cuz I didn't know about it and then I'm at the school and they have it I'm like this shit is yeah and they're just oh yeah of course yes if you're a football player you can come some Herschel Walker type character and become a youth baller yeah that's true but you have no shot if you're a lacrosse player I love when they interview like all the guys the NFL they're like the young guys to like you know all this evidence is that your lifespan is gonna be way shorter and it's gonna be probably horrific at some point because of the impact of what you're going through playing football you know what did you think about that they're like shit's worth it man this is awesome lifestyle you're getting some guys you see retire early which was unheard of ten years ago right guys one guy came out played his rookie here and retired you know you're getting guys early retirement some guys play finish out a contract they're up for a big contract and they're out yeah that's happening but they're still you know there's no shortage of guys who are like I'll take the guarantee whatever my signing bonus is and take some brain day look that's how our brains work our brains are designed to not have that kind of foresight do you get much oh of course you liked young satisfy me now yeah you and I don't know what that is but you can tell people hey whatever it is you're doing right now this is really gonna cause you a reparable huh yeah when like today no well fuck it you know well that's the same way we deal with climate change yeah literally the same thing we're driving the room with cars blowing smoke I like yeah one day yeah it's gonna be a real proud like you tell us must be a real problem here on earth in like 300 years and they're like I won't be here bro or even 40 years yes sadly yeah there's also the issues people that get a lot of head trauma they get very impulsive and they they don't make good decisions anyway you know so even if you know even if they could have the foresight they probably make good decisions they don't they're not thinking rationally and they did some study what was that study Jamie we've referenced this before where they they looked at kids that play football literally from Pop Warner all the way through college and how many of them have CTE really oh Jesus Christ it's stunning see I always felt like my point of view on it was always like I play football fourth grade through high school right and I always just like man that's why you so fucked up I know I know it's fun but I just feel like you know the IMP like you have definitely some big in an amateur career you have some you can think back like man I got my bell rung a bell rung I don't know I mean problem I mean here's the thing in fourth grade and fifth grade you're like that doesn't happen really I mean kids are like you know walking up and like wrapping up slowly that you're playing with kids who will eventually not play football even in sixth grade right now so it starts to be you you might have like a stud on a team in middle school and still a bunch of guys who won't play in high school yeah and then in high school yeah there's definitely some athletes that stand out for sure I mean those are the kids that will eventually go on but you play teams or in those weeks you're just like no one is really good on this team you know mm-hmm and you'll have a game where you'll feel like yeah I mean there's a couple I got a couple good hits and there was nothing really of impact and then something will stand out like you'll play a school that has like an all-state or all-american player you're like holy shit that guy fucking fuck me up bad and and you remember it I mean I remember it to this day some of those like really stand out guys and you're like that hit stuck with me but that's once a year that you play that guy right or that you remember a school that good and then if you don't go on to playing college really feels like kind of a a risk assessment where you're like I didn't feel like that was you know do I have damage I don't know but I mean once you get into college football is where I feel like that's where you're really playing with really good athletes a friend of mine a guy in his neighborhood a kid was 21 committed suicide and he was a college player who was about to going to pull into the pros he was 21 years old really yeah and the significant CTE like just really ravaged every year a player played tackle football under the age predicted the early onset of cognitive problems by two point four years in behavioral and mood problems by 2.5 years yeah but there's a study wow this is okay average study found that 211 players who diagnosed with CTE after death who played tackle football before age 12 suffered from cognitive behavioral and mood symptoms earlier than those players who didn't start to play until after age 12 well they're saying that okay study included 246 former players 211 of whom were diagnosed with CTE after death that's insane well in college there's there's definitely there's no such thing as getting around real high impact hits that's it those are all people that know how to play they're all athletes you're saying rock what they're realizing now is that sub concussive trauma is what's responsible for the majority of brain damage what's sub concussive you not getting a concussion oh yeah you just getting rattled yeah getting rattled where it's not even fucking you up but overtime overtime that you have multiple hits that are just not they're not knocking you out there just jostling you you can always happen a lot yeah you even get it from getting hit to the body right you get hit to the body your head snaps back and you don't even get hit in the head and you're like throwing up and your heads all fucked up and you trying to figure out what's going on it's because your brains been moshing around inside your head yeah the thing that I remember - the thing that stands out is when you because such thing is like bracing for a hit and then feeling in you're like fuck but when you don't see someone coming oh yeah oh yeah it's like a fight you don't see punch coming you oh yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's dangerous you guys are saving my child's life right I'm telling you right now he's because I don't know that much about lacrosse I had to actually like YouTube lacrosse to be like how Jimmy's the video because there's some videos of some fucking hits that we were watching the day and Brendan played lacrosse in college he played lacrosse in college and football Jesus and then he fought in the UFC yeah so his brain looks like a walnut it's gotta be there don't you talk to him do you kind of know yeah it's it's a crazy fucking sport watch these guys just over and over again these guys getting Kayode boom boom see that I mean they're smashing each other the impact is horrific oh look at that boom this these are strikes this is like me kicking somebody in the head this is this is not much different than a kick in the head you just bring them with the elbow but the amount of force so these guys are getting kicked in the head with these helmets on yeah and if you think the helmets protecting your head that shit ain't protecting anything boom look at that eye boom alright look I don't anything about this stuff but I've thought for a long time hard helmets gotta just make it worse right well it makes you more confident that you got slam your head into somebody and then you don't realize how bad you're getting fucked up from that you know it's your head when you get hit in the head even though you have a helmet on it so I'm gonna crack your all your brains he'll still sitting size on your skull you know you get serious punishment smashing around in there you're all the connective tissue it's like it's awful it's awful boom and this is coming from a guy who's probably seen I probably see more people get fucked up than 99.9% of the people that have ever lived right in terms of like being there live when someone got the fuck beaten out of them yeah I probably see more people get the fuck beat not true then almost anyone that's ever lived in history yeah there's probably a small handful of people that have seen more sure see how many fights have been called hundreds thousands thousands at least more than a thousand probably 2,000 but then I've seen more I mean I've seen a bunch live and when I was competing I saw a bunch of people get fucked up I mean it's just I've seen a lot it's that when you can avoid that avoid it you know especially something like lacrosse you can't give me a career out of it like get out of there right because I actually just started because right now I'm used to like kids soccer where they just run it's cute chasing the ball it's cute fun it's great fun to watch and and yeah my son just got into lacrosse and we play catch with the lacrosse stick and it's great we have a good time playing catch with it but no I haven't seen him good about tennis man soccer even soccer which you think you know who's getting hurt in soccer soccer from heading the ball just heading the ball the ball flying out you hit it with your head soccer players are suffering from CTE to the point where they're starting to minimize the amount of heading they do in practices really yes this is what we're finding out about brains like this is you know there's a good friend of mine dr. mark Gordon who specializes in CTE he deals with a lot of soldiers coming back and a lot of them that are like my friend Andrew Marr where they would blow open doors so they had set up a charge on a door and step back and boom the door blow these guys I mean he didn't even get hit with anything or maybe IEDs like they're nearby those guys suffer significant brain damage and it's just from the impact of just getting shook by an explosion not even anything actually hitting them in the head which high school sport is the most concussions is it soccer girls soccer girls soccer cheerleading head rates scenic boys football by 2015 wow I know when you stop and you look at those uh like when they're going to commercial on the college game yeah and they throw that grow up in the air and you're like man to get that right I thought documentary but it's one of the most dangerous sports sure well this is high school cheerleading these girls fall on a gym floor I just the floor it's crazy this is this is a breakdancing Instagram page called stance elements Jamie pull-ups dance elements is a guy who looks like he's about 300 pounds and he break-dances he leaps forward and lands on the top of his head and keeps his feet up in the air I don't know how the fuck this guy did this this guy's bigger than Burt really yeah maybe not as big bird yeah he's pretty big and he leaps forward and he lands on his head no hands lands on his head was feet up there and holds the position for like a solid second it's preposterous and when you can do that trick you do it look at this guy whoa ya know the size of them watch this give me some vine that guy will need a disc replacement within the next month that is so much weight on your fucking head he's probably so dizzy and he's playing it off yeah no shit bro look at that oh I gotta tell you you guys are making me feel so good about my mostly sedentary lifestyle that I've led my whole life okay don't hit your head this is coming from somebody who watches people get their head hit for a living I feel really good now usually I feel more shamed for the way that I've been conducting myself it's just when you can avoid it I mean look it's not a bad way to make a living if you want to be a fighter and you really want to do it and you that's your drive that's you should do it but you should really learn how to defend yourself correctly and learn the right technique but when you're doing it for recreation and you're doing something like lacrosse where you're running out each other full clip and smashing into each other and that's within the rules like I think we're operating on ancient information that's what I think I think most of these systems that they're setting up most of these these sports rules and a lot of the organizations they're all operating on these old ideas of brain damage that's why I'm freaking out when I'm going to this school football game and I'm watch this I'm like like this is just brain damage I'm watching brain damage and then watching it that's promoted by a school and school pride yeah everybody go yeah yeah yeah we're playing another team let's hope we beat them how are you gonna beat him you're gonna fucking slam into them yeah give them concussions and you go to school and they can't count do you get blowback for talking about that stuff or from fans and that kind of thing no no it's true yeah I really I mean I'm sure there must be some blow but yeah I don't read it anyway but it's gotta be true yeah I mean it's there's just too much evidence I just think you choose wisely just choose they don't not take risks I mean if you really want to be a BMX rider or a professional skateboarder you're gonna take some knocks yeah it's just part of the part of the program just don't don't do it if you don't have to yeah because it it piles up and there's no coming back you know when you when you go you have like significant brain damage I mean you can get therapy that can help you it can but you're you're gonna you're gonna dis a road you're goin down yeah it's your brain I know they see this I mean HBO's actually tapped into it a lot with that real sports gym for years now that you just follow up pieces on CTE and men it it is devastating to see some of those guys those guys are like their 50s you know 60s and they're not there at all dude I put a video up on Instagram or on Twitter i retweeted it and it's boxers where it shows the boxers when they're young and they're talking and then it shows them like at the end of their career yeah they're retiring and then they interview them and you see them like just completely gone like a shell guys it's not an interview with riddick bowe really bad oh it's awful and I remember even this one was actually kind of funny was James Toney because he was he was it was towards the end of his fighting and he was definitely at least 40 pounds overweight right like really out of shape but still throwing bombs right he was sparring and it was like that piece that they air right before the fighters go to the ring for the on fight night mm-hmm and he's definitely taking some shots and giving some shots but he was sparring and they were throwing in fresh bodies for him to spar against so it was like you know two minutes with this guy and then boom fresh body and as he's like he is like really hyperventilating sweating spitting he's still talking shit like he's fighting he's like and just and then they bring in the next like your mom he's a mess he looks like a total mess but he's just like talking shit calling guys bagging shit like as he's barely making it through these these sparring sessions and you know I mean he would he'd need big guys he had to fight you know yeah he had to fight well especially towards the end of his he took a fight in UFC he did yeah yeah he's the only like real world champion boxer that ever fought in mixed martial arts in the UFC Randy Couture ankle picked him took him down strangled them right away yeah it was easy yeah I mean this just you know he I don't think he really bothered learning right lights out Tony I think he just put the gloves on and got in there and just had no idea what to do when Randy got ahold of him he was clearly untrained when it came to this low ankle low single I mean this is the beginning of the fight Randy just immediately mounts some punches him in the head a bunch of times and then strangles him and you know Randy was just honestly being nice really yeah he could have punished him a lot longer if he wanted to he just wanted to finish him up it was sad because it was just it you know he was talking about all these guys just don't know how to handle his hands and every fight starts standing up and which is true but Randy Couture will take you down all day anytime he wants and they got him in an arm triangle I'm just smooshed him I mean even when he's punching him he's not even hitting the amount of art here he's just trying to force him to give something up he like that's what he wants he wants his head tied down against the side of his arm then he's gonna squish him that's gonna tap that's it it's wrapped up I was pretty quick I was pretty fast and James Tony's one of the best that ever did it yeah phenomenal boxer yeah but and talked a lot of shit you raised a talker shit yeah so I don't want to discourage you but no no no this is good show your son somebody's videos we're out the backyard playing catch it's just like a slice of America they're thinking about this people operate not totally aware of consequences and they make choices that will affect them for the rest of their lives yes that's what I mean I love my mean I you guys are kind of like I'm having that feeling right now because I love my kids so much I stay at basketball he does yeah a sketball is a great sport yeah there's no no contact and guaranteed contracts man yeah the best how tall Z that's all yeah okay what about baseball it's another one baseball baseball as long as you only hit a bit of pitch you'd hit with a pitch yeah that's something that that's the lifestyle man you know I don't know if I'm allowed to do this here but while we're here I really wanted to talk about how Tom got into this movie oh we talked about that yeah what do you mean allowed I mean allowed to just like totally like like you know jump jump tracks like that and so I I saw his stand up and I thought I thought it was really funny and we had already written a draft of the script and I was like oh man this guy would be a great Russ and I didn't really think too much about it cuz we were making another movie at the time and then when it came back around we were talking about you know just you know talking about different people that you're gonna cast you these boards up and so your picture was actually on a board for a while wow I don't think you even knew that I didn't know the hexer was on a board I did not know that and so then so tell it from from your angle when you got the call though because I'll tell you this so I don't know if you don't you know if you know this that I passed on the audition I do when they you know for people like when you're if you're a star you get calls that like you have an offer right like you want this off you want to do this movie but if you're just like working trying to get booked you get these emails usually it's an email followed by a call that says like for your consideration movies called it's the family Shawn and there's John Morris wrote it it's a you know the part is Russ and it has like all that you know Mark Wahlberg's agreed to play this and Rose Byrne is attached to play this and then they here's the sides and it was like one of those things where it'll say you know so Thursday at 11:15 a.m. you are confirmed for the audition and I get that email like on Monday and I was like I just got back from the road cuz I got a podcast today I was like whatever and then I just don't even read any of it so then it's like you know Tuesday and then something happens and we're busy at the house and then went and then they go hey were just following up that you're good for the audition tomorrow I get that like on Wednesday you know just confirming that you'll be there and I were like nah like that's a pass like I'm not gonna be there and that was it I just sent that off like I'm just not doing that this week and then I get a call right away and it's my agent he's like hey I noticed I'm trying to make money oh yeah I noticed that you're not going to you said no is there a reason did the what did they say they there's always that phrase did you respond to this yeah did you not respond to the material and I go oh I haven't even read it well why aren't you reading it I was like because and I just kind of lay out my week I'm like I've had this I've had this with my kid I traveled I'm doing this pie just got a lot going on and they're like he's like okay I go so like it's not person I think like he's taking it personal you know I'm like I go I'm not saying no to upset you I just have these things he's like okay well the director specifically requested that you audition and like as you know that doesn't happen a lot with you so like do you want to reconsider and I was like yeah hold on I go he asked me he's asking for me to that idea and I go no way did you believe him or did you think he's a manipulating you I did I did believe him because I mean he's never said that and you know a lot of times I've done things for like the producers are in the room on this session or that stuff and I go okay well here's the deal man I'm not gonna go in unprepared so cuz now it's like the auditions in 24 hours so I go I'll do it but you have to buy me a couple more days because I'm like I'm I have this the rest of today like I'm not gonna do it tomorrow morning yeah and he was like okay I'll see what I can do and then he coming back he's like they said they're good for Monday or whatever and I was like great so and then I then I tried to prepare for that like you know because they told me the director because I was like I can't go into this thing half-assed so then I'm like really trying to prepare for that and then I go in there and it was you you're on sky well okay so here's what happened from my an because you didn't show up so I had to go back to Atlanta and so then we had to do the audition via Skype see I didn't know that's brutal for everybody else because you didn't show up but who organized it huh what kind of nonsense agency are you with that they booked you something and don't tell you that they booked well they always they do that where those booked it no they'll they'll set up at a time right like it's very common well they'll go 11 11 a.m. is your agency yes now they must have nothing to do with your podcast then nothing that's the problem right yeah so they don't know what you're booking so they'll just think that that takes precedence they also will be like hey you have an audition Friday and I'm like when I'm in Philadelphia like you're in Philadelphia your stand-up as well yes oh Christ is there any way you could move that they really fucking say that oh yeah holy shit an agent I mean call these 5,000 people that are waiting yeah I had an agent I had an agent go like why don't you just um oh it was about like booking something a booking and I was like when does it shoot though like if I booked this when does it shoot and it was like this you know October 3rd whatever I'm like oh but I'm in Sacramento he's like just move that and I was like yeah but it's to theater shows it's like five thousand people and he was like oh really I'm like yeah like you think I just gonna yeah just move it aside and he's like I'm like why don't you know that my calendars public yeah just look it up but yeah they'll give you answers like that so she quit acting hey you should make this movie sure this movie's gonna be awesome make it your swan song bro a lot of people are saying it's the breakout performance of the year I don't know if you crackle if they do whatever they do well so I so I'm in I'm in Atlanta Atlanta thank you and I and we he auditions via Skype and when I saw his stand-up I was like this guy's perfect because we want this guy to just have this kind of swagger and this confidence but he can kind of say these jackassy things but just sort of own them and I'm like this this guy's perfect for this I keep saying this guy cuz I didn't know him and so Tom comes in and I watch the Skype audition now I'm gonna shit-talk you okay here okay and and he was not good he was so not like like who he is like he came in and he kind of was like sort of putting his back into it a little bit like he was kind of like really just trying to be kind of like really sort of extra funny and it was just not at all what I had in mind I just was like so I so I'm watching it's - I'm just so I'm trying to give you know some how do you feel about this that you weren't good I have I had no idea what what whether here's the thing every audition this is actually fascinating if you audition because you literally leave auditions and you go sometimes you go that was great and you'll never hear anything again sometimes you go I bombed and you get a call hey guess what they want to see you again or you don't know no idea you have no idea I mean you don't really know what they want when you're going in yeah I did not know that it sucked that bad I didn't know that it didn't know it wasn't it suck that bad it might have been no no it wasn't ah no it was just that you you have this very specific thing yeah you do that I wanted to bring in and be a part of this character yeah you left that out see I but I don't think what's that thing it's like he's got this he's got this in his delivery this kind of devil-may-care kind of like a deadpan but it's but it's it's it's like a big part of your persona is yes alright whatever you know yes I just said that okay and I wanted Russ to have that thing and when you came in to audition you left that thing out did I do you think I did that in the movie not at all no you were great in the movie no I'm saying I feel like I did the movie exactly how I auditioned no you didn't at all really no it was like night and day really night in my mind if you have somewhere to ask me I'd be like 100% no the second the second audition you did just like the movie really yeah because basically so then what happened is we got together and I thought and I was like god I don't want to meet him for the second audition I'd well yeah well we got to get exercise I called him cuz I really wanted him to be a movie and I called him and I said would you be willing to just like come over to my house and we can talk through it and work through it a little guys that's what Harvey Warren's teacher yes I made jokes about that I made jokes about that immediately to him on the phone I was like am I gonna give you a bath he was like all right but can I tell you I gotta go back this is more embarrassing I remember leaving that audition that now you're telling me this the first one and telling my agent like there's no way I could have done better [Music] I can't imagine dude this was I'm serious that it and this is the thing I understand that because you had energy and you were funny but you just didn't have that thing that I wanted so badly to be a part of this character and and so it was that was this one thing that was missing and then you came over and we talked about it yeah then you did it and then also we got the chance to because we didn't when he read it he's just reading dialogue that we wrote you know for anybody but then once you once you have somebody's voice in your head a little bit you can adjust it and make it a little more comfortable that's right so we made some adjustments to the dialogue and everything which made it more conducive to your just style of speaking that's your Hayden's yeah yeah that was fun and yeah it was and so then he comes back and he does it again and he crushed it and he was really funny and we sent that to the studio and they were like oh my god this guy's great it was on the podcast yeah I knew you didn't know I definitely didn't know that I definitely didn't know that it's actually like it's it's the thing though like it's that's the big bummer about in general auditioning is you walk out and you go sometimes you follow up with your agent you're like what so what's the feedback and they're like they look they always they always tell you they loved you yeah and you're like is there anything else and you don't know like was it good was it bad and you also don't know what they're looking for and I don't know I mean go into your place going over like what you know in detail more is also like I actually feel like I won a contest because you know you audition now I know i taked and then the directors like do you want to come work on it so that like possibly you can do it better and I was like sure man so I'm working with him on this thing and I don't know you we spent a lot of time working on it and then when I found out I booked the role then I go there and I feel like I it's a second part of a contest because I like he has all great actors in the movie like for all the parts I mean you know the stars but like margo martindale from the american or watch the americans know oh that shows you've seen her though she's amazing she's yeah she's alright that shows awesome that shows so good I mean it just ended but like if you ever want to go on a binge weekend now you have like six seasons I think to go through and she III became a big fan of hers on that and then Julie Hagerty you have like just all these great actors so every time yeah where she's been sorry yeah take Notaro we had like really good every time we're like shooting a scene with one of the with one of them I end up just washing them like I'm in the scene and I'm just like wow she's a really good actor yeah totally is I did a scene with Maura Tierney once when I was on Newsradio maura Tierney just wanna definitely one of the best actors I ever worked with but she was so good that she did the lot well you know we rehearsing doing all those thing she did the line in the scene and I didn't realize that it was the line from the scene I realized she was just talking I thought she was just talking because of hellas she's so natural yeah I was like that kind of creeped me out yeah I was like oh oh that's the line cuz otherwise people like Tom where are we gonna find a guy that's gonna fix that right it's so forth she had none of that cuz she was really an actor before she was we just said some of them don't like to be called actresses right yeah so it's like safer to say actor mmm-hmm but at comics like who the fuck uses comedian remember that that went away I didn't know that doesn't exist in him do you know about the Latin ex thing I didn't know that was like we didn't know about that what do you mean I was reading this article and yeah it's you know you know and latina are male and female gender specific right so and the word Latin also get gets it done as far as yeah I don't know yeah so it's supposed to be like that's how you latin ex you're supposed to say latina --xx because is this new it's it's not it's a couple years in the making and fuck off we'll see in Spanish the masculinized version of these words is considered gender-neutral but that obviously doesn't work for some of us like myself and so I think it's appropriate to assign masculinity as gender-neutral when it isn't so I'm latina --xx well it's interesting because my kids are Latin and this is another one of the things that we touch on to Nick's yeah there it is and we touch it oh sorry go ahead please when we touch on this a little not this pronunciation or you know but we touch on that a little bit in the movie of there is that feeling you know when when we went in to adopt our kids we were just open we were like look we're we're pretty general age-wise we didn't go in expecting three kids just you know we thought one and it sort of turned into that right but but you know you're open to it and you just and they ask you well what about ethnicity you know and you just go yeah you know whatever you know wherever the the need is you know whoever needs parents you know let us know and but then when when it happens and your kids in my in my case my kids turn out to be Latin then you have the you know you start to kind of think about like oh well you know is that is that okay is that kind of you know is that gonna look like the white Savior thing is that gonna look weird is that mean am i am i saying things right and whatever and what ends up happening is this really wonderful thing where your family becomes this melting pot where you know at first you because of the there's the the times that we live in right now it is it's a little scary jumping into that because I'm thinking about what you know but you're you know but you ultimately are just gonna think about who the kids are what their need is and how obviously wonderful they are and but you but all of those things come up and they're that's the kind of thing that wouldn't even be you know why would that the Latina thing have anything to do with my house well now it does yeah so I've got I've got all that you know all the time and I know I actually find it really interesting the Latina King no no not that it's specifically but just that that my family is now this little melting pot yeah that's cool and it's cool I reject Latinas completely well it is it is cool but it's also very strange that that is a and it would be a real point of concern like you would worry about you know how do I handle yeah this sure this culture without culture appropriation how do i how do i bring my kid and embrace the Latino or latina culture like what do i how do I handle that yeah yeah and how do I do without getting call the racist well and it gets back to what I was talking about before where you're trying to just put your kids needs first and just deal with them as children as individuals as human beings you know and but at the same time you're also you're with other parents and there's in the adoption community and really in every direction there's there's mixed-race families in the adoption community and and you're kind of learning from them and it's just I don't know it just it opens up a lot of conversations with your own kids and and just the movies you watch the the foods you eat sometimes and I don't I think it's great no it's great I think it's really you know the the language think for me it stands out more because my whole life I've said Latino like my mother's latina and it's just funny to me too yeah yeah yeah hilarious because tom has some great stories about people not thinking he speaks bash cousin you look at him you're like oh this fucking American guy yeah it looks like a regular American guy but he speaks perfect like I've been around him before when he asked people questions like oh I forgot you could do that yeah yeah it's like someone who you know they could do backflips you do that yeah it's true and they throw it throws people off yeah yeah because you look so American yeah and that you mean look like a guy I mean if you have a guy who loves football yeah like I'm it's the fucking American a regular American but he speaks perfect he rolls the other reason when you go even when I travel abroad and like to spanish-speaking countries even there even though spanish-speaking countries are also melting pots you know right different they still look at you like oh shit like you know yeah it's really throws people what the the most the craziest one wasn't even with me my sister who one of my sisters would also speak Spanish went to the Naval Academy's linguistics Center so in the Navy and she was in the Navy for a while and she learned Mandarin and it was really intense you know it's really intense and we went to a restaurant together and the the guy was one of those rest like at Benihana tight where they chop stuff up and the guy was what someone asked like where he's from and he said somewhere in China and she starts speaking Mandarin and he dropped the thing he was like like he saw a ghost she's spitting back to him and pretty fluent Mandarin Wow and he stops and he was like I've never seen this before he's like I've never seen a white person do this and we were like yeah pretty pretty well and then he turned us he goes I don't think you understand how hard it is to speak this language I was like I have a pretty good idea I can't do it and then they just watch it and he was just like he could even start cooking I think your sister to learn well she was in when you sign when you get in to like that Naval Institute program they have you going I think it was something like eight hours a day five or six days a week so it's really it's super into it's almost life's learning Mandarin yeah yeah and it overwhelms people people drop out almost like in a physical stress way you know people just can't look him like boot camp and I forget how long she was in and you know she didn't reach the level of super you know fluent like we're speaking English but she was able to communicate in Mandarin can she read it she was reading and right that's the thing is she was telling me one time about how many characters and you know it was just unbelievable and like there's sounds for expressions like I'm gonna screw up so I don't remember it but she was like you can do something like oh and that means like means an actual phrase you know like there's so many and that there's character that mean entire expressions as well that I was like this just our brains are so married to our alphabet and way of speaking that it's a real jump to to learn that you know it's just it really is fascinating when you travel and you listen to people speaking their native tongue and you realize how strangely different languages are across the entire planet yeah I mean just unbelievable and in the summer and you listen to people talk tie and everything thaw everything stretches its got like a stretch to it you know it's like a weird ha this it's a very odd language I'm like compare that to like German or Dutch yeah they're like these like the Germans got those hard sounding really hard yeah it's like this weird difference yeah and the Latin one the Latin root word like languages all do have a flowy singing sound nice to listen to yeah I'm at like listening I don't speak Portuguese I like listening to it yeah Brazilian Portuguese is amazing yeah sounds so cool and I listen we listen to French music sometimes at home just in the kitchen yeah yeah like cooking or something I don't know the hell are saying I like it that when I write I listen to Spanish music when I write because I have no idea what they're saying I do that too when you listen to music in a foreign language it doesn't it doesn't distract yeah yeah yeah it's like it sounds good it gives me a little something-something but I can still think about the exact things that I'm thinking about well I recently had this interesting experience I sent you one of them that you know the trailers for the movie get oh yeah the movie itself and the trailers get dubbed into all kinds of different languages so you have this dialogue that that I wrote you know or mean on road or whatever and you get to hear it in these different languages and I sent you the Spain Spanish yeah yeah it's different and I don't really I'm not gonna pretend that I understand that much what the difference between between it is but that's predominantly what you speak right no no it isn't no not mother what I speak predominantly is just like specifically South American and more specifically or Peruvian though okay all right great so but I mean I I did study I studied in Madrid for six months and once your your ears are trained into it you can listen to someone say a sentence and know that it's oh that's from Spain like that's and there's the Cuban version of it which is crazy yeah yeah version of the way they all the island dialects sound dramatically different you know like if you listen to somebody from Cuba Puerto Rico is it a comparison like English speakers from America versus English speakers from Ireland mm-hmm it is yeah and I would say you know I always think of Spain as like our Britain you know in a way like the the language property English is from England right that's that's where the language that is how you speak it Spanish and gusty a Castilian you know that comes from Spain they're speaking og Spanish and then it all kind of came over here and its influence and every country has different ways of saying things different obviously different slang all different curses all different expressions completely different even words like as simple as like to pick up you know go ahead pick something up you know you say that in Mexico or Argentina it literally means to fuck so yeah so if you're like you know cuticle haste our like you're trying you're saying like I want to fuck this water yeah my mom told me that she was in in Argentina like when her youth and traveled there and was with a bellhop and she was like go ahead mate I'm gonna let that which is like pick up that suitcase but he was like okay because she was basically in slang saying fuck my suitcase you know so it's just but like there's like and there's also like severity of words like whole day it is the word like there's so many ways to say fuck it of course in every language but head in Spain is like is saying fuck it's like going like oh fuck but like when you say it in Peru no my clothes it's a it's a softer it's not taken as severely so it's not it's not read the same way you're not saying you're saying a like you're complaining but you're like I don't it's like taken as like I'll don't mess with me wow you know so like even when I would say when I would go Spain like they're like damn you curse a lot I was like really and then they you know we went over that one and then like six months later they were like you actually do curse a lot all the time and I was like yeah that's probably right do you just stand up in Spanish when you I've done bits and stories were like I involve both English and Spanish but I haven't done theirs there's a show now here in LA that they're doing a thing yet even at the stores had it like once where some of the spanish-speaking comics here have done like the full show in Spanish here in LA yeah let's just go to Ramos a Felipe did it as far as a well what's the guy Torres didn't Joey do it I don't know if Joey did it Joey used to do Spanglish yeah in Miami he would do Cuban Spanish plus English and it was impossible to follow yeah it's like because the audiences were there's so many Cuban people in the audience and he would hit punch lines in Spanish and people would literally just throw chairs through windows just jump through the ceiling he would crush so so great I middled once in Miami and did you know you used every trick and to get through the sex it's such a chaotic Club because I wasn't saying it was totally insane yeah and I was doing stuff and talking to this lady I would you know I would hit a punch line in Spanish and then say something back to this guy's Spanish then go back to English do like your best bit and then something else in Spanish and it was so crazy for me at the time like I never experienced a 20-minute set like that that the guy the headliner after me did 35 minutes and split like he was just like a good night it was he was a white guy and like not once I got that flavor yeah because it was like it's the most I mean that that room that didn't hold that many people don't I had like three hundred I think less I think probably less maybe like 275 or something and it had like you know there were Haitians in there Colombians Cubans Puerto Ricans but I mean such a mix of people yeah and they if you start giving them a little bit flavor yeah and they let people in there that were like 18 to 18 people in with guns it was the Miami improv it was the the worst Club to work they're reopening in a new location good luck yeah too late I don't know I don't know that was a what was that that was Coconut Grove yeah and now they're opening a thing in Doral a thing Miami's just so crazy it's such an interesting place it's so different than any other place I did Miami right before I did my Netflix special and they were using those Yonder bags we had to put yourself on into yonder bag yes I couldn't use it while you were inside the this sure so you know what they did you could leave the room and use the yonder bag Yeah right so these the entire set it was the only place where the entire set people just kept coming and going they just kept leaving and coming back to happy bones there was so many people doing it like there might have been like dozens of people at any point in time walking around coming and going going outside to get to use their phone and then coming back in like it was chaos yeah the phone thing I don't know that there's a real good solution yet no I did the Yonder thing in New Orleans and that place wasn't too big but it was or it was still you could tell like you know it's inconvenient for them it's a it's a long thing to go through they but then you're like then you people coming and going in and out of the showroom because they want to use their phone it's a fucking nightmare but if they don't if they just sit there and just tune into the show it's great it's like ten percent better I think so too yeah but it's hard it's hard to impose that on people too I know it surprised when people don't know they're like I'm doing what with my phone yeah you're gonna put in a bag it's still gonna be on you and you can use it as long as you leave this room they're like I don't know man I need to check my phone every 18 seconds yeah yeah I don't let people know but there's some people that just want to film everything - that's a you know when you get on stage you see people just stand there while you're doing your set and they're holding a phone up yeah this is you're making this whole thing so much weirder yeah do you understand what yeah you're basically no like a TMC guy at the airport it's like they're watching a show like yes yeah get up in front of them like they're not even looking at and it was my first comedy - yeah I went to of all things a daddy-daughter dance with my daughter and it was the weirdest thing every guy was dancing with their little kids like this and I realized I realized though why they were doing it it wasn't about the moment I mean a little bit but it was more about that that if you have that phone out and you're looking at that screen and you're doing that it sort of keeps everything else out it makes you feel like you're having this little moment instead of having to be this awkward thing of like you're dancing in front of these other grown men yeah I think it's down honestly I think you just trying to capture these moments you know you're you're painfully aware that they're only gonna be six for a year yeah but not all night you know what I mean concern that that's the problem is that you wind up as a parent you wind up with all this video that you that you're never gonna watch because but you're thinking logically yeah yeah maybe people aren't they're just collecting video you know they're just collecting they're like hoarders well the thing that made me think of it though is that I was more comfortable when I had the phone on I was like oh yeah cuz I feel like I'm doing something like I'm not just dancing and I'm just you know doing I'm doing like a like a parental kind of thing I'm just documenting my cute kid but then when I put the phone away I felt a lot more exposed okay dance dude my it's the terrible and every guy there I had the same I had the same feeling I'm sure so but I was just like nope I'm not gonna do it I'm putting my phone away this is stupid and tell you what though man you go back and look at those videos like from when your kid was really little and it does freak you out like they're they're really valuable powerful videos yeah videos of your kids when they're really young their social there's a video of my daughter when she was she was wearing a diaper I think she's probably just a little over 1 and we're walking through the airport and I'm pulling a one of those little roller bags and she's she's behind it pushing it she liked to push it and her legs are like that tall yeah diaper but and she's pushing this thing and we tell her hey we're gonna go to a toy store and she's like and she puts her hands together and she pushes the bag again but it's like the most adorable I've watched that video hundred times easy yeah it's like that video will forever be stained in my brain yes well we're easy we've got these videos to there's an inch there's a really interesting thing we were starting to get there earlier in our conversation but there's an interesting thing that happens when you adopt kids particularly kids that are already walking and talking when they come into your life you go through this really chaotic adjustment period because nobody knows each other and it's very yeah it's just it's just so awkward for everybody involved and and there's there's there's so much to it but it's a really difficult time for everybody but then when you have that when you get on the other side of it and you're really falling in love with your kids and you can feel that they're falling in love with you and you're becoming this family we have this video we went on this trip back to Wisconsin where I'm from and when we were just things were really starting to come together before this trip and then when we went on the trip the kids like you're describing the kid pushing the suitcase like they have to stay a little tighter with you because you're in airports and you're in you're driving and you go into like a cabin and doing these things and by the time we got back we were a family like we knew my wife and I were like wow we're we're like a real family now if we love these kids so much and we can tell they love us and it's an amazing thing so we have videos from that trip and those videos like you're saying are just like gold you know there's it's so amazing to see this you remember that bonding yeah that's a gotta be such an intense feeling to to realize that these kids could have gone in some terrible direction I mean they could when you're six years old you're you're so anything can happen yeah anything go wrong and instead they got so lucky and they found you I mean it's like what an incredibly positive thing that is that you've done and an incredibly positive thing for their lives that they came in contact with you and so fortunate I mean it's amazing but for our lives too and we didn't know it for a while you know we had that period where we were like you really feel like for a while they're like okay we've we've done a good thing here and we're gonna suffer for it for the rest of our and then and but then as it comes online I had this one more I think I told you this but I had this one moment that and I'm not this kind of guy I don't think of myself as this kind of guy but after all of this just frustration and craziness and and the kids would wake up really early every morning and they would be out in the hallway throwing things at each other and arguing and whatever and you you're so sleep-deprived and you're just so like you know over heads and one morning I woke up I think it was a Sunday and it was quiet in the room my wife was still asleep and it was like around the time where the kids are normally up and I woke up and I thought oh wow it's quiet in here and then I had this just overwhelming feeling that I couldn't even identify at first and then I thought oh shit I missed them right now like I'm actually waiting for them to come in the room and wake us up and that was that was really a big moment for me where I was like wow I've turned a big corner here and that what you get from them and that those kinds of feelings is pretty incredible is this strange scene the movie like thinking that this is based on not just your life experience but also based on your interaction with some kids that you never wanted up adopting yeah it's well and also I met a but like I said it made a bunch of families along the way and some of the there's this young girl named Mairead Green who became a consultant on the movie because she grew up in foster care she was adopted as a teenager she's an amazing kid she goes to UCLA right now and and so I know either my own stories or other people's stories I can associate them with really specific kids so the thing that's embarrassing is that I'm taking the movie all over the country I've seen the movie like a thousand times now and any time I watch it with an audience I get emotional watching the movie I mean the movies really funny but it's got some really emotional moments and it's embarrassing so that looks like oh yeah good so broken up by my own movie but it's really because I'm thinking about my own kids or I'm thinking about these these real kids that are you know that I've met along the way so it's I got to tell you this and I know I'm in it and I'm amazing in it but I'm saying I'm saying in them we went to the screening like a month or two ago and Christina and I get there and we run into Marc right away so I he's like he's you haven't seen this and I go now he's like it's really man it's really good and I was like yeah I keep hearing it's good and he's like now like he was like he was prepping me for how emotional he gets in it he goes he's like I you know I I'm in some violent stuff that's awesome but this I'm in and he's like I couldn't help but like get emotional about it and I was like okay I'm like all right and then I sit there watch and then I look over you're seeing is crying in parts the movie I start getting emotional part movie I mean it's like he actually you you did a really good job of balancing those emotional moments with the comedy so I don't mean I don't know how you do it but like the the back and forth of it was like a perfect balance and I think it's a it's a great movie I mean everybody who's seen it has you know that has said anything to me is just like blown away by the movie yeah well and that balance of comedy and drama was what we worked on that was the number one thing we worked on through every draft yeah everything and it's great and it is really fun to watch with an audience because they do get emotionally caught up and if the world is coming back and giving them a laugh where they need it you know this is a hit do you think they're gonna want to dig down to other aspects of your personal life oh well this is all I got this is boost our Airlines for me this is you know in Wall Street when Charlie Sheen couldn't sell anything to Gordon Gekko and then he's like well what about blue star Airlines cuz he had the tip from his dad because the ad was like a mechanic of booster Airlines that's been kind of the running joke that this is the only interesting thing in my life gone there and it's just you know when this when this happens you know and you you become part of that adoption community as well so it really becomes a big part of who you are and who your family is and that kind of thing so you know there's this is all I got I got this and then making movies this must be a different movie for you though I mean you I'm sure you love your other movies but this one's gonna be a really different feel it's really different because I you know I was talking about sex drive before and the reason why that one was has a special place in my heart is because it was my first real Hollywood movie and I was just it was just such an amazing experience to just be this bumpkin from out of nowhere making this movie with this budget and it was great but I've had great experiences on all the movies that I've made but this one's totally different it's a different tone it has more drama it has more gravity to it it's about something that is really really important to me and and it's really funny and we have people like Tom in the movie and Tom is I mean you know we're joking but he is really funny in the movie I believe you it was fun he's a funny guy yeah he's a really do thanks man man I'm telling people that for years but I haven't been lying it was fun to do man it was really a thrill this became one of those they the camaraderie on that thing was another thing that was really fun because you go to a different to Atlanta and we have like this great group every day but we have like you know you have the the big stars but then like people I mentioned like Margo and them and Julie Michael Allen Brit Jodi and we would just like it was like it is kind of like being in a camp or something you know which for me was the first experience well what you don't know is that and what a lot of people who work in movies a lot of times that so much of the the the camaraderie of the set is set by kind of number one number two on the call sheet like whoever the big movie stars are in your movie sometimes you know you you hear these stories a lot of stories Steven Segal yeah but just people walking on eggshells around you know whoever the you know and when you have people like Mark and Rose were really cool and just really easy to deal with everybody everybody just is so much more relaxed and having a really good time when you know and then I mean you know I'll take some credit for it myself too because John and I try to run a really happy set and we just try to have definitely man it's definitely you guys are so like you guys are low maintenance types you know like you're like the type of people like it feels I took you for just to show you like how unpretentious he is when I got the part I was like I we've been speaking about the part and other things and then you know I'll get an email about rehearsal at Paramount and I would just call Sean like the director direct like he is rehearsal at 10:00 and he's like yeah I'm like where do I park he's like I think in the there's a lot don't tell you there to go and I'm like okay and I'd hang up my bike I'm just calling the director of like a major picture like where do I park yeah he was never like fucking figure it out you know he was just like that's fine just call me if you need parking directions use it out right now that comes out
