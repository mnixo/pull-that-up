the girag and experience well I'm glad over all the years though although all the stupid ideas that I've had about arguments in my head I've avoided all physical altercations I've never had a physical altercation I've kidded I've had situations where you know a long time when I wish I told this guy that I wish I told him this but the reality is it's way better that I didn't because thank what if he went will fuck you and then he fucking throws a rock at me and then all sudden were two men biting each other yeah oh that wrestling in the street like fucking children you know what the fuck is that when I was a kid my dad came home from work once with a fucking black eye my stepdads business was going was falling apart and at one point shit got squirrely and him and his partner fucking duped it out it's crazy yeah he's been YouTube wasn't around then you know they'd be some sort of security it was like that whoa are you like in your fucking 40s it's like what is happening it was a it was disappointing embarrassing it was sad it was a bunch of different things all once didn't think it was bad ass on any level that you stepdad could still throw down no I think got his ass kicked I'm pretty sure yeah that's embarrassing I'm sure I'm pretty sure he got sucker-punched and then he hit the guy back he punched the guy in the stomach but I don't know who punched who first but it's just fucking pathetic this guy was his friend and this guy's to come over the house and we used to you know we all still have family dinners together like him and his wife would come over the house this is my dad's partner and then all sudden they're fucking duking it out at work as the business fell apart it was very very straight I was come over for dinner again or no was there became friends again yeah they'd stay stayed friends you know they just they duked it out his friends and then they stayed friends but it was just embarrassing and he was embarrassed too he felt like such a fucking idiot he came home with a black eye you know it's like what am i delegate hire only man to reap ick up the friendship it'd be easier if I won the fight if I lost the fight that would be in the back of my you want the rematch at some point you get used to when you do jujitsu a lot you get used to getting beat yeah yeah but that's a different thing that's a different thing you there's young one there you're learning to fight and then like hey let's let's try these techniques you know if like what if we had some big argument about we were going to combine our podcasts and then it just didn't go well and I didn't give you the money for the microphones and then we duked it out and you somehow lost I somehow surprised you and had a whole feeling wasn't one in a million chance I somehow caught you I would feel way stupider that we're fighting I would feel way stupider than that it's my voice I know but you're a martial artist I get it yeah is it but just right now go in peace he got doesn't even know this it's always going to annoy you you wouldn't see me in there like I got my back turn to your dummy I would shake my head I'll be like what bill how can I punch me in the face could have Ron Howard look at jackass that wouldn't bug you depends on if you really just tooled me up like all of a sudden you just fucking unload like a a one two leg kick combination on me and I mean I've never been you hit me with a liver shot and drop me and then how to tap out yeah then I probably want some sort of a rematch let me ask you this which really upset would you lose a belt class which you have to go back down to brown belt you don't lose I mean the only way you get to the other ideas of your certain lever proficiency but it doesn't mean that someone can get you what if I started flexing half tall pictures of my face to your dojo there's no way you'd have to lose yourself win a beauty bill bug who's next and I'm just sitting there with a stupid look on my face velvet you know this competition is healthy I think it's fun and everything but when it gets in the real world like as far as like fighting people and shit like that it's too squirrely because you don't just fight someone they get mad and they come back and they want to bring a baseball bat or fucking stab you or shoot you I never fought outside my family past junior outside Maui when junior high oh yeah once kids started getting to be like you know buck and a quarter in that new house becoming coordinated dude I saw one kid take a pounding and I was just like I'm sticking with the jokes it was this kid who he was jacked he's one of those man child's you know in like eighth grade you know they aren't they could like beat up the teacher but then they get to high school and they just stopped growing and then they're just little fireplug but Nathe cray that's like that's their peak and this kid was at his apex of physical fitness and he was fighting this doughy this baby here we looking kid and they go to get off the bus and baby Huey's behind manchild and he just you know he just pushed him down behind jump got on his chest and it was just he just started teeing off with his head and it was one of those you know people go crazy and then it becomes disgusting like the crowd was just like wow and it's just like who's just being the fuck out of them he didn't come to school for the rest of week and he came back next week and the swelling in his face had come down probably 80% but he this is man child yeah he still didn't look and he had a look in his eye I remember his confidence was shaken am i it was it was amazing man I was like you saw it was a it was a moment in his life and I remember just looking at that going yeah yeah deaf it was funny because I almost went at it with that baby he would kid I would get killed he's like I'm he just he would have stabbed me with the son's know bang every fucking kid know he used to get bullied and he just I don't know he was used to getting the crap kicked out of him by people like two years older which is basically you're in seventh grade like that two years it is a huge jump physically and it's like you're sitting there you know like okay I'm gonna fight you and the other guys like we got like a beard you know smashing you over the head so um yeah so all my fights were basically within my family and I had four brothers so I used to practice on my three younger ones and then try to take my older brother with a psychological advantage over me so older brothers always have an advantage yeah I didn't be I had a friend whose older brother used to beat the fuck out of him and it tortured him late into like adulthood he was in his late 30s and it was fucked it fucked his head up he always wanted to get back at his brother he's to go over his brother's house and brother wasn't home and steal shit from him like he would go like his wife his brother's wife was there he'd say hi again I John told me to go pick something up and go in and just steal from his brother what's up brother why the fuck out of him his brother beat the fuck out of him my brother was like 2 years older and just used to just box him up used to fucking really hurt him and intimidate the shit out of them I got one for you I went last time I fought my youngest brother I figured we went at it about my dad came in to break it up and like a piece of shit I did one more over my dad's shoulder caught him and it made that classic like Hollywood should have Rick recorded the sound for like the punch in the face was that classic but like with a little bit of lip sound kind of right in the mouth and I knew it bugged him and then what would hit for like 15 years we would be out drinking and like when he got on his third drink I would feel him sizing me up I felt I felt an obvious cone is this in my head or just dude sizing me up and then like years later I'm drinking with my other brother and we were talking about him I'm going yeah he doesn't think I noticed but I feel him sizing up he goes oh yeah do it he goes every time I drink with him he brings that up and like by then he was a little bit taller than me and he had that dad that anger and stuff but uh I just would I would have just tied him up like I got to a point where I just you know I'm gonna strategy blend out in your head duck under the sucker punch get the clinch yeah my older brother came at me uh my mom of two eleven years ago and like a Red Roof Inn over some some sort of bullshit and he came flying at me you know my brother is no joke he can fight and I just tied him up I've been like but I had the advantage where he has a real job so he has to work I can sit here going on hikes and going to the gym and stuff so I was in that cardio I was in better shape so I just I just tied him up hello just I'm up for not not long dude he was like 1d Spassky 15 say it was like in cubical shape he had like that initial I'm gonna I'm gonna kill you but I'm this is the thing though if he would have if I didn't tie him up yeah that's all like its it's like in hockey when when someone goes on our fight they just grab the guy in like bear hug him I just sort of did that and I was uh how was he he was kind of on top of me but I just I just said I'm sort of smothered and I was like dude I'm not gonna fight magnify you didn't talk to me for a year Wow didn't talk to me for a year and what was he mad about I don't it was dude it's that family shit some I don't know some from 1974 I'm glad I don't her brother because I would not want to grow up with someone like me if I was a brother if I had up like a one or two things would have might have been you know we would join an alliance yeah and fucking started to take on the world and tag-team chicks or we would fight to the death it's gonna be one of the other I don't really see any other option yeah so which one's gonna be fucker you know I think there's a reason why you didn't have a brother cuz I whenever I talk to him he is like you'll have a couple of parakeets and they somehow have a fight to the death like dude I don't know what's with parakeet yeah they just go at it Freaks and Geeks lovers and children what's going on
