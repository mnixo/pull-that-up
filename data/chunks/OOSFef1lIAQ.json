and boom what's up man how are you good thanks for doing this thank you for having I was so impressed with your performance from that past UFC that I had to had to talk to you I was like that was what I've seen guys make like you were always a very dangerous striker from obviously from the gokon sake fight ever got everybody got to see that mm-hmm but to see how fluid you were against a beast like Eric Andersen Eric Cantor's a scary cat yeah he's he's coming from blood right and you were so fast man it was crazy to watch it's really interesting thank you like what if you had to give yourself a percentage leap that you've gone up over the last year what do you think it would be compared to like who you were before that not that high of a leap I'm not that I like that performance for me was like I feel good about it but that was only four months so I'm like I know there's so much more for me to gain that's one like yeah I gotta go back so the leap not not too much because I know there's still a lot more to go a lot more yeah wow so you've decided so for people who don't understand what we're talking about you went to Thailand you spent four months down in Thailand and you were fighting like a Thai boxing it was crazy like Martella gratae who works in the production truck this guy who picks out the instant replays he and I talked back and forth sometimes while the fights going on and marketing with his heavy Boston accent like dude classic he's classic Thai stance I hear you just so light on that front inside leg kick was so ferocious it was fun to watch man so it's just usually wherever I go um I've always been good at just like kind of absorbing the culture I'm a guy like I can go into a room full of people and I can just kind of pick up what the energy is like and that's another reason why I wanted to go to Thailand so just the way that they train and the discipline the power but the relaxation like everything I was learning just like then there's so much more to muy Thai so I would just even the days that I didn't train sit around and just watch these guys because more times more than just punching kicking elbows man there's balance you know what I mean there's there's repetition like how many kicks are you throwing you know the guys at the stadiums they're like they're kick kick kick kick yeah so I was able to learn a lot man and there's still a lot to go it's beautiful to see someone on that pursuit and I think it's um it's much like Roger Mayweather said about boxing like most people don't know shit about boxing a lady said that's like if anybody is gonna say that he's gonna say that because there are levels and layers and there's there's paths to go down and it's interesting when you see someone like committed with a very like a very specific style like your you like your adoption of that muy Thai style so if it's so effective has a striking style it's really interesting when you think of all the different ways to attack with striking that one way became very particularly successful you know what before I even started training MMA as a whole my first mixed martial my first martial arts class was a Muay Thai class I knew that I wanted to train Muay Thai or to learn Muay Thai and so since I've started I always thought like yeah I want to go there you know just maybe it's cool but Moya has always been my thing but I had never really learned it like the actual way you know like from the root yeah of uh of where it comes from always just kind of like passed down or like Brazilian style more time right you know like shoot the box type stuff so um that's completely different from Stadium we taught and most people don't know shit about stay here Voigt I'd like unless you go to unless you go to Bangkok let's characterize it for people you say that that Curitiba style is just way more aggressive different different way they utilize techniques yeah it's not light on the front leg so sometimes they are like more Shogun would be light on his front leg a little bit one thing that they were doing a lot that's pretty similar is just like they go at it shoot the box they'll go at him you just go until the other guy stops pretty much but from the shoot the box I was like very calm based like punches and kicks like one - like you have to memorize these crazy combos cordero is he like I think he's one of the guys that just like passed it down along Diego Lima think guys like that but you know they have this system and it's very like combination based memory slipping punch kick all the stuff but the ties are just like it's just straight kick you know like punch you you fall down on that front foot elbow knee it's just it's broken down completely differently um it's just a whole a whole different style yeah it is like so that the shoot the buck stuff has punches kicks knees elbows combination same tools that you're going to use in my tie but muy Ty's got a whole different game plan hmm you know clinching it's like I've never trained as much clinching in America as I have in Thailand in just four months and I've been fighting our training now for like nine years so just in four months I've gotten more clinch time in Thailand that I have you know in my whole career and then because it's a whole different game you got to master the clinch into in in my diet you have to for effective like real true Muay Thai are you getting a lot of wrestling over there yeah so that's one thing - I heard I heard shop talking about it Tiger has amazing like it's an amazing gym forty to sixty guys on the mat from everywhere Chechnya Wow you know in everywhere in everywhere men those guys they come there maybe for a week maybe two weeks mm-hmm maybe for a month but you're getting constant good training grappling everything MMA boxing CrossFit have everything you need is in one place it's it's it blew my mind be in there honestly um that's fascinating and you're are you the coaches that you were working with before are still working with them and Thailand are you just gonna I know you talked about actually moving to Thailand yeah yeah the plan is to move there like as soon as possible really yeah so I was like hitting you up like Jo want to get on your show I want to talk a little bit but yeah I want to the plan is to move to Thailand like within the next couple weeks for at least a year and I want to go there just because I can just train that the lifestyle is completely different I can walk to the gym hop on a motorbike it's just it's so simple but to answer the question about my coaches I always have my brother in my corner he's just kind of like moral support we started this together I had a conditioning coach slash friend slash mental type of like support lorenzo pav luca and then my head coaches have switched probably two or three times in the last couple fights I had Kenny Johnson from black house John Wood from Syndicate and now I have George Hickman from Tiger moita yeah and so this change that you decided to make did it come after the Johnnie Walker fight yeah so the Johnnie Walker fight like that camp was tough man like I was doing so much to try to improve in my wrestling and grappling because that was always like a big hole in my game so I spent so much time wrestling over at Black House with Kevin Casey and this guy that I've fought Blake troupe they're huge and these guys are great grappler so in case he's a powerhouse yeah he'll put you into the ground and it feels like cement blocking off you so it's old-school Hicks and jujitsu exactly high pressure man yeah so yeah I would I was just grinding myself into the mat every day for that camp expecting like okay I'm comfortable in the feet if it goes to the ground I'm ready and I I think I just completely lost sight of like my striking my Muay Thai in that fight his size everything I just kind of froze up man I was just like I didn't know what to do how to get there so it's all part of the education right I mean this is what this this career of fighting that you're you're on this path is what it's all about yeah and fighting for me is like big self-awareness too you know I think it's always important though when a guy has setback to see how he responds some people get discouraged some people get encouraged some people just decide like they're gonna be much more committed and that's what you did you just making that move to do your camp in Thailand and seeing how it paid off I mean Eric Anders is a very tough customer and you essentially shut him out yeah I mean it was very very impressive man that was that that was the the plan though because I knew he was telling he's before I sparred with him before that everything in like he's I've watched all of his fights the guy's hard to put away we're making a case for the fight being stopped yeah we were making a case I mean DC was saying like the we could stop this fight I was saying it I was like you were fucking his legs up like this about it during the fight I wasn't I'm sure you weren't but that guys so damn tough he kept coming man I mean he never stopped trying to win that fight yeah there's no quit in him no I mean even in the Santos fight remember it was just they were do or die yeah sweetsies like I haven't been that tired since like my wedding night or something he's always got good good tweets after the fight Andrew I love with John annek said to he loves when he fights cuz then Bruce Buffer has to say you boy hey why does where does he keep his suits man he's got a new suit oh he's a bad motherfucker dude the insides of always has like different decorations and shit they commemorate different places where we're at Bruce Buffer he's he's got style I just imagine him have a level on his house just oh yeah you know I mean like you know Nordstrom or something like his is all suits warm before I mean I've unless he donates something he might donate them to charity that might be one of the auction them for charity or something that'd be good yeah he's uh he's a fun dude he's the best ring announcer of all time to man when that guy starts whaling he gets so pumped up serious he's fucking heard gets right he's so intense man like if you watch boxing they're much more smoothly digs in I remember see him first yella like at TJ Dillashaw and he was gives you goosebumps yeah you just feel as energy right you're just like I'm there wait ready for a fight look I'm kind of nervous and then Bruce comes over like yeah blue quarter like we're talking about dude who blew his ACL out from jumping up in the air while he was reading member that oh my god so it does he gets me fucked his knee up from just getting crazy well yeah Oh Joe really quick what do you we got okay so remember I told you to turn your air drop on during the show so I didn't want to come here empty-handed Lee so I haven't slept in probably mmm 24 hours more than 24 hours but last night I was drawing and I know you like art it sounds like yeah let me draw these illustrations for you so I just want to send them to you okay so turn your air drop on it's on and as soon as it comes through I'll send them but yeah I really just like man I just want to if you want to keep them use them for like wallpapers or post them up whatever you want made this yeah I did all these man do this I look ridiculous yeah I did a little like I'll put it on Instagram later cool man it's very cute well it looks like me view in the gym and you had this like crazy first I actually show you the the action one it's real I know what you're talking about yeah I was going crazy during this stupid fitness challenge I was having with my friends we were working out to six hours of cardio a day trying to be each other and so stupid nothing else taking that picture there's a good one I wasn't kill me let me copy that so when you decide to move are you taking anybody with you you go solo mmm I'm gonna start off going solo I would like to get you know my brother to come visit I'd like to get my mom to come out really has made me smile time yeah yeah and and just cheap and just kind of simple living my and my mom I don't think she's ever left the country so I think it'd be really cool for her to go out there but at the moment I'm just really like this place is great for my career right now I'm bringing my training so I just want to get there ASAP I'll get back to work sorry how do you account for jet lag like do you do you just like do you give yourself enough time to adjust to the time difference you know what the whole time I was there would my sleep schedule was off I never adjusted so I was going to bed maybe 2:30 a.m. every morning then and like get up run at 5:00 and then you know just tired later get hired later yeah schedule was all off and then when I came back it took me like a week or two to adjust so I was disappointed how stupid my body was man hey dummy go to bed now I'm telling you just go to bed now like my I didn't know my body had such a rigid schedule when you jack that thing sideways and you're on the other side of the planet your body just really doesn't know what the fuck is going on seriously and then for me being stuck in that plane for so long yeah like yeah you too big for them little seats too and so when you do that if say if you have a fight in Vegas you're gonna go from Thailand to Vegas do you show up two weeks early yeah well this is my first time flying back to the States after being in Thailand and I flew a week early no I flew two weeks early one week I stayed in Vegas and then fight week stayed in Atlanta and look I think that was perfect timing oh that's good so I could get a little little difference in time between those weather two minutes it's so hot like we trained outside and it's humid and hot so between every round it feels like you know like the third round of a fight if we're going into the championship rounds I've never been there but I'd imagine that it feel very shitty and that's how it feels every round in Thailand it's just like you're covered in sweat mean hot thick yeah that was probably like my fifth round or something like that and we do it always dead by this point mmm shout out to the editor for making me not look as tired as I was yeah so what we're looking at folks for the people who are just listening is a bunch of videos of you training strength conditioning pummeling up against the wall so you're getting everything down there yeah that's Joseph Henley right there he was on the on The Ultimate Fighter I forgot what's using they called him Leonidas he's a black belt out there and he helped me out a lot man there's you run into so many different people and he's like yeah like black belt any type of grappling you want any positions you want to work like we'll go over it will create a system whatever so he was really big help in this information for this fight yeah bunch of free spirits live in there right so Minnie Oh Minnie but everybody's down there with a goal they want to get in shape they want to get healthier yeah spiritual path whatever it may be there's something romantic about the expat living in Thailand having a good time you know romantic about that so it's interesting it's really cool yeah I mean that whole culture man I mean the the tie and Muay Thai culture what a phenomenon if you look at combat sports I mean this one that it's so tied into these stadiums it's so tied into gambling and netting it's a mean kids get indoctrinated into it at a very young age we're young super young there's guys at the gym that I was at little kids they'd come right after school and they go to Muay Thai training and their training just like the older guys and then they go right back to like home eat dinner but that's just their lifestyle so it it starts as a kid it's like go to school Muay Thai go sleep and then as an adult like muy Thai feed your family Muay Thai feed your family these guys live at the gym man Jesus they live at the gym and they go home maybe two days after a fight just to take care of the families and then come right back to the gym and get ready for the next height now of course at Tiger muy Thai you know you've guys everybody knows various people in different organizations UFC Bellator what-have-you one FC but what about those guys that are fighting in those little small Thai gyms and stadiums like how much access do they have to grappling or how do they ever the they are they satisfied to just do more tyres here at all like a movement in Thailand no and especially at tiger a lot of those guys are coming over to the MMA and learning jiu-jitsu and wrestling one of the guys I was learning to clinch from he was like a he's got probably 300 fights hmm 300 more Thai fights and he started training MMA and taking him and they fight so it's step they're definitely opening their mind to it and and hopping in there and there's access and Bangkok it's a little different because that's very like stadium based you know any high-level muy Thai and they're not too focused on him mayor a couple of imagens but if you want to do if you want to get the best of both worlds it's in it's in Phuket a tiger mmm so in is there any MMA at all in Bangkok oh they got a couple places but nothing with like at like pro fighters or any high-level fighters but they do have they do have maybe three or four MMA gyms there with just guys stopping in or guys who practice you know a little bit of everything I'm always really interested in countries that figure something out better than everybody else yeah when it comes to leg kicking like nobody figured it out any better than the Thais it's like no one argues that right no seriously and they're Chan's man like I think they're just that's done for they don't even feel the front of their legs anymore because they can kick anything and they're getting kicks checked there's guys that Joe they'll fight one night at the stadium go five rounds and then sleep and maybe the next day go fight like another small event or smaller he's memorized sometime even in the same night and it's like man aren't you like your shins don't hurt your elbows don't hurt nothing in these guys they're just like they're bulletproof they're used to this man it's crazy Wow and their first time in my life I go into a locker room and the red and blue corner is both in the same room probably as big as this studio and they're all getting their hands wrapped together getting massaged out together everything no weird energy in the room like you know the UFC like they separate us we have to kind of be separate whatever purposes but like in Thailand they're just like hanging out same room you know talking whatever and then they just go fight right after it's so weird like that the peace it's it's so weird man it was the first time I experienced that and I was like maybe I can start lightening up a little bit like that's only a fight that's kind of something I had to tell myself um for this one I had to like really fall back and rely on my training because I was really nervous I was nervous to start to try the new stuff that I learned out mm-hmm never threw many leg kicks and any of my fights I've never really did that stance everything that I did was pretty much brand new and I was really nervous I was like what if it doesn't work you know like so many different so many different feelings and for this one I the only thing I can tell myself was like on your training and a few other things I actually got um I got like hypnotized to before yeah dude who did um my friend Dominique he has he has this like I met him through one of the one of the other UFC fighters like Julianne Marquez I met him I met him through him and he's like oh yeah I do like hypnotism all this stuff I'm like okay cool I've done it before I did it in California and so I think three weeks two or three weeks prior to the fight we had a few sessions a week we're just like help me to really get that visualization clear because we have so many thoughts all the time right and everything just like thoughts are constantly coming in and to stay focused and to really like like get the outcome that we you know set our intention to it's kind of hard so so many distractions so when you go into his office and or wherever you do it man you guys talk about it do you set a goal before you start the session we do this thing called timeline therapy so it's like I'm just kind of sitting there with my eyes closed and we kind of just do this we'll pick a subject whether it's like you know pain fear you know nervousness something we'll just pick a subject of feeling whatever's going on and it's kind of just like a visual timeline of like where did this start or come from what's the event whatever and we kind of just talk about that for a while and I just kind of dig to this place of where the nervousness is coming from or where the you know where the fear is coming from or whatever I kind of just I find a place on my timeline and I dig from it whether it's in the future of the past whatever and then we get things clear and then and then after that he kind of helps me guides me into this like hypnotism which is really just like a really deep relaxation if I wanted to open my eyes or something like that I feel like I could but I wanted to relax I wanted this to help you know I wanted my vision to be clear so I did my best to just like surrender to the process and I'd say it's not something where I woke up and I was like ah yeah my life has changed but I can definitely remember the thoughts that I had so that I can stay moral Mike in that you know in that lane of what I wanted and in my in my hypnotism I actually visualized not winning the fight because I didn't want to strive too hard to win like it's just something that I've been kind of studying it's like the outcome it's not really like the winning or losing I don't want to base too much on that I just want to put on like a great performance so I visualized after one thing and like just having my hands in the air seeing my brother smile my coaches smile and then slapping hands with the crowd on the way out and then I was also like and I want to see my win bonus and my show money and these are the things that I wanted to see these are the outcomes that I wanted not so much just I want to win the fight but the things that I liked how I wanted it to happen yeah and having that vision clear it helped me and so like everything that I visualized before that it happened I was like cool hands raised slap hands with everybody on the crowd the way out sign both my checks and that was like that was the end of it for me until the next session until I want to get clear on something else you know it was cool Wow so had you didn't anything like that before any mental coaching yeah before they go comes occupy I did something very very similar yeah with a with another guy I was up the first time you'd ever done it first time doing hypnotism yeah definitely and yeah my friend Matthias he's here and he's really good too and he'll just like take some notes you kind of just have a conversation in the beginning and everything comes from your unconscious mind it's not somebody telling you something mm-hmm I just dumped out whatever my unconscious mind was telling me he was just helping me to like relax be at peace and just listen to like my unconscious mind just on unfold all of these kind of like hidden answers that we don't have you know so that's it now when you get hypnotized and you're thinking about a specific fight do you think about specific things you're trying to accomplish things that you think you'll do to him you'll have an advantage at or strategy or like how do you well those were thoughts that were happening and before my hypnotism but then all of those thoughts were coming from the anxiety coming from the nervousness you get what I'm saying yes so it's like let's go back on the timeline to why you're feeling nervous yeah like all these things are happening they're gonna you you you're anticipating all these things happening and it's making you feel nervous so let's go back to the nervousness and revisit that y-you know and then my subconscious my own conscious mind just like spewing things out and then after the process of that mixed with the hypnotism I'm not even thinking about oh I'm gonna hit this arm drag or whatever I just I'm thinking about having my conscience clear and my mind clear and everything so that I can get the expectation that like or the the visualization that I created yeah so have you tried different versions of that or different styles of hypnosis mmm no not that I can I mean I've done a lot of just like closed I like emotional intelligence type of like exercises you know like where I'm just like my eyes are closed and I have someone helping me visualize internally you know like just whether it's dreams or emotional pain or whatever it may be yeah and people just like guided meditation almost yeah but the actual name like hypnotism I've only had it done by two people well as when you're watching fighters if you're I think fighters are one of the most complex puzzles for psychologists because I think it's a super-rare state like the rare state that someone gets to where they can be completely calm see everything in the heat of a dangerous encounter with another trained fighter yeah and when you're watching these things play out on TV and you oftentimes see how much anxiety plays a factor or doesn't play a factor how much someone having the I don't give a fuck attitude for real and play it can be a benefit and it can fuck you up sometimes - and to see these complex psychological puzzles play out and see fighters struggle and then regroup have a bad fight and come back better all that stuff is like it's it's really like a giant microscope on the human character you know and I like a guy like you who comes back from that Johnnie Walker fight and looks sensational against Eric Anderson an it was like that was one of those things you're like I like what I'm seeing this guy he figured some shit out man like that that was that was incredible it was really fun to watch man guy really loves my tie it was fun to watch thanks man yeah that was and that's that's kind of the goal to going forward is that I want to continue to like put on stuff like that continue to learn Muay Thai and then because that fight kind of raised the bar right people are like oh man this guy for sure kind of put me back on the map so now I'm ready to just go back and you know how many guys use mental coaches now if you had to guess a good handful good hand yeah a good handful I think I think a lot of women Vinny Sherman he hypnotized me and he he hypnotizes a lot of fighters yeah yeah um yeah it was a trip it's very strange it's like oh this is real so weird feeling how long ago was it it was the old studio so it had to be at least a year and a half maybe two years ago okay yeah it's pretty weird but he's a great mental coach too though he knows like what's creeping around your subconscious and just waiting to pop up and play tricks on ya you know you should put in enough rounds where does he live I see you cake I okay yeah I gotta get linked up with him yeah I'm all about I don't care anybody I'm like yeah like whatever you got yeah any Sherman let's go yeah he's a good dude I'll connect you guys I think it's a probably one of the least trained aspects of fighting is the mental aspect of it you know you realize how good guys are just by watching them train you see them spar you see them do all these things and Scott this guy's fuckin goods guys got great Jiu Jitsu this guy got great kickboxing you ever hear about the people that like their their sayings right like man that guy's amazing in the gym but when he shows up to fly it laughs he just doesn't put on like been that guy multiple times and yeah a lot of it has to do with mentally yeah that's almost like an unaddressed giant chunk of the puzzle like a third of the puzzle like it was a pie a third is keep it together you know like you know when it's ready to go and now it's all happening don't freak out and you never like here's kind of some of that I think about you never know everybody's situation right so the day before the fight we have weigh-ins and then Dana comes back and like he gives us as our speech right so everyone there you don't know what life position they're in you know so it's like hey there's a potential we can get a bonus so all those guys are affected emotionally somehow you know what I mean some guys maybe they don't care some guys maybe they do but then like we walk out and then there's a crowd 15,000 people sold-out look around we got Joe Rogan sitting here we got Mick Maynard say we got Dana why we got everybody sitting around and then like we're still human - so we're thinking like this is kind of like a test you know it's like we got all the we got the whole board right here in front of me ready to take my test you know like yeah it really depends on like there's so much that goes into it like mental you got to be prepared for a lot of things or some guys block it out but it's just like like anything else if you had to know about half way into the first round some special shit was happening though on this fight yes after so after the first round I was very happy i sat down my coaches were like okay this is good this is good you're doing this I was like listen I don't want to know what's good what should I expect the next round like I was ready to go I told this straight to George I'm like dude I don't care what do I need to do next what should I prepare for and he's like prepare for a little bit more pressure he's probably gonna try to shoot the further takedown in this round I was like okay cool so that I was just looking for that and using my tools to kind of to just prepare for that but uh definitely midway through the second round I was like okay like I know he still got a lot of power all this stuff but I think that that leg I should be able to you don't buy some time and take away a little bit of damage like coming at me I mean he had to be in agony and he never stopped coming I mean he didn't wince at all like even on the cage when I was just like when he was on the back and I was trying to kick his leg he just his face his facial expression never changed he's a fucking savage man it's crazy he's a bad man respect that yeah for sure sure for sure even before like even before the fight not more in after yeah sure yeah no it may be even more so man not everybody can do that not everybody can take that you know and to do it the way he did it with a hundred percent of his a character intact never shirked never shied away from it kept moving forward that's a dangerous person and he's still getting better oh yeah how that guy's just getting better oh yeah when you were doing how much do you think the hypnosis helped you a really good amount man how many different did you feel like in what way mmm I just I felt more clear I'm I feel like a lot of times I can be just kind of like an anxious guy I just I feel like I feel a lot of just energy to kind of like I don't know I go into a room and I'm just like guy so having having the focus on having my intention set on what I wanted to happen was 70% like I I know Senator ISM all that stuff to just help me to keep my thoughts on track something never fall back on - every single time if I felt like I was getting distracted or getting nervous or whatever I would remember you know the things that we went over in the hypnotism and so every time just kind of like that hit that reset button or just a delete button on on thoughts that I just didn't want to have or thoughts that would make me feel anything other than happy and ready to go now how often do you practice is to practice this outside of hypnosis is there like some things you concentrate on or meditate on yeah so I do my best to just it's kind of like the weird thing about me is fighting is something that it just kind of happened by accident but it's caused me to search for so much peace like inner peace because of everything that I go through emotionally being a fighter so going from this I know Shaab told you about it but going from this kid who was just like super overweight my whole life never fit in with anybody I was always just like this introverted gothic weird kid that nobody you know nobody ever talked to didn't ever even wanted to fight I'll have always been non confrontational but somewhere in the journey of becoming a fighter I was like ah this is cool but I need to find more peace because this is like it's bringing up way too much just like just way too much my of my anger kind of like you know from everything that I held on to so practice meditation a lot of meditation I read a lot of different I'll study different religions whatever wherever I'm at all just to find peace man how does it know he's confrontational guy wind up being an elite cage fighter hmm stop and think about what I'm yeah it's that's a very strange still trying to wrap my mind around it but I think that internally there's just a lot of there's a lot of expression I for me it's a it is a big expression it's an expression of just my my danger my ferociousness this the the the part of myself that I've always held back you know it's like I have to hold back I'm I'm a big guy you know like I if I get angry I'm afraid I can you know break something you're like you know it's like it's crazy so fighting for me like when I train after training I'm super peaceful right after I fight I feel like I've grown I feel like this guy's trying to hurt me all these things like it's it's just a place where we both agree like hey I'll give you my strength versus your strength or whatever whatever powers that strength is what we meet in the middle and so it helps me balance man it does yeah because when I'm not fighting I'm I'm so relaxed it's crazy it makes sense and it I think that something that could aid a lot of men I think just at least training just aspect I think there's something particularly soothing about hitting a heavy bag there's something particularly like when you're done man you feel so good when you're done hitting pads we've done sparring you feel so just peaceful yeah you got it all out you don't have anything left in you know a lot of men carry a lot of extra bullshit yeah well that - Troy extra for no reason you got to let it out yeah some guys will build it up in the gym right and they're super huge and it's like I gotta let it out again swing those arms wouldn't do it yeah you see less of that now - it seems like but yeah it just it would be nice if I really think they should teach kids how to fight at a very early age have a cool think it's the opposite it would have the opposite effect I think people would fight less I think if you talk kids how to fight they would just train and spar and they would get it all out of their system there and they'd probably fight a lot less it's it's kind of like in our nature right like yeah everybody everybody's got like a curiosity like I wonder what it's like yeah the closest they have to is the wrestling team you can join the wrestling team and they will teach you a very important part of fighting but other than that like they're not gonna teach you how to fight but frazzling is kind of like now at least it's kind of a loophole like they don't teach boxing in high school but they'll teach you how to wrestle and then they're pretty crazy man great wrestling's get rough prisons life fuck yeah yeah yeah well some high school kids are savages I remember being a high school kid in a high school wrestling room it was awful you know those kids were trying to kill each other they were hardest - Wow running with plates over the head and all that stuff football teams just lifting weights and running practice those guys was just a shit it's the laven everybody seen that movie Vision Quest right you know I've never seen never saw I've never seen it dude it's Matthew Modine and Matthew boudin plays this badass wrestler and he's going up against this dude there's this other badass wrestler and he comes to visit the guy while the guys training and this dude's got a log on his back and he's walking upstate downstairs and there and that he says you think you make the weight cuz if Matthew Modine characters haircut weight he goes I hope so he was hope so too and he keeps walking up the stairs like kid where did this come out a long time ago man back when Madonna was young yeah that's the wrestler so he's walking up the stadium stairs carrying a fucking log on that it's a great movie man every wrestler that I knew when I was in high school everyone worshipped this movie what year did this shit come out it's probably like 85 or so that's not the cover for it is it 85 BAM I nailed it son is that the cover for it yes I definitely would not click that on Netflix thinking of wrestler movie at all she was hot as the Sun - fun times but yeah that was like the quintessential wrestling movie because he just was dedicated and then there was this friend who lied about being a Native American how's that what that is what's that Vesey goggle and I just wanted to be different stand out but it's a fun movie man it's a fun movie I have to get into that for sure yeah not a whole lot of movies about wrestling that's the least glamorous but probably toughest sport for high school kids to get into definitely you know that's I stayed away from him and you know I tried out for I've tried out for volleyball in high school actually made the team but my grades were terrible so I never got to play but I was like heavyset dude and I tried out made it I think it was just kinda like a joke though I think the coaches were just messing with me my friends - when did you get involved in martial arts uh when I was 20 so 2010 so really quick right after high school I started I started traveling so I used to play in a band I used to play in mini bands and winning star I played guitar I play drums I play keyboard a little bit of everything every Christmas my mom would just no just give me an instrument and I'd lock myself in my room and teach myself how to play that's just always how like music was my first love a Mormon so my first look so hot yourself yeah I just put on like headphones and I would just match the sounds and then keep restarting the songs over and over again and then a keyboard song I'd play it like just on the CD player and you know as it evolved and for some reason I can just I can match tunes with whatever instrument it may be you've always been able to do that since kid Wow yeah so no formal training nothing that's great I've tried to take I've tried to take guitar lessons before but it didn't work for me and my mom was just wasting her money like I was learning but it was kind of like school for me like I had a teacher he saw me okay this chord in this Gordon I was like I like just let me feel it like I gotta I gotta feel it you know like I can hear it I can I can feel it I'll get it and so I I stopped going how many people do it like like that I'm not sure I know there's a lot of people that can just kind of play by ear but so I'll like I just love instruments so I'll pick anything up and just start playing it and end up teaching myself how to play drums bass guitar keyboard I played the stand-up bass in uh in middle school I've got like a little home production like Beats Studio at home all that stuff so after high school I started touring and that's when like I started getting my heaviest we were eating fast food every single day three times a day never drink water soda only smoking like a pack and a half of cigarettes a day and just on the road traveling and then by nineteen I got up to three hundred and five pounds nineteen years old and I remember one night laying down to go to bed and I just felt my heart pumping ridiculously and I was just like no way this is like I think I'm gonna die and like I woke up in a panic and weird thing is I got up and I went outside for maybe like ten minutes I smoked another cigarette and I was just like this is the problem like I'm coughing up stuff my heart is gonna give out and I'm only 19 years old you know so around that same week is when I discovered MMA with my brother just like watching an ultimate fighter on TV and so I went on my last tour and I told the guys like hey I'm gonna go training MMA they're like oh you're gonna be a fighter like you think you know and I was just like I don't know what I'm gonna be but I'm gonna go train and get healthy and they're like okay cool like we'll see you in a couple months you know I hit like no one really believed that I was gonna go and actually train at fight I told you guys have always been this big quiet non-confrontational guy so yeah I went and took my first class Muay Thai and March 1st 2010 took my first muy Thai class and then after like a month of doing Muay Thai I started to see progression I started to see like my face slimming down all this stuff so it gave me motivation to keep going and then I remember going to a MMA event amateur and I saw really big heavyweight guys going at it so I was like I think I want to do it I want to give it a try and some of my coach is like okay if you lose a hundred pounds I'll like I'll find you a fight and I was like a hundred pounds he's like yeah I'll find you a fight if you lose 100 pounds so I just kept training within 11 months lost 100 pounds and then took my first fight and then there's been like every fight has been until now because like now I have like more of a drive and a passion for it but all the way up until then everything kind of happened by coincidence they're just like I just I didn't really want to fight but I had a lot of people like oh you're so good like keep doing it and I was the first time my life ever had people supporting me to like really do something that was big and I was a new guy and I was in shape and I can you know girls are noticing me now I'm like all either my whole life changed within a year of training MMA like wow from going to this guy that nobody even paid attention to to just like oh hey how's it going or you know like oh you're so in shape and I was just like oh this is weird it's still weird it's only been nine years eight years you know so everything's still very new to me I've only my first day stepping on the mat was like you know nine years ago dude that's an amazing story it's crazy that's like a legit success story yeah it's you know is that you look at a ridiculous ringtone do you have sir what is that [Music] what is that it's just like stock iPhone you know you you ventured into the options yeah went down in there yes sir so yeah that's like that's kind of how everything started and then with three five three or four fights and then I tried out for the Ultimate Fighter so I have like three or four fights in one year being a pro and and then the Ultimate Fighter trials came out and I like tried out for that and like made on those like oh shit so most of my career has been in the UFC Wow yeah is that like when you hear about fighters boxers you hear like a really well-managed boxer will get fights to test them but with a guy that you could be and you learn a different thing from each different fighter as you move up the ladder and way more of them are undefeated when they finally get a shot either a title or a top contender but an MMA you could be fighting the top level guys within a couple of years of joining it could honestly be a couple years prior to that if you're particularly talented where you picked up martial arts like in Ghana perfect example perfect rancis and god it was like an incredible example because he's really only done anime for five years and he's still right now the scariest guy in that cage exactly when he's throwing bombs away it's like you to just let go when he knocked out over him that was a UH that was an unheard-of knockout yeah I sparred with him in like in preparation for that fight move and I actually almost got hit with that same punch but yeah we went if Francis I and I went three rounds in the cage and then I remember Forrest was there and and and John the head coaches syndicate and they were like okay you guys tone it down because we were going had it and I mean it was fun like I like to go hard yeah but um how often though how often do I like to go hard yeah every now and then yeah you do mostly technical yeah so like entirely right now it's like everyday technical one days more or one or two days boring and when you say sparring I'm amazed pause I'm amazed boring you know and then the other days are just like technical grapping grappling and technical striking and then you know wrestling and then spar on Fridays now when they break it up did you have someone who makes your schedule for you like for the week do you have all your training routines like what what your the schedule set up for morning evening do you have that yeah yeah so um dance so they had like so for instance like the gym has a schedule of all the classes mm-hmm but uh the the head MMA coach George would help me out like hey if you're getting ready for a fight show up to these these and these and I'll help you and almost like curriculum yeah exactly so that actually helped and the cool thing about it is like everything was in line so like whatever I worked with him personally in the morning we'd still be going over in practice and even in the night practice so getting the same things like you know multiple times a day instead of just one time and then you'll get it again later mm-hmm and when you're you're training over there you said you like 50 to 60 professionals I've seen so many guys on the mat yeah and I'd say on a very very low day 20 like so many people so many people guys and girls men and how much time are you spending striking versus grappling do you specialize in one thing or the other well I can train grappling all day and never get bored and like even if I'm tired I can still do it but then like grappling I do it a lot of the times because I like it but it's mandatory and it's and it's my job so I like okay I'm gonna go to Grandpa in class but it seems like it's an even balance but I love to go to striking more cuz it's just like that's my favorite thing yeah so one striking class one grappling class one inmate class all in one day type of thing so like two hours of peace and then conditioning and running and all that stuff in the middle you not see one whole day yeah Jesus yeah well the MMA class is more like so there's a class of MMA one personal going over like my specific things that I like to work on and want to work on and then maybe whoever's mimicking the opponent and then in the morning muy Thai so for me it's always great to start the morning off with Muay Thai wake up first thing half coffee do my 5 6 K run trained Muay Thai for two hours eat go do MMA personal and then do the MMA class at the end and then go relax after that routine for me can work every day and it does everything's discipline like to do the same thing every day is very common in Thailand and I think that that's why I was able to put that that performance on and use that many kicks because we throw so many in one day you know what's different about the training there there's not there's not really classes like for MMA there's not much talking in tighten my tie there's no talking you know it's like they tell you what to do a little bit like punch kick knee deep five times ten times 20 times you know like it's a lot of repetition and the same thing in the in the MMA class George gives us a lot of time to drill and drill at our own pace and things like that before we go alive and I think that that's what's helped me the most is less talking more drilling show me one or two things we're mixed martial artists we're gonna create something off of it it's okay mm-hmm and just let us drill it let us drill it walk around cook you know correct if you need to but I think people need to spend more time drilling on the mat go live every now and then just so you can feel what your output the only way you're gonna get good is by drilling yeah it's just not as fun exactly it's training I don't think training should be fun you tell a dog to sit a hundred times you got to give him something like you know some type of treat so the promise certain parts of training are fun right yeah which is probably one of the reasons why you like striking exactly it's fun that part for me I can just yeah yeah yeah it's um it's I really believe that psychologists should study fighters study high-level fighters to try to figure out what makes them tick because there's all these different versions you're a different version you the 300-pound guy decides to lose all this weight and now you wanted the best fighters in the 205 pound division and yeah it's crazy man I mean that's a that's a wild story it'd be really cool though yeah yeah maybe you'll get one psychology studies on fighters is almost mandatory because there's certain guys that like they're just impenetrable you know there's certain guys that just they just like khabib is impenetrable if you're not getting more shit you talk more he's gonna fuck you up when he gets ahold of you like it's not working man it's not getting in there and then there's certain guys that like sometimes they're hot and sometimes they get rattled and you know it's it's a crazy endeavor what you guys do really is yeah it definitely is man I think a documentary or something would be really cool to yeah I think a lot of people and the fans need to see kind of a little bit more of the inside the real stuff you know yeah the real stuff like one of the craziest responses that I've been getting lately is people have hit me up on Instagram like I can't believe you're just a normal guy like you're posting songs and and you know like doing all that I'm like yeah I'm human just like everybody else like I think a lot of fans kind of forget that I think we as fighters sometimes forget to like hey like for a little bit you can shut it off and yeah normal yeah it's uh I mean the the balancing act is it's a strange thing to ignore you know the balancing act that a fighter has to have with their personality with training and competing and then just being a normal person and the highs and the lows and managing all the stress of an upcoming fight you just sort of ask to go it on your own like hey good luck keep your shit together yeah in the face of flying fists and it sucks too because the higher we go up then it's just like it's kind of hard to go anywhere behind rights and we're working to get to the top as fighters and we want to be known and and but like the more the more the higher that we go the more like obligations media people want to talk to you all this stuff so your time kind of gets short I was thinking about it last time like damn like getting to the tops gonna kind of suck media like you know media a week or fight week for everybody at the top there like press conference this that that I'm I'm the type of guy where like just like relax so I'll definitely need like a psychologist or so help me out more hypnotism yeah I would I don't know how much they do at the UFC Performance Institute and talking for as far as mindset training do they do any of that over there mmm that's that I've seen when that place is insane if you have chance to train there at all yeah I did it I did to fight camps there when I used to live in Vegas yeah and it it's amazing it's crazy play it was like it was like a little too good for me like I started feeling like a little bit spoiled you don't I mean I was like I gotta go run out in the street like I can't write all these travels man I mean to have a place like that where the company creates this super high-level training environment that there's not another gym like it on the planet on the planet okay good work out there for free seriously it's pretty though you want a protein shake okay you want yeah food like whatever you need just live here yeah look it's a great way to keep guys on track with their weight cuts to you know area information with that place like they they've taught me so much yes you know just about recovery and what to do afterward you know they're they're investing a lot in just like different programs for us to take home so that we can make sure that like our nervous system is good for the next day like they're putting so much stuff into figuring out how to help the fighters you know a stripped down part man that uh that underwater treadmill Jami is it an amazing on it no I did it's sick I was I was wearing my clothes I was gonna jump in there but I was like what look at this is crazy this thing it's sick did you do it yeah I did it a few times what is it Lizzie good for your cardio uh it's it's low impact on the joints right so like it's oh yeah you'll you'll get it real good cardio really real good cardio push on it because there's jets blowing at you and the the treadmills on the bottom so you're trying just to not you run it against the water oh wow and so like depending on how deep you go your arms just that's all resistance oh sure you can go just waist level and it's a little bit easier but the lower you go the harder it is good cardio did you do the zero gravity I didn't do any of the things there I just looked at them daddy just gives it before first Griffin gave me the four one one yeah they've done a lot of wins the last what's the zero gravity it's been a while maybe here what was the zero gravity so there's a treadmill and you put these pants on and then you just zip into this bike you zip into it oh I did see that you turn it on and it fills up with this air then you can run up to like 10% of your body weight so you it's just like it's another zero gravity like the treadmill it's not low impact low impact super low and you can tell percent of your body weight so you're just like tippy-toes just like oh that's so weird yeah you know that's really weird there's not identical stuff man well they're at the four of all recovery methods and training methods and Tricia yeah and you see what they're doing for this on fight week what are you doing so this last fight they're like hey do you want any help do you have your meals prepped or anything that I was like no I don't so I guess for the people that are fighting within us for now they'll they'll prep and make everything for for fight week when you're cutting weight you know make sure wow like you stay in contact with with the guys Clinton them and they'll check your weight and then they'll make meals according to you like whatever you need deliver them to your room that's outstanding it was it was the best and then the recovery afterward they give you these drinks all like you sada approved all that stuff it's like no problems and they helped so much with that last weight cut and and rehydration how much do cut this fight I could 19 19 pounds and that's a lot usually I usually cut maybe four to seven pounds the last couple fights I've just Coast it but when I went to Thailand there's a lot of sugar and a lot of stuff that I was eating out there cuz I really what it was yeah when I was in Bangkok for a long time and it's just a lot of street food a lot of fried food and stuff and I was just there I don't like I'm gonna try everything so once I got to Phuket they actually have like health food stuff vegan stuff they have a lot of tourists there so especially on the street so the street that Tigers on all gyms it's like five or six CrossFit gyms maybe ten restaurants health food restaurants everything so I was able to stay on track there so just I was just back just a few weeks yeah but I still may wait so that's good that's a lot of weight to cut though right and you'd like to cut like about five or six so yeah yeah yeah no more than eight like eight is pushing it for me so what difference do you feel uh the day after I didn't with their rehydration method I felt amazing usually what cutting that much I feel a little bit bloated a little heavy sling beer all that stuff but this when you're talking did you ever do IV or what I did do IV yeah when I used to fight in the RFA and at 185 I used to fight at 185 oh my god yeah that's ours how much did you cut oh I used to cut from I try to get as close to 200 as possible and then cut Wow the 15 super skinny 200 200 terrible I'm struggling to make 205 not not struggling it hurts to make 205 now so I couldn't even imagine like it sucked so what would you think about if they abandoned weight cutting mmm they just opened up more weight classes and abandoned weight cutting I mean I wouldn't mind it I would I would like to see that don't think would be better for the fighters I think it'd be better for the fighters and we'd see some really cool matchups yeah you know what I mean because there's some guys I cut a lot of weight and there's some matchups that would be really cool at different weights too I think it's one of those dumb things that's existed in the past and we never corrected yeah I think I think we should stop it it's not helping anybody to lose weight for fights the key be fit and in great shape yeah okay sure but how do you go about that but I mean losing weight like losing weight and training not like massive dehy for weight cut day and then rehydration to the next day for fight day I think it's it's a crazy strain that guys are doing to their kidneys and their bodies I mean many fighters have told me that they're they don't feel like they can take a body shot as well yeah when they cut a lot of weight I guess sometimes the your head my head I remember in the Johnnie Walker fight I had cut excuse me could have been from the wake up but that morning like if I even tapped on my jaw I just felt like my head was just like off like ratalie you know yeah I felt very sensitive nose from the weight at the same night I get knocked out I don't know what it was from but I remember feeling that morning when I woke up because usually I like I'll shake everything off I'll like you know like punch myself in the jaw that stuff just to get ready for the fight and I remember that that morning when I was like tapping myself on the jaw my head just didn't feel right dude yeah that's not a good feeling no but I got checked after I didn't have any like concussion or anything did you have some particularly hard sparring session or something close to that I don't think close to it during that camp like I said I didn't feel it all the way until I I didn't have it the only the only time I ever felt it was like after the weight cut so it could have been from that right yeah and I think that morning I actually ended up cut in the last little bit of my weight the morning of weigh-ins too which is not usually like me I usually cut it the night before so you said you like to start your day off with a run um are you doing that every day yeah definitely really so that's one thing that I learned too is just training every day not to learn but it just feels different now I have to go and train every day when I was in Vegas like I got to drive 30 minutes you know all these things I had a lot of excuses to make up and now with the convenience of how training is now I don't even make up excuses I'm like if I'm tired I still it's two-minute walk get your ass to the gym you know right and so yeah every every single day training and then weekends off for sure so you're running every single day then you're training every single day for Muay Thai it's mandatory you run like the James right you train it real so you run first you show up you run the first day I showed up at at Tigers Muay Thai class I didn't even have tennis shoes I just showed up with my flip-flops cuz I was staying right across the street and I showed up I start wrapping my hands in the trainer he's like are you gonna train and I was like yeah I think so he's like you think so we'll go run and I was like I don't have shoes only have my flip-flops he's like just pointed like so go run and I had to run like I think was like eight kilometers it's in flip-flops before me seems trained yeah that's like four miles yeah right somewhere around there five and a half yeah it's like for like four miles something like that we just had to run run run run run run I asked the girls like how long do we run for she's like usually like five to six kilometers or something like that yeah I was like 5k is like three a half mile yeah yeah I'd say like just cutting it short 5k Wow and in within flip-flops and I was okay cool yeah I never I never forgot my shoes again I would always talk bad that fuck your feet up it wasn't too bad action oh no cuz I wasn't wearing shoes a lot anyway oh yes Thailand sometimes you had to take off your shoes before you enter the store so so they're they're hard asked and their discipline with the one you're just serious is that very serious yeah they're just serious about it they're like show respect you know and when you're running are you running with a group of guys or everybody guys girls whoever shows up to class but is it is like okay so that when they're running are they running like organized like in a group or they just is everybody running a few miles before class every time the first the first Muay Thai gym that I trained at the strait muy Thai Gym in Bangkok they run as a unit every day 5 a.m. Wow as a team they live at the gym they eat at the gym they sleep at the gym they are like they don't have homes their home is the gym and their job is just fight and eat sleep train fight that's it it's crazy when they even take on the name of the gym yeah exactly yeah and that's a whole different life like that is what made me respect and learn and love Muay Thai so much as how these guys trained and just they lived together everything it was amazing so they run as a group but the other like the other place we all start off but if someone's lapping you and they just want to run fast like it's it's totally fine but before the class everybody has to go yeah wow that's smart way to do it man I mean if you could really convince them to be conditioned all the time and there's no like you have no option you can't be out of condition if you're gonna run five miles every day no five miles and then hit and kicking hitting and kicking pads for five to ten rounds a day clinching 45 minutes a day like clinching out after every session it's like you run knee bag sit-ups all that stuff second second session is kick the bag three to five rounds until a trainer picks you up like for me I had to wait for mm a trainer to actually even like want to hold pads for me if you just show up you'll just be hitting the bag until the trainer was like hey okay I'll hold for you hmm and then once you actually find a trainer that wants to work with you then you kind of whatever their schedule is for you that they'll create it though you'll hold they'll hold pads you'll kick the bag you'll do push-ups we'll do sit-ups and then clinch 30 to 45 minutes after and it's the same thing every single day Wow and it do you ever worry that this might be something that would be monotonous because you're doing the same way every day or do you think we just concentrate on excellence you know I'll be it's also like going to the fights and there's so many different styles so like people are doing the same thing every day the repetition but the styles are completely different you know like nobody fights like Sancho right he does the same thing everybody else does but he has his own style yeah you know what I mean or some guys will do the same thing but they don't even like to kick or knee they just like to throw elbows I know plenty guys like that were they just like you know that when he goes he's just throwing elbows all five rounds yeah this guy's just gonna throw knees so it's just like which tools do you use depends like are you an ear are you a kicker are you an elbow guy you left cake are you a low kicker it's kind of like which which strikes are your thing and then you go watch the chaos and these guys are getting split open every night on the stretchers they take them stretchers on the ring man it's amazing it's like not to see someone get hurt but like just the fact that these guys are all out brawl in every night every single night there's a fight at the stadium Thursday nights or the nights that like the like the higher guys go and they're packed with people thousands of people like the one I went to there was a few thousand people there for the stadium it looked packed and everyone's betting like and then when the kicks land I'm like oh and the energy is crazy they never showed up man I'm getting hyped thinking about it how did Sancho figure out how to do more Thai different than anybody he's so interesting with his quick switches of the feet and like even the way he throws kicks is just sky like a little different flavors everything that I think he can help it you know what I mean there's just something about the guy's character it's just like his his fighting is him right you know like he's just he's kind of outgoing like this is a weird funky guy and it makes sense that he fights like that you know what I mean it's not like he's just like seriously Stern guy Lydon goes out of there and fights all crazy like he seems like his fighting is definitely an expression of himself he's so good man yeah he's so good I like watching him just warm up sneakers on outside sweating throwing elbows and knees and she's everything he's a bad motherfucker man and he's you know he's not young now I think he's in his 40s is he yeah really yeah I didn't can we look out of how old Sanjaya 38 38 oh he's getting there he's getting there but meanwhile I was in his prime still fighting people up all the times a month multiple times now have fight good luck dynamite this Instagram was awesome man and he's got these great videos of him warming up and you watch him him his movement man it's like wow look guys he's something special it takes a lot of fucking energy to move around it's the way he does - yeah I'm sure he still shows up to the gym every single day - I'm like holding pads for foreigners and all that stuff I stopped by a couch gym he wasn't there but I hear like there is look at that guy oh the fucking man right there he just posted a video the other day where this crazy wig go to see if you find a video of him there it is right there even how he did this kick it's different and I know different yeah like he doesn't really like turn all of his upper body like a lot of the ones I've seen right he's he's a volume guy but he knocks guys out with one shot - look at that catch yeah just instinctual you know like he didn't think about it didn't even flinch he's so direct up swipe it's interesting we think of how many different people are doing it and that this one guy stands out I love outliers man so that's one thing that I learned compared to like watching Muay Thai in the States and then going there the amount of kicks and knees that they're throwing hmm I'm looking at fighting like okay like when's the next punch gonna happen these guys throwing kick after cake after cake for five rounds I was like okay I'm definitely not kicking enough so I got to start kicking mmm so I'd say it like being in Thailand definitely helped me to learn the importance of kicking so we were talking about the shoot box style Rafael Cordeiro who is absolutely one of the best avatar striking coaches on the planet it's funny that he's such a nice guy and he trained the most murderous crew every Brazilian could not be nice they had Anderson Silva there Wanderlei and what Vandelay Shogun anyway look at that photo yeah dude that's a that's a fucking like Pele everybody yes that's right pay like two they were some that guy who talk I'm Michael Costa he was he was from that same that same group I really to this day do not understand why more times not more popular I've never understood it it's so exciting to watch yes I said if we had a league in America that people understood who the fighters were got to know him in root for him and see you know like you see with boxing with Terence Crawford you know he's like is that this he's prime right now yeah you know he's on top of the world I want to see a guy like that in my tie and I think it would be the same thing I think Americans would jump on board if they understood how exciting it is yeah you see a lot of you see a good handful of foreigners and Americans in Thailand to go watch rhino more Thai and I thought the same thing like man they got to get this what's missing Dana White has a good point he thinks that culturally we won't accept kickboxing after pka karate from like the 1980s I've never before my time for 90 it was guys would throw like these little kicks so they had to throw like eight kicks around you know and then they would have like a sloppy boxing match some of the time there's some really good guys that fought in there too like real high-level guys like penny jet or Kita's font PKA and you know a lot of like really really good strikers but it was it was nothing compelling about it yeah just wasn't it wasn't something that you wanted to watch all the time but if you could watch some of the best more Thai fights you've ever seen and you could watch them on television just like it show people on television some crazy wars that you and I have seen from the past like how could you not like that if you like striking how could you not like guys were experts in bone smashing dude that's why I have a lot of love to for like I'm a huge one championship in - I'm a huge one championship yeah I like what he's doing I like how he's mixing all three of them together - it's amazing because like you can literally go to a fight and see good MMA match okay through if you like grappling and fall and striking obviously and you can see legit Muay Thai fighters like my friends from the stadiums are fighting in Bangkok on the 10th so I'm like really like I can't wait cuz I really want to get there by the 10th to go see this one championship event in Bangkok wow that guy one of my friends like Pat Dan he's a he's a stadium like champion and he's fighting one championship again and it's like it's it's just sick - semen yeah I don't think people understand how big it is an Asian either there's a lot of American fans that are just really they're missing it yeah it's like Asia's version of the UFC it's gigantic you know I'm figure yeah yeah the numbers are insane and they got some fucking killers over there yes they got some legit killers yeah yeah that's like that guy nasty you can who just knocked out Eddie Alvarez yep that tiger dude that guy's legit yeah I remember to train with him at all no I would like alongside him I didn't personally train with them but I remember one day we were doing we were training and he was the last one on the mat and our wrestling coach Frank was like he's like he said something like 10 more sprawls in like you beat Eddie Alvarez or something the guys just grinded like he's just digging himself into the mat he it was it was cool to watch him prepare for that fight but there's there's guys like that they're like yeah he trains there all the time and he beat Eddie Alvarez like that's a big deal I think it's a big factor over there too that they don't cut wait I think that's a factor if you're used to being the bigger fighter all the time yeah and then also now you're not now no one's cutting any weight I mean they they have some sort of a system Ben Askren was explaining it to me I don't really remember how it works but there's some sort of a system where they stop you from white cutting yeah like they check your hydration check your hydration levels yep you got to be do it he's the right he's correct he's smart it's the right way to do it we should have done it a long time ago in the UFC I really think that all the weight cut issues all that stuff like ruining cards all that it would all be eliminated all right yes ruining cards and even more importantly I think causing fighters to fight it less than their full potential how many fighters got hit when they shouldn't have gotten hit because they if they were recovered completely if they didn't have to not recover completely but if they they didn't have to recover from a weight cut who knows maybe there's shots you ate because that you wouldn't have eaten Yeah right especially if you were some guys cut in a brutal amount of way it's entirely possible that you could get hit with something you wouldn't if you didn't have to cut way off there yeah right we gotta fight more often yeah the training would be a lot better too because we wouldn't like a lot of fighters spend in the last three weeks four weeks of the fight or their camp just trying to lose weight it's it's the terrible way approach of learning yeah building strength and all that stuff that you could do so I don't know I think it'd be awesome the only argument for it is that the guys are tough enough to do it and cut a shitload of weight have this massive size advantage and sometimes it allows them to win and they think they should be able to do it because they're tough enough to cut all that weight you know I get it I mean it does it's hard to do you have to be a strong person but I just don't think it's good for anybody I don't think it's good for the athletes I don't think it's good for the sport I don't think it's good for anybody it's just an old way it's just an old thing that people are doing so they don't have to fight the bigger people you know it's crazy because I have to answer that question a lot for people who don't like some of my friends are just like oh like they'll hit me up like hey I'm like I can't talk this week like I got a cut weight like it's not a good time I can't look how do you how do you lose 20 pounds in a day and why do you do that you know I'm just like right I don't know how to explain it it's just because that's what we do you know there's not really it's just what I have to do when you see certain fighters get on the scale though like Conor McGregor when he made 145 hast grazy looked like like a zombie man like a Walking Dead character yeah I was like holy shit man he looks like the Ice King yeah what's that know the winter king is what he called the the night came the night kick yeah the night king he did look like it like it but do you see him when he fought had when he fought named Nate yeah one so he look great you look great right right yeah there's a different definitely yeah I mean these Wow yeah look at that presents a knight oh he looks happy right there he's just like yeah I just yeah I just had a burger I know what to sleep good and it was the other one he's like yeah dude he's on death's door right there really only three months apart four months apart no wonder 2015 and March 2016 is that right yeah Wow Wow you know what's crazy too sometimes weight cutting messes up the mind too cuz you see yourself so shredded right at one point in your life and then like I can get maybe like five pounds I'm like a man I'm out of shape I got to get back in shape yeah you get accustomed to it yeah do you you'll never allow yourself to get back to 300 pounds again no never no I can't go down that road crazy transition though to go in a ten-year span from being a guy who's like really overweight and worried you're gonna die to being an elite UFC fighter yeah like life life for me is is happening now like this is kind of the beginning of everything for me you know it's it's really cool it's really cool what I'm glad that I found mixed martial arts just because it just it gives me it's a journey man it's not just UFC just like finding MMA and diving into different cultures and lifestyles and understandings and sometimes philosophies all this stuff just to understand just to put it all together just to have it all make sense at the end of the day like it's it's been a beautiful thing that been able to meet a lot of people go a lot of places like I'm very thankful and very just like like I'm okay with life you know it's all good here man that's a cool thing to hear I love hearing that you're cool with life yeah you're um you're on a great path man it's uh it's also what's inspiring about it for other people is your story of being at a place where you weren't like that before and their story of being overweight and smoking cigarettes and feeling like shit and then now you're like for so many people out there that gives people hope yeah that gives them a thought like maybe if I just figure this out I actually can't maybe life doesn't suck maybe it just sucks the way on living maybe if I could just figure out this path in a positive direction I can change everything I can I could be a happy I could be like you right now what was the exact quote I'm happy with me happy with life I'm happy with life yeah cool with life I'm happy with life that is a great quote mopes people don't get to that spot and know the crazy thing is - I didn't have this dream to be in the UFC I made a choice just go get healthy yeah yeah it was like you know a short just a short step in the right direction and I just what propelled you did take the first fight if you were just trying to get healthy ah a lot of encouragement and the first time really hearing people like being good at something that like I was like surrounded by fighters and guys who believed in me and like who cared and like wanted to see me get better and tougher and I was getting my ass kicked every day and that was something that wasn't used to just being in that environment I had at that time learning I had a very strong team like I started at Wanderlei school when he was still fighting so a lot of the guys that was like shoot the buck style it's like everyone's getting knocked out every training somebody gets knocked out really very hard and that was that was new for me to get in things like that and how they're doing that in Vegas oh yeah I mean I remember helping him get ready for the either it was like Brian Stann or Chris Leben and thrown full-on elbows in the cage no pad like we're going at it like my jaw was dislocated everything but it was just like what we learned was just always fight and Brazilian they Bull Honda every day Wow every day pull ha ha do ya think about that it definitely made me tough in the beginning now I realized that like I've only been doing this a short time and I already feel like aches and pains and stuff and I don't want it to be like that when I'm older so I'm a lot more smart about my training and do you think it was a critical aspect of your success though I needed gone through the fire like that I needed that because he was different guys you know what I was made of right being being a guy who's overweight and secure all these things never going on hikes or my dad passed away when I was younger like very young and so I never had my dad to encourage me to go throw a ball or anything play sports or be a man be a boy be a you know just be and I was always like kind of sheltered by my mom and she was more like protective like I don't go do that and she finally learned to just like set me free but I needed to know what I was made of man I mean I needed to know what I was made of in in the realm of Ament fighting whatever it took blood near sweat had the same thing that I say like I didn't know what that was like I never got a taste of it so going through it in a real way like actually getting my ass beat and having to find my way out of it and you can't run from it still like it's people that cared about me - it was like it was just a great thing to have and it now I enjoy it I enjoy really good hard fight something about it that's well you're you you're enjoying your progress - your change of who you are as a person you're strengthening how far into your training was were you like a hundred percent all in committed like that I think it was after my loss - Tyson Pedro which was my second fight in the UFC before everything was still kind of very fun in games and I was like all I get to travel go to Australia fight in Australia so it was a big shock to be in the UFC especially not even expecting to be there and within just a few years so after losing that fight is when I met my friend and at the time my strength and conditioning coach Lorenzo and he had been through like pararescue school and things like that so he helped me to just develop this mentality of like how far before your mind take you how big is your will and when training with him and doing kind of like pararescue survival training for conditioning that that was a that was a point where I started to like say like okay I'm gonna take this full-on I know I can fight hard but now I know how far my will can go in the face of the elements and everything so like putting those two together going after it and then the fight I took after that was Daniel jolly and then I ended that in the first round with Annie and then I thought Paul Craig in Scotland and I had the same mentality like I'm going forward I'm getting better I'm gonna grow stronger better harder like everything and then the fight to the polish guy Michael Alexei Jack have you seen him lately he's been he's been he just beat like John Volante and I forgot oh that's right yeah it was a body shot I lost it are I lost to him but then it got turned into a no contest so after that was a gokon sock you fight so it's been how to get you to no contest he test positive yeah I tested positive but I think he was also a last-minute last-minute fight I always fuck his name up Michael Alexei Alexei Chuck yeah it's a rough one at the weigh-ins I was butcher it terrible but someone who's fucking me yeah yeah yeah so when then like three or four years been and how many fights you have professionally uh okay what's my work eight and three a three and one that's funny do you know don't really know your record uh-hmm I don't remember eight three and one I think it's a three and one Wow yeah that's amazingly even fighting for a relatively short period of time and have achieved some pretty fucking spectacular results man do you have anybody in your past that was into martial arts do you is it in the family you know my brother's my brothers were both like just athletes at school and they were like they were always getting in like fights and stuff at school like I said I was non-confrontational so that was like they were the biggest fighters to me grow now are they stunned that your I now know my other brother is actually a fighter - he fought for like the World Series world series of fighting 125 belt and and a contender series things like that he's still fighting still training and then my oldest brother he he doesn't fight he's to play like college football and stuff but yes I got one brother so it's in the family a little bit at least a little bit what do you think about the world series of fighting that which became the professional fight now yeah giving away a million dollars to everybody who wins whatever they're respected weight classes right yeah and then you fight two times one night yeah yeah we kind of cool but I don't know two times in one night I don't want two times in one night sucks but I don't know if they get paid to show up and then or it's like you just fight and then hopefully you get that meal I don't want to see a guy who goes through a three round war fight a guy who knocked got in ten seconds yeah cuz there can happen it does happen that seems it seems so unfair did you see I thought Vinny mallesh was gonna take it that last I did too he's I remember Sayed a lot he's really coming to his own his striking is caught up with a lot of his grapple yeah and he's fantastic very dangerous I've never seen a guy that big that flexible he could do everything when it comes to jujitsu you ever see one need flying armbar paid upon oh no it's crazy look who the fuck does that no I was at that match the metamoris I think it was was it metamoris when he when he grapple with Kenan was that metamoris like him few years back maybe my for five years yeah Metamora city I thought it was although metamoris matchups he had some good ones but I forget all the matchups yeah those are good events huh yes yeah more huh I wish there was more of those but I mean I'm happy Eddie Bravo's sort of taken over that space with the EBI and combat jujitsu now have you seen that slap sir it's a great idea right it's nice to be a knight sometimes like you might be holding on but that slap and then that might cause a guy yeah that let go something changes the game there's things aren't available anymore you can't just allow yourself it's just too hard you could somebody like a vet somebody stops somebody Wagner Rocha stop somebody got on top mounted him just blasted him with palms to the head yeah it was pretty rough man it's like you it's almost like a look at that I mean you can do ground-and-pound and we learn from bas Rutten the way back in the pancrase days do you remember those days yeah bas Rutten figured out how to pull his hand back way further than other people and bas Rutten would smash guys with palm strikes he was throw him like uppercuts and hooks like he wasn't just like slash yeah these are really high level Jiu Jitsu to with smacks look at my uh yeah I've you know that guy's not used to getting slat up not by guy with a nasty card like Wagner Rocha can you tap from the slap yeah you can tap oh he's getting beat up Mike Beltran seen enough see once he starts dropping those palms down oh yeah it's bad for it yes a reality check you know it's a reality check about how dangerous this position is you can't really just sit and let a guy mount you do something desperate to get out of that but in jiu-jitsu if the guys just mounting you you can kind of chill out hey you're chilling out figuring out how to hit escape the leg or something out of that shit yeah combat you just you got to get the fuck out of there that's a terrible place to be yeah same they were like MMA right being mounted so exhibition would be hired well the difference between MMA grappling and regular grappling too used to always be with the one of the big ones at least I should say was leg locks they thought you really couldn't get away with leg locks in as much in MMA because as you're going for the legs you have two arms committed to the legs so we're just gonna punch you in the face and you don't have defense for it but now you've seen when guys like imanari burst on the scene and started ripping guy's knees apart you see how effective that is and then Paul Haris are you're long people look no no I don't like less scared of it it's they're scary huh yeah three knee operations and to reconstruct but I'd like do you like to watch oh yeah yeah like yeah a John Danaher yeah yeah dude he's so interesting Gordon Ryan and yeah you know yeah yeah I remember just like kind of looking into lady Cummings yeah those guys are savages Gary tone and their fucking people's legs up and you know and then Craig Jones and all these other guys that are all over the world that are leg lock specialist now they all these complex leg lock systems now yeah it's totally fuck up you go Zig when he should have zagged like when Brian Hall fought BJ Penn yeah right and he caught him in that I was like no not that way yeah yeah you're just trying to get out you tried to get out and Ryan Hall just locked it up I just imagine the feeling right now I always Debra Lee oh well it's once that stuff gets chewed up inside there that's the problem I mean some people could just take it but once you start ripping miniscus apart and cartilage apart once that stuff starts happening ligaments starts getting stretched out and rip a little bit and then they're always gonna be Wiggly so I mean even Gordon ride just ripped his fucking leg apart did he really yeah yeah he just had surgery I think he did it in an actual grappling match so I think his foot his leg moved weird and it just it popped his his knee apart but the guy had a hold on it I don't think so no no I think it was in a scramble I think it came apart in a scramble but there's a lot of those leg lock experts right now that scare the shit out and everything came from Dean Lister which is crazy d-lister see on the story no John Donahoe was talking to Dean list her and Dean Lister was talking about leg locks and John Danaher said something inquired about why you do leg locks and he goes why would you ignore 50% of the body and john donne heart being that fucking crazy wizard they're like why would you would you is all these memes there's a fucking hilarious meme of John Danaher in bed next to a woman and it says why would you ignore 40% 50% of the body yeah and then other guys yeah well Danaher is a guy who understands things like he sees them on a very complex level like he understands all the various possible exchanges and what's the best way to mitigate like stop the defense push the offense control the situation what is what is the ultimate control position I have to get to get on the inside do I grab it this way do I grab it and then they once they started really experimenting and putting it together and putting it into a system and you see how these guys who have only been doing jiu-jitsu for a few years like Nicky Ryan and Gordon Ryan they start tapping all these like really legit guys like what the fuck is happening yeah the more system that lock system everything huh mm-hmm I think that helps a lot just when it comes to training learning things in systems you know what I mean I think tent planet has like their own system right oh for sure it helps you go to another stage like it's the same yeah same system right deal all systems help yeah you know I mean and then fighters devise their own system really often you know have their own entries and their own ways of defending things but the leg lock game is so unexpected because I always thought they were a good technique if you can get it but it's not that high percentage in MMA that was kind of how I felt you didn't see too many of them I don't know why well I think it was we didn't we had a few guys that were really good in the early days like Oleg attacked our off and you know some other guys were really good but we didn't have the level that you have what like a Paul Haris yeah diving on things transitioning from one thing to the next and then locking you up in a position where you better tap quick because if you don't you're gonna be screaming do you think a lot of the times as those guys like the other guys fault or does he really just hold too long he definitely holds too long yeah he has there's one fight from Brazil where it's crazy he just not letting go he's just holding on to something I forget what it was but he was not letting going they were trying to separate it when he was still hanging on to it I think he came from a really really bad childhood okay and he's talked about it in depth about growing up on a farm and being forced to eat pig slop was pig slop but he was a little boy that cut that he has on his chest that big scar he sealed that up with glue yeah like crazy shit yeah actually I've met him before a few times like through yeah there's some friends and he seems like a cool guy yeah he does you know genuine I just think when he's in competition man he yeah he just doesn't want to let it go yeah he wants and they make him let it go and he tried even though he knew that they were gonna get mad at him if he didn't let go still in quite let go yeah and they like get the fuck out of here they kicked him out of the UFC the first guy ever to get kicked out of the UFC for holding on submissions oh he got kicked out yeah oh okay do you know who he held it against I don't know but I'm pretty I want to make sure that that's true I think it is that who some are Paul Harris was the first guy to ever get kicked out the UFC fault and I think the last one that I kicked out for was like any normal person wouldn't even got in trouble for that one yeah it was like normal I was like it may be a little bit too long but it was on that borderline edge but because it was him people like enough you know he's is that what it was it wasn't in the UFC but it was a controversial submission victory over Jake Shields at the world series of fighting ah yeah Jake Shields I think yeah but I think he did that too but that was a Kimura yeah that's right but I think before that he got kicked out of the UFC releasing 2013 Mike Pierce yes referee intervene that's right hook yep so that's what it was yeah okay that's what it was he was released after holding onto a heel hook of Mike Pierce in 2013 yeah but look man that guy was particularly scary when he fought because he was so strong and his body was so well designed for heel hook right he just could grab a hold of you and to rip your shit apart man look at that oh my God look at this oh no look what he does here see he grabs my dog he's tapping he's tapping he's still holding still hold but that's all in slow motion but it looked to me like he was still ripping at the knee apart even though he knew that the guy tapped yeah yeah he had it he knew he had it he's just punishing that guy you know he makes it scarier for other people and he's probably used to doing it you know he had this psychological block though they all said that he's like a really really nice guy yeah do you just become that guy that nobody wants to fight you can I'm on thank nobody but I think in the Jake Shields fight there was other shit that was happening to I think there was I poked I'm pretty sure he said dirty fight what are you here yeah what are we hearing there's something bleeding through into our microphones I've heard this before I've been trying to catch what it was ghost bro don't know what it's from it's some interference this is like so I don't know if the people can learn it can the people here I was no it was this what is what is it the firefight we just debunked ghost bro which fight wasn't the pool the UH that that fight that took you know yeah oh what do you guys near part yeah yeah he was the first guy to be like super scary and Ally modern level with heel hooks where did he start off do you know what promotion well he's a Minotauro guy okay so he came out of Brazil probably Cage Warriors I don't know man I don't know where where what he was fighting in in Brazil I remember Cage Warriors is the UK and yeah that's where Anderson came well yeah I understand when he made the jump from pride he did Cage Warriors for a while and then came over to the UFC and I think that's when he started working with the new garre's when he started fighting cage fighters also he fought in a bunch of fury FCS fought a bunch of stuff storm samurai 12 tum tum mai storm samurai 12 I want to teach hurt for storm samurai 12 throwback yeah real throwbacks yeah he had a great it goes to show you how good Gary tonin is as a submission grappling grappling match keep go back to his record there because I think that was listed there I think it turned out in a draw and Gary Tuchman is so much smaller than him draw yeah Gary tonin oh yeah that resit mm-hmm yeah what's that really 2016 I think it was because I remember no that was Craig Jones okay 2018 was Craig Jones yeah cuz I thought someone was posting pictures about like how he looks now Toki no he's got like he's got a half a dive like this big mustache now and he's off he looks like a thousand pounds yeah oh he's running through walls yeah is he fighting MMA any mores are you just doing grappling I think he might just be doing grappling I haven't heard any MMA news that's something extra scary about a guy fuck your knee up yeah you know what's up look at the size of him now look at them with hick Hickey monster holes you sorry I don't want to get my my heel caught in that armpit yeah look at those pit that picture above where you screaming look at that picture like what in the fuck man yeah okay Craig Jones just chill that is a body designed to rip your legs apart do you know the hill who came not enough to really play it but spent a little bit of time picking picking the brains and people who were getting them yeah I like it I enjoy it yeah I think I can I think I can actually pretty good at it it's like the basics of it seems pretty simple it's just a matter of like getting comfortable there because I feel like my knees are just I don't want to risk it let's play this game a little bit yeah but if I find a partner that's not an asshole just like really wants to learn together or whatever you know I'll do it I'll go after it do you ever see yourself doing jiu-jitsu matches or anything like that yeah I've only done maybe three in my life yeah yeah I did one my last you Jitsu competition was probably two years ago two and a half years ago Naga it's like it was a random just like a random like okay I'll do not go today well there are some MMA fighters that are at a high enough level of grappling that they can compete against really elite grapplers in jiu-jitsu matches yeah you know like Chad Mendes remember he had that that match with Jeff fuck one went blank on his name Jeff Glover Jeff Glover really yeah I didn't know that yeah I think he choked him out Thank You Chad Mendes choked out yeah Jeff Glover I think he took his back and tapped him yeah oh I think they were using the Eddie Bravo Invitational rules make sure that's true ah which you start on someone's back yeah you know in overtime and go to a certain distance is that the Chael Sonnen Schmidt it is it's Chael Sonnen 'z organization in which case I'm pretty sure they use the EBI rules so he got his back through sort of an one of those overtime positions but he still tapped him and the other one is Urijah Faber your I favor is pretty fucking elite pretty fucking elite like Gen Glover's of animals oh my god I love like a super super technical you know and very dangerous it relaxed right and Big Time stoner yeah so he they must have set him up on his back this doesn't show it it just shows him have the back man that's a hell of a fucking reneging right there that works all day on everybody even a Jeff Glover well that's why jujitsu works you know it'll fit your lead it'll work save your ass yeah three by over time submission so we're correct yeah yeah there's so there's a few guys but it's really hard to be the master of everything right that's for sure so for you is there a balance where you like am i spending enough time grappling am i spending enough time striking do you do you ever like wonder what the correct formula is or do you tinker with it at all I have wondered and I always wonder but I can't like so a long time ago maybe like a few years ago Anderson told me like listen just you need jujitsu like you need it and he's like it saved my life I love to strike too but when I learned you Jitsu it changed my life so you need to learn it put on Aggie let's roll like it right there in the living room you know and I was just like okay so one of the things that I learned from him is just he's like learn the basic stuff like learn the basic stuff get really good at it and then and then like use it to save yourself and you'll you'll end up growing he's like just keep training jiu-jitsu you don't need this whole crazy secret system at the moment just make sure that you're training jiu-jitsu and continue to learn jujitsu you know like so that's kind of my take away from the conversation so I just make sure that when I'm training at least I'm doing jiu-jitsu you know like I focus on it make sure that I'm getting better make sure that I'm going with guys that are way better than me so I'm always getting my ass kicked but at least I'm always going with guys that are better than me all the time and like I enjoy it but I'm a striker that's it like I enjoy it I know that I need it it's my job I know that it can get dangerous if I go against you know if I go against the guy was a high-level jiu-jitsu I know that I understand that and I'm very aware that every time that I train and so I make sure that I do my job and I go to jiu-jitsu class but I'm a striker and I'm always gonna be focused on that's always gonna be what like my go-to anybody whether it's a striker grappler I don't care I'm gonna train striking and I'm gonna train - Jitsu - but I'm going to my striking always do you think that that is like you're letting everybody know are you trying to trick people and then next next fight you're gonna shoot on folks I don't need to shoot I'll shoot if I need to like if I'm getting my ass kicked and I need to take a desperation shot but you would rather just let them know that you're coming out striking because one of the things I believe you do and you're very good but one of the things that's interesting about real high level MMA when you look at the guys who were bent who have been like legendarily is successful like George st. Pierre or Mighty Mouse two great examples one of the things is you never knew what the fuck they're gonna do to you and that overloading the mind with possibilities is a part of their success it's like how much of a part it's a good question do you think that there's an argument for using the skills that you have which are quite spectacular with that sort of style sort of style that incorporates way more takedowns way more takedown attempts way more faints just just different combinations of things so you never know what the fuck is happening at any given time or do you think that it's better to just be the best striker you can and that'll be enough you stopped those takedowns that'll be enough for me for just in general for you um I think for me it would be the best to just be the best striker did you enjoy it that much more I enjoy that much more you know I think yeah I enjoy that much more I still have a lot to learn a lot to grow so that it's always gonna get better I don't think that it's I don't think that's gonna get bad I'm still learning a lot especially what you guys got to see like a few weeks ago that's only the beginning like everything even before that was like non-existent compared to like the type of training I've been doing so I'm like I'm really excited so I'm like ah boy ties a lot more than just punch kicks and elbows you know and that's that's all the striking it's so you just so it's infatuated by it right now yeah I just want to focus on 100% yeah like there's guys like think about like Michael venom page right and like before he fought like Paul Daley I'm sure that guy trains a lot of grappling as well and it shows like if he gets in positions like he's knocked out guys from weird you know weird positions but when people watch him fight they want to see like they trust and his stand up they're like oh this guy's gonna do some crazy stuff yeah and I kind of want to be able to do the same thing not crazy like you know whirly stuff but when people watch me fight they know what to expect and that's just like bulletproof striking you know yeah that fight was very unexpected the way Paul dealer decide to take him down I was pretty stunned yeah I didn't think we're gonna see that I mean Paul Daley so dangerous his fucking left hook is one of the best in all of the business his left hand period anyway throws both of them knew what they were going up against so like you know even behind the shit-talk they knew like yeah it was a tough fight for both of them it was but it was interesting to me watching page use his distant and that crazy karate point style and that you know he had he had a really look out for that stuff I mean he had a head of make sure that he wasn't getting dinged by that stuff yeah well he's coming in with a like his venom throws all this wild stuff oh yeah like almost like a fencer like dives in on you and pops you and you could tell Paul Daley was like really having a hard time like finding that range yeah it's it's hard to to fight against guys that are long and know how to use their body like athletically is he fighting Douglas Leeman exes that's what's happening over in Bellator I remember seeing that Douglas Lima had a fight but I don't remember who the opponent was who's Michael venom page fighting find out that he's a spectacular though man right a that he landed on cyborgs holy shit he caved the man's head in its goal who's never seen that I've never seen razor just insane like he got hit with a meteor imagine the pain imagine man and he was hanging up headache sir been like for months he's like I'll be fighting again in four months and they were like bro yeah when that guy Brazil it's tough man yeah he's tough he's been around it that's why when you see a guy like that cover his face and then fall down like that oh it is Chandler versus pitbull Lima versus MVP that's it Douglas Lemus no 11 he's no joke that's a dangerous man Lima the opportunity he's a fucking enormous welterweight to Lima I've ever seen a fellow there's a big frame gorilla for 170 whoo cuts a lot of weight but he's so powerful when he gets in there dangerous fucking striker he was he's for real that to me is as interesting if not more interesting the Paul de Leeuw fight I want to see what happens yeah his Lima is a little different man like he's not he's not a trash talk a lot like he knows he's a dangerous guy yeah so does Michael it's gonna be a good one it's a real good one for sure yeah well fights like that really legitimize Bellator because these are fights that they could be easily be a main event in UFC that's how it was you know unquestionably that fight who venom page is he's a real fucking hard pill to swallow man figure that guy out who the fuck you bringing a train that can move like him no one you can try but yeah he doesn't even know how he's gonna move you know I think that guy just puts on music and just whatever happens happens yeah that's why this fight is so interesting because Lima is like way more like has just a rock-solid traditional stance you know he moves real well devastating power that's gonna be a really good fight where does leave a trade you know it's good question where's Douglas Lima train um James gonna find that out for us yeah I'm very happy that there's a bunch of good organizations like like one and you know like the PFL now in Bellator it's it's great that fighters have options super good yeah just it a lot of times to like I like to just watch whatever is going on you never know who you're gonna come across where is that mmm where is that American Top Team somewhere is it this is terrifying nasty combinations man he's got ruthless leg kicks two men ATT we're which one there's a bunch of those right there from top teams you might be ATT Florida I don't know is he it didn't look like the Florida but ATT how many att's are there I have no idea is there a bunch I should know that I had thinkable sleepers are training into or hungry Phuket Fight Club in I guess Thailand Oh real in this article right here those came out yesterday okay Fight Club maybe saw your fight it's like fuck it I'm gonna Thailand to bring everybody everybody Phuket fight huh wow he's been a lot of places recently mmm honestly nowadays my life as a camp Lima stated it's been like six or seven months and I haven't stopped trying to improve for me this is a lifestyle yeah it's the only thing that really bothers me the only thing that bothers me is that it's difficult to get a champion to fight a champion like a champion from the UFC champion from one or two fight a chance what's up with that I think that would be good for everybody that'd be so sick yeah it'll be good for we should find out who the fuck who's running shit exactly yeah I think that'd happen or how also how UFC fighters can do like Muay Thai fights on the side sure I would love that it'd be hard for them to do though because you'd have to justify it like what if they got hurt and they couldn't fight in a card and then the UFC like loses an asset you know they would think of it in terms of like a possible main event like player yeah if there's a guy who's top of the food chain dude and he says I want to say one more time fighting the terraces MCL and then six months later you're still not ready to fight but they should do it like if you're not it like if you're the top 15 you can't do it mmm yeah that's not about idea but like if you're not even right then yeah go ahead go crazy yeah gonna be a while before they'll let you do a Jiu Jitsu tournament though right jiu-jitsu fine yeah fucking dangerous too though yeah yeah you can go it's kind of like bars yeah yeah Michonne be cool shop father the other side Borg Brazil Ricardo Bru oh that guy yeah he's he was one of my jujitsu trainers at vanderley's yeah it was a beast yeah it's a big man yeah yeah and shock basically kept him away just pushed him away from him yeah yeah he didn't wanna get his legs ripped apart I think I remember that that might have been the time where shop was over at black house I think he was in it he was gonna go do that well his his point of view was like I have a fight I'm not gonna get my leg torn apart take me down do something you don't even do anything it's not worth and then later he did sit in as guard but he couldn't do anything to him mostly defensive he basically shut his his jujitsu down though I mean that he really did do that if you really stop and think about it I mean cyborg wanted to do something to me stall them out it's not a fun thing to watch and it's not good if you are cyborg yeah but if a guy could stall you out like that's a weird in a grappling situation that's a weird situation if someone just defenses you it just pushes you off never attacks just keeps pushing you off yeah what do you do what do you do yeah I mean in how much of your jiu-jitsu is based on someone that's willing to engage that's a problem with you said a problem when guys go to the ground oftentimes you'll see them almost not even securing a position just thinking this position will maintain this way because it isn't raining all the time because guys are just lying on top of you and you're in your guard instead of just jumping out of your guard going need a belly and smashing you in the face exactly think you can catch a little break because you do all the time in training you really see that with jiu-jitsu players sometimes you know they forget they have to hold on like especially guys that are used to train with the key and then then in an MMA fight and the guys on top of them and they think they're trying to set up an armbar or something like that and that people are just like no but I'm so jealous get out of the spot do so training gee yeah yeah yeah yeah where'd he trade jean-jacques yeah well last time I did it was two weeks ago three weeks ago I might have even more me and Russell Peters I've done it a couple of times he did in Malibu - he's a good dude man Jean Jacques Machado is awesome yeah I heard good things about him he's awesome couldn't be a nicer person and just really really tactical really good at breaking things down really good at explaining things the big gym it's a good size I know he'll get like 60 people there in a noon class sometime so it's packed yeah yeah is it in the heart of the city or one else in Tarzana oh yeah there's a bunch of Machado Gym still though I think I think they have one in Redondo hey it's me and Russell hmm but uh he's just got this just perfect basics perfect event I mean everything he does he's always in the perfect position his defense is always perfect like when you roll with a guy like that it's like wow so many levels this thing yeah like it just lets you know what it's just level after level he's never in danger ever never he's always laughing Oh Joe Hogan yeah exactly yeah you talked to the guy yeah sure a song yeah yeah hilarious man that character is one of most weird obscure like to think about it that it's a character he developed that's a fake Brazilian multiple time world champion but the dude who plays it is like he's legit he's a normal person he's at one of Eddie's black belts I think he got his bike but I'm pretty sure he did he's a really good grappler man really yeah but he pretends to be this guy oh not too low Raja yeah I remember I met him one time at EBI D he wouldn't come out of character yeah that was him we fucking gave me a hard time about James Brown or something I think I forgot it was a wee fucking weed but he's my friend I've been friends with him for a long time he's a great great guy in real life that's not that's character yeah it's just it's he's so committed to this character he's been doing this character for like ten fucking years what does he do it just like in public I'll fuck around with you probably bust out the character he's always on it's got to be fun though you gotta have the character yep some people got really mad at him though like Nate Diaz got legitimately mad at him was that at the at the booth yes like that yeah yeah something like that yeah yeah something happens all the video they kinda you know Nate was like get the fuck out of here bitch and he was like oh hey I'm just fucking around this is what in the hell bro is that his idea that you have to turn away because the girls but not necessarily he does have this character social where it's character hates child support and is always attracted but it's I always have March I mean it's a crazy character man it seems like something that someone would have on a television show or something yeah you know it's arts it's only for like only MMA people and jiu-jitsu people know about exactly Oh once you get it you go try to hit the streets with that joke they like what do you say it I'm almost positive he's a black belt and he's a very legit martial artist that's pretty cool yeah his dad was a karate instructor too he's a bad motherfucker he's a real martial artist it's funny is that that characters just so funny yeah I gotta meet him we can arrange that that's bullshit so what is next for you after this past fight what do they do they they give you some time to recover and then hit you with some options does your management contact the UFC how does it work yeah it could be management contacting them or just UFC reaching out just to see what I'll be ready but since the fight like I just took a little bit of time off to see the family it's been a while since I've seen them did they ever offer you like a short notice fight uh I've gotten offered a short notice fight before I got offered that oh my a long time ago I got offered that gustafson fight it was like long shot didn't think I was gonna get it but I was down I was like yeah I'll take it and it was like I think 10 days notice well seven days notice that the the one in LA mm-hmm but it didn't happen and then I offered to be the replacement for the fight and Sao Paulo that Eric and ER stepped in for blood against Thiago he it was either gonna be against him or manhwa who was the first who was supposed to fight first Thiago he was like someone pulled out of that card I'm not trying to that fight I don't pull out of it and then they offered me since I was already in Brazil but I think they needed a Brazilian to fill the card so I couldn't do it so yeah there's been times that I've been willing to step in short notice but for now I'm like if what I've learned in four months has been able to get me this far and a lot like in my last fight then I'm gonna go back and just get back to training so I can't be ready when they call me again so what do you anticipate how many times would you like to fight a year I want to fight at least two more times this year yeah so I've I've got to learn what works for me just based off the time put into this camp and kind of this new system that I can start to develop so now just get back start training it and then get into a fight camp so and like typically what do you like do you like eight weeks 12 weeks like what do you what do you need to provide think eight weeks is perfect yeah eight weeks is perfect I'll take six weeks four weeks feels kind of like yeah you know like everything's kind of got to be rushed but uh yeah I think six to eight weeks is perfect and what are you doing for recovery while you're out there you do Thai massage massages are so cheap like you get to our Thai massage for yourself you get to our Thai massage for maybe like 10 bucks Wow 2 hours full body like let's high elbows and feet everything that's amazing and then they do the ice baths but they put like big blocks of ice they don't put bags so there's a bunch of just ice baths and massages that's it stretching but uh I really I really want to do something down there like save some money and maybe get like recovery place going like what kind of recovery place I want to bring something down there I I didn't even I wasn't gonna get about this idea but whatever who cares um I think because there's so much stuff down there gyms CrossFit restaurants all that stuff I think the only thing that's lacking is a proper recovery cryo cold plunge mmm hot tub no massage just like speedy recovery you've been in the cryo right oh yeah man you can go after a hard session and go cryo and go take a nap and you'll feel pretty good yeah but the eyes good just getting out of it do you feel the same way from ice baths ah cold plunge yeah like I wanted the pie that was freezing cold I do a couple minutes in there and yeah the ice bath so in Thailand because the the bricks are so big it takes a long time to really like fill up and stuff so they don't get as cold so I think I would love to just to help out like help that little community and just get something really like really good in there for just recovery and have you know maybe some some type of smoothies or something to help you know boost everything up get the system running again so that we can train multiple times a day now do you do anything to monitor your heart rate or heart rate variability to see if you're over trained or under trained see how you're feeling uh yeah not as much as we did here at the UFC p.i but I do have a heart rate monitor and for this fight camp I use it only to make sure that I can get my weight down because I got up to like 235 and I did this like vo2 max test and I did all this stuff and this this clinic down there helped just understand when my body's burning fat so where to keep my heart rate and how to monitor like when I'm actually working hard enough to to lose the weight and it worked so it was good it's it's such a different world now with all these scientific inventions yeah different ways that they can make sure that your body's in a good space it's not guesswork anymore yeah make sure you're not over trained or 100% dealing the same time off the same time I was doing vo2 max they had a like EKG going on everything so I'm like running there making sure my heart's pump in my like lungs are functioning everything all in sync and they gave me this whole big printout of everything and everything seemed to be working perfectly so they were just like okay well in order to lose this much weight by this much this is what you need to be at and when your body's at the highest fat-burning stages when your body's at or when your heart rates out like 178 for me it was 170 a PPM's and so I did my best to push there just and I at least know when I'm there I'm burning the most fat so I'll try to get there and what response are you gonna try to not do that again as far as like get that hundred percent but getting getting that heavy too was like I had lost the Johnnie Walker fight got to Thailand Oh food sugar like all this stuff so I was just kind of like I don't know what I'm fighting again so but now I'm ready to be active that was a big part of my decision to go there too and stay there a year is I want to be active this year to two fights but training where do they have you ranked now I don't think I am you don't think you're ranked even top 15 no definitely not hmm what do you think you should do in terms of the next level of fight or your face like what what kind of guy would you like to fight oh man that's crazy I don't even ask myself those questions what do you do you just wait for the call yeah I usually just I wait for the call and whoever they they usually offer to they like two options really yeah like how do you choose Oh usually they offer like like the last time it was okay there's air kandar's or there's a guy like I didn't even know his name like this guy is gonna be new coming into the UFC and Eric Anders is like coming off a loss blah blah blah I'm like okay well sucks I know Eric all this stuff but I'd rather fight Eric because I've already lost three times to guys who are making their UFC debuts and it's just not good for me you know I mean like obviously they're tough they're hungry they're trying to get into the UFC it's gonna be a really tough fight and so that's kind of how I made the decision the last one I was like I don't want to take the risk of losing another fight to a guy who is making his debut because three times was enough for me guys were freshly honest yeah that's what yeah I mean it's like we were talking about earlier about boxers having managers that have a strategy to keep them undefeated as long as possible give them tests and have them decide like when's the right time to take this fight ones row you know what's what's the right thing to do and as a professional how much of an advantage is it to know what a guy does know who he is have seen him fight a bunch of times been around him yeah it's I just like just for instance like I fought gokhan Saki and then they offered me Johnny Walker and so like Johnny Walker was coming off contender series but still nobody knew like not even we knew we saw his highlights but we're like ow well like this look at the competition that he's faced right you know so we didn't really get to see much of what he was capable of so I'm like okay if that's all you got then I'll take the fight but then here comes Johnny Walker this like raging beast you know it'd be like the guy's huge so yeah it was just it was weird like so I went from beating gokhan Saki to losing Johnny Walker thank God Johnny Walker has been as good as he has and has made a name for himself but still like yeah I just didn't want to be like a I guess like a foot in or whatever what do they call it like a journeyman yeah not a journeyman but like when they say like you're trying to get like your foot in the door or something like that someone said it on Instagram I saw it like a few times but um yeah I just didn't want to like just be another guy that you know what could possibly give somebody their shot into the UFC I was like I'll let me fight a guy that's that's in the UFC this time well so now that you did and you had the fight with Eric Anderson you have the spectacular result and now you know people recognizing that you you've made some big improvement like what caliber fighter who who do you think would propel your career like what would be the best next step uh I mean definitely I think it's time for me to break somewhere into the top 15 you know for sure no nowhere and the guys that are at the very top because they're all kind of tied up they're all pretty tied up you know and I definitely think it'll be a while before I can actually fight Jones mm-hmm because just like how things are how things are laid out like I know it for sure Johnny walkers ranked and he's already kind of like in talks like he's the guy to beat John Jones so sure they're gonna try to set that up mmm right then there's like kind of this set of guys in the middle did Johnny Walker fuck his shoulder up when he was doing that worm thing supposedly supposedly but I think he's fine I think he's fine cuz I've had people call me like I just see this Johnny Walker guy down don't look like on the street every day I guess he's back in Thailand now mmm so he did that flop around thing and then he cookie when he got up he couldn't move his shoulder yeah so this gate is located or something I think that's what happened that's so incident you were you yes I was coming after right yeah I think I called it out like most like what's going on man yeah he's um I hope he doesn't didn't permanently injure his shoulder no I think he might be fine I hope so yeah he's not walking around in a sling or anything right now but he could have a little but yeah after your fight with him he's made quite an account of himself yeah that last fight with that flying knee was insane yeah so I'm sure I'm sure before I get to the top I'd have to fight him again right what's up Jim yeah I would imagine that he currently recuperating from shoulder surgery after dislocating shoulder surgery dude surgery that's never fucked up I've never known anybody to have shoulder surgery and come back like with a full fully RJ Ward did Jay Ward had shoulder surgery and came back better than ever but he's also got the best doctors sure took a long time two months from a comeback as what he says he hopes to fight their winner two months justesen anthony's telling smith he better take his time it isn't one of fuck his shoulder up forever you know if it rips again that's a great fight Anthony Smith and Gustafson that's a great fight and you know Anthony Smith account he really held his own like he made a good account of himself in that fight he didn't win the fight but you know he showed everybody how technically especially in that first round that was real good and sharp John's just patter just John's just better you know I mean for now he just has his number I mean in the Jon Jones you've seen now that John Jones it sort of has like a real goal in mind yeah yeah he's had taken away from him and he gave it back to him and now he knows he hasn't he's capitalizing on it it seems like it it's like he knows what it's like to be to be the best but not be able to to really like do anything about it right for a long amount of time yeah so I think it's I think it's pretty cool to be able to see this version of them and and to be active around this time maybe you know maybe I'll get a shot or maybe he'll still be around at the top like whenever I get my shot when how it goes if you had a timeline in your head of when you think you'd be ready to challenge for a title when do you think it would be uh I can give it another year yeah I think I can get one one more year year and a half of good solid fights in to really solidify myself and just in the UFC and and just put in the work and everything that that it that it takes to really embody what I think it would be like what I think it would take to be a chain being a successful champion not just like get the belt and lose it you know like mmm get the bell and then and then uh just be a champion for you know a couple months like known to actually be a champion and and and hold it down I think a little over a year well it's an unbelievably talent rich weight class right cuz the Cormier is still kind of in it John Jones is the champion you know he just got off the Anthony Smith fight Anthony Smith Gustafson Gustafson still a beast but no one is like really standing out as being like this person that everybody wants to see challenge for the title you've got worthy challengers they're good fights but there's no one that you're seeing them except Cormier was the only one yeah we've seen him versus John you're like whoo what the fuck is gonna happen here what's gonna happen here and that's what the division needs I think ya know definitely and that's something that that I can also see and that's something that I also want to do for myself I just I want to be the best version and I'm starting to find out what that's like especially like the happy like being able to do what I what I want to do and strike how I want to strike and stuff so now like let's get some some fights in there to mix it up yeah I really like tests that like test if it works test if that's really gonna be able to just to stay and in what it takes to get to get there you don't have made like I'm willing to test it like if they want to put me up against the best grappler in the world and think that I'll have no chance on the ground ok cool or if they want to put me against well they already did they thought I wouldn't stand a chance against coke on sake and like I was very happy for that because I go I'm like ok cool I get to test the best of my abilities like I think against a legend yeah I didn't like I knew that I had everything it took to beat him but I didn't think like ah he's gonna destroy me no never like so I I'm gonna continue to be tested it's interesting your approach because I wonder if the the fact that you were such a non-confrontational guy and you are really easygoing helps you in that you have like less conflict in your head I almost wonder because even the way you approach like these different matchups and everything you like you kind of put your ego aside you're looking at the leg what is the smart thing to do here the smart thing to do is not take this fight against this newcomer guy I've already lost a newcomer guys the smart thing is okay we realized that Thailand was extremely beneficial let's fucking move to Thailand oh yeah so you're doing all these like really really smart moves where you know you're you're looking at it very logically but you have confidence in yourself but you know you don't know like a braggy guy you know you're getting everything done with your work you know you're getting everything done with your results it's a it's interesting to see maybe because you want to see as many different kinds of fighters as possible and you're like a new kind of thing that's the most important thing though then like I don't I don't really tune in to much UFC and like what's going on because of that reason right I don't care about what people have to say in this hmm I don't watch fighting to hear what people have to say you know like I didn't fight and like it's it's not about talking it's about fighting right and the only thing that I can prove and have to prove is what I can do with my skills that's it you know so like if they put me like they put me against any type of other fighter like it let's go back to the roots of mixed martial arts let's go back to the roots of the UFC like when guys weren't even the same size and they were just matching up different martial arts let me down for that I mean I'd consider it and if it had to happen now like yeah I definitely think about it and I'd probably lean more towards doing it than saying no do you have guys trash talk to you mm like you're pretty easygoing guy easygoing it's it's nothing to my face it's always subtle if I ever hear about anybody saying something it's just through word of mouth and it was like yeah well but you never had like a Conor McGregor type incident where is only in the beginning with Paul Craig but oh yeah I think it was just it was just like his thing we've like we smash that beef you know yes good yeah but what do you think about trash-talking in this day and age because in many ways look honors an amazing fighter in his fighting skills what's made him such an international superstar but he also talks a mad shit and that helped him to because I'm so good at it it was funny he would say funny mean insulting shit it was fucking great 100% yeah but I think what people forget is I like that's always been Connor even when you go and and and and look at the the interviews from before he was in the UFC and he was just like coming to make a bunch of money and be all this and so of like he created that for himself and yeah he made a bunch of money from talking trash because he always had a plan that that's was that's what he was gonna do yeah and so I think people try to hop on it just to sell tickets or get money and sometimes it works it gets people wanted to watch and it gets your name up and stuff like that but that's not the time but name I want to make for myself like I don't like people talking trash to me so I'm not really gonna talk trash to anybody unless there's something that's really personal but if I don't know you and I don't care about you then I don't really consider it it's like why would I talk trash I don't even care about you it's a waste of energy it's a waste of theirs like I got so much other stuff to care about it yeah it's what's a very healthy look man I mean to the the way you're saying like I said healthy like I think I'd like to maintain a healthy heart and mind as much as possible dude it's like mental health is a real thing like this you know what I mean and especially like especially just having certain obligations and and just using social media and having people reach out and they say like oh ignore this ignore that happen it's like man like I'm it's hard to just ignore certain things you know I can still see things and so just that and condition of the world and just everything man being in multiple different countries and here in this news and that news and blah blah blah blah blah like for a person who like who wants to care about the world they're just genuinely cares like a lot can go on in my mind so I'm just like I don't even want that in my heart I'm just gonna do my best to kind of keep my own peace and come fight time I'll let it loose dude I like the way you live and you got a great approach I just wanna ban that's the happiness is important it is but it's a great message to men and to have it come from you a guy I loved those kind of stories where guys life was fall fucked up and you figured it out man and you put it together man tell me you're like nothing feels better than just like being fucking happy Yeah right like when you just when you're okay with your life okay with your your your your your heart your a birdie when you just feel like you know what I have no I haven't done anything wrong yeah I'm okay I like life is happening the way it is and I have not I don't have to think about did I fuck this person over they I do this like no everything is okay yeah so I welcome anything else like you know I'm in clear mind clear heart it's a very full thing it's a rare feat to achieve balance and balance is hard to maintain so it's like it takes a little bit of fighting it takes meditation it takes anger it takes it like yin and yang is the most beautiful thing ever man like that is life that is life it really is the opposite the balance of opposites constant the constant flow like that's why I love just reading like the daodejing and like just like Kundalini Yoga like all they've got cool like spiritual stuff I'm like yeah this is it like it just helps me to just kind of reach for this like this peace this light that's just that's awesome do you see the contradiction and reaching for that peace and light while you're smashing people yes and that's That's Life that's life man yeah that's life you know like you know feels like a battery right - in order for it to to give its power like it's gotta have the negative and positive like energies flowing through it and it's like I feel like a lot of the times people are too focused on one side like too much negative or too much positive and you need a good amount of both in order for like that that energy to spark so well said you're wise man I appreciate you man and thanks for coming on the show and I can't wait to do commentary for 20 fights again man it was really fun dad we had a good fucking time it was great thank you thank respect that was great man [Music]
