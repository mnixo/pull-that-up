nineteen goddamn shit you divorced for two hundred ninety-nine bucks Shaffer listening it's gonna be easy online yeah it's beautiful do it online you know it's it's very unfortunate divorce is very unfortunate but what's more unfortunate is a marriage exists it's more what's more in French for sure don't get me wrong you absolutely women should be compensated when they have children and I understand the idea of alimony I get what's going on no one should suffer and yeah I get that totally 100% but at what time do we just stop and go hey maybe it's not the best idea to just get your finances all fucking tangled up together where you want to break up and you can't break up cuz all your fucking credit cards and bank accounts are together and your own the house together or some crazy shit and you absorb her student loans and now your credits fucked and she has to deal with the facts your credits shit too because your car got repossessed and together you're just a fucking nightmare and then you have some some lawyers to take the extra third that they you know yeah we don't even end up with everything you know with a lot less than you expected in the first place I've seen it I've seen it happen I'm happily man but I got lucky example oh it happens with everybody its creeks people are fucking crazy me included we're all fucking crazy the idea that we can get locked into some nutty contract that says all right I'm not going anywhere you go anywher no sign here sometimes it works but that one third thing is the thing that Phil Hartman used to always say yeah and this is a guy whose wife wound up killing him this is what he used to always say it's not half it's a it's 2/3 cuz the lawyer gets a fucking third like he was he was sweating it hard did she did she do that but she killed him in his sleep but I mean and but I'm saying with the divorce or no they were still married but you know there's all sorts of rumors as to yeah why she was upset but she was obviously she was fucked up on some she was on zoloft and cocaine apparently allegedly it's quite even I think they got a payment from zoloft for that I think the family got money for it it's the whole thing is so fucking sad my point is it's not like that would have changed it that's that's a crazy person and drugs and all sorts of other things that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that I just wish it didn't have to be that people got crushed like that I've watched dudes go down and take a divorce hit that is like it just eats a year of your life and they were miserable for a year yeah it's so it's it's like any any like vicious separation like that is hard enough just emotionally but then the tag into it the fucking battle that people go through where they you know this fucking bitch she wants the house I'm not gonna fuck it give it to her you even like that house I don't ya fuck you know you see people get crazy yeah well you can adjust go zoom Kobe's wife took all

IT a human optimization website we gotta get in McCall's some supplements bitch I need some alpha brain gonna get you some alpha brain son have you ever tried it ever take four during the show people go for what the fuck yeah hey don't be a pussy you're gonna live forever you have any water form water stand if you ask me to take I do understand but this is good for you ready to dig we'll get you slides ready we'll have some delivered to you we also have hem force you would love that shit I have protein powder it's fuck delicious I'm a coffee man bulletproof I got it yeah I read something saying that that could be bad for you that I could possibly do heart attacks and shit like people are like looking at all the butter in the in the in the coffee and they're like um hey man that's probably not so good but I think they're probably discounting the difference and I wonder if they are between the body's absorption of grass-fed butter versus regular butter if you know you don't know what the fuck we're talking about there's a guy named Dave Asprey this like super eclectic genius dude who collects all sorts of information about human optimization he's a freak for this stuff and he runs the bulletproof exact command he came up with this idea for bulletproof coffee it's fucking genius it's grass-fed butter MCT oil which is medium triglyceride oil and is that what it's called is that what's called what the fuck is gonna blank MCT oil medium something whatever the fuck it is I don't know what look it's good for you you know what it is MCT oil is coconut oil but what they do is they spin it in a centrifuge and by spinning it in a centrifuge they can take out the most nutritious aspects of it medium chain triglycerides is what they're called and all that together mixed with the coffee somehow or another it has like a slow-release effect because you have all the calories with it because you have the calories of the butter any calories of the like really rich MCT oil and it's a slower release sort of coffee thing so that you don't have light like that massive crash leave you drink like black coffee and you have an empty stomach do you go for four shots before every training session do you four shots holy shit man have you ever tried doing it with bulletproof coffee no I'm just I'm literally was like when I was sitting in Brazil I was on the internet trying to buy it off of your back you would I think you would enjoy it man this is we have some of it right here do we have any shit drink at all if you want to try it don't try sit tricep yeah I don't have cooties try some just don't stick your time we sell we sell a lot of shit like that though at we do sell bulletproof coffee but we try to sell the most nutritious and interesting things that we can find like killer bee honey that's delicious right delicious stevia - no sugar Himalayan salt which is incredibly rich in minerals if you don't know about the benefits of natural salt if you think about any of these things whether it's the nootropics I always urge people to google it it's it's a very interesting and fascinating subject the subject of supplements themselves there's a lot of data you know from a lot of people that seem to suggest that people it's more important to have diet and that your diet is really where you get all your nutrients from which I agree that the body absorbs nutrients most certainly better from a rich diet and a healthy diet but it's also really good to supplement that's don't be crazy they're both good healthy vitamins are good healthy nutrients are good and in healthy amounts of vegetables green leafy vegetables that shit's so important can't stress that or no I don't sell vegetables but I always tell people you want to make your life better eat more vegetables bitch you're eating fucking cheeseburgers and empty food sheets perfect yeah but no supplements and I'm trying to get the response by EPS hey as long as you need perfect you don't need supplements quite honestly I think there's certain supplements that I would take regardless of my diet like shroom tech for for training or just to think things give you extra energy or melatonin if I want to sleep I would still take those things but I think that if you could eat like just nothing but organic vegetables and you're like all day and you you really ate healthy quantities of it you probably get enough nutrients you probably do but if you really do if you quantity though know the quantity yeah you'd have to eat massive quantities that's the thing yeah she's young though look at her and you're young you young people are vibrant they heal quicker my daughter's 3 she's like Wolverine she gets a scratch it's gone by the end of the day they just suck up inside their body you know they're just growing it she could eat cheeseburgers all day that's how young people get away with shitty diets and still amazing athletes you give a hyper body and my daughter's almost 2 and she I feel like she fall down a flight of stairs and then 5 seconds later she's doing jumping jacks I'm like well they're gonna have some supplements one day that to be able to do that you're gonna be able to rebound just like a little kid that's fucking for sure come on there's some crazy assholes right now just crack and all sorts of things about the human body back to Orange County every man every 56

all supplements all right Ian Macross here the Joe Rogan experience powerful in McCall Wow dude thank you so much for doing this man thank you for happily much requested by the underground forum yes the UGC TT my my loyal followers yeah what does that stand for the underground of creepy top to you and these these guys I've been there forever I've been on the underground since 2002 or 2001 I think but they made this themselves they called themselves the UGC PT to make kind of other all the other top teams in the way that that's why all the shirts have it on it that's why we don't make money off the shirts oh that's funny we just make it make enough to pay for it and then we give away tons of shirts I mean it's yeah that Underground's got a mind of its own yeah they could sway the opinion of yeah the sport adding itself yeah and it's it's funny how like these things sort of just sort of they just come out of nowhere on a forum and then it becomes like a meme and then it takes off like like on the underground it was always beep the homo detector like I always have beep like someone would some someone with this you could clearly see that some guys with troll for BBS but still it's very common if something happens some guys shirt off beep you know I had a long thread on that again for a while I never saw that what was it yeah the threat the threat of the the women that ever sleeping with know you had a thread with all the women you were sleeping with I didn't yeah that would seem like that could get you in trouble right there's no nudity oh no yeah but it was you know all that there was honestly it was a couple hot five a couple hundred on there anyway it was like a year long and it just got ugly and then you know some people coffee ously complain and threaten mean make it on there it's just there's stars over your parts it was it was at the time I probably feel like it was a better idea at the time yeah yeah I thought it would I this is before I was in the UFC this is before I was it was awhile ago I just I just thought I was cool so that's really all I'm only go to physical things everything else I suck at fighting and and women I'm alright at well the Underground has produced some of the most epic threads I've ever seen on message boards did you ever read the one with the the the guy who's the undefeated prison fighter oh my god Christian I believe his name is Christian Darrow and he went to jail super thick white dude yeah big white with a lot of tattoos yeah and he he wound up having a fight with this fuck what is his name Jane I goddamn it I got I got a I got a look up this guy's name the kid who fought him cuz the kid who fought him had some skills and just beat the shit out of this guy but it was it was weird watching it was like cuz this guy even trained and they might have not even have ever trained he might just be a crazy guy who lied and he talked himself into being the toughest man in to having an MMA fight when he really had no fucking business did they fight in prison James Furnari that's his name no no they fought in a gym this is a video of it there's a video of it online I need to shit on the dude but but sorry you suck sorry yeah come on I don't even know how we got into this subject I totally forgot epic threat so that's how I found out about this thread was from the underground there's ever read the girl like tried to lick my pooper Jesus Christ that thread is like a billion fucking pages long six months old of it it's crazy there's some threads that I have like subscribed that I'll check in on every couple of months you know if they have a podcast thread and you know every now and then I'll jump in they have a thread about the podcast I'll jump in and say yeah your people yeah they're nice people they look this the this amount of cunts in the world is is pretty high I love that word and when people are free to be whoever they are anonymously you're gonna get a lot of because that's the the root of all animosity is kunti behavior i got trolled in Brazil and I would just lost it on some guy cuz he was just he just there's only one word he said but it just pissed me off it's constant but it's you know what it is they're just trying to have fun a lot of times but just getting a rise out of you you got to realize that and but it's also just it's not a natural way to communicate to not be in front of someone like there's a lot of things that you'd say an email that you would never say in front like that's why people say I don't want to talk to I'm just gonna write your letters show you how I feel bitch stop it with your fucking letter don't make me read don't look at me and tell me what's going on like you tell me what's the problem and let's talk this out because that's the best way to communicate it's looking at each other looking at each other and actually saying what's on your mind you can't let things like build-up and yes she goes you're gonna explode and then dive you know doing something stupid yeah and things can swing like left or right like good or bad depending on how you react to a moment while you're in front of someone yeah and a lot of times you would apologize you'd go look I should have said that look I didn't mean it that way or look let's list this is where I'm coming from I don't you know that when you're looking at each other yeah but you write it down on an email you could just be completely self-indulgent and just filled with nonsense and you think just cuz it's someone wrote it down like it makes it really you know respect feelings and this then blah blah blah shut up you fucking you verbose yes don't have the ball getting clickety clack clickety - stop it talk stupid text messages you can hook up with me over text messages well that's horrible but if you are in a nightmare relationship it's probably a good move that's true like why be around them any more than you have to just go watch just pull cord Jewish hey I you know I've been thinking I gotta go and you're kind of crazy yeah unfortunately we've all run into crazy people and they've all run into us so there you go I I attracted crazy for 99% of my lives you did my friends you're you you're old school man understand that you're talking about Chris Brennan and Jeremy Williams and that's next generation right that's cool I started they'd like all right Matt Donnell started training mm am I so did I that's that's Brendan man he was like a early pioneer jujitsu guy he was like one of the first guys around LA to get really fucking good he was sick and then he comes words were nasty yeah yeah gang of setups too yeah a bunch of it and that that's that that was my that's what I took from him that was most of my game yeah he's a tough dude man really good jujitsu a lot of people slept on his jujitsu and then he went over to Japan but it was almost like on the tail end of his companding you know when he was over in Japan yeah he he wasn't able to really showcase how good he really was didn't you have a bunch of epic fights with Pat Miletich I know I mean didn't they have two fights do they have two fights they fought and wasn't UFC I remember he slept Joe Stevenson and UFC when Joe was like 16 oh yeah and he held on to it the triangle for to look at but it's only gonna knock out Antonia McKee - I was there that was bad oh that was a nanotech nasty kick Chris Benner was a bad motherfucker yeah well he's doing jiu-jitsu in Dallas now right yeah exactly he's out living out in Dallas he you know he just wanted to change the scenery so he took off and I was good for him I left for him that's a beautiful thing about having you know reputation having a name yeah you know in martial arts world like he does you could just start up for place places and people would be like hey fuckin Chris Braman just moved and that guy's awesome I mean he is a very very smart businessman could you jets a guy it's nasty fucking ears don't get crazy while lead Ishmael beers in the world but a VC his wife she's a beautiful cream I'm sure he's tough dude unlike that guy - it's nice guy he was training with Gerald's tree been who's a buddy me ya know Gerald gerald yeah you know a lot of dudes but career and and just old-school people man how did you start finding um I liked fist fighting I mean that was me and my boys thing in high school right we all we wanted the fist fight and it wasn't like and we you know we were in this stupid little gang the cops called us a gang but we were just a bunch of rich white kids who like to fistfight and I mean we're talking out of my friends that say 20 of us 18 of us trained and 10 of us had pro fights we're talking myself Shane del Rosario Robert Emerson Josh Smith oh my god you guys all went out looking for fine Justin Levin's said yeah imagine imagine yeah we've been pulled to parties and just push over a lantern I would because I was the smallest one I'd all right go you know hit on someone's girlfriend go steal CDs or something and then some big jock would be like what's up and then of course I'm not the guy to hide I want to jump in front and talk some shit like hey yeah and then they just kind of see everybody behind me and kind of go mmm like no okay then all the sudden I'm yeah I would you want to be that guy I was I don't know I had something to prove I was tiny I just and I liked fist fighting it wasn't like I wanted to you know drop somebody oh you weren't even thinking that you were like disturbing people's private lives and and in a week I understood that I was a kid I was a horrible child I literally was I spent most my life being a horrible person doing what made you realize that you were that I was a bad person yeah 20-some odd years of doing bad stuff and then just just trying to pull out of it constantly falling back into it trying to pull out of it falling back into it and now I have a kid and now I have for once in my life I have a positive female influence as far as dating goes and I mean it it helps me you know I don't I've literally done everything possible I think I'm a fucking psychopath would want to do but I've done just about everything you know I can't even think of besides you know having a man to enter me the night is young yeah you know but it does just saying it and I just you know now I got a kid in the career and I'm just trying to settle down and be a good boy yeah you're it's kind of a wild past for a dude who's like a top-level professional athlete you know people listening to this on the podcast you know without getting to know you better I'm like what the fuck is this guy one of the best fly weights on the planet I'm the best look dudes May on any given night in in the world of high-level mixed martial arts anybody could beat anybody yeah and I thought you'd be DJ in the first fight and then you guys well this is I think in correct me if you disagree I think that there has to be an element of the fight where when some one person is like doing something like really dominant to the other person that's gotta count for more yeah when a guy's got a guy's back like he had his back you know pounding on them that's got to count for more than just winning around all you know barely yeah like if a guy wins around with like strikes and ten more three more strikes or the next guy gets into a really good position and does significant damage that's not it's not the same point that's it's a different it doesn't make sense to me the way things are now I think that um you do know Doc Hamilton's I know yeah do you like that idea it's a half-point idea yeah I like to have pointed actually it makes I mean it just it did it sounds nice but we have people that have no business judging judging guys and then like literally let's let's say if I would have won that fight my I wouldn't have gone into some just horrible spiral out of control for the the next year of my UFC career right after my very first fight you know back to just being stupid and doing horrible things myself do you think you would have done that no no that's what I did how you did after me that's why I did you kick my ass the second time that's why Joe I didn't do anything to Joe when I could have I mean I should have done a lot better both guys said I could have finished them and then I just I just I had just a mental bad marriage it's all it was I don't want to get into it right right right now just in a bad place was a really bad place and wasn't performing and it's right we are all top-level athletes but I know I'm better than these guys it's just they were better that night they're better performers at this point I'm mentally and when it comes down to is is the mental aspect and you know I'll get back now I'm happy and I'm finally in a good place I think against Joe I was getting there but I wasn't quite there yet I mean physically I'll always be there you know but it's just for me mentally even in this last fight I did great you know but I think I still have steps to get back to where I know I can't be like when I became world champion it was just it just it was just better you know I was just training harder and longer and faster and everything I mean now I'm technically better I think but it's just getting my head there is still it's still a process but I'm I'm I'm almost there I guess so you you feel like you're a work in progress of course always always yeah if you feel like all this shit that's happened to you all this craziness and your life the mistakes you've made like in some ways surviving as many mistakes as you have like really creates a very fascinating person because the type of person has as many experiences as you it's a very it's a it's a magnetic thing to be around most people haven't had as many crazy fucked-up life experiences and have been you know professional cage fighters at the same time yeah and now I'm trying to now becoming a better person for once I'm trying to be that better person I'm trying to just show people like this is what this is what I've done I'm a walking because here what not to do right because most likely you're not gonna get back to where I am you know most likely you're either gonna become just a normal human being or you're gonna die you know like right we they're calm down yeah or you're gonna die yeah you figure it out on your own or you're on a bad path yeah and I think that for some reason I'm able to I've been able to do to do that and make get back to greatness and try and do something that no one really ever gets to do and that's fight in the Octagon you know very few percentage of people in the world that actually get will ever be able to do this so especially data your weight class man yeah you know that's really fucking technical weight class the DJ he keeps getting better too everywhere every time he fights man his last fight with Moraga was incredible yeah he's so good at like changing where the fight takes place yeah whether it's taking you down kicking you anything he's gonna punch you punch you anything's gonna kick you he's he is ever-evolving I make fun of him a lot I do you know because yeah he yeah exactly I got a guy gonna chip my shoulder cuz I thought I beat him and then he beat me up and plus I think he's a nerd but um but he's just such a nice guy was something wrong with you no no nothing wrong being murdered I just can't make fun of him cuz he beat me up on time right just let me do that but now he's the guy is he's at first people gave him so much guff because he just wasn't performing but now he's getting better he's getting the point where the strides he's making are making it actually exciting and they the adoring public is actually uh not being such a douche bags they're learning the sport and realizing that that's that's art right there ya know he's painting a fucking masterpiece you know especially compared to these big guys not to say that anything against big guys but we're doing a lot more than they are yeah it's well it's definitely a different game the the pace is faster it's more technical there's very little room for error yeah you know I key cotton Moraga and that guillotine there was no room it's just like just snatched it up you know it's it's really kind of an interesting difference between watching the the smallest weight class and watching the largest weight class the room for error it's incredible the gallery comes a lot big oh my god I mean if you've never seen a heavyweight that moves like like a flyweight you know it doesn't exist now it's a completely different experience watching the the lighter weight gaseous it's like you guys are like hummingbirds you're like moving it's such a faster pace you know it's it's I mean even their stuff to fight at that pace yeah I mean you gotta be on point because if you're one step behind I mean it's just a constant just like TJ got caught by Moraga big time on that fourth round it's a perfect example of that I mean DJ was not getting hit by anything he was just moving like a ghost he was in and out and when you thought he was coming in he was coming out I mean it was a beautiful performance and then boom it hits hard he hits hard you know it's hard but even the point is like you get any time it can come yeah any time a big one point clip you yeah that's the craziest thing about the sport isn't it yeah there's really nothing like that it's so rare in boxing for things to turn around out of nowhere with one shot it doesn't happen that often like later and you know in a fight when you see it in MMA that it can happen at any moment with those little gloves yeah it just slips right through that I bets people really don't get is that defense even having your defense has to be perfect yeah because those little gloves fit through the smallest holes and they made they make a they make those holes bigger it's not just like a boxing glove or it's a blunt object that's just kind of expanded yeah on impact you know yeah there's much less give yeah they slide through things yes especially they get all greased up sweaty up like the Todd Duffee Mike Russell fight is the fight that I always point to if you never saw that fight if you've never seen that fight it is one of what it's a historical MMA fight yeah they played that for young fighters this is what can happen this guy motherfucker looks like Superman rounds yeah the rear ounce of horrific beating broke his arm yeah Russell had a broken arm and then at a with no hint whatsoever that it was gonna take place before this it wasn't like he tagged him a couple of times it looked like you had him staggered a few times like he's coming back and hitting him he's getting just destroyed and plus it's it's Duffy is this is a physical specimen yeah that guy's huge and and might not so much yeah Mike is looks like he what he is is a Chicago cop he's a tough fuckin guy no doubt about it super tough fucking guy but that punch was like one of the quickest turn it was out of nowhere yeah it turned the whole fighter out bang he had him/her and boom he was out like what the hell yeah like how is that even possible I mean especially at that weight you know when when you have two guys that are 250 pounds hitting each other that hard I mean that that is frightening I'm terrified and I see where the heavyweight in you my roommate Chen del Rosario to see him move and he's fast he's very fast you know to really show how good he really is but man that guy can move and it's I mean it scares the crab at him he can hold pads for me that's how fast he is Wow and I mean I I'll go for you know 30 minutes straight yeah he moves really well and he set that weight of heavy weight where there's like a point of diminishing returns a lot of people believe if there's an argument about it bush and that argument is about like 240 but like anything bigger than like Cain Velasquez you get tired too easy yeah exactly you know but you know then but then for a while there was like people thought it was like when Brock Lesnar like first burst on the scene people like oh shit you got to get way bigger man that's what Frank yeah that way Geiger Carwin got way bigger those dudes got way bigger they're like fuck that dude look at gif is that's your game if your game is you know tuck your face in between your shoulders and plow board if that's your game and you better be built like that guy shines as Hulk smash people it's no no no no man doesn't work out so well yeah well it's when you watch a fight like Carwin versus Lester which is an all-time classic fight but you see how quick car when gas is out like to the point where he's dead it's laying one round within run room it's like you kid well first I think he said it was also that he was so fired up but so much adrenaline I couldn't believe he thought he was winning in fight was over said was gonna win the fight right there now and he was beating on him for a long time so I mean that's that's that's gonna take not just ten seconds if I thought I want it was yeah so I thought I want and he was sprinting yeah I mean it was two minutes of sprinting yeah and literally after it was over Brock survived he was done like he couldn't even get up out of his stool I was like his whole body like completely shut down it's crazy to watch yeah but you watch a body like that that's when you go okay how big is too big because that might be too big like you got a someone's gonna figure this out like scientifically yeah we got to figure out what it's I don't know anything about CrossFit but my roommate he runs RV sport for Ruka and he went to go sponsored guys and talk to some people and watch it and and I always thought concert guys are douche bags I don't know I just always hear him yelling and screaming I hear it's a play he's like no dude they're really positive they're cool guys and the the apparently like the perfect way for them is like 185 200 pounds is what they do and that's which is I don't even really know this shit way it's just stupid way I mean I don't see stupid like dumb I mean like crazy like holy shit I've seen this a little guy was like 165 pounds and he was doing cleans with I think it was cleans with a hundred and twenty pound kettlebell him so he's not a big guy he's doing this clean press over and over again but this was more than 100 pound kettlebells ridiculous whatever the fuck it was yeah he was doing it for reps although this is incredible I can we got that 200 we have multiple stones we have 125 pound stone and uh at my extreme conditioning place god damn you know roll all up in my legs and I can pop pop but it's just a stone it's just that's I think that's where I get my suplex but what they probably would help a lot man but I mean I can I can get up the to think it's 250 240 I can get that up and do it maybe five times but I mean it's it's it's getting it up and onto your lap is the hardest part I can explode probably 400 pounds off my hips as a professional athlete isn't it fascinating to see like how much things have changed as far as like the way they trained athletes the ideas behind it if you go back like if you're a student of the game and you go back just like 20-30 years like these like Angelo Dundee's you tell fighters to not live weights yeah they said telling a lot a lot of weights that it was gonna slow you down yeah they just didn't they just didn't know they didn't know well it does slow you down in that if you lift weights and you're sore the next day you're gonna be slower and then the coach was like I'd slowing you down but then Macke she'll stone comes along and trains Evander Holyfield to go up to heavyweight yeah and all sudden heavy he's like a real heavyweight yeah he was like 205 or something like that like not too big no but he was big enough and boy he was gosh I got fuckin oh oh my god was he jacked he was about 40 Holyfield how was he when he went up to heavyweight he started out as a cruiserweight right get it fought Dwight Khali that was like a 195 right that's Cruiser way and then when he went up to heavyweight was a Maki Schultz don't work with him it did right because he worked with which he worked with Spinks right yeah he worked with Michael Spinks when he was bulking Spinks up to be a heavyweight to fight Tyson and Larry Holmes that was when he burst into the scene he was like one of those first guys that was they were realizing back in the day like we have to do things a little different here can't just do curls Marinovich yes I mean that guy's insane how many and I've never had a run-in with him but all my friends have and all my coaches I did he errantly he's just very set in his ways I guess we'll say but I mean that he was an originator of so much crazy stuff I mean looking at son I mean that didn't turn out like it should have what a Saito was under a tremendous it for people who don't know the whole story I don't know his son's name because I'm not a football fan what is his son's name todd todd todd and there's a good documentary on it and Marinovich is like a crazy strength and fitness guy he's the guy who got BJ Penn in the best ever when BJ Penn fought Diego Sanchez and when he fought Sean Penn I think there was a two-time Sean Penn Christ yeah that's right why he fought Sean Sherk and it fought Diego and I think that BJ was like one of the best fighters that semi beat yeah that that's my the guy I've always looked up to the most because that was he was old school and people feet he made Joe Stephens and cry he beat a man up so bad that he was crying in the fucking corner BJ Penn was a motherfucker matic for a long time and that's the kind of fighter I want to I want to get myself to because when people need to fear people mm-hmm you know I want to be fucking feared because then people you know you beat him up and they cry in the corner that's that makes me feel well it's not I mean look what do you mean that's that's the path you're on you're on the path to excellence and the people fear the scariest most excellent fighters yeah I mean there's no really disguising what's the sports about exactly supports about victory it's about beating the other man it's about imposing your martial art skills and you really can't get great at that and not be scary as fuck it's part of the program not the most primal yes urges in us that that I you know I want to kill something to eat it with you know eat it my bare hands I wanted like you know I want to just be that you know King stink I want to be the head monkey you know I do I want to be able to do that do you think you have that extra bad from growing up small oh yeah because I always wanted to prove myself my parents especially my mom my aunt Lee my dad really cared but um because he always knew I was you know I was I could do it my mom wanted to show everybody else that I do every single sport and you're good at it oh wow cuz I was I was good at everything I mean how much do you weigh when you're in high school I wrestled 103 103 112 119 but I got into high school at 100 pounds Wow but then again I had been doing kung-fu sands through my whole life had a black belt in that which you don't compete it's I learned how and I was the bill Egan was my sent by my Sifu he was he just I was his protege and he's like I'm gonna teach you things that I don't teach up kids okay you have this red zone around you okay if they would get in within arm's length of you there a problem you need to hit them okay I got you know in a threatening manner and I got you know did I would punch kids in the throat elbows you know I was I learn arm you know arm bar kind of stuff back then kick jump kids you know in the face the groin like I got kicked out all the best private schools so it was always people fucking with you and you defending yourself against assholes or was you being an asshole sometimes um a lot of the time it started out as me wanting to beat up the bullies that's how it turned into me being like you know what fuck those guys I want to beat up every bully I see right and I did it you know like I got kicked out of my high school one year for beating up some cholo for picking on my friends mentally handicapped cousin bouncing them and I meet the shit I think what kind of a world is it where you get in trouble for that and what happened was I beat him up and then I felt someone grab me so of course I thought it wasn't one of his friends and I turned around and I swept the person on the ground it was one of the Proctor's one female Proctor's and oh I ran away oh you swept her and I just you know just kind of try to kid style sweep the leg yeah just turn around and like cuz I she grabbed me from you know one side and I put my my arm out on the chest and just swept the leg that's so dangerous to grab someone in the middle of a fight and she probably wouldn't even think that because it's probably not a violent person yeah she was super nice she just III had to be pulled out of school my coach pulled me out of school three out of the four years from freshman sophomore junior year because after wrestling season I was just so you needed the discipline of wrestling to keep you in check oh yeah that's the only that that I owe my life to a small group of people and resume my old wrestling coach is one of them and that that guy's saved me yeah isn't it it's an amazing thing how many people have been saved by the diversity that comes from something like that it's boxing or MMA or wrestling or jiu-jitsu for me it was Taekwondo yeah so you just needed something I needed some some form of discipline yeah something that can I can like enjoy and I can attack it and I can get really good at it and it gives me a calmness because most boys like people who are not boys don't remember it I guess when they get older and they or they forget because they have problems of their own they don't want to deal with it when you're like 15 16 years old you're fucking cry your body's bouncing around hormones our dick is is hard all the time and you're crazy and you're basically almost a man yeah and you're like thinking I'm kind of fucking almost a man and that was how beaten up guys that were no holiday Oh so I was I was you know I thought I was fucking super cool I was out stealing my dad's super eyes which we built you know either built super or quarter cars and I would steal those and he knows whatever you know I was living you know living in South Orange County and just just getting away with whatever I wanted my parents I was too fast for them so I you know that and they were going through their own stuff you know right so of course you know like I just was off on my own just being crazy and I mean I started smoking weed when I was like eight years old that's a good team start so yeah it's not six yeah that's a teammate sounds good and it wasn't like it was a bad influence you know it was just just happened and I mean I thought so crazy yeah so eight years old you're smoking weed god that's so crazy I'd go to school and kids be like oh my god my dad let me have a sip of beer and I like I drink a 40 and took four-foot bong rips there's all be good god how old are you you know going through like middle school or whatever and kids just didn't understand I'd be a private school and I wouldn't I never you know I was always know you know you don't you don't talk about stuff like that especially you don't get in trouble so of course I always kept my mouth shut but you know I was I was a degenerate at a young age you know it was just it was just in me to just I wanted to be the bad guy I wanted to have that fun and where do you think that came from when you think about it now when you're trying to be a calm guy and you head and you're your careers on track and you like reflect back to like your wildest shit like what I had you know I had a great upbringing I did this all to myself my parents are awesome people sure they went through a divorce but they don't turn let me stop me let me stop you right there because I think it's really difficult to understand or underestimate the negative impact that being bullied can have on a person yeah it's huge you know and people say like that it's it's not like being molested or abused and I say bullshit I say it's probably pretty close to a lot of guys yeah for I mean it's not it might not be the physical humiliation of someone forcing but the the physical intimidation aspect of it is terrifying and it changes your perception of reality when you're in around that person there's constant danger you're gonna get swatted you're gonna get pushed you're gonna get compromised it's a terrible terrible thing and it can fuck with people and it can turn people into depressed people who want to kill themselves because of that because they can't take the pain anymore yeah and people don't realize it when they're doing it I don't think I think you know they're probably bullied at home or you know someone bullied them and you know they're insecure they're beaten or whatever the fuck is so they go to school they just cont'd out on some little kid yeah but man I've seen it have devastating impacts yeah people I mean I exactly I mean you see it in high school and what I always did isn't in high school was I would pick on the boys I'd pick on the cool kids because because you know that the class president types I was I was just like I just like talking shit to losers it was fun yeah I had always had a big mouth I got pretty lucky with not getting the fuck beaten out of me in high school yeah we see the only time I ever got really beat up I think in street fights was because I was I'd pick my battles I know you know I know I can beat that guy up I'm small you know but like I would always try and test it but I got mean we used to go as groups me and my friends we would go beat up a bunch of skinheads in the next neighboring town like all the time right I got booted you know booted by those guys twice at Del Taco and went to the house party but you know it's you get beat up I get beat up on national TV now and it's not that bad but I mean when you're getting beat up I mean especially as a kid getting beat up by by a bully by someone in front of other people and that that like humiliated it's it's horrible and that's why I would always try and stick up for the kids again getting bullied and it's also at a time in your life when you're the most vulnerable it's really hard for you to really understand what's going on in life and you know people make a lot of terrible mistakes at those young ages and I think one of them is actually being a bully yeah you know I mean I think that that that kind of karma like pushing out in that direction you're a ten year old asshole yeah I want to punch you in the face yeah I I started getting into martial arts just because I was scared I just wanted people to be scared of me I don't wanna I didn't want to do anything like I wasn't I didn't want to start fights I just wanted everybody to be scared of me I wanted to be Wolverines you got the look yes yeah it's um it's a weird thing but the the interesting aspect of it is that I'm a huge MMA fan and I don't think you have MMA if you don't have bullies sure it's really kind of fucked up but one of the things I mean it's not everybody but goddamn a lot of them have been bullied like I don't know if Jon Jones been bullied but I do know that Jon Jones has a bigger brother and they used to go at it in the house all the time so like that's it's not bullied because it's not dangerous I mean it's like your brother but it's still like you got a fight all the time my brother used to beat the crap out of me my oldest brother Tom he was kind of a dick he was he was a bully but he's he's like 15 years older than me my brother Brad who fought professionally before there was anything you know I told you fuck man and stuff and he was 500 or five and one or six and one you said we trained a tenth planet no yeah I trained with Eddie at tenth and you attempt but we know we were at next generation and and are when we get mad at each other I mean we via the gym and I'm sure he you know he'd never probably really let me have it but he used to beat the crap out of me oh that was I was 15 and beat up by grown men by the crib and the Adam Linz and my brother Jeremy it's fucked man but that fucking sucks yeah it was horrible it was it was but it made me the fighter right now yeah but that's almost I mean on encouraging bullies and any stretch of the imagination but George st. Pierre was bullied yeah the greatest fighter of all time just one of the all-time greats oh yeah I don't know about Anderson Silva but I would like to know no wonder it was like that I mean he for sure was in a dangerous area growing up yeah it seems like those days like it's funny just like watching those old fights and those chutes the box guys would all come in like a gang yeah elders motherfuckers I mean fighting in like backyards don't come grass the concrete a stucco wall yeah those old school like when you go like you look at the the early days of Pride and you see like Wanderlei and and Shogun and ninja like goddamn they were scariest motherfuckers wild ass Brazilian dudes trying to step on your face oh yeah like China gen there's not a drug test to be had they were pretty open about it back then I mean I've I've heard things from you know yeah there they were like hey like guys guess what like we don't we don't test for steroids yeah well they tell you to get on him - I had a friend who they he was 170 and they wanted him to go to 185 we do steroids use that it's like what they were just like ready to go they were just going gangster I mean they you know in a lot of ways I was really happy that pride existed and yet it was as wild as it was because they put together shit that no one would ever sanction like Minotauro versus Bob Sapp yeah when Bob Sapp was 370 Plus like people don't realize that that's real he was 370 fucking pounds hong-man choi i bring in these just these oddities out here just like what that was that the big fat black guy from brazil zulu eno or whatever yeah i mean he could fake it fight but he was just they just see these well he was Zulus son yeah they see the Japanese see things differently they just see entertainment you know yes they see a black guy and they're like oh he's gotta be entertaining that's why he's here you know you get Quentin like I love him over there well Quentin also had some so anyways you know fights yeah I'm just saying they they just the Japanese they have the niche that they like and they just make it the weirdest craziest shit they can yeah anybody who complains about Quinton Rampage Jackson you are not an MMA fan if you complained about rampage I don't care where he's at now I don't care whatever stop go back and watch those pride fights and shut the fuck up because badass his fight with Kevin Randleman yeah incredible fight his fight with aronia Miz one of the highlight all-time slams in the history of MMA that's when he was with my coach Aoyama oh yeah yeah yeah rampage was a beast man Aoyama hadn't thrown more leg kicks yeah I'm doing a lot of different gangs then he's doing he became like a real power puncher after a while just you know I'm lucky I can still knock out anyone in the world if he catches anyone in the world there fuck's gonna sleep he has a murse that right hook that he hit Chuck Liddell with I'll never forget that hunch he did he ducked away yeah Chuck threw a left and he came over the top of the right but whatever it was I think chuck was pawn with his jab maybe he's trying to set up the right whatever was rampage hit him with either a think was a counter right hook baby I know they were circling I can see the camera you now I barely remember chucks one of my best friends so that's the missing great my brain you know but say I think they're circling left and then of course you know right they something he threw that right hook a new food that was rampage had that ridiculous one punch power that Wanderlei fides another example god damn he uncorked that left hook on the button they're going night-night you know nobody had ever done I mean cro cop he hit him out gang at times before they flatlined him he was a lighting Wanderlei up in that fight because the first time they fought it was an incredible fight but cro cop just really wasn't good on the ground you know he had to take down defense was he there very little very little and they had a strange rules fight where is like you could only stay on the ground for a little bit of time it's like short period some short period so cro cop would just lock him up in a guard yeah and try to hang on i don't know what rules they had it was a weird rule thing it was private but then in the second fight cro cop had had a few MMA fights and he got his Tommy down and that was when cro cop was cro cop he was that was a scary man me yeah again one of the scariest tools to ever against ever an MMA that he knocked out multiple people with and you know the thing about cro cop is I feel like UFC fans again don't appreciate the majesty that was cro cop now his prime we got him after a long career a hard career against phaidor and against Josh Barnett I mean he fought some fucking battles so when by the time we got him in the UFC he had been in quite a few like real real wood and think of all the heavyweight kickboxing fights he had yeah exactly yeah he fought a lot of k1 fights against the top guys high level high level guys that Mark Hunt fight it's a classic one man classic they had some wars in k1 man people had mean he was in the mix with some of the best fighters in the world over there you got you know you got the bun jockey and small small Alistair Peter a urates you know that the Tyrone Spong is like the the Dutch group of kick boxers the heavyweights are I mean these guys have like a hundred heavyweight fights 200 heavyweight fights I mean this is insane I mean you know someone my size okay you have 200 Thai fights in Thailand it still sit still pretty gnarly it's more than art it's crazy but I mean double the size and almost the same amount of fights I mean that's that's that's just that's completely yeah it's incredible I mean dude had 29 kickboxing fights on record on record and then 41 MMA fights god damn yeah yeah he had some great fucking k1 fights too man really funky you see he was one of the best guys to come over even though he wasn't one of the best k1 guys he was like just below the the elite of the elite like it wasn't just below like the grand prix winner yeah exactly before he did win a grand prix recently Yeah right it was in was the European one or something yeah something like that I'll find out give him the credit he deserves but when he when he came over he was he had that one thing that a lot of people didn't have ridiculous speed and explosion and he had like I think he had a karate background right correctly I first started I think he started like I'm sure that was a long like jean-claude Van Damme movies or something like down learn how to kick that way and then gunner something crazy like that I believe I believe that that's like how it got started I think he like it was a Jean Claude Van Damme fan and Ogata karate from that but his fucking kicks are so unusual like angle Oh be the speed is ridiculous I mean he's got I mean horse legs like things are huge so of course those those kicking you in the faces is gonna not feel good and he again I mean it was like he had that weight it was like you know 230 is 228 he said yeah 228 is what he like a the the average that he weighed when he was in his prime and it was just scary fast when I knocked out Bob Sapp yeah the SAP was three fucking seventy and Marco Crowe cup no you right-handed or left-handed it was straight left to the eye socket remember won't broke is that okay and then okay broke his eye socket boom I think he kicked him before that okay I mean I remember I kick to the body that yeah Bob sieving and find that CV good find crow cop versus Bob Sapp because that was one of crow cops best fights and he was it was a kickboxing fight yeah you know that was back when this was a guy Bob Sapp who had beaten Ernesto Hoost who most people think was the greatest ever or one of the top ten guys ever for sure yeah I shouldn't say the greatest ever like even Dutch guys say but it's kind of between him when he's in his prime or like Rob came in or or of course Ramon Decker's deckers gets the most credit because he fought the light ski exactly red diamond Decker's is fine miles look at this shit dude this is Bob Sapp versus Mirko Cro Cop Mirko is literally almost 200 pounds lighter that he's actually a hundred he's a probably no bullshit a hundred and fifty pounds lighter than him easily which is incredible and I mean he's he just sucks man and he's chasing cro cop around and he gets ahold of them and he like trying to rabbit punch turn a dirty box um he's wants to Club me to death he sees that big he just has to lay one on you and your Mirko was strong enough and fast enough to keep him off yeah which is the difference between his style and Ernesto who's thrown esto who's the better kickboxer look technically than Mirko oh yeah what makes Mirko so dangerous in MMA is that he's explosive and it'll dart in and blast you he'll take a chance yeah and do something wild where a guy legit with something hard yeah it's not ridiculous shit not just a feeler I mean that that's he wants to do yeah he would go after you oh I forgot he got ball clipped and got Paul clipped it looks like or something happen there very rarely do you get pokes in pride too there's another interesting thing fingers on ya fat fingers and apparently that the way it's designed it makes you curl your hand more keep it curled whereas the UFC ones do you feel that the UFC ones make your hands straight now I never thought about it I'll to check that out next time well they say that the pride ones were like curved they had like yeah yeah actually yeah they're actually bent curve where the UFC wounds are straight yeah and as you especially as a fight goes on you've relaxed your hands may be a little bit like that would be a time where the pride one would be better because it would keep him kind of curved Oh City hitting with a body shot there back that up I'm talking too much people who listen to this and watching this are getting two totally different experiences because uh I don't even know who has the C there's a body shot left kick to the body and straight left to the face Mirko Cro Cop was a fucking savage back then man he was one of the most dangerous guys as far as like sniper strikers yeah and then came into MMA and fought in Pride holy shit with those some great fights his knockouts in Pride are some of the all-time greatest highlight real head kick knockout series yeah ego of chance kaboom Alexander Emelianenko boom just blast and dudes with that head kick that Russian dude dos Carlos with the he came in with a Lucha Libre mask on head kick Brown he was training with Marco who asked for that fight and I remember thinking like dude this guy's good Oh because you know market was it was it was in our area and I had some friends that trained over there and I remember just like I would stop and every once in a while and I was just like man this guy's disguise this guy might might actually die in this one yeah he was amazing man Mirko when he at that level that's like when he was at its very best it was either before his challenging fade or ripe right after yeah it was somewhere in that area where was him chasing after fade oh I couldn't quite beat that guy you know that guy was the best at that time at that time you know still one of my all-time favorites especially now like now that you know you've had a chance to like look at his career in perspective because you know he's decided step back I've been watching some of his old fights like I've watched the best of Pride and you watch some of the crazy ones oh my god he was he was a risk-taking motherfucker man as a heavyweight champ a risk-taking motherfucker just he wanted to go in there and he wanted to finish you no matter what he wanted to and he wanted to just violently take just crush you and he would I mean it just seemed like he had that super killer instinct that I mean it's rare who was incredible yeah he was he was so aggressive and explosive and the yet unassuming yeah it was the weirdest thing 230 pounds yeah 20 pounds of not not buff at all almost like a chubby kid yeah not even a little buff and just like I mean he could move yeah that guy was fast and he hit with you know he hit like a had a brick and it was crazy because he really started off as a grappler yeah but somewhere along the line he became one of the scariest strikers in MMA and one of the guys who was the most successful striking like his fight with cro cop was basically a kickboxing fire they said the whole time yeah I mean there was a few exchanges on the ground where he was inside acro clubs guard but for the most part it was a kickboxing bout that he won yeah exactly yeah outset crow cop and he just kept cro cop backing up yeah kept coming forward and he's always dangerous you know and there was fights where he had to come back to like um the fight against Fujita where he got clipped but that fight did the chicken dance yeah I did the chicken dance and then you know 15 seconds later Fujita's out yeah yeah Randleman slammed him and then I just swept him and that Kimura that reverse armbar whatever it is that was beautiful and it was like the seconds after getting slammed on his head and one of the most ridiculous suplex has ever attempted in MMA yeah and Randleman if you never saw rhythm and fight Randleman was probably the biggest freak athlete to ever get in MMA I know that's like a big statement though that guy is a ball of of alpha of alpha yeah he is just I mean he could do things physically like a whole like the whole like the Hulk if the Hulk was real yeah that's him he would go into the Octagon before fights and do this thing where he would jump up in the air just to kind of freaking you out and he would literally jump to the top of the Octagon it was one of the weirdest thing you've ever seen your life but you couldn't believe a human could jump that high he's not not not that tall but wide and just long it's probably is he 511 or 6 feet tall maybe 511 I'd say and unbelievably muscular in his prime yeah I mean he was a superhero had a 26 inch waist he looked like Wolverine yeah like if Wolverine was a real person he had that build yeah and god damn that motherfucker could move Randleman would take guys down and take guys down with these powered doubles like launched them through the air like he was launching hundreds of pounds he was and then you know those big looping setup hooks that he would feel like he knocked out God with yeah Enoch he jumps from halfway across the ring Dilys explosiveness athleticism power speed off the charts but seemed like there was only bursts where he really applied himself you know yeah it's like that's one of the curses it seems like for like these ultra ultra talented guys it's like almost it comes to easy and it's almost like guys that have to I've always said like if you want to learn technique like Ivan who's like trying to learn jujitsu learn from a light guy yeah learn from a guy who a struggle and really learn how to do it correctly you learned from some Kevin Randleman type cat like that guy can do shit you can't do man like just so getting around that you're gonna do what came over you all day yeah just forget that it's we got to figure out another way to approach this because you guys are different with dealing with two different kinds of vehicles that guy's got a fucking Ferrari yeah he can do crazy shit you can't do that you got to think yeah for a spy aren't gonna let's it's weird that a lot of those guys that are like super ultra talented for whatever reason they don't achieve the same results that a lot of the guys that are like almost it's an uphill battle the entire whack but along the way they develop these incredible skills like like perfect example of a guy who had very few physical gifts and didn't even take care of his health was Jeremy horn yeah you know and Jeremy horn would eat shitty ass food and was never yolk didn't lift a weight in his life he had what 205 god damn Jeremy horn had a lot of fights and he very rarely got hurt yeah very rare he got Chuck the Chuck fight was like the only fight where he got hurt I was a bud that was sad it was a bludgeoning it was a different Chuck it was a different shock and Jeremy didn't belong in that wake now so there was already a weight class below that he should have been competing at 85 it was a money thing it was a hype thing you know well yeah I was like Chuck's first loss yeah it was a fun fight the first fight was interesting because Jeremy caught truck with an arm triangle from the bottom and put him to sleep which never happens it's so rare and if you know how fucking strong chocolate Dell is that's when that becomes really incredible yeah because chuck is a fucking savage he's a very big very very strong people don't know I was like in person I saw some of his greatest victories yeah like the Tito fights and cuz the babalu fights and just you could think of this so many of them back to the Randleman fight another great fight Chuck had a way of going after dude it's like the the first Tito knock out that fucking series of hammers he threw he was a terrifying guy man terrifying yeah especially for Tito that time just he dome knew yeah it was comin yeah it was coming he knew that it was only gonna get worse with no pads on yeah you know an Tito doesn't it doesn't like in hit and it he's just that kind of guy who you know maybe will break under that kind of pressure I think most people will but I mean he just he wilted pretty bad well it was just a terrible matchup for him at that time and I think Tito was already having some back problems yeah I think Tito's back had been fucking with him for a while I mean you got to think he had a real powerful style you know Tito had this really aggressive attacking style and the only fucking feed that bitch is you got to work it like that in the gym yeah you know and I'm sure if he fought the way he fought and if he if he trained for those kind of fights I bet his training was every bit as fucking brutal and that's an incredible amount of punishment for your body that's not my coach is the one who had him there and he just I mean that guy trained his ass off from what my coaches that Colin Yama yeah he Colin says that Colin's been around forever yeah he's super old-school I mean old-school respect my respect we got an old-school team man fuck yeah I mean to go from like Tito's early days ya know and the dude went hard man and I'll tell you what you know people I don't think Tito Ortiz gets enough respect people realize that during his era who was incredibly dominant even if he lost to Chuck Liddell or whoever he lost to during Tito's era when he was on top when he beat Evan Tanner when it when he slammed him and kod him rest in peace Evan Tanner yeah when you know when he beat Ken Shamrock and granted these are not the best fighters in the world at the time ken had already a long career and had a lot of damages ACLs were fucked up you know but he it doesn't matter Tito was fuckin dominated we don't even get his hands on you he was so so strong get you down with it but you know with clean wrestling and then hey Mike maybe he didn't punch out hard on the feet but when he got on top of you oh yeah oh man he was putting all of his weight in the elbows always waiting to the punches and I mean he was just on point that in my opinion he's like a pioneer of ground-and-pound oh yeah the guard definitely because he's one of the best at doing it inside the guard like who everybody I say like if I see someone doing a ground-and-pound thing in the guard I always think well this guy would do better if he would get out of this position yeah not Tito Tito would fucking smash guys from inside their guard and I think we learned a lot about horsepower in those fights yeah if you've got that kind of horsepower this certain is like most dudes have a 320 horsepower engine and you know if you're in there with a dude like Tito Tito is got a 500 horsepower engine okay and you're not gonna hold on with your legs yes not your sweaty-ass tired legs I'm not gonna keep that animal for fucking slamming elbows in your face but it's just that was his time and everybody's time is very limited in that sport of cool now yeah we all have a very limited shelf life and we're gonna go back yeah even TD I mean even chuck it was one of the most durable guys ever a certain point in time you had to be like you know that's that we're gone I mean that that that your body gives out that button gets pushed too much whatever it is yeah and it just you know one day you know maybe most of us want to go out on our shield you know so it's just how it ends and it's not that pretty it's not always pretty you know it's interesting the the volume of strikes that you guys deal with in the flyweight division it's gotta be higher than by far than any other division right if you ever has anybody ever compiled it and try to see like what the volume of strikes is that's a good someone do that on the ug someone someone figure that someone probably already has them on it numbers I gotta beat this probably dudes out there that remember the Rain Man of those things just stats weekends but I've just the amount of like actual beats that actual go on whether it's movement steps strikes landed and the accelerated aspect of that in comparison to maybe other weight classes where they don't move as much I wonder if that has an impact on you know your body getting to a certain point and just saying alright we're good yeah I landed the fourth-most Lake cakes in UFC history that's how long he told me in your last fight yeah 43 holy shit god damn bitch I'm gonna kick harder because if I lean 43 kick someone should not be walking I'm just thinking about 43 kicks that was just the body it was just the legs I got a couple of the body and coupled ahead of it I covered wait I Jeff I know you do listen I love your footwork to and your you're a fun guy to watch it's constant excitement and your last fight was fuckin badass I wish I was there was a lot of fun did you fight in Brazil is that where it was yeah once it what was that like oh man I love Brazil and I went out of my way to make the fans appreciate me and not hate me I was the only non-american on Brazilian they didn't get booed at weigh-ins oh that's beautiful and and you know and of course I knew I would get booted in the fight because there's right of course 15,000 20,000 angry percentage and that they where do they stay they the change you're gonna die whoo-hoo you know what I think though man undeniably you're one of the best fighters in the world thank you and undeniably they're mixed martial arts fans yeah those people when they see a top contender as weight class they appreciate there's a few guys that have said stupid shit like chill on it yeah she all sunny can't go too funny like if Jill ever like jails not the type to come to me for advice yeah but if he ever came to me for advice and he said hey Joe they're offering me a fight against the Brazil vitor belfort in Brazil do I go fuck no you don't go no don't eat the food toca and I'm not saying Brazilian people would poison you don't get me wrong but one of them might shit they're fucking they have a lot of pride you're the most intense fans and I like it I enjoy it I was chanting you're gonna die along with them how does it what is it the words to that again I think it's Vonda who've um vomit a it's ma rrh somewhere somewhere around there something like that yeah and they they just I mean even in Australia American fans you got to get your act together you guys you guys are half half really knowledgeable but quiet and the other loud to have for douchebags and are just drunk but like other other countries they might be douchebags but they're all doing it at once like you know they they they just become one giant entity of energy that's just going fucking crazy and god I love that shit man there's nothing like Brazil for that no nothing like it it's it's a really life-changing experience first of all they're there for the first fight an hour early exam an hour early the place is packed to the gills they're singing songs and shit I'm not joking right that's incredible you can hear it in the back and you're like wow they fucking passion and they're so successful if you look at Brazil in the international MMA scene I mean fucking across the board from the old days the very first one hoist Gracie to go over just all these different dudes that Anderson Shogun you know just all throughout the list Fabricio Werdum they're everywhere Wanderlei Silva of course you know Jesus Christ so many jiu-jitsu guys although so many there's so many and they're still coming they're coming more and more and more you've seen these guys from whether it's novo and Yao or you know all the different teams is there's a fucking gang of them over there yeah and we when we were down there I didn't get to see it but my coach and a few the guys went to go when the index gym to watch sparring and jiva got jiva my jujitsu coach jia with the armor collector santana yeah he got you know he liked the guy didn't like okay they just go super hard in the guy the guy hit him with like a spinning heel kick and hit him in the ribs and just like separated a rib or something or hurt him and and they're like man those guys they they're fighting yeah like they they are going they're trying to knock each other out like jacket ain't knock some dude out and woke him up and the guy kept sparring oh my god you know like they're there it's like and of course if you can survive that you're gonna survive a fight you know I mean that their dad they're tough their weight that they build a tougher product than I think anywhere else in the world do you think it's just the extreme poverty that's close by that you're getting a lot of like real intense like need to get the fuck out of there and elevate your position and this is an opportunity to become Anderson Silva exactly to be yeah baller to be Elvis Intercontinental baller you know by far I think that they see it and they know that that's where you know the humble beginnings they started at yeah so they see it and it just makes sense there's a straight path yeah a straight 1/2 there's no I mean there's there you just know where to go you know such a high level of competition there it's really interesting to say but you know what in America you could say the same thing there's such a high level of competition everywhere and mmm there is it's it's amazing it's an amazing time were you seeing a high level females yeah you know you're seeing like really high level MMA fights that are that are happening in female division they're gonna have to expand female divisions to the yeah we have a one of my training partners to grow my gym it's the Invicta champ Carlos Barza and I mean she is she's fucking badass she is I see her beat dudes up all the time and I mean she is fucking me yeah she's fucking but I mean like in the gym I've had I've had to crack her hard and just be like be like hey she's like stop it she's trying to kill you yeah like I told you once I told you twice if you do that again I'm gonna I'm going to drop you do you feel like you're a John Wayne movie when that should happen hey hasten I know you've been fucking up some dudes if you ain't fucking up me I'm not trying to fuck you up we're trying to go over technique Carla don't hit me that hard pop and hit her back she go I'm sorry okay well some people get really intense man they're really into it but that's you know obviously it's a style of training and some people disagree with it like to think that like to shoot box it up you're gonna punch a card too many times before you even get into it yeah into a ringer cage or head gear yes but does that really make an impact because they say that head gear even though you don't get cut is up as much you're still it's the impact on the brain the actual impact doesn't change it gets cushioned a bit yeah but it almost rattles you more that could be true I I don't know I just I just you know I'm no scientist yeah I have no idea I just it keeps it makes me think I'm protected yeah I'm so aware well it also do you do you practice training with guys you can trust do you like it anybody trained with a no we've got it we've got a tight-knit team it's a it's an interesting thing isn't it that MMA over like maybe the past like decade or so has really developed a way to professionally approach them yes whereas there was a lot of variation just ten years ago in training methods and a lot of people did a lot of stupid shit when we've got you know we bring in wrestlers you know I have we have the wrestling coach that bring in wrestlers the work of me I have the guys that on the team but then I also have guys that are just Muay Thai you know like Romeo Don Jose my you know he the guy's one of the best us kick boxers of all time you know and people don't know who he is he fights 115 pounds but he'll sleep at any heavyweight out there promise you the guy he's incredible what is his name again Romeo Danza and he's he gonna fight MMA or just ask no time he's he's just more Thai you know he's he said a bad string of luck the past couple fights but I mean he's just incredible and and but like I said that's not a high level more now guys - right yeah I've got the Muay Thai the wrestling the jujitsu and I work at all separate all what guys I trust it on my size and then we can combine it who's the mastermind your camp is it you and Colin do you work it out together it's just College just Colin jiva for the jujitsu and then um Romi fer for you know because he holds pads for me you know we'll go like literally will go like an hour straight holdin pads and then Romi Arum no rope no Romeo Dawn's Romeo Dawn's yeah Romeo's over at Millennium yeah yeah and then you have for wrestling off Sheldon Kim Romy's another old-school guy right yeah you know a hobby Vasquez old-school super old I mean he was motherfuckers right there he was a black belt that like what 16 and a long-ass time ago - and there's no black belts yeah yeah I never rolled with javi but javi rolled I said I roll a couple times at Jean Jacques in person and watch in jiu-jitsu jiu-jitsu is incredible he talks to you the whole time it's a constrictor and just tells you what's gonna happen and like in like a super like sometimes annoying way so good I'll show you after what he did but it's like dude oh my god you're so good it's crazy Eddie Bravo told me a hobby Vasquez story the first time I ever went to a tournament you saw javi he saw this dude running sprints up the stairs and he was like what the fuck who the hell's gonna have to fight this fucking guy and Eddie comes in there with flip flops on and can you just set up he's watching this fucking dude run sprints upstairs yeah I think he I think he lost a hobby twice I want to say you almost caught him at twister once but him and javi had some crazy battles yeah javis uh elite elite jujitsu guy it was very very rarely do there's there's black belts and then there's the super elite you know like like the javis or the jiva's or the or the you know the there's you know the B name off a million different Gracie's hobbies also a guy that he was pretty public about his his knee injury yeah you know he had a pretty fuckin serious knee injury and he lost his title yeah and um what the fuck was it that he fought god damn and I can see him right in front of me right now he fought in UFC as well that guy sorry hobby hobbies listen he's like what the fuck just look you guys how do you not remember bitch I can't remember there's not enough room alright there's a thing called I know Robert fought him Robert Steven BM I think I don't know that wasn't the fight I don't think no no Robert just stayed out of his guard yeah Robert fought a very smart fight again in Emerson oh yeah that was another guy who who who had incredible skill and could have been really Berto crane but but wasted it yeah he fought Alberto Creina blew out his ACL and then kept fucking fighting through the rest of the fight his shit was gone so his leg was buckling every time he tried to move everybody just mangling the inside of his knee while he did that and he just really always had problems with it after that you know he had so many problems with he's actually he got mad at me that I brought it up in a telecast once I didn't mean I mean he was he talked about it in and if yes I didn't think that I was like naming something that people weren't aware of but he I was saying that someone should kick his legs because he's had problems with his knees he was like that's kind of fucked up and I see his point it is getting fucked up but it's also what is the truth public knowledge it's not like you hide that and like you told me don't tell anybody but I fucked my knee coaches are already gonna have that fun yeah and I just I hate saying shit like that but it is what you should do yeah I mean it's like if you if you were fighting in a movie like Game of Thrones and there was like the noble choice no that's not noble to kick a guy's legs if his knees are problematic but with a fucking boa constrictor like that dude you got to take every advantage you can get anyway right yeah you got to just just try and put a chink in the armor somewhere so you know that the body doesn't move right if you can just start to hurt something yes man that I brought that up but and something I don't love you buddy yeah I love I do love that dude I was bummed out that he was mad at me but I get it I understand it yeah it's one of those weird things where like people have been upset at me if life I've done commentary on them losing and like spectacular fashion that like I sort of like emphasized it made it suck here then it even had to be yeah but it's kind of your job I know I don't but I don't mean to like everybody thinks it's you know or they suspect that it's personal you're getting away you have you get excited about doing your job that's that's a parent you know and yeah it's a weird job though you know yeah it's it's an especially weird job if you haven't done it you know it's like I'm doing commentary on MMA I know rad an MMA fight close I wasn't even thinking about it you know I almost thought Wesley Snipes but I was pretty sure he didn't know what he was doing but I was just gonna grab him I felt like I'm like hounds like I gotta keep me from grabbing him yeah what are you gonna do you're gonna be gonna be really slick yeah takes a long time solo we have a long time to dance I'll grab you I'm gonna grab you that's all I thought of I didn't think like I'll start fighting MMA you know so yeah to do commentary on a guy like Anderson Silva like who the fuck am I to say what you should do have zero credibility it's a ridiculous position for me to be in damn you you're just like the rest man no business being there it's true I have no business being there and ya got the rest I said the judges the refs have no right so the refs actually yeah for the most part I mean there's some mistakes like Maserati takes a lot of heat I think I think it's a fucking tough tough job you know it's a tough gig and I think there's excellent guys like in my opinion right now Big John McCarthy is always top of the eToys always that's the gold standard yeah and then there's Herb Dean who I think is right out there Josh Rosenthal that was Josh he was right up there man whose elite man I'm really bummed out about his legal situation he got I don't want to blow up his spot yeah whatever I don't need to talk about his legal problems B's a great guy wish that guy luck yeah me he's a good dude he just did something that's only illegal because the world is run by cuts yeah that's what firearm whatever great dude I love the guy and he's a great referee - yeah you can count on him like there's a few guys like you find out they're gonna be the referee go good this is gonna be a good fight you have say over who referees you're fine um I know I'm just waiting for the day that Kim wins I walked in i can just raise my hand and go hey this is not happening I think Kim does a pretty good job man I think she has a real hard time with big people though yeah you know it was her last fight with his to fucking Joe it was gonzaga and pee-wee Herman yeah I was like that is crazy yeah like that's dangerous for her yeah and for the fighters yeah she's like a hundred and twenty pounds maybe right and Gonzaga is 216 through 260 built like a fucking gorilla that someone took in a lab and merged with a human I mean when he like gets in front of the camera goes like I makes crazy faces and shit I mean saga looks like he's some crazy caveman was he just bothers me cuz she's made some bad choices and the fact that I don't want to hear a woman's voice in the game you just just pick again just just yapping at me while I'm fight trying to fight prepare for the feminists to be coming at you full bore especially feminist MMA fans and that's just me which are in the that's a huge huge market the UFC is gonna have to apologize for you now Barbie both in trouble right now shut our phones officer Danny can't text us dad fucking shut the internet down who call Vegas caller Enzo shut the internet down we're getting Ian are gonna get us in trouble it's funny man but I see how you would want definitely if you have that opinion about it whether it's a woman or a man yeah if you have an opinion about a referee that you don't think is good I would think that would be important to like make sure that's one less thing you have to think about they give you like a hard time about that is I'd look pretty easy to do I don't know I've never I've never had to complain about it so I know that's been in dispute in boxing matches like there's certain rest are slower to break things up and let guys fight out of clinches you know and then there's other reps that don't they don't tolerate gosh I've never I've never seen it happen in UFC so I don't know it's a good question I'm sure it's gonna have has happened and that they've taken care of I'm sherbert as has made it quick work of it you know that guy does his job well it's really it's an interesting situation and a lot of people don't even aware of that like people go what is UFC fixed you fucking judging they can't do anything yeah it's it's the state athletic commissions that control all the judging exactly it's getting better I think sometimes sometimes the things getting better right now that a fight comes along and you're like wait what you know come on man like there's some shit you guys are not taking into consideration here yeah you know there's there's a few fights where you just go man I'm missing something here I don't get how that was what did you see that I didn't see or not so I'm just I really believe this and it sounds like stupid bullshit but I think that they should consider having a one extra vote and one extra judge and that one extra judge should be the Internet that's what I think I think you should allow fans to register and vote and allow them to like you could rate someone yeah who judges the way you rate a Yelp account like are this food tastes like ass yeah like all this got judges like shit and then you get a few red flags if you made some questionable decisions and then you get removed from the queue yeah and you can't judge anymore or you can't judge high-level fights or you have to prove yourself or whatever the fuck you got to do but I think having that as a fourth judging and the fourth option maybe even coming to it if it's a closed disputed decision yeah if it's closed let's go to the internet judge let's see what that was and then you know take that into consideration or or what I mean I don't know how you would factor it in what would be most valuable whether it's the in-person judges or the internet judge yeah because it's a different experience not being there as well maybe give them half a point yeah like is that does that make sense that it's a different experience watching it cage sight as it is watching it on television and it almost wouldn't be fair if they only watch it on television it's completely different yeah because there's so much your condition what you can't see your judges have screens in front of them don't they yeah and you can they do have screens if they want to catch angles they do now it's something that we complained about for a long fucking time before they finally gave in and giving them screens because there's certain angles where if someone if I'm on inside the cage and there's a ground fight going on the exact opposite side of the cage I can't see what's going on if a guy has his back to me and the other guy has I don't know what he's I have to see him on it's the only way to see it exactly so finally judges get to see that because for the longest time some of the questionable decisions could be boiled down to that like that you didn't get a good angle to see exactly what was happening the whole time so in a close like ten nine sort of a situation where it could go either way there's a lot of fights where it could kind of go either way yeah well after the round was over like fuck they have to choose a winner here yeah and I would how I mean how much do you do refs judges go off punched at so they know them right away I don't think they know them at all no that's the kind of thing that needs to get figured out like we have them I know but I'm saying that that they right they should want that information to judge a fight I don't think they get it I'm pretty sure they don't get it so like when we're what I think that could influence them yeah yeah but I think that's why they don't get it I need to find that out for sure I should ask my dog Mike Goldberg I'll text him that's how strong this is while this is going on if they don't know the numbers and that's that's bullshit because they need to know they need to see those numbers yeah yeah it seems like that would be something just like the just like the monitors that would be a no-brainer but it's hard man it's hard to get change change is fucking hard you know especially when it's run by the state yes and that's what people need to understand it's not this is not as simple as like the UFC needs to implement the know you're dealing with a whole bureaucracy you're dealing with people that don't want to lose their jobs you're dealing with it's really tough to fire people because it's a government gig yes it's not the same yeah you know and that's part of it like there's a lot of people that are judges that I like as human beings I always say hi to them they're very nice people I just don't think they're qualified to do what they're doing and I think I think there should be and look at them and see that yeah yeah there should be some sort of some sort of like absolute baseline knowledge that you have to have had you have to have some experience in some sort of combat sport exactly III think that fighters or judges should have been fighters with so many fights it's a good idea you know or or at least hire a stand-up judge wrestling judge and you know and a granite ridge it's a judge or you know some sort of and then have a fourth anime I don't know just they didn't need to figure out something because everyone has to have knowledge and I think the entire sport instead of just one facet of it yeah I think you're right too but man if you had just two Jitsu judges those motherfuckers would be so by every five judges so what's winning my friend he said like wow they he didn't know he can posses God my friend you know we disagree everybody there were so many Brazilians were mad when Hodja Gracie got cut yeah they're fucking legend so good one more fight for twelve five mr. Dana White they're like they all wanted him you know they're so loyal they and like a name like Gracie yeah you know that shit's that's his royalty in UNIX martial arts as you get fuck Prince Charles alright that's real royalty the Gracie name is Royals it is so when Dana cut Roger Gracie it's like Jesus yeah what how dare you he's a dude that I don't think should be fighting in 185 I look at Hodja and he's so big he's so tall and it is murder for that motherfucker make 185 I saw his like what he looked like after he'd wade in like Jesus that dude I mean that is really hardcore weight cutting that guys doing yeah he's a big boy fuck yeah yes man the weight cutting is yeah he's big dude when you're around him you like how does that guy weigh 185 how is that even possible I see I see a lot of guys like that at every weight yeah that is just like wow yeah no one better exemplifies it then who GSP is pretty Anthony Rumble Johnson yeah he's I mean he made one well we barely made one who said 170 but now he's fighting in heavyweight yeah it's okay he's beating guys are laughs key you missed you missed weight at 70 so they kicked out of 70 they kicked you out of a weight class which I don't knew that was possible then you miss weight at the next higher for the 15 pounds higher weight class by 12 pounds so you miss your original weight by 27 pounds you're just being an asshole now yeah I met him in between fights once is back when he was one of the scariest guys in the walther weight division he was just coming up he had knocked out Tommy Burns okay and remember that fight yeah Bruce Lewis fight man he was absolutely brutal Tommy was coming off the Ultimate Fighter and he was there's moments in fighter's careers where they just appear like oh my god this is the motherfucker right here and he was one of them in that moment when he burst on the scene and knocked out that Tommy Byrnes he that was like his coming out party I was like this kid is fucking powerful that's what it was I mean he he went after people and he just just physically just crushed benny was so big for 170 didn't even make sense now I met him in between fights he was at one of the fingers in Denver came down and he wasn't competing so he was giant yeah I go what are you weigh and he goes I'm about two thirty two twenty to thirty like how much Weiss it was huge he's fucking gigantic I mean it's it's 60 pound weight cut and he's built like a heavyweight - yeah huge I mean he be like look like a what didn't look like man you shouldn't be fighting heavyweight it was like yeah you could be a heavyweight how the fuck did you get 170 because he's tall - it's not like he's a short super thick guy he's just a big man yeah that's that's just got to be unbelievably bad for your body it's just got to be unbelievably bad for your body when you have that nutty seesaw right yeah I honestly probably think it takes a year or two off your life every time you do it I mean it's like I cut the most I've ever cut was 18.8 and last 20 hours it's a different thing for you though - because of the percentage of your body weight oh yeah as opposed to like a guy like Johnson who's 56 pounds heavier but I'm saying I was in Florida oh my god when I fought deep dmitritch the second time I cut 18.8 pounds the last 18 or last 20 hours I don't even know what I was before that was I just I was just that that one was really screwed me up but when you go to a place like Florida how much time do you spend adjusting to the moisture in the air and the change in the environment I don't I mean I don't need it doesn't bother me what about altitude if you have to fight it like Denver I've never fought in high altitude before Wow but I mean that would be a wild place to watch some fucking flyweight jeez man because heavyweights in Denver are crazy like every time you have a heavyweight fight in Denver it's like these poor fucking guys just got drugged and pushed into a cage you got a fucking dark neck man people don't understand man if you've never been to Denver that shit is up there yeah that's a mile-high City legit and the people that live there have more endurance than you yeah if you get used to that too like that's why those guys train in Albuquerque nobody goes Big Bear when you get used to that shit it makes your body like super enriched with oxygen and red blood cells you have all this endurance well that's it but my girlfriend outside she lives in Reno is always in Tahoe oh so you're always up there high and then she's always she got hit more but but you'd go up there to Train uh no no I'm going to start you know more except because she's up there and I've actually genuinely liked this one so I would think that for a guy like you like there'd be a real benefit in training at a place like Big Bear well I don't make enough money right just to pay for a camp you know and I do do see back which is that I don't know if you've ever yeah no it's he back yet explain that though for it is let me try and be still the tent like BJ has know that whatever the sleeping bag it's an egg egg you sit in and you're like you're sitting in a recliner and basically it's it does the elevation but it's it's changes to temperature density of air elevation of a few few different things where it makes your body at a cellular level flex and expel all the bad stuff and you're just ready to suck in you feel amazing like you'll shoot from from sea level up to 25,000 feet within 20 seconds and then shoot back down and then up and they do this rhythmic stuff to it and you have to do breathing exercises and it um I I mean why am I only hearing about this for the first time right now I'm so excited I was the first real fighter to start doing and now I mean you got a lot of guys are doing at Newport Beach I mean this is some i ball i okay it was your call see back look up meanwhile cut to ten months from now Joe Rogan caught up in a scent Newport Beach hoax ever I got tricked into going into a fucking egg yes see there's I get totally hoaxes 'red and I love it man how do you say it again see back season yeah I don't know BAC and it's I go to a scent Newport Beach and it I mean it's I'll do 20 minute sessions I'll do three of them and I just pound I pound out you know water like this for the good you know nine point five pH or whatever I'm in there and it just I feel amazing that I do breathing exercises while I'm in there so I'll hold my breath and what it does is when you shoot up in elevation you're already full of oxygen and dude it stretches your lungs like I've it's if there's no other way to get this feeling that I've ever I mean felt it literally stretches your lungs out at you and then breathe again and see that what sivak Newport Beach just Google yeah Google sea back or sea back ascent a sea am i spelling it right SCA no it's just a separate ascent yes what's up a scent see back Newport Beach a sense evac what am I am i spelling it right se a VA see ya but nobody backs just one see the letter c SC o c and then vac that's yeah okay Oh si vac okay see vac Newport Beach okay see VA see that's what it is so it stands for something what does it stand for I have no idea a Scentsy vac but yeah I mean it's it's something that wants been around for it's been around for a while powerful five-star review on Yelp they've just uh yelps amazing they've just started it really catered toward to athletes more Tito goes I've been going for a while now well Wow so what is the process how does the has the actual thing you killed your body you go in and you sit in the pod and then as it as you you build up there's different levels the fluctuations in the pressure the temperature the the elevation you know the the density of the air it just makes your body just heal faster you get rid of swelling I mean it did it has a list of stuff I mean you read on there what it does yeah I can't really put my finger on it it just makes me feel amazing it makes my cardio Gotha sounds like walls magnet bracelets son hop on check it out cycle variations in adaptive control conditioning okay that's what they're calling it building the new super athlete Men's Journal calm and it's in in this it work it works for me I believe you dude I'm only fucking with you respect just joking but what they're saying is this uh this is called the power it's a an article that's in Men's Journal magazine and the article is building the new super athlete and the first sentence is the power of the pod and it says Heather Henniker owns and runs what could be considered a gym of the future in Newport Beach California the machine does all the work at her assent facility the training consists of showing up and settling into one of her three stationary cv AC pods for a 20-minute session the air pressure inside will yoyo which means sea level at about twenty two thousand five hundred feet with two hundred to four hundred pressure changes in between when you hit maximum altitude or rather the air pressure equivalent you take a rapid nosedive back to earth akin to racing up to the top of the unka gaga i don't know what that is uncle uncle ACON CA g ua why did you have to be so obscure crazy person you couldn't say everest heather fuckhead Heather came together and jumping off the 36 year old Hinkler said that the pod is the only thing that has kept her rum buoyed arthritis at bay and that she left her job in finance Sankar life-saving it's into this and saw her business nearly go under until word starts spreading around the California jock grapevine dude welcome to the California Java Creek your party wow you're in the California jock rape I don't know if that's good or not it's a tricky one right when someone calls you a jock yeah she says the majority of her clients are professionals athletes and the first thing it says UFC fighters and it says major league baseball player and dirty comedian I'm coming I'll go there you gotta try that shit come on down many times you go a week three days a week its death to get down there though yeah well well and supposedly it cures been years and I kept telling Dane that you gotta come try it gotta come try it I had vertigo for like six months of my life a while back here's Meniere's how's the cumin years again I don't know I don't I didn't build it is it a bracelet with a rubber band and a sign I told him to give it a shot it makes me feel better so well it sounds like there's something happened yeah it's not it's not like yeah it sounds like also it's getting a lot of people that are excited about it yeah now finally people are starting to see it and they're they're they're starting to see that the results although I do have to say we were talking about Shane Carwin much-respected Shankar much loved shankar and big Shankar fan as a human being and as a fighter but that motherfucker was trying to tell me that a rubber band worked for him and he had a rubber band with a magnet on who's telling me that it's really helping my balance my touch touch nothing that's it your head those guys the guys who have been in power balance are so crazy from their from my area there's a bunch of them now right yeah but I've seen power bands that come rich in one at least was done bad toothache in jail did they have to go to jail I don't think so did they get away I mean I know there was some like crazy loss yeah there was them someone else he just had to go yeah are there to stop doing something I know I know went under but they they made a boatload of money all they could well if you sold something that gave you the kind of confidence that made you believe that you mean is that a product because if you got all those fucking positive you know you look at like those stupid rubber band things man so many people were telling me how great they were oh I wore him justice just to wear it so people suffer when I could try to get a sponsorship out of it oh there you go I didn't I thought it was bullshit but if it did actually help cuz everybody else had him on I was wearing it you know the only reason why I was willing to believe out look I've been willing to believe a lot of dumb she had my life psychics and fucking tarot card readers and I've been willing to believe a lot of stupid shit but the reason why I didn't believe in this one when it got down to it was that the dude who was trying to demonstrate it on me was trying to do carnival tricks yeah he's like put your arm out like this now resist okay now I'm gonna put the bracelet on you put your arm out like this was just like that's not the same position like oh we were up here let's go bring my arm back to here okay we're about here yeah yeah go ahead no you weren't there before yes I was like what are you doing like you guys are playing carnival they were doing leverage tricks exactly like trying to like get me to pick him up with my hand what are we doing like you're holding your hand next to your waist to try to prove strength there's one way to prove strength stupid yeah put some weights on a stack and let's see if I can lift the same amount or less or more whatever that's the only way you can't do a carnival trick so I go what are you guys doing like what who taught you how to do this I go is this like did they teach you and then they got like real weird with me and I was like what is this come on man you're trying to make some money I've seen people trying to make some money before but they teach you how to do this I'm like because this is the second person that I've ever met that has these wristbands for sale that wants to thumb wrestle you wanna like pig I could get you in some weird Yesi position exactly okay we'll try and lift me up now it's like yeah when what it was ridiculous yeah and the guy wasn't even that good at it you know I resisted it okay Mike come on man you don't even doing it right at least do it right if you're gonna you're gonna try and scrap it's one of those things where people want to believe that there's a rubber band that you could put on that makes you feel better you know like slap that bitch on I'm gonna be ripped and good-looking and tan tan is straightening my chakras my chakras were out of line I didn't know what it was I was taking yoga it was really a waste of time I just needed a rubber band with a whole hog around I love it put me back in that's it center and tune so how long you been doing this three times a week thing in the CVA C pod ah man since before I got in UFC by the way this is not sponsored by CBS right now people going oh I see product placement you worked your friend know this is spontaneous I'm gonna bring Joe down to try that I'd love to except I can't get down there without a helicopter yeah fucking ever oh I just quit I'll just pull over the side road and go asleep but i driving down in Newport Beach people don't know it's a joke yeah it sucks I went to visit uh yeah I went down to affliction and fact when tom was working there yeah and I went to visit him I say yeah Malcolm Vizio come hang out yeah it took two hours yeah two hours that's the norm that's that's not even Orange County see you Seal Beach is still LA County I think wait a minute drive I mean it should have been a 40 minute drive at most yeah I was like this is just ridiculous then they do that every day and it wasn't even like it was an off time I was like three in the afternoon or two in the afternoon it wasn't even my dad drove from my family dealership in downtown LA next to Staples Center the tow dealership it's my family's he would drive from there down to Laguna Niguel and then to San Clemente after we moved to San Clemente on the beach for 30 years there's some really fucking long time how old were you when you moved you lived on the beach like right on the beach yeah yeah like I walk on my balcony and I can you know be it could be 2:00 in the morning I could grab a gear people and run and jump in the water run back in the house without getting caught Wow how old we then when you guys moved to the baths we moved there when I was 16 or 17 I believe and we do find in any way that that had a change in your in your demeanor at all like being by the water no cuz I already had lived in the good Niguel like like a couple miles from the beach I was at the beach that's where our whole little fight crew came from was Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point was that was our Beach like what are you doing at our beach like beat it you know beat it kook like we had a bunch of pro surfer friends and body boarder friends and and you would just bully people and kick him off the beach it's no water balloons you know and like we would always know it was our Beach though it was different you know that's so douchey people just want to use the ocean man the fuck knows our beaches like dude we were such douche but what I mean is is there a difference in being by the water all the time and yes living at the water yes I've always wondered like out of from either is I have a friend was a beach house yeah and it's it costs like 4 million bucks and it looks like you should be like 50 it's fucking crazy cuz like this is not a four million dollar house man and you're right next door the neighbor like this is the nuttiest thing ever like how the fuck that someone to get you to pay 4 million dollars for this yeah you can have like a castle in Colorado exactly yeah you could have 100 acres with elk wandering through your yard instead you're jammed up on your neighbor yeah but he was like it doesn't matter when you get up and you see the ocean you look out you want to see the ocean he goes I'm on vacation every day of my life yeah because I look out there I hear that water and it just chills me out yeah for sleep the water I mean my dad's a Waterman he ate his whole life has revolved around you know surfing and fishing and traveling he was like his passions you know the man the fish feeder my dad he's his spear fishing any sort of fishing so what are fishing some wild shit yeah he's my friend Aubrey the CEO of on it just got back from doing some spear fish no fun and he was saying it's it's like hunting underwater while you hold your breath yeah it's such a different things yeah and there's a lot more creatures I want to eat you you know it sharks come soon up next to you but like you know like living on the beach at as a senior in high school you know he was never home my parents got divorced at that point I had his new car to try brand-new Porsche drive around oh my god and he lets you drive a Porsche when you were in high school no no I would I just do you know many people right now I just know he didn't know he found out I was driving it but you're like a evil character in a fucking teeny bopper movie I was a horrible kid let me think about it like there was like a matching candles type movie I would be like the ultimate bad character but then you know what I did probably a girl in the movie and you fall in love with her and you would change for her just think about you driving your dad's Porsche around living in the fucking beach shit and kicking guys asses like what yes constantly and it my dad would bring he would go kill fish you know big tuna whatever out of Mexico and come back with whole fish a whole turn just literally we would eat you didn't get any fresher than that I mean he's cutting up he's K he's getting it and then giving you sushi out like is amazing I've never done any tuna fishing but my friend Tommy did and he said they ate tuna sashimi on the boat he said it's the most ridiculous thing I can't even believe how good it is it's it's a different it's a whole different world and I mean to know it's a it's a fucking torpedo muscle I mean that's the best fighting fish in the ocean yeah tuna albacore like that rate those those those jacks you know but maybe like a yellowtail but tuna is the best but um and they're also the best eating yeah you know I mean Gerardo's fun they're pretty but you know sailfish you know there's a fun pretty but I mean tunas he's unbelievably delicious especially it's it's so delicious that it's preferred raw yeah examine tunas preferred raw more than anything the Japanese have paid over a million dollars for one fish I love sushi how's that possible how's that possible you sure that's sure you make it know what you can google that shit you can google listen this is at least 50 people aside yeah be really careful about tell the truth all right largest amount paid for a tuna yeah but they regularly get like 30 $40,000 for a tuna oh that's right all the time if you go out like out of Nova Scotia for my dad has told me you go out of Nova Scotia on a trip and everyone pays you know for you know a couple nature oh my god you were wrong you ready for this 1.8 million oh well fuck me running that's insane that's for a fish 'we depleted bluefin tuna sold for 1.8 million dollars when it was that mean that just means that they're they're trying to get them endangered because they're 500 pound a moderate-sized 500 pound bluefin is sold for an unimaginable price of nearly 1.8 million u.s. dollars a new record at a Tokyo fish auction okay so that must be because the the supply is way down yeah yeah it's it because that those we need to stop I mean as much as I love bluefin tuna we need to farm it and we need to let it rebuild them in the in there in the fuckin if we ever want to fish it again because okay but hold on there's some fucker here it's saying supposedly the high price is paid at the annual New Year's tunas auction tuna auction in Tokyo are a way to celebrate more likely is about publicity and do not reflect actual market price nevertheless the continued increasing price buyers are paying for bluefin tuna mirrors its increasing rarity okay so this is a really unusual circumstance for that's probably fuckery yeah they probably did that just so people are paying attention yeah there could be some crazy Yakuza shit going on the old price was pretty high anyway though the old record was seven hundred and forty thousand dollars yeah holy fucking shit and that wasn't even supposedly fucked with that's supposedly a real record that's what's the biggest those things get a thousand pounds I think gotta be okay let's find out world record tuna I'm scared now I'm thinking of catching it could you imagine you're in for a fucking fight something's gonna rip your arms off I mean that is a thousand-pound ball or whatever but however many pounds it is ball of muscle that just wants to eat and I mean those things could eat us biggest fish I ever caught was a Marlin and uh it was not that big it was only about 70 pounds but it was my oldest daughter was a vegetarian a little bit she was trying to be a vegetarian and I was you know she's just a kind person yeah and at the time think she's about probably 12 it makes sense yeah about 12 and I say you know what let's let's go fish it I said we'll catch a fish will cook it we'll eat it and we'll understand sort of the cycle of life because you know we buy things the supermarket and we're very disconnected okay you have to understand like these animals they eat each other and this is like it's a natural wave got people to acquire food and it's way people have done it throughout history but she tried to be like this really kind person so it was a it was a moral reason like she'd wanna hurt it yeah of course she loves animals so anyway we're fishing we're fishing for maybe 15 minutes yeah and I hook a Marlin maybe 15 minutes that's unheard of yeah but people fish for years and they never catch a Marlin it's total stupid luck yeah cuz they were trolling it's not like no skill whatsoever it just happened to hit my line so we get this mileage jumping through the air it's wild man it's really cool it's not that big it's only like 70 pounds yeah you know maybe yeah maybe but it's about the guys about its they get hundreds thousand well this fucking thing they pull it they gaff it they bring in the boat and then they beat the fucking shit out of it with a club and the way it works we're in Hawaii in Hawaii the the owners of the boat they own the fish yeah like if you catch fish they'll take you and you'll enjoy it but it's also their livelihood it's how they make a living so it's like it's a different sort of a situation than a lot of charters it's like they want you to have a good time and but we know you're in a resort and this is our lives and we would like the food to is that cool and everybody's like yeah it's cool these otherwise like sometimes the food would go to waste and that's terrible yeah and I think they recognize that really early and they put the kibosh on it and they said look people are just trying to have some fun let's have them have some fun catch the fish but we'll eat the fish yeah so they were gonna take it and apparently they bring it to a luau and they smoked the Marlin just sitting there while this Marlin kitchen what and it's a big animal I mean it's in a boat with us and it's a fairly big beautiful animal that once you kill it the color goes away yeah and it's the size of a dog yeah it's like yeah it's like a golden retriever size they're beaten with clubs and it's it's real man's real shit and when you're a 12 year old girl wanted to be a vegetarian that's like that's a fucked up thing to say yeah it didn't die right away either man it was flopping around they had ice on it and did like it it was fine it wasn't moving at all and I saw I don't know where to it was devastating devastating and we didn't catch another fucking thing for the rest of the trip we caught this one Marlin and then the rest of the day was just looking down at this murder they're both dead and then afterwards taking photos together and it's like really weird look on her face fucking murder victim that we just clubbed to death we didn't clubbed to death but we aided and abetted yeah tricked it into the boat but there apparently you can eat Marlin like I didn't know I didn't know you can't eat him but apparently you can what is the size of that one oh my God look at that thing I hope my dad's watching this what a fuck and they have to attach it to a fucking crane ladies and gentlemen to get it out of the water they hook it up to a crane I love killing fish man killing fishes is a good time well if you grew up near the ocean look at the size of this fucking thing oh my god that's a tuna that's incredible what a big animal Jesus I mean think think of the speed those things get so big they die off because they can't get enough food that's a great just eat and eat and eat that's that's their whole life is spent hunting I mean they are like you know vicious what is the biggest one ever I have no idea oh we gotta find out now because the biggest tuna ever caught it's gotta be that one was about 900 and what it's gotta be maybe 12 32 pounds I would think let's say let's say world record - no wait they're so cool-looking - man do you imagine if there was like tuna that had four legs and would run down a field looking like that glistening and blue just running like a bullet fuck every other animal is path a pack hunting just eating Lions and you imagine of a fucking tuna could run on ground as fast as it could swim that's frightening I I yeah I I always think weird shit like that like about the fucking like what if parrots were the size and they walked on all fours like like dogs and I I'm afraid of birds in general cuz they always hate me but you should be afraid of birds birds are cunts yeah they're evil man they're vicious killers yeah they fucking are man they're creepy they're creepy animals they you know they don't really give a fuck about anything I mean they're they're in a real survival of the fittest gene pool situation yeah we're just lucky that they're not that big magic birds like the size of giraffes if eagles like the size of giraffes they would be eating people all day nothing we could do to stop we'd have we'd have to kill them all and it sounds like a ridiculous thing to say emerge in the world of tune who could run manage the world Eagles of the sons of giraffes well guess what asshole giraffes the size of a giraffe okay there are animals that are that big we're just lucky they don't eat people I think we're lucky they're not against us we probably have never got to this place if they did I don't know we're kind of tricky we'vewe've seem to Conaway this farm I really don't think it would have happened I think we came along like we're like boxes that became heavyweights after Mike Tyson lost prime like finding a gap we're like falling into this like relaxed period tiptoed my way through through evolution it was way easier to survive as those dinosaurs got hit by that rock you know after Buster Douglas came along he thrown Tyson the world got a little safer know back in those days I cried myself to sleep when that happened it was a weird thing to see because I watched it after the fact I didn't see the fight live I had heard what happened and I still didn't believe it happened I was watching it I was like he's gonna get up he's gonna kick his ass it's my brother both literally cried I turned around I cried like bawling - our parents like why why did that happen I can remember the last time I got emotionally attached to a fight and I was devastated when a fighter lost it was Mike McCallum when he knocked out Donald curry I was a big Donald curry fan Donal curry was the welterweight champion at the time gentleman count I think he went up to 154 Donnell curry like ruined his career because he kept cutting weight down to 147 it couldn't do it anymore he couldn't do it anymore he had those fights with not McHale but who is the other there was another like really strong welterweight a Cronk fighter from that era and he'd knocked that dude out and Donald Curie emerged it's like the top pound-for-pound guy but then he fought Lloyd hunting in and he was just too dehydrated he couldn't if I can do it anymore it just wasn't the same guy and everybody's like that's the top pound for pound fighter and that one beating - Lloyd hunt again never he never was the same again he went up to 154 and then he didn't have the physical advantage I've had at 47 and when you see the UFC and you see like that this is especially in higher weight classes yeah big gaps huge in between the weight classes what would you like it how would you if you if someone could like allow you to create the optimum weight divisions what do you think it would be I mean see you just don't want too many you know but I think there would be we would really figure out who is pound for pound the best you know but at the same time maybe ten pounds cuz boxing there's so many champions he just gets dealing cuz it gets diluted yeah in boxing as a sport in general is a bunch of different sanctioning body that's where it gets really weird it's almost weirder there because of that than it is because of the amount of weight classes yeah it's it's a bit to be all of it it's just all the clusterfuck you know yeah people don't realize how many weight classes are unboxing but it's crazy they started like 106 right isn't it huh it's like light flyweight together be something I think it's I know it's startling really light and they go all the way up to 195 and then heavyweight and that's the deviation like the UFC the only gap they have that's more interesting as the 205 to 265 yeah that's where they need to put at least I think a weight class yeah a 240 or something too and I think also in between 85 and 205 would be good I think so yeah I could see that because you know just making every 10 pounds I think so today at work I think so too and I think that the big example that is between 55 and 170 that's especially as you get low in percentage of body weight that's those those jumps between that one and the 185 to light heavyweight those are big jumps now yeah 15 pounds is a is a lot of person yeah you know and yeah it's also you're seeing these guys who are making these cuts to get to 205 so your guy like John Jones he's coming down if I'm like 225 230 like big shit at 205 and if you're like kind of I don't want to cut weight but you feel you're 185 er and you're you know my hams not you go oh god no I gotta lose the weight now like you got a we got to be realistic about this yeah and especially because the the way the sports have evolved people get stuck in certain weight classes because they're good for that way class mm-hm and then they try and cut weight or they train gay night and then that not having the advantages you know of that they had before mm-hmm and they don't work on it or they don't have at all they just can't get it so then they end up getting beat up by someone smaller or something like that what is it like to be a part of this this sport right now for you like as a top-level professional fighter because it's a really interesting time as far as the sport like its its evolved to this point where there's there's clearly like the best athletes that have ever been involved in MMA or involved in MMA now and the hot the level of fighting and competition is as high as it's ever been before now by far but you've had a chance to see it from the outside for a long-ass time like what is what is it like for you now you know the the evolution of the of the the people of the fighters I think as a as a country I think we're getting pacified you know kids aren't allowed to get in fistfights I think it's a rite of passage for young men to get in fistfights you know and not jump each other I'm talking no weapons just you know just Duke it out and deal with your problems some people don't want to do that though and they don't want to be harassed by people who would it be if they don't want if they don't want if they shouldn't have to right but how do you stop that though exactly I don't know it's but that's I'm just saying but we're building better athletes in the gym but we have to now now I which I I get as a good thing we if we want to build a tough kid if we want to make him tough will bow them in the gym right and that may be you know that that is a good thing because not only is he gonna be tough but he's not gonna be a dick like I used to be right yeah you know because like I said I started out beating up bullies and then I ended up just being a bully mm-hmm you know I'm glad you really honest about that man I think that's really important because I think you know there's a lot of kids out there that are fighting that watch guy like him and look up to you and when maybe they might be on a similar path and they hear that and they can learn from your mistakes yeah I've made just about every mistake there is you know I whether it's that or dinah dinah of drugs you know drug overdose or whatever or whatever I've done a lot of things and it's just it's there's so many things that I feel like I can share and it do I can help one person change it'll work you know a little bit but obviously I'd like to help us pity's possible but you know just try and you know especially the people that are closest to me like we got some amateur guys that I'm trying to trying to just turn into super athletes and they already are but just get them focused and ready and not make any mistakes it's very difficult for a fighter to transition from being a fighter to like mainstream life to going back to being like a regular person with a regular job who you know it doesn't have those big crazy thrills every few months yeah you know you just have sort of like this weird steady drip of life juice instead of this wild rollercoaster rush that everybody knows you can only stay on for so long yeah but the thing that I always try to stress with people is that like one of the best things about martial arts is the development of the ability to do something good he's good at something and know what it's like to be good at something and then from there like you knew how hard it was to get good you didn't start out good you started out shitty but you got better and you got better and you get that that understanding of that is is so important for everything don't look at like the finish line I go I'm never gonna get there look at progress and you can get anywhere as long as there's not some crazy physical limitation yeah that's what I tell me because they always turn to me for rehab stories eun-jung stories or whatever because I've been to rehabs and whatnot how old you 29 how old were you when you went to your first rehab it was 19 I think wow what was it for I got caught with with some pills and then I was a pill guy and then it was just through the court I had to check in and I got kicked out of some like class things and then they put me in like a outpatient rehab program and then I ended up the second one was you know before in-between WBC and and tachi when I you know became world champ I got in trouble you know got arrested was looking at probably going to prison for you know like three to five for just doing some dumb shake and I had I had a record so me do anything bad would put me in you know in prison so I checked myself into rehab and they're like oh good job little buddy you know pat on the head you can stay there for six months and it was a live-in and and at first it was just escape just escape goat for me not to go to prison but then it actually helped you know the people there helped me the program helped me actually getting getting my just helped me get my life together you know I had to be sober you know and ice dates over for a long time you know and it was it was it was good for me you know that it actually gave me some perspective on life because I was just such a mess for so long but isn't it crazy to be a guy who's such a mess and wild and with like this really self-destructive style of living especially with regards to drugs and your body but you're a professional athlete a high-level professional athlete for so long yeah how the fuck did it work for so long I don't know really I mean I'm like a cockroach or something there's something there's something inherently I don't know if it's right or wrong I hope nobody tries to imitate it yeah do not do not do what I've done yeah learn learn from do that don't do that I'm a walking mistake go to the gym bitch exactly Jim first if if I would have spent those extra I mean hours that I was doing stupid things I believe I've done calculations to everything I could have put in that that because they say it's 10,000 hours to master something you know right so I could have put an extra ten thousand hours into jiu-jitsu an extra ten thousand into kickboxing an extra ten thousand into wrestling if I would have done that because I've been training for that long I could have fit that in there I would be I would make everyone else look silly well don't you think though that there's something about you that is the way you are because of the adversity that you've gone through of course I wouldn't change the thing I'm just saying that right but I'm not weird you know I just like I would be the motherfucker motherfucker I thought I'd be a choirboy I probably look crazy from that because I wasn't doing anything nuts yeah I would yeah and then and then this then this this beast would show up now and it would just blow it all that happens to a lot of guys too right they get it instead of on the way up they get it once they get up yeah get there and like there's too much fun never giving you money yeah there's a lot of those dudes out there like they should've never given you money dude especially crazy wild and athletes and fighters like the Tyson stories of the most the dude got Tigers he had his own Tigers he'd like the most legendary stories of spending money two hundred million dollars wonder did it go seeing his show that he does know he's stand-up show his one-man show I heard it I heard it's awesome I heard it's incredible I wanted I really wanted a nun white called me up after he goes dude it's one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my life he goes it's fucking amazing he goes Spike Lee I guess direct yet is that what happened yeah and they just so they put it together it's a fucking show yeah you know and it's really it's just him isn't it yeah he puts up a number it's with his 200 or 300 million dollars yeah puts up a number on the thing and it only this giant screen he goes that's how much I lost three hundred million dollars or two hundred million or whatever there was 100 million whatever so it's insane amount of money he just spent it yeah he just spent it when he bought it like that Lee and crashed it and gave it to the cop yeah like not interested thing's a piece of shit now I don't want it here you have it's gonna cost me a hundred getafix he used to wear furs and shit he used to walk around like Jack Dempsey style like with the hat you know like Jack Johnson when Jack Johnson was a heavyweight champion was hanging out with all these white chicks nobody did it they were trying to make those laws so he could yes two people don't even know have you ever seen was it unforgivable blackness is that what the documentary is called what is the documentary called I need to quote it because it's an amazing documentary just blackness Jack Johnson boy am I going to jail for fucking dude yeah I don't I don't remember who made it I want to say it was Ken Burns cuz you know he does a lot of those unforgivable blackness that's what it's called is it Ken Burns I don't know yeah it is oh it's amazing it's amazing it's incredible I mean you got people don't realize what a bad motherfucker this guy was and what incredible racism he encountered like the racism that fighters encounter today or people encounter today like here's a perfect example the recent thing with Oprah Winfrey you know about this thing no yes you know they'd done it she went to a store in Switzerland or some shit is that where it was and she there was a purse it was a very expensive purse yeah and she asked to see it and the store clerk said oh you can't afford that purse you don't want to look at it we should you should look at something less money and Roper was like oh shit really okay that's the kind of racism yeah that Oprah has experienced in 2013 with Jack Johnson experiences like it's like to these people they wanted him dead and slavery had just ended like inside of their lifetime 1865 so you're dealing with just a few decades later and all of a sudden there's this dude just knocking white dudes senseless and taking these white chicks and impaling them on this fucking super dick the likes of which white women had never seen before they were just following him around and falling out of his car while he's driving down the street I mean he had he was like the first black guy ever with a dope car exactly to cross that border and just kill it and he did like fuck you what are you gonna do he would take him across state lines they try to get him for all kinds of shit transporting white women across dirt lines like the government was after you for sleeping with white women yeah he had your winning sir it's sad sad movie and then at the end when he throws a fight you know you could tell he throws a fight I was it know wasn't just Willard who was it that he froze I don't remember but uh I don't want to tell you in fact even if I did remember you should watch it go get it it's an amazing documentary and it's just you see like like those old Jack Johnson fights or you see Jack Dempsey's old fights like boy you're dealing with a totally different kind of human being back then it was a lot different there were animals they they're there I think we're slowly losing that that piece of us yeah you know with whatever whatever is that's everything everything is taking it away from it we're slowly losing that killer instinct well you know it's funny that Tyson latched on to the jack dempsey Jack Dempsey was like one of his like main heroes and his main idols for that style of fighting that just ferocious mauling style you know and Tyson sort of recognized that he was a throwback I mean you think about that in the 80s and then you look at like Jack Dempsey was doing when there was no TVs no they found out about fights from the radio he was doing that exact thing that long ago you were either there in person yeah or you were listening to guys talk Jack Dempsey when I left Jack Dempsey he's down and it's I mean I guess yeah I guess it was it was all word of mouth you know it was all back then the head oven did you see that a photo that somebody posted on the underground the other day of a fight from 1913 did you see that shit I don't think so what MMA I know that you can you find it you know it it's on my Instagram if you go to my Instagram it's a dude named Irish Roddy it's a boxing match and it's a boxing match from you know 1913 that they've turned into a color image they've processed it and and and made it a true-to-life it's fucking crowd ball pulled up here for you look at this shit leave that picture holy shit yeah holy shit is right it's incredible that was back when they used to fight like 50 fucking rounds yeah right I mean then they have like some crazy fights back then with it was the most amount of rounds you think anybody ever fought back in those days at probably 50 or 60 they're like on the verge of beating each other to death very close but I've seen some UFC fights it look like that to Joe Stevenson and BJ Penn the end of that fight looked like Joe Stevenson got murdered yes you know I mean well especially those forehead cuts forehead cuts are responsible for some of the craziest most ridiculous scenes in the Octagon ever what did that Bigfoot service manager say his head is well irrigated yeah no shit that was a crazy one longest boxing match ever let's find out match ever was the longest boxing match in history oh my god a boxing match landed lasted seven hours my kin to the man what the fuck is that is that real oh my god listen to this the longest boxing match ever took place in New Orleans on April 6th of 1893 the match was between Andy Bowen and Jack Burke both of whom claimed the lightweight title after the reigning champ Jack McCall full all a fee all a fee Jack McCall if he retired the winner of this take all purse was set at $2,500 and in order to decide who is really the new champion the match was set to fought to a finish they fought to a finish all through the contest fighters went at each other aggressively pounding each other with their gloves inflicting and sustaining tremendous punishment that read like someone wrote it with their pants off yeah three-minute rounds wore off oh my god they went to a hundred and eleven rounds both fighters dazed and weary gave up and did not come out of their corner pool zhuzh well you can't fight all around one more run to be one guy telling them just get up Rocky and you'll win all that what sagina says it's two hundred and seventy six rounds in 1825 but that's English people lion might we heard much longer than that we our endurance is superior with proper boxing training that sounded more South African so maybe they're right man I don't know whoever fought over a hundred rounds is the craziest fucking human being that's ever lived that fight was only four and a half hours oh that's weird will they like 30 second rounds it doesn't make sense I can't even do the math all right I'm gonna try 2,500 bucks that's crazy for the welter with the welterweight championship of the world or whatever lightweight these days it's a good question it's a very good question I've been to be like a million bucks yeah is that weird like when you hear about like economies imploding and then all of a sudden like a loaf of bread is worth a million dollars like they says how the fuck what does that even mean yeah I don't even understand that people have billions of dark how does that number even a real number and can I have you a pull out a billion dollars in cash let me see yeah at a certain point Tom you have to admit the you hack the game okay you hack the game somehow dude how'd you have ten billion dollars I don't understand when you know you've got like Bill Gates you have a submarine inside your giant bear okay what happened here what exactly as you do this isn't fair escape paws in your house to jettison you to the middle of the fucking ocean whenever fucking danger shows up yeah you have a constant team of security detail around you that's like having a bank yeah you know around you all the time because if Bill Gates is worth what a hundred billion or something crazy like that but if it was the whole JV him dropping forty thousand dollars he shouldn't pick it up kind of thing yeah that's what they say it's like if he drops $40,000 it's worth more of his time to keep moving forward than it is to turn around and pick it up yeah he just what happened was he just didn't turn around a pic of the bonus I just got almost four for bludgeoning another man for fifteen minutes he if he dropped that he wouldn't pick it up it is crazy if you think about how much difficult MMA is then almost every other job that you have to do physically like besides being a soldier or a cop or a fireman where you're really putting your life in danger on a daily basis with fires and bullets take all those out and then ambulance driver pretty fucking dangerous there's a few race car drivers dangerous shit but MMA fighters a fucking scary one that's that's one of the most dangerous jobs you can have other than like crab fishing those fucking crazy assholes yeah guys nuts they're they're secluded out there for a reason are you friends with guida I'm we don't talk to anybody he's a cool dude that's great guy Clay Guida did that shit for like a year I went to like test his mettle yeah it was a fucking crabber crazy fuck he's the kind of guy that sounds like fun I can make some cash cool yeah I gotta go yeah yeah yeah that dude's got some endurance I didn't just on the boat the whole time doing that I've seen him blow off more energy at a weigh-in than I have a real workout like a real workout like today I'm gonna have some coffee I'm gonna really work out I mean while he gets more cardio in on the way up to the scale and he's always fuckin like super energetic where everybody else is dried out you know they're they're cutting weight and guida wasn't much bigger than 155 he had he has ridiculous endurance yeah he's he's just that's one of those natural things that uh he's never at rest anyways ya know it's just it's it's constant it's his rest is active yeah he's never gonna get tired it's a great fucking guy - yeah a great guy very very fun dude to hang out with and he drives like he fights you ever drive with him it's awesome he drives like alright Clay Guida cuz my eyes just hold on fucking Chicago savages yeah it's different yeah those Illinois's people are animals bro never been that cold as fuck just those cities where it's really cold and there's a lot of people it takes a hardy motherfucker to rise above in those spots yeah I wouldn't last them even live your like growing up here you grew up in paradise yeah this is the greatest weather in the history of the universe yeah it's great but you missed at that adversity that you get from dealing with the weather yeah there's like a knowledge that it's out there yeah oh yeah that we don't have we're like Olivia's out here yeah oh my god sunny another day whatever you know my my stepdad for instance world-renowned hunter and tracker like Saturn he's almost 80 years old he's this mountain of a man was in the CIA and he says oh he's a Mason and he's just this like that guy my mom you know met him you know being a chef at his wilderness hunting lodge in the middle of B Fe and in Alaska like the guy I've seen pictures of him with polar bear he killed like it's just a big mountain man polar bear holy shit I actually have a polar bear like it's not another house to put it in yet but but I mean it's just that's like that guy's is just weathered like you don't eat polar bear do you do you yeah I don't think so I think he just just did it to do but the back then he's the guy's almost 80 so back then I was okay I mean he doesn't hunt anymore back then we own black people shot polar bears whatever don't worry about it it's okay we drove drunk shooted polar bears out the window of the car yeah you're supposed to hunt sir predator bears though they have to keep their numbers down people don't like that that idea but it does become a real problem when you have there's like the game wardens in these areas and the Department of Fish and Game yeah they're very meticulous about keeping track of numbers of both animals that are prey like deer and then animals that are there are also predators like cats and bears and shit like that and they're pretty good at figuring out how to manage that stuff but you have to kill some of them unfortunately yeah I understand people will hate that idea because they're so beautiful and majestic but the reality of biology is that there has to be a certain balance of predator and prey because if there's not then we become a danger a are going to come fuck us yeah and nobody likes that idea people people that are like especially like people are animal rights people or you know people love animals there's a lot of people that their dogs are like their best fucking friends it's the only thing that they can count on for love you know I mean that's not even a bad it's not a bad thing it's true so I understand where they're coming from like you would think about the a bear it's just like a big dog but it's not it's a big dog that will eat your asshole all right I think doesn't give a shit about exactly with that even it wants to eat yeah it's a heartless monster and for the most part they're harmless you don't go near them you stay away from them for the most part you're right we're gonna be fine but the reality is when they get to a certain number and they start taking down elk in front of people at the campsite and getting the shit at everybody that's what you ever see a 12-foot bear take out a moose no I haven't either this is a very there's a video of a bear in I've never forgot this pull this shit up Jamie it's a bear eats a moose in a driveway dude okay just dude imagine imagine you're living in Alaska okay I'm five eight okay I stood next to a moose and it's fucking huge its dick was over my head gigantic oh until Alaska I was a kid that place is fucking beautiful they're gigantic I mean I didn't I didn't get really close enough to a moose to get its dick over my head but look at this but this moose which is gigantic okay is killed by a grizzly bear in this guy's fucking driveway so could you imagine there's a thing that's oh you know whatever ten times the size of a deer and it gets killed by a giant wild dog that's essentially what a bear is a giant bulletproof wild dog moose or what like 12 feet tall that fucking huge it's a huge animal that's not the biggest moose in the world no but it's a and it's a female moose it's a big fuckin animal and what's really crazy about bear is bear eat moose alive they eat all the animals they kill alive a lot of times they go guts first they don't even bother killing the animal they just start eating them you look at the size of that fucking thing just ripping chunks off of this moose he's eating the guts now that's what they go for the first but they're they're just they're everywhere up there and it comes a time where the the wildlife people determine that okay are the population is too high and so we have to manage this what is that well they dragged it away Wow look how they dragged it away look at the size of it back that up so it puts it in perspective oh my God look at them dragging it away look how big it is you don't realize how big it is because the bear so fucking big but when they drag it away you're like holy shit how big is that bear now let's go back to the bear go back to the bear look how big the bears goddamn how big is that fucking bear oh that's a big bear dude literally a fucking 600-pound angry dog with bigger claws and look at the size of that thing now that you know how big that fucking moose is in comparison to a car that bears huge Oh goddamn fuck living in Alaska my mom was saying when she went to go haunted doll sheep that of course my stepdads not gonna tell her but a bear a bear was tracking them the whole time no of course yeah the whole time and it's like and like she's like oh we're wading through like thick you know brush shit and just I wonder why just are telling the story yeah it's like man that's fucking frightening having something Fleming wants to eat you it's so crazy because you can get there at the wrong place in the wrong time yeah you can get there when there's an old bear that can't catch catch moose or deer anymore and they have worn-out teeth and they see you and they're like oh I can catch you yeah and then they just eat you and especially when it's late in the season they say that's when it gets really desperado well bears we eat their Cubs they get really desperate because there's no food yeah it can't catch any fish they can't there's no salmon left and they're starving to death yeah and so they'll fucking eat everything in front of them you can catch them in that really intense desperation because they're the last animals that haven't hibernated the healthy fat bears that what a grizzly managers theme in that movie yes I talk about that every weekend talk about anymore it was it was like that that was exact storyline yeah the guy stayed way too long he was like there in October or November some shit like that and they supposed to already be sleeping yeah that's a weird thing man to live in the presence of those crazy beasts my favorite shows are all these subsistence shows like Alaska the last frontier yeah so my one of my favorite shows I get giddy like a little schoolgirl when that shit's on I gotta watch it these people they live it's a bunch of families the Kitchener family and I believe like Jule you know that a beautiful singer a credible voice she is like related to these people even fascinating but these folks live in like a really remote part of Alaska and they have a homestead with a they're responsible for everything the responsible for all their own repairs and their equipment they get all their own meat from either cows that they have to butcher cuz they run cattle or animals that they hunt whether they hunt bear or moose and they have like very specific chores they do and they have maybe four or five months a year where they're just trying to keep it together and then it's bundle up for the cold and their whole life is about preparing for the cold yeah and they're just fuckin storing fish and every day is just a mad dash getting up at 6:00 pulling nets of fish in freezing them smoking them everybody's working around the clock and then the fucking frost comes in the river freezes over the point we drive cars on it it's gangster cold up there I gotta watch that it's amazing I'm a dork for it dude well might you know my mom went through it your mom went through it because she living in being the chef at the hunting lodge god damn in middle of nowhere I mean you know she was living in Alaska for a while and obviously Jim's you know I'm sure listening this season is old but yeah he was up there forever Wow you know that's the harsh climate sir I don't I die like Southern California there's something amazing about the people that come from those spots though they have a different there's a different sort of like mentality that they as assets for a pussy like me it's so attractive now this this guy that's a man right there doesn't have a bank account he's got some beaver skins he's got a trade for gasoline for this fucking snowmobile and he's driving around where it's 80 below zero and he's running traps and that's how he feeds his kids yeah this guy there's a fucking show called Mountain Man where this guy takes a plane every winter he flies he leaves his family behind he flies for months and camps out in the woods he's got these shacks up there and he runs these trap lines and just kills animals in the wintertime it's like apparently easier to kill them cuz they're desperado and they go and find the bait and snap down on them yeah and this guy just takes it all and freezes them and skins them and brings him back home he lives out there by himself for months and months at a time no phone no nothing just a wood house a wood house and a snowmobile and yeah you do it could you do it I don't know I guess you could if you had to like if that was your life there was no way around it if it's like listen you know they came to you and said hey there's a fucking there's an ice age coming there's nothing we can do about it I figure that we're gonna have to figure it out we're gonna have to about four months out of the year to gather up food and then it's gonna be 80 below zero by the time December comes around okay dude okay I do with those people gonna die off because you know what people are doing that in Anchorage go up there go to Fairbanks go up there there's a whole city it's a whole city where it gets so cold that you could freeze to death while you go to get your mail Jesus Christ you can freeze to death they all carry candles in their car and shit you get trapped somewhere you got a lot of candy I can't just sit in your freezer that you'll freeze to death damn yeah I didn't know that yeah that's that's not even I mean like I I'm I would love I want to learn to bow hunt and go kay I eat my food but I definitely want to come home and bring it home to my house by the beach the breeze and you know the nice yeah did your dad take you on on like hunts and fishing trips oh he came into my life my stepdad the hunter um later on well I would love that's my goal is to now eventually take him on like one last hunt you know cuz he's the man's bulletproof but you know cuz he doesn't anymore all right I want to go up to Alaska again and and I don't want to kill anything like a bear anything I want to kill something I'm just gonna eat right right right elk caribou yeah caribou get set my doll sheep you know but something difficult but my dad either side we were food fit we just all fishing so we're always hunting something right right right and it's it's it's definitely I love doing it I love and I'd also need to go fishing again do you feel like that that's a primal thing to that almost I mean not obviously on the same level as fighting but there's something about like the satisfaction that you get from acquiring your own food it's a very primal thing it's the most intimate thing you can share with another creature is taking its life fucking psycho if I was a fucking FBI profiler I'm like yeah I'm gonna follow your Twitter from here on out pal okay why it's true because you get to send it off the kid hate to kill something and eat it no I know what I'm fucking with you obviously we're joking around but um I know what you mean I killed a deer for the first time of my life last winter and it's a very intimate fit yeah when you've eaten the liver of an animal that you just shot a couple hours ago it's weird you know tastes unbelievably delicious and the reality is it's the most ethical way to approach it because that animal is probably not gonna survive much longer anyway yeah it gets un-fuckin'-believable cold in Montana and the waiter and a lot of them just freeze to death there's a fucked up picture Jamie we've seen a shit of an elk frozen to death standing up yeah you want to know how brutal Colorado gets bitch check this shit out there's an elk that they found that froze to death like trying to cross a lake or something like that just like standing up frozen it was trying to how whatever what all snow and it's stuck standing up and animals have eaten big chunks off of it so it is like this freaky carcass of this standing up zombie elk that's that has like these chunks taken out of its body but it's frozen standing up you find it how dare you that's got it let me see it this is what's gonna freak you out I'm sure there's people to have some more MMA questions you're gonna fuckin stop talking about animals really talk about everybody fucking queer hey don't be mean you hate your folks look at this look at that fucking elk dude are you shitting me can you see it in that picture is there a better picture there's got to be a better picture than that man see if you can find the actual picture because the actual picture the high-res picture is fucking crazy this thing's frozen standing up it's big chunks are bitten off of it my point is we're such pussies here in California true I come to the weather yeah yeah exactly but on the other hand it's uh it's a great place to develop your you're an MMA fighter I mean look at it there's a picture holy shit it's even crazier than it looked I mean that there they they're eatin hole straight through it yeah it's just the body like you could see the spine and like the organs are all missing in the top area like by the spine and the organs are all like - that's right - it what you gonna do bitch they probably ate the asshole before it even died like oh shit what we got here sharp I'm a bear actually there's a bear there'd be nothing that has to be probably coyotes or something like that because they didn't even knock it over or chew through the bone wolves would have probably chewed right through the bar what am i a wildlife expert listen to me like I'm a fucking like I'm the Crocodile Hunter I'll go zoologist or some shit don't fucks on so let me ask you about some some upcoming fights people people always request this and I never get around to it when when fighters are on to talk about upcoming cards because there's a bunch of like really interesting fights coming up that people are interested in first of all I got to ask you what do you think about Anderson and Chris Weidman - rematch that fight I think this time obviously Chris you know can beat him I think but I don't think he's going to I think well I think Anderson's gonna blast him quick I really I saw a turn in that second round where I just I thought it that tidy completely turned and Anderson does the same thing he always does and it's one to dip you know he just because it's MMA guys don't know how to box very well it's just a straight basic one too right and he always goes the same way one two and then if you start to pressure him he goes back and dips to that to that side it's it's the same watch on the video it's what he does you know and I I don't know if Wyman might have not even known it but all he did was take one step better a long go new yeah all I did was you know flash he kind of stepped in the southpaw flashed out the jab and then threw the hook yeah and it was ugly it wasn't it wasn't beautiful textbook punching but it worked well you know that's that same hook that he knocked you right all out with you weird long hook way is this arm like fully extended and he catches you on the end with his hand turned exactly and Anderson's used to being out here yeah you know and he already got crack coming in so it's mmm he just got lazy overconfident or whatever it was and but I think that he I would love to see him in blitz Weidman just because I want to see Anderson do it to somebody because he does it so beautifully nothing against Chris Wright I know what you're saying I know what you're saying he's the most beautiful guy to watch as far as movement by far yeah yeah he's it's hard to wrap your head around now how you'd like a guy like Chris Weidman and want to see him get fucked up people don't understand that it's not what it is it's just you want to see the performance exactly I want to see I want to see a beautiful performance and and no one makes it more beautiful than it and when it's against a really tough guy it makes the performance all the more spectacular exactly I'm a huge Rich Franklin fan I've always been a Rich Franklin fan he's a great guy he was a great champion yeah so when Anderson beat Franklin for the title I knew how fucking tough Rich Franklin is yeah so it made it all the more crazy when you're watching that you like Jesus Christ like if you don't know how tough leemarie is if you don't know how tough Lee Murray is watch Lee Murray versus Anderson Silva watch first of all watch leemarie versus a host of other motherfuckers that he just slept with like one punch like a mere Renovatio slept he was a sniper he hit a piston of a right hand and so that guy different breed that guy mauling psychopath well he's in jail right now listen to this podcast he listens to the party rock oh yes well I think he's still in Morocco yeah I probably live in a castle they probably got like a little man hole in his gym great in his uh his cage rather and like the guards go to bed yeah got a girl pregnant while he's in the cage he probably was like a little manhole and he opens it up and it's like fucking Masada machines Palace underneath the gym it's he's a crazy criminal character yeah but he was an excellent fighter stay a very dangerous striker in air since Silva just ran it on him and the way he attacked him so systematically and took his legs out from under him and Anderson just fought brilliantly and also showed a fucking world-class chin yeah you know which is interesting because this is the first time we've really seen Anderson staggered and hurt yeah and stopped it's never happened before and it's it's such a cliche it's the shot you didn't expect exactly so cliche but even on a great fighter like Anderson I mean even on a great fighter like Anderson it's so hard to believe but it's a shot that you didn't expect yet and perfectly landed point of the chin rip legs go that's it lights are amazing but it's also I think in a way it's it's poetic that he's the guy who got caught that way yeah because as much as I'm a huge Anderson Silva fan and I will never not be the guy was like a human highlight reel of excellence that's how I would describe Anderson Silva's career just affection perfection but it's good for young guys to see it's good for young guys come up to go okay that can happen even to that guy yeah you can't do that that can happen to you but you can do that though sometimes you can do it only for so long yeah where the wit depends on who you're fighting to and what's the circumstance you know you know what fight I'm looking forward to man as fucking to this weekend Uriah Hall and John doomsday Howard they're gonna slug it out fuck yeah you're going to beat the crap out of each other that's kind of people who don't know if you don't remember John Howard and you know you seen her riot Uriah Hall from tough who would just had some of the most wicked knockouts in the history of the fucking competition The Ultimate Fighter is like the highlight reel of a Ultimate Fighter without a doubt at the top Sariah hall oh my fuck without doubt that wheel kick ko that the right hand to make it into the finals I mean he's a fucking monster man he is really tough his striking is so but you know who throws fucking hammers doomsday John Howard throws a good he's real Gable to do that and I think it's ah man that's that's a tough call I'm gonna have to go with your eye I think but I mean if anyone's gonna end up spoiling that party it's gonna be Howard but well you know Howard is also only like five seven yeah that's something is sure it's interesting but yeah I wonder I mean he's a thick motherfucker there's some guys that even especially as they get older in their career they actually do better when they go up and wait you know I wonder if that's gonna be the case where I wonder if he can carry that power that 170 power that motherfucker carries that power matter why he hit so hard it doesn't mean he's got that kind of hit hardware it doesn't matter if he goes up a weight class you know it's probably the guy's gonna be able to absorb it better but he he throws some stupid one punch per hour that hauls got a very diverse game too though Paul does a lot of wild shit yeah that's a very because you need to get its that's very very Muay Thai you know sometimes that random shit see they're gonna work really well or it's gonna get you in some trouble and you're gonna take a fucking beating that's true right if you miss and you slip and your back is turned and you're just gonna get bludgeoned especially if you can catch your legs yes I think that it's interesting it's a it's an interesting thing because your eye has a job viously has a lot of Muay Thai skills yeah well but he also has a lot of traditional like karate style Taekwondo style techniques it's always interesting when you see those the clash of those two yeah I was actually just talking to a layout his brother on the way back from the from the fight to the hotel and it's kind of awkward he's like yeah so who do you think won oh and honestly the fight sucked it wasn't the best fighter but I enjoyed it it was if I didn't I wouldn't say that fight song it was just well I mean for I don't know I didn't like very much because I think that neither of them did enough to really win that much I mean it was it was a toss-up it was it was just not exciting to me oh you're so crazy I thought it was very exciting it was just are you so crazy it was just one of those things that I mean it had it had flashes of brilliance both guys are awesome I like both guys a lot it just it just was a bad matchup it didn't work out well you know what I think I think that it wasn't as exciting as it could have been because not a lot of action took place but to me it was very entertaining because I was watching a puzzle take place that's true and I was watching it trying to be solved I was watching Phil Davis try to hit the takedown I was watching Leo to try to defend and land charlatans and Phil Davis landing shots of his own you know and it's interesting you know if it was just a kickboxing match it would be curious to see how it would have gone down but you throw in the wrestling and you know Davis accounted himself very well on the feet which I think surprised a lot of people you know you look it the way Machida knocked out Ryan Bader you look at the way Machida knocked out Thiago Silva but she does use that sniping style on some really highly skilled strikers and fucked them up bad you know especially the Thiago Silva fight I mean who and Bader man caught him with that one punch coming in I mean he's a bad motherfucker as far as his counters and Phil Davis didn't really take any of them full clip you know he avoided he took some shots but he rolled with a lot of them he had good defense took a good shot like it showed good chin yeah I don't see what he never was squared up because constit was constantly moving back and forth and had good head movement but you know I think Pacino landed more strikes oh yeah you know so it becomes a matter of what's more important is the takedown more important but when you hit a takedown what how much damage was actually accomplished during a takedown exactly do you feel like there's like a overhaul that needs to be done of the scoring oh yeah they definitely need to figure this out because there's been so many I mean put my mic should call aside I mean there's been so many that are bad yeah I mean they need to have maybe it's a scoring system where a takedown is this much you know but it just has to be like fought over by a big group of people to just to just figure out every angle you know and and because people are gonna keep on getting screwed no matter what and for folks who don't understand again we talked about if you're not like a fan of the sport the the the State Athletic Commission is the one who choose the judges and you know the rules are in place essentially like piggyback from boxing yeah they took the 10-9 system so one fighter if they win they get ten points if they lose the round they get nine points and the difference is in a boxing match there's ten nine and then there's ten eight if there's a knockdown it's like it's easier to define ten seven there's two knockdowns it's pretty easy to define it's very rare that fighter gets knocked down but wins the round whereas an MMA you're dealing with a longer round and you're dealing with all these other variables kicks and takedowns and near submission attempts if a guy like peppers a guy with with strikes and then he gets taken down but absolutely nothing happens while he's on the ground he just ties the guy up how much damage does he take and is it equal to all the punches that he landed before you were taking he was taken down it becomes a weird situation of like what's worth more forcing the fight into the area where the fighter wants it whether it's through a takedown or forcing the fight by standing up and landing strikes leister by stopping to take right what is more what's worth more is it a you know a takedown or defending yourself and attacking from the guard and getting a near submission yeah like if a guy takes you down but you almost get him a triangle like hmm how does a judge really know how to score that correctly that's it gets tricky right especially not some random person who got their job just because they know uh yeah they know someone who works there yeah I mean I'm sure they teach them some stuff but my take on it has always been there's so many fans out there that would love that gig and they're like huge fans of MMA and would do a good job a much better job yeah I think it would be like a Yelp thing and Yelp thing she'd do would you do that at the UFC from now on just do online vote give them an opportunity for an armed online MetroPCS vote MetroPCS let's make this happen yes maybe a Bud Light vote Bud Light Bud Light doesn't like us anymore the culinary union got rid of him I think it's Bud Light or some Miller whoever was over 'man brows this weekend too man I want Travis to win because I'm you know friends with him but can he I mean Overeem's too cocky you know maybe you know we saw that in in in the Silva fight he got knocked out he's a better fighter technically then I think just about anyone in the heavyweight division if you break down just about each aspect but I don't know if it's he's lazy or what it is just a gas out it's just there's something wrong with him well I think he also has to deal with his hormones I mean yeah yeah of course there's a reality of that let's be honest here yeah you can't not talk about that exactly he had a completely different shape to his body when he came back after testing positive for testosterone so when when you do that you know I mean and I you know I have no reason to believe that he didn't accidentally get this injection by this doctor who was gonna fix his shoulder it might have happened that way you know or it might have been that in Pride and these other organizations and k1 you could get away with doing things and then when you get off those things the problem is your body doesn't exactly know what the fuck can do exactly because your your testosterone is really low and so he tested like really low for his last fight against Bigfoot yeah like almost in like a dangerous area like whew that's a professional athlete and this is like really low and you're that big yeah son it's interesting it's unfortunate because man you juiced that dude up and he's a motherfucker yeah you know when when he was fighting Brock Lesnar and I'm not saying he was juiced up but let's just say for instance if he was juiced up then goddamn he looked good and scary dude that fight against Brock Lesnar he rag-dolled Lesnar he slammed those kicks into his body and he was kicking less than when Lesnar's just like ultra wrestler he didn't give a fuck you still slamming kicks in two weeks and knees into his midsection leaning him in the clinch and Lesnar couldn't take him down you like how is this possible that were just clubbing each other like oh dude whatever he was on let's say was on nothing yeah whatever that that shape that he was in back then that's the scary over it yes it that's the Overeem that everybody thought was gonna be the greatest heavyweight you've all time just wicked ground games and it's Vitor Belfort wins the Abu Dhabi trials I mean he's a motherfucker I won the Europeans yeah as you know a great grappler that's like that's a big fuckin fight man you know what else a big fight Travis excuse me Matt Brown versus Mike Pyle that's another very interesting for a good fight I'm gonna get I'm gonna go Mike yeah yeah I think piles too crafty yeah that's exactly what I think it is I think that Browns good I mean he's you know he's obviously been in forever for a reason but I think that that pile is too crafty he'll he'll end up getting him with something piles of crafting motherfucker he's an underdog man and not in this fight necessarily I'm sure he probably is listed as an underdog with Matt Brown coming off as that's fine but I mean in that division he's like a dark horse I think it'd be a lot of the top guys you know and everybody that trains with Mike Pyle will tell you they're like Mike Pyle in the gyms this motherfucker yeah like he's even guys that have beaten him he fucking trounces in the gym you know it's like just sort of coming into his own find out as a fighter it's funny to the lung curry already but Matt Brown is a special kind of savage yes there's a there's a darkness to that man's heart he fucking comes out to do you could like you could smell the devil in the room when he's beaten on dude I'm telling you man that fight with Jordan Mian that was a fight to the death that was a fight to the death man I think and I saw that funny that was an incredible fight incredible fucking fight he went after me and me and is a tough talented kid he's fucking good and Matt Brown put a salt on him it was a you smelled the devil yeah you smell just just whispers brimstone as he's beating the fuck out of this do you like this guy there's a there's a certain fury that that dude bring yeah into the cage he's got that instinct he's got that that that wants to wear your skin kind of thing all these fucking dudes that went through rehab what is about oh yeah man he had also some similar near-death experiences with drugs Rory McDonald's a weird zone issues issues but it's think about court court McGee yeah another one same sort of situation that dudes fierce man court McGee is a bad motherfucker and he doesn't get tired man he never gets that keeps common you see that elevation training there you go elevation was weight vests he's runnin hills the fucking dude runs miles with a weight vest on he doesn't get tired as a tank yeah he's a scary dude and it's the same thing these dudes that go through crazy adversity even if it's self-imposed adversity like drugs there's some you guys been to the other side is that what it is yeah so I don't ever want to go back well you you you have had like a near-death experience I died well I mean you didn't for that I got hit with like three epi pens and the paddles did you see aliens um no there was no light I woke up in the hospital with my brother just shaking his head at me whoa you didn't know anything and this was a real overdose this wasn't like oh I overdosed and they'd let me out the night that night no I was in the hospital for a week whoa like I aspirated like I had pneumonia like I actually was dead and they brought me back was it pills yeah it was mix of pills and alcohol and more pills and this other pills and some GHB and some damn I just and I was sober for a while and I just went ripe and I just used me getting a tattoo as an excuse to get fucked up and it uh I literally I remember I remember parts of it and then I remember waking up in the hospital with just like you know one of my friends and I don't know how the hell she got there stead of this day I never even asked dude you should stop your story right now and make the rest of it up and write a book about what I learned on the other side how many dudes get to go to the other side I just make a dolt book about it make some shit up you could do it you've been in the heavens you came back man you can tell us some shit just makes me it's true shhh don't tell anybody okay so you know what really want know what happened do you feel um like that you have like a second chance at life yeah definitely feel like I have a second chance and it's easy to feel like that like tangibly like wow I kind of gotta get this thing right um no because I still fucked up after that you know honestly I still drop the ball a couple times after that I still just you know I'm running out of time is it three minutes left I'm a constant threat to myself oh please get it together I'm such a fun guy and that's what I'm working I'm a work in progress I love underdog stories I love when a dude pulls it out like you fucked it up in the beginning yeah gets it on track I love those spinning and because I think I think they're beneficial for everybody yeah I think I'm not a perfect person I've never been a perfect person I made a lot of fucking mistakes and I think in talking about mistakes not only do I get like some jokes and relief out of him like other people can you could realize like oh he sucked at life too yeah you know it's it's there it's therapy for me to be able to to explain my story yeah you you taking it to a whole new levels what I'm trying to say it's like my stories are fucking ridiculous compared to yours I mean you fucking died dude all right that's about as fucked up as you can get you you've fucked up so bad your body said we fucking quick and then science came along and g-shock this dummy back to life we need them around look man look at that you die and then you come back and have some awesome fights I'm back it's amazing yeah dude let's
