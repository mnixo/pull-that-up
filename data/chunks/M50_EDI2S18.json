the Joe Rogan experience so yeah so Mme who named it mixed martial arts you know what that's a look at that's a whole story and you're gonna hear I heard was you well I give credit to Jeff Blatnick as far as look at he didn't come up with the turn who did but the truth of it you know and this is the first thing I can tell you I wrote I wrote a I had to do what's called a work permit for LAPD because I worked for LAPD back in 1993 93 in 94 and it was because I was going to referee the second UFC which was March 11th in 1994 and for me to actually work the department has to allow me to I have to ask for permission and then they have to grant that permission was there a concern that it was too outrageous so that was part of the whole thing is I didn't want to say oh I got two guys going into a cage they're gonna beat the shit out of each other right so I is the first thing I put was martial arts referee hmm okay and then they said well what kind of martial arts so I broke mixed martial arts referee now I can tell you that that was in 90 right at the end of 93 and where did that term I didn't get it from anywhere other than I'm sitting there trying it but I do know that there was a columnist a sports writer from the LA Times that wrote about the very first UFC and in his article wrote mixed martial arts Wow so maybe it was him so I well you got John Freddie saying that he's you know he did it back in 1983 it's like okay well if no one's saying it it doesn't mean shit right okay so the truth of the matter is soda Peretti might have said it in 80 if he might have said it but it didn't mean anything right because the fact of the matter is and it doesn't matter what I wrote what matters is when you know and when you joined it when you joined the UFC it was still considered no holds barred NHB yeah and it was what we called and it was something that was and this is you know part of my problem with Campbell McLaren is back before UFC 2 you know they had him on Good Morning America with Jim Brown and you go back to that and he came up with the line that you could win by knockout Tapout or death okay and four years after that I was in court having that thrown in my face by the frickin attorneys trying to put us down saying isn't this what your company's no that's not what my human cockfighting that's what an idiot said yeah okay and so he still to the state thinks he was magnificent with that maybe no no it's kind of shamanic ceremony maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all well here's the deal it's all one thing getting fucked up shamanic whatever if you're taking drugs and you fucked up you're fucked up doesn't matter if it's shamanic or not if you if you get high and that's net tweaks that little thing in my brain that goes um here I go remember in your brain I got high for 30 years right I'm from the sixties right with the best of them I got high and it took them down some of them most of them you came through it remarkably unscathed if you think about it yeah thank you God it's pretty amazing thank you God thank you God you think about that one yeah think about that we could talk for two hours about times I did shit and almost died so you know and then I could also tell you how many times I took shit and wrote things like you know I'm listening to this guitar lick the Joe's playing he did an interview here with you yeah but he didn't tell you how in his fucking sleep he would play these riffs and I come down the hallway because you know as I see it of course not as they see it but as I see it we were up in New England and he was playing at a place and I mowed the lawn at my parents place and I quit my last band and I was fucking Allah who saw her I was crying I was in no more bands the dream was over he drives up in an mg we go and he's playing that night I swear to god this happened and so we decided to move down to Boston but all in an apartment because I thought I knew why those bands didn't make it but I knew in my heart did if I had a bro in a band like I'm making a Keith like the kinks David David you know ray any of those bands they had that you know there was two guys that were really tight that feed off each other they fed off each other exactly so we moved down there I got really tight with Joe I hear him he'd get weak it's so sweat weed so stoned on booze Boone's Farm you know when we I mean it's fucking her I said what do you say what you say anyway but he would play these licks that was so fucking for every song you've ever heard sweet emotion every one of those licks walked this way there's 20 that got lost in the ether right 20 that got lost ether so I went out and bought a little thing called tape recorder back then remember this was 71 you know a lot of shit wasn't hurt no phones no cellphones so I would record that shit and so anyway where we're going with this that's that's what that's where these songs came from and stuff would come out of my head while I was like sweet white well fuck get me a paper and pen I write that shit down suddenly whoops on the radio see so I use that place with you game you go to and you know edibles do you ever write some of your routines on yours yeah well there you go no for sure well and also check this out the best part of it is when I got sober I started writing even even better shit I'd go in a room with four guys and say we're going in the right ahead we're gonna stay in this fucking room until we do or until we can't stay each other smell and we would leave in seven hours with a fucking song and a good one and one that would live way past all of us check that shooter and but that's a lot of damage out what can be done as the ideas can die the ideas of fascism the ideas of racism the those those things we can kill right but are those ideas are those ideas being fostered and easier these communities I think yes yeah they're being cultivated yeah cuz it's like you experienced it yeah yeah I mean if i'ma walk a white guy walking down the street I am I am a higher degree than the locals right you know like I can I can go and shop in some places that they can't I can go in and sit down and have a meal in some places that they can't I can odd being greeted on the street good Morgan you know not not the brown dude next to me he's not and his kid definitely can't date the the blue eyed blonde girl at the high school that's not allowed so they'll basically create these little colonies yeah Yahtzee colonies in South America yeah did you google google Colonia Dignidad yeah did you you will have nightmares see dude I'm freaking out right now it's not it's crazy how many people got away with it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach that's Julian wife I mean that one hurts me because he's a guy like me just on the ops cuz he he's a special operations guy he was an SS he's he was a physical specimen especially for the time you know like we didn't understand I mean he was a he was a very early on into one of the first real Nazis like this isn't okay all of Germany's going this way the Chancellor is Adolf Hitler this is where we're going I kind of just have to go along and you see some of that in the third and the 43:44 now it's okay we might be losing this war now it's not so invoke but when you got guys in like 1939 that are talking eugenics and you know higher calling for breeding and segregation early on you're like yeah I don't like that guy gonna beat him to death with my hands but he's massive so I would be a pretty good fight yeah it was a there we go reform Nazi cult trying to what does it say Jamie was the full feminazi cult what is the so that that's just a marketing thing cuz it's still the same place reformed Nazi cult trying to open its colony to tourism and where is this that's in Chile yeah I spent a lot of time there right there oh they made a movie about it so that's current day right there Jesus Christ later hoes in range it's freaking gorgeous though it's I mean it is shangri-la yeah a German flag flying Wow they've tried to hide the Nazi things they've had I've met some people that I'm like I talked time ago I'm like a monkey yeah yeah dude I talked to your buddy Eddie Bravo and that guy is a real he's out there he's like a jet he's like a deaf like a deaf Jack Russell almost you know a deaf Jack Ross yeah cuz once he gets going you can't Oh Jack Russell terrier yeah you ever been around one of those dogs you open the car and then the next thing you know there I go yeah they're like sick yeah but how's he deaf because you can't

description like that Jack Russell terrier that is hilarious extravagant dude yeah that means extravagant he's so motivated he loves conspiracies more than anybody I've ever met in my life and he thinks everything is a conspiracy yeah no no he definitely but then he gets into it like I don't know it was fascinating to me how he went from this like one genre of life to the next and created a business in each one and kept moving forward a business yeah he got like he was a muse he liked music he started a band you know he liked karate he started doing you know organized karate he liked you
