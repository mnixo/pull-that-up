still no main event for a massacre no four three two one booyah yeah no main event from Madison Square Garden so far the rumors were John Jones and Gustafson but I don't know I don't know I don't know why that hasn't materialized are they just waiting to announce it till after the whole Connor could beep thing why would they do that I think if they announce something it's got to be this weekend I mean what isn't it November 3rd or something that's soon so it's on my percent monitor really a month today's the third right second today's the second ladies a second yeah fuck man that ain't good I yeah maybe they just don't want to steal any shine from the counter could beat by the record yet I think they were banking on Jones to for that main event but it's been tricky to fill that slot but also why not have if you're gonna do this why not announce Nate Diaz does import is your main event that's a great main event I can ride with that what I mean that and then advant then announce John Jones and Gus spinner John Jones and Kane if you want to but the main event is to be announced versus to be determined I've never seen a fucking pay-per-view a month out that says to be announced versus to be determined in the main event does that mean they have somebody booked and then the not an opponent forum and they're not in announcing it just like decided to just be funny and write both first that's a very good point Jay good point it's a very good point I would say they have no idea I think you just nailed it I think they have a guy that they want to fight another guy I had heard I actually heard from you Jones versus Kane that was the rumor mill that I birdie told me yeah that would God I'm all over there I would be all over that business cards actually better in this weekend's card style benders frighten Derek Brunson that's a great fight leaper that's the sleeper on that card right there we got Luke Rockhold Chris Weidman - oh that's a good fight - job by David ranching faint where's Rob Weidman on there at the bottom middle what an order yet oh wow what what things all over the place puzzle the UFC website took the month off Rockhold vs. Weidman very interesting that listen Gegard Mousasi was the dock guy is the fucking sleeper of the 185-pound division the fact that he went over to Bellator very fucking fascinating to me he just wrecked Rory MacDonald completely rectum right to watch boys should not be fighting at 185 pounds especially against the guy who's fought at 205 he's held titles at 205 I agree especially a guy in Gegard Mousasi who's just as talented just a skill so and then maybe go better might be better than some other assets then when you go skill for skill then size comes into play and you saw how that pans out but crusher says from sauce there's a giant dick how would he know he was in a sauna next to him oh that makes sense though you know what is it John sauce he has that big dick energy like he just carries himself like a straight badass than me like nothing really gets him going you know why because a giant dead giant dick you know what birds birds probably right on this thing sense Todd this makes a brilliant break crashing sorry I mean it's not even like you figured it out I mean he's got like eyewitness don't you seem that they're he's in the room nothing's ever made more sense than that you know hot cedar box with a big ol sweaty dick dude that gay guard amp damn bit everyone's like how come he doesn't get more emotional because he's the fattest dick in the world did he swore it was bigger than his fucking water bottle I go he goes dude I'm telling you it was giant Wow all right makes sense man it does make a lot of sense yeah but Gegard Mousasi not now belt or is an interesting kind of predicament because they have that welterweight tournament going on now you have your champ who was gonna enter the tournament as the title holder and the first round supposed to fight John Fitch who isn't an easy fight but he just coming off a loss and got destroyed and also it looks like you had some nose damage which was his issue before yeah his nose had been fucked up for a long time and you know he decided to take a whole year off just to try to fix his nose try to let it heal that's serious yeah whole year off I mean think about that was like part of the delay in his initial fight in Bellator was that he left the UFC you know he his nose got smashed and robbie lawler fight I mean that was hard to watch remember when he was in agony on the ground cuz his nose just shattered he said every time we get hit it just go white like sparks he couldn't see any oh it was a bad injury so he said there is one of the best fights of all time by the grace one of the greatest fight or he earned that shit but now with Rory you know what's sad too and it's happened to me it's happened to some other fighters I'm sure Roy goes I just think it I just didn't feel like fighting I did I was in wasn't in the zone just didn't feel like fighting a girl you saw see that night whoo that's a 10k garden you know you saw see who he doesn't get enough recognition how good that he is this is absolute monster you got to think about all the guys that he's beaten he's on like a six or seven fight win streak which includes Chris Weidman Vitor Belfort aus latest who's the guy in Bellator the former champion Sheila menko yeah I was good I was come on come Shevchenko that's fucked up that girl that was slumming go man yeah yeah he's an absolute nightmare monster yes a monster I'm surprised UFC let him go now when I say let him go just dent matches his contract you know cuz belt or pry off heard more in there like I'll we're good yeah you could use them right now they survive yeah well I mean it's like they had Yoel Romero they've got Robert Whittaker was a champ they've got so much going on at 185 but Gegard might be the best I mean he's certainly in the running if you looked at it objectively it's entirely possible if he's not number one he's he's number two top three he's number three yeah but Austin you look at his fight with if him and Robert Whittaker were to fight that's not an easy pick I'm fine you would have to be like damn that's the fucking fight you might favor K guard you don't know how big in long as he's grabbed I person listen Robert Whittaker is a monster he's phenomenal at least for now but so was Mousasi so was Mousasi Mousasi has a full game and his ground game is phenomenal and the biggest dick in the division giant dick there's stuff that has me taking the consideration at all this might be no yo Elza bet it's bigger no way I bet it's no bro he doesn't care that Energon it's too aggressive why it's yeah when you're that aggressive you don't have that fat oh there's no way he looks like that and doesn't have a big dick I don't know dude see Batman and Batman the comic drew a dick and he's that's Batman you know I'm saying yeah Batman has a dick now there's a new comic eight there's like this new like kind of x-rated Batman that come out with and they show Batman's dick that's how I pictured this is an evil Romero these fucking Millennials that think they're gonna rewrite history there make an Ironman a woman they're crazy yeah they're fucking mine Captain America is now a woman yeah well I'm just saying Ironman is probably gay everyone's it's this there's a weird revolution right now in comics because they're trying to sort of social justice warrior up all the comedy all the comic books what do you laugh at that it is true it is true all Cogan's uh-oh you this DC comics sorry for showing everyone that man's penis that's yo Romeo bro yeah it's good-sized real that's not real see that's a comic book and it's a comic book that's by the way was created in like what was let's just take a guess when Batman was created I'm gonna guess like 1940 when he's in super old-school 1940 1950s please rewrite Batman's dick in 2000 think about the guy drawing it I don't have the biggest dick and just mad yeah but maybe he thought that was massive probably thought was the biggest dick he's ever seen yeah I'm scared to watch porn and then and then got backlash when he's like what the fuck if this was a big cock and was like no dude for Batman's Batman you pray yeah Batman's a weirder superhero ever because he's basically just a rich guy he's Elon Musk well on steroids and getting fight he's Elon Musk yeah yeah basically that's what he is with a bunch of stuff yeah no special skills well he knows how to fight yeah but he doesn't have any superpower there's nothing he's still rich dude that's why I got angry at that Batman vs Superman well my bitch Superman would first of all he moves so fast he can make the earth spin backwards in Reverse time his lasers in his eyes for God there's no fight [Music] kryptonite Superman we even got a suit on the files Lex Luthor a valiant like adversary for him that's not okay this is bored keeps that dude around like a sidepiece dude this guy / tastes kicking my ass venom drops this weekend yeah Tom Hardy huh you know what maybe I'm just a debbie downer but I don't I don't know it looks

Disney World the Jurassic not to dress apart the avatar ride the avatar ride in Orlando all right it's called flights of passage I think it is dude beyond the greatest ride ever it's all virtual reality you climb into like a chair like you're on a motorcycle it pushes against your back and you settle into this thing and then you put these goggles on with this headset thing on and you're in full virtual reality and this is it and you know this is the one where you're on the boat there's two actual avatar rides this one's pretty dope - that looks legit that looks like avatar world yeah this one that's pretty dope - that one you're on a boat like Pirates of the Caribbean I like the boat the both pretty badass but this one you're flying in full virtual reality while you're riding on the back of one of those dragon things I mean I've seen better graphics on but no know what you just not just isn't doing it yeah yeah film their screen they're not even filming their scream in 3d right so he's just using his cell phone that's why it looks all blurry is that lying line long as shit long as shit yeah and then while you're doing it like you get breezes in your face and you smell things it's fucking incredible man it feels real it's the best ride I've ever been on by far like I got it I've been on some dope rides that's numero uno with a bullet by far by far Wow yeah I did two times in a row dude I'm a sucker for though I'm old-school I like the Haunted Mansion old-school ones man and then they put in what is it Nightmare Before Christmas yeah yeah yeah have you taken him to Disneyland yet oh yeah season pass that's the shit I don't feel like he's getting spoiled because you know when I'm working my girl I take him and her friends and they go he's going when he's not

wait for an hour and a half let a funnel cake and set each other up it's wrong and those one of those fucking those the ones the brown sugar true I'll do those nice char the staff they kitchens oh yeah the churros do no not the machines yeah they've liked the candied almonds know what they won't have one thing's guilt-free though that big old turkey leg that's smoked singular makes me feel sick when I see just these enormous people just chowing down and then the meats all pink in the middle for a reason well it's smoked is everyone out of shape Disneyland it's a shape they're ambulatory oh dude yeah there's more people that can't walk they're just on scooters because they got so big their body just stopped moving God yeah it's a strange vibe you can't be on a diet got a amusement park you got except that you're gonna fuck off that day for sure that's a fuck off day that's like we're gonna get some ice cream I'm gonna drink a regular soda well I tell you where else she can't be on a diet Chicago I was there a few weeks ago man fuck it go to loominatee I went ate every pizza and I apologized to every crowd beforehand that is not a pizza that is a goddamn casserole it is a straight it's it's a casserole it's a it's a pie it's a pie pie I don't I felt so sick after that but it was so nice going down I felt so sick that's a weird sacrifice right you decide I'm gonna be sick for a few hours for just a few seconds of mouth pleasure yeah I'm like again I apologize to the crowds and I shouldn't be doing this man this is this take a fight or missing weight like it's such an asshole move my face is all swollen from the sodium which one was that that was at the place where it's the famous place the grinder something grinder where comes in a bowl and it's where grinder is that is a gay gay site yeah but it's also a delicious beans of Chicago reinder opening dry oven grinder I wonder if they're bummed out that grinder is all succulent but fucking anything you can get a deep dish and a but it's that same place where Al Capone's men staked out before they did the st. Valentine's Day Massacre so it's like a storage place yeah so it's old as far to our wait wait you waited two hours for food 200 200 it's a two-hour away I put my name and strolled around oh good move I know you gotta do what you gotta do yeah no there's no freebies it I don't give a fuck you that's a lot of food man they don't fuck around people get cold that's the thing if you live in a place where people get cold like Boston or Chicago people get thick do you think this yeah it's tough to work out in the cold man no not just that I'd like you to insulates you that makes sense if you want to live and you don't want to be shredded you might have shredded near that water the wind comes off that Lake sense you've been Chicago in January yes whoa miserable colds fuck not my cup of tea it's a great place to perform though yeah the audiences are amazing amazing they're just fun they're fun people you know there are they're a unique combination of like the Midwest and a giant city hmm same as Toronto Toronto's like that Dave Toronto but it's a sim kind of vibe it's a weird combination of like really nice almost small-town people that live in a giant urban city and Toronto is a melting pot it's just to meet toronto minds me of New York not with the hustle and cleaner yeah wait I loved her more polite people - yeah way nicer you get Indian people Pakistani black Asian white European me to get everybody no no on the other end of that I was just in Seattle Washington and the crowd was always alright that is the way the darkest dude in the in the building yeah damn in Portland there white as fuck even if you're black after a few generations you just turn white let's start talking light if you if you bring your family up there and you plan on you know staking out a black existence in Portland good luck good luck if even if you your your kids only date other black you're like a hundred years everyone's gonna be everyone no son that's son for three months year lived is a reason why people became white I mean everyone really comes from Africa yeah it's one of the real reasons why racism is so stupid every single fucking human being came from Africa just like every single fucking dog came from a wolf every person started out as an African it's just as we moved to shittier and shittier places with less and less Sun your body adapted and you basically white skin is like a big ol solar panel for vitamin B for vitamin D rather do I don't and obviously we don't I don't know anyone who is racist these days so but I don't I don't I don't have anyone that I even you know so she's so nice but even like the jokingly or like I don't like Asian so I don't like well I don't that is a me no no not really that are doing well no it's a stupid mindset it's a stupid mindset it just really is it's dumb just is I mean it's very old-school well it's just it's it doesn't benefit you in any way it's super detrimental for your view of the world the way you interact with people just it's dumb I mean I know so many cool people of every single race like what you know I mean why would you so stupid it's like judging white people off of a few small portion sample size of like mass shooters the dumbest to shoot up the high schools well this you know there's like blowback the other way right like there's a lot of people think it's okay to be racist against white people because so many white people have been racist in the past but that's just as foolish and just as short-sighted that's different yeah it's all stupid it's like today with all this me to stuff it seems like it's okay to be sexist against men yeah because there are awful men out there but there's also men they're nice and they're gonna be nice to you there's also some awful women out there who do some other agendas when they come out with these me two games there's a lot of that what you're seeing we're seeing these cases now you know we're seeing these cases get exposed for what they are you know and it's it it the problem is that it casts doubt on legitimate cases what is going on my throat something about these goddamn caveman coffees really early in the morning did you think if you're in Lucy case shoes do you think you came back too soon I don't think it's that he came back too soon what I honestly think is he should say something more than what he already said not just go up like it's all good like all right there's not just I mean he said he put out a release a statement these stories are true they happened a long time ago right they happened like more than a decade ago I think he should and I think it might be even better to release a video rather than than a written statement because a written statement the problem is like it's impersonal it's personal take yeah well it's not even not only that see it's not as impactful I want us when what is he gonna say it's like I can't fix it maybe if he donated a certain amount of money to certain causes or you know he spent you know time and therapy or talked about it and it's and maybe expressed himself and said that what was you know what was going on through through through in his mind during that time when he did that thing and why it was wrong yeah and how he's changed his his way and how bad he feels about it how he's apologized he has dollars I think I think you get all that done by just doing a video with this I think you've done so much further for him if he didn't have a big production that's right he's a creative dude obviously a great comedian if you just went off the top of his head straight into the camera and post on Instagram was a K man I've paid a price you know I've learned I have daughters is a horrible thing that I did you mean even stay away from I've paid a price because people don't really want to hear that shit like what is the price but they don't think he has well they do they're crazy well a lot of billions of dollars they don't realize that they think oh he's fine history get back on the road and torian's gonna be a millionaire well he's a ton of ton of money off his shows FX deal more importantly his daughters have this image of him being his guard jerks off in front of women that's never gonna go away either no that's that's a pretty heavy stamp which is deserved maybe not forever but but it's it's a complicated issue you know it's complicated like what was his psychology what was going on in his mind that allowed him to do that apparently just started going up again he just went up again tonight oh yeah he just went he went up and I guess the the owner of the club was like dude I'd I didn't know I was asleep and went up you know it's the crowds discretion if they want to stay or leave but well the first time the the owner was upset in the second time they said something along the lines of if anyone has an issue with someone stops in aka Louie I mean it's only Louie yeah maybe Aziz I guess really well yeah apparently some people got upset about Aziz - still with these yeah dude dude look people just like targets they like targets like that they like negativity the elect negativity but they also like targets when they find someone who's a viable target yeah someone who's done something they can criticize and they go you know you're still alive yeah you know they there's people that just want to decide that someone's a horrible person and and they don't have this really well-thought-out comprehensive view of the situation they just attack you know there's a lot of those people out there man and they think that they're justified particularly if that person is famous and they're not if yeah it's a fair game yep publish form so people were definitely upset at as ease but marked much more upset about Louis Oh hundred percent will you stop and think about what Louis actually did creepy yes asked women if he could jerk off in front of them they said yes he did it if they said no he didn't I mean it's it's fucking look if you're working with a guy like that he's like can I jerk off I mean like Jesus Christ he imagined what the fuck it would shitty work environment for terrible and he is not handsome here he's like Brad Pitt's asking to jack off in front right not that it's ever right but it do less on the it's on the feelings of Brad Pitt's yank it in front of you I mean all of it all of its no bueno it's a whole mess yeah I mean he obviously had some sort of a weird kink you know I wonder what that is but I started in childhood maybe got caught and then got off on it and hey right I just never got chicks and now he has this power because such a he didn't have the power when he started doing it though man when he started doing he wasn't really famous he was respected but he was was like a mess ya know which is it's um you know it's it's awful but it's it's just the thing that he's stuck with now so he's got to figure out how to ingratiate himself he's got to figure out how to to re-emerge and I think you can do it I think he can do it or he can do it look he's not an awful person I just think he did some stupid things that are really gross and weird but if he just I mean he and he has owned up to it I think he just you know make some sort of a sincere apology and then does something like what could you do to I mean what do you help female comics maybe do I do it's done that he's trying to help but a lot of people accused him of trying to help them to try to cover up his tracks fuck man you gotta just do something you guys to go back to work yeah I mean the it's been a year now right it's a year next month I think to expect him to just never work again seems ridiculous and to not forgive him there has to be a path to redemption for anyone who's done anything other than actual rape or murder right like for Bill Cosby I'm very happy he's locked up I think what he did is awful he imagined being one of those girls that turn to him as a mentor and you wake up and you you know you're you've been violated while you're a cold and you're drugged and you're confused and Bill Cosby did it to you and who the fuck is gonna believe that his image is that's the thing about Lois right look Louise image was like he's a pervert he's a weirdo he's always talking about jerking off like when you found out louis c.k asked god girls if he could jerk off in front of them and did it it's like not the most surprising no but with Bill Cosby it's here's a guy who is and I'm not comparing the the acts at all but I'm just saying as far as like famous people have done something that you know became a scandal but built with Bill Cosby he was this moral guy he was this like ethics guy and he wore sweater or his dad he was America's dad and to find out that that guy was drugging and raping women he's in fucking jail right now which is crazy right he's gonna die I give it what are you over under a week you think that's the way it goes with those old dudes really yeah he's 81 his eyes are so crazy you can't see I think the ones good but the last ones all over the goddamn place which one is the one I thought the right one was well oh it's I think it's this one but it is fucking yeah it's going on its own way yeah that's what you get man it's yeah I'm gonna die any day now I think I think a path to redemption or a path to retribution would be would be good a path to forgiveness that's that's a thing that's important for all all human beings who've made mistakes I think it'll cast people out if they've made mistakes I agree I still think it's important to with all this stuff is like louis c.k got lumped in with the big dogs like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein then there's Louie CK and man there is definitely different levels to this yes these fucking grub question no question how about one that under-the-radar especially here in america and i was just reading about it how true it is who knows is with Ronaldo who you know in soccer that's your boy in Ian Edwards I mean there's there he's a super superstar superstar it would be like basically like Conor McGregor getting caught doing something for in our world yeah this is a new one yeah this this girl's you know he said she said he kept telling him no and then he anally raped her and then paid her the three hundred seventy five thousand dollars to keep quiet now she coming back out but who knows human beings we capable of such amazing things and such fucking awful things might have to look that up Jamie I might have been trained no I think you're right about that my brother's about ezg on it that's what I just read in new york post's yeah we should probably go back to fights right Renato likes that booty yeah we should go back to fighters I don't know dude how excited you by your special being dropped today nervous at all I was nervous before you nervous about it yeah it's the body of work you've been doing for ever cared about it I've worked on it for 2,000 years you know yourself reviews are awesome came out great heard it's great I'm excited you know it's the best I think the best one I've ever done I really do I think the last one I think triggered was the best one and I think this one's better than that touch a girl right yeah I mean that's how she go just keep working keep keep trying to refine it and keep and you know raise my standards I learned some stuff still about all these years doing stand-up I'm still learning I learned some stuff in the editing process really yeah well I learned some stuff just watching I think I listen to recordings all the time but I think I'm gonna step my game up now and after talking to Bert Kreischer yesterday Bert he records audio and he also records video and I think I'm going to start recording video of all my shows too now it's tough yeah because when you're doing these giant theatres so there's not video cuz like does that parlor wherever I go they usually have video capability so I get all the video that's nice I always get the video well the ice house can do that for me and you know I can I could definitely get someone to do that for me at the store but I just think it's critical to see the way you move as well as here you gotta analyze all that shit and try to figure out what you got to be natural and in the moment but you also got to analyze all the particulars and find out like what like oh I would watch like two or three different sets because I filmed for shows and I was like why didn't I do that in the second show yeah like the way I did it there that's the way to do it yeah but I did it differently in this other show I think the shitty parts watching yourself and listening to yourself this takes a real type of asshole to do that it takes a real type of asshole to like it oh my god that was good yeah it's you well it's pretty good have you ever been over someone's house and they make you want they make you watch something that they did to this quarterback Vinny Testaverde who says he's a first-round draft pick he played forever we went to his house and he made me watch the recap of his last football season a two-hour NFL Films recap of the Baltimore Ravens and it was a nightmare you made all just sit there and it was so boring shut the five promises I want to put a fucking bullet through my home on but out of the respect of any Testaverde and he beat my ass in basketball before that I stayed there and watched it who does that though mmm I heard about a dude who he had a party over his house and then when the people were over there he made them listen to him sing a song is it Bryan Callen no just kidding some other guy I know who you're talking about because I think I was there played music and sang and was serious during the middle of the superball sir put the superball on pause and his band struck up a fucking song I looked around way is everyone a terrorist here what the fuck is happening why is the game paused I'm from Denver Colorado put that goddamn drumstick down I'm gonna flip the flip the fuck this that was the most Hollywood thing I've ever seen in my life I went well I feel sick I'm gonna leave I feel very sick in the middle of the fucking game in my broncos were playing - oh dude people are so strange what the fuck that's the most Hollywood thing I've ever seen in my life where I felt sick yeah I've seen many of those I was over someone's house once and this guy ran outside to his car to get a video to get us to watch a music video that he did was which was one of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life you feel like great and it was a music video and as a music video that Luke that was made for about $3 Oh God like what the fuck and he's like singing all sincere in this music video and we're all sitting around like we have to watch what it's torture just compressing my chest and a vise well you've never seen comics like play they're our special and they've had people over I haven't seen that yet but I'm sure it's happening right now as we speak right now there's a guy's like come on everybody sit down sit down it's time for my special come on everyone get around you laughter that bird did that no he did that with his family though they had like a screening nobody ever liked it specifically who's that friends and Fett was its friends - yeah but he no no that's like he invited them to a screening of his special where that was the purpose it wasn't like he threw it on in the middle of a party join the music and I got PSA it's all different yeah it's different yeah no it was a screening and his agents were there and his managers were there and people that worked at is do you have family come to your shooting your specials no no no no you know if someone from my family comes and watches me I mean they come to a show yeah we're gonna come in the shooting of and I never asked them to like if you they want to like what does your wife like to go if she sometimes she I have her come out like every six months just to see just to see like tell me tell me was anything new like what what's what's different because she's known in first yes so it's right now it's like yeah someone here's the thing if someone sees you every weekend and I have friends that take their girlfriends on the road with them and they get so bored with their act because they're watching a guy perform every night two nights in a row two shows in a night they fuckin your act is nonsense to them you're my favorite people on planet Earth mama that comes throughout time I've seen you know you're set when you drink for this a bunch of times and when I was leaving someone's like you know watch Joe Mike do I've seen it man it's not disrespect yeah it's dance I've seen it though I don't even watch like seen it ten times I don't even watch my favorites like even Joey l sometimes leave the room if he's in stage yeah you don't you you also don't want to get bored with someone's act you can't watch them over and over and over and over and over get that's what happens with girlfriends girlfriends are go on the road with guys they're watching two sets a night what a terrible idea Oh Thursday Friday Saturday and then they just think you suck over it really this is what you do you tell the same story shut up you pretend it's a news story and then if you have a new opening act like he's really funny like he's funny what about me he's funny yeah I've seen you too many times like oh no yeah my brother used to think I was great was on the road to me every time and the other night oh here we go again goes I feel like I could do your act we used to do that in Boston we got a thing called Joe Biden night at stitches and Joe Joe Biden who was the former vice president people don't remember this but in 1988 when he was for president he got busted retelling some of Kennedy's old speeches come on man this in 88 yeah it was a big scandal so we and that kind of took him out of the running for being president for a long time although they're talking about it again for 2020 but he so we would do Joe Biden night at The Comedy Store that's hilarious hope I loved it though they loved it and was you know like an off night it's like a month like you do enjoy Diaz yeah yeah yeah well that would be good because I can do an impression of Joe Alec a lot of it was just people just doing the material chris d'elia does Callen yeah yeah yeah comedies a weird thing you know you do too many I mean that's one of the things about this special it's like I got too close to it you know like when you're editing things and you're practicing it and you're doing it over and over again I know it's working I know I go to a cloud no it's gonna work I'm it's polished I practiced it I wrote it out I redid it I'd fucking edit it and changed it and twisted it and I know how to do it but I also don't want to hear it like I've know I've heard it too many times so you get too close to it so then when people are gonna see it for the very first time you're like I don't know I hope I'm too close to it but you still get nervous even after all these years yes if you care you get nervous and it isn't it's you're it you're so close to this body of work like you said this is your baby yeah I'm saying if someone's like do that sucked like motherfucker it's definitely people that are gonna think it sucks that's always gonna happen but my thing is the majority of my fans who like my comedy I want them to like her and so for me it's like I was confident I knew I did everything I could do I knew I know I'm a good comic and I know I've done everything I could do to make this my best one so I knew I was confident I knew it was a good special and I thought it was my best special I'm I'm very confident that it's my best special but it's still I'm too close to it so I don't know anyway well it's good transition this weekend I'd say this I'm not being a hater I'm not being some sort of debbie downer I don't think it breaks to million pay per view buddies you might be right I'm not I'm not seeing it man like when Connor fought Florida Floyd or when Connor Nate ds2 I couldn't go anywhere without Starbucks unit anywhere shoe store where car dealer every what dude Connor Floyd who you got man everybody in there mom now very rare maybe I one of my show someone to bring it up but there's something that Connor didn't want to do for this fight and that's massive promotion but that so does that mean it's not as big like who's that fallen is that Connor you have Scott it's bull doesn't want to do it well the UFC has a model right and it worked in the Jose Aldo fight that model is you just promote the holy fuck out of a fight you travel the world you promote the shit out of it you scream at each other at press conferences you do all that stuff for months and months and months and those things sell like crazy if it's Conor McGregor if it's Conor greater so who have they ever done it with besides Connor great like that no one really sells like that they you know a little bit with Ronda I guess but she didn't have the same kind of chops as Connor so Connors the only one but you know I don't know maybe it's cuz he had a layoff mates after the Floyd thing I think it does well I don't think it breaks Conover snake - well I think it breaks one-point-six minute what I think happened was Connor made a hundred fuckin million dollars and he was like yeah I'm just gonna train you know I think I think there's that and I so it goes I'm not that took so much energy you do all that and everyone knows me is that guy I have the toughest fight of my life coming up I'm taking every precaution necessary not to over train you not to use all my energy this I'm in the fight of my life I'm gonna train like it I'm shutting down everything you can post the fucking me thrown the dolly through the window 1000 times I'll do the press conference on Thursday other than that man I have got to get ready for the fight of my life that's the way I'm looking at it I think you're right and I think this is the fight of his life I think stylistically it's a nightmare matchup I think it's a nightmare matchup for both of them I think anyone who goes OH Connor you know he can't wrestle he can't do this he's just going to get taken down and pounded out your show-off it's not funny you don't know the game he absolutely is capable of stuffing a takedown or two in the early going that's what's up because in the early going he's got that stinger of a left hand he put his movement his footwork meant his footwork and khabib is gonna know that coming in he's gonna be a little hesitant gonna walk towards him like Edson Barboza did or he didn't the Edson Barboza fight you can't because Barbosa is mostly kicks Barbosa ties a lot of kicks a lot of Thai style cakes and khabib just put a tremendous amount of pressure on him and then got ahold of them but Connor is gonna crack him with hands and his footwork is way better yes he's he's just way better at moving in and moving out I think when people go it's either Connor Starr Chism and gets the kale or khabib just takes him down for five rounds and pounds them out I think I think it's a it's a classic fight I think it's back and forth I think it's a fucking dogfight you think it's a fight of our lives man I really do I think you're probably right I think you I think you're giving a fucking great fight from two guys where there's more on the line than just win or lose I think with khabib and what he represents and talking his team his team captain Josh Thompson he goes Kabhi he's gonna retire after this really he wants to beat Connor and retire really he wants retired like the Floyd Mayweather of MMA 27 and no beat the beat the UFC's you know poster boy and he's walked off in the sunset unless they get him a super fight with GSP or something he's done really Wow that's shocking he's young very shocking he's but think how long he's been doing this yeah since he's always been fucking in grizzly bears so he's like I'm over this man and not to mention he lives with his family man he still lives it's mom and dad his wife and his two kids same house Wow that's kind of monster you're dealing with and then for Connor I think it's it's a legacy fight where you know he's coming off the Floyd Mayweather kind of train there where you know it was a success either way you look at it he made a hundred million dollars he compete against the best of all time and lasted more rounds anyone thought and trained for a complete boxing match was striking to me better go in this fight but for him it's not about the money you see him the one interview he's done on Mac life they didn't see it's like it's a vintage Connery oh oh shit we got one airman this isn't you know the Floyd Mayweather's more of a show like you know we nothing who's gonna win that this one he looked at oh shit that's vintage Conor this motherfuckers coming to fight and he might get taken down yes I guarantee you gets taken down that my fuckers can get backed up he's gonna get up he keep getting up and could be using keep coming and we got a dock fight man I think both guys gonna be fucked up after this fight and Smith classic it could be or at four it's fucking just could be good starts in seven seconds people playing this on a loop look a Biebs got to get through the fire you know he's got to get through the fire in the early going he's got to close that distance and he's got to do it with precision without letting his nerves affect him right I mean he's got all the shit talking Connors done to him he's seen him rattled at the press conference he's rattled when he started talking on his dad he's rattled and I think we've also never seen kebede fight with high stakes right like when he fought a like winter that was in high stakes Al's amazing fighter but that's not the same as fighting Conor McGregor right when he's fighting Edson Barboza that's not high stakes when you're fighting Conor McGregor Connor takes all the chips on that poker table puts it all in the middle goes I'm all-in you have to be all in I do well under these circumstances how do you respond yeah so we've never seen khabib and everyone goes Oh as cardio is great it is great but when the fucking the Irish nation is rocking that fucking arena and there's all this pressure his heart rates gonna go up anything my god I fucking hate this guy cabbies never father got who we hate he hates Conor yeah how is he gonna be over zealous and open himself up yeah there has to be something there and we don't know exactly I was an assassin until that fight completely get it best of all time yeah still is but that that fight exposed how good Conor psychological game is because months and months of being on tour with Conor those press conferences kind of stealing his belt and screaming at him and getting in his face and then starches him with one punch Oh amazing but that what the what what else is interesting is remember Conor is an amazing counter well to be an amazing kind of puncher you need a guy to punch at you mm-hmm Kabhi he's not gonna punch at him right unless it becomes an ego thing like you did with a Lauritzen Barboza we just walked him down there's no respect he might throw some punches so it's gonna answer him for Conor to find those angles when a guy's not playing the game it's also khabib has had a history of struggling to make weight he cannot struggle to make weight for this fight he's got to be on point he came in that press conference at 174 they said this motherfucker started camp at 180 something like he's never been more serious for a fight which for people listening if you're saying like what buddy fights at 155 he used to play 200 200 and then get down to 155 and it was not good I mean the Michael Johnson fight he struggled he had like some real shutdown issues and then the Tony Ferguson fight they pulled him out of the fight he can't have any of that nonsense this weekend oh no I don't think the the nonsense the only thing where like Jamie Tony's going to fight I would never go to this fight I think there's what I would not go this fight for this reason I'm a complete pussy I think something's gonna happen in the crowd between the Russians and the Irish I think that I think that just the animosity between the two they hate each other so bad if this fight happens for Conor you're gonna have upset Russians what happens for a Kabira have upset fucking Irish I think it's it's gotten bigger than just a UFC fight really I do man so you don't so hostile you think you wouldn't go to this fight because the potential the violence breaks out correct I also don't like going to UFC fights I also don't like you going to your sea fights well you like it because you used to fight yeah it's just stressful for me I just did yeah just super stressful do you feel like you're gonna fight again when you get the nerves I'm sorry I don't complete ops of that now I try to get more relaxed when you know when I'm doing stand-up side I don't want to be in that scared mode anymore yeah that's interesting my heart rate under sweating the whole time I'm just like around like sweating I look like shit pull up that card let me see the rest of the car dude if you're Tony Ferguson it's like oh yeah and Tony's fighting right it I know and he's fighting Pettis it's not an easy fight for a comeback fight from Tony I mean I'm just amazed that he's able to fight again so quickly after knee surgery you know what's interesting to me is I asked Josh Thompson on who knows Kabir and obviously you can talk to DC about it but they I go dude Tony's back like if could be were to win huge fight Tony writing just no interest that fight does nothing to mentally he just doesn't care about it like Kabir just doesn't care yeah he's like not with Tony so he really just wants to fight Conor and then get out get out was ap from from this from Josh Thompson's mouth from khabib he wants to beat the UFC's poster boy Dana's poster boy and walk the fuck out unless they give him a super fight who the fuck has ever been 26 and OH as a champion I think that's the only one yeah but 26 and oh for sure he's fucking undefeated champion Matt Hamill before he won the title he like that ham on the ultimate Roy Nelson bread no nah wasn't the Ultimate Fighter it was Ultimate Fighter finale because I thought Roy Nelson right not on though not on the ultimate now you know when they do the familiar yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a bullshit loss though oh my god you got a lot from whoopin a dude's ass so bad you know what as far as unfair champions who I don't think there's one Hannon brow oh he won but he lost his first fight Kenan Burrell losses the first I don't know he was like he had like 30 wins in a row or some chick but had a weird loss back in Brazil yeah he lost his first MMA fight rather Ronda yeah Ron Brown was undefeated undefeated yeah yeah yeah Rhonda's only two losses were the the two title fights between Holly and Amanda let's see what do you got there Jamie what are you pulling up list of undefeated MMA champions Ben Askren hanging her uh Ben Askren for sure one of them but Ben asked her to me you know I've had him on the podcast I've said this he's my O'Brian Ortega but Brian Ortega isn't really a champion well these aren't champions are they these just you undefeated MMA fighters yeah yeah these aren't champions Ben's the one guy who I'd love to see come on our retirement and fight could be he's the one guy that's my biggest disappointment that that guy never fought near me it's a fucking shame and but the thing is like khabib wouldn't find Mike nobody knows who he is outside of the hardcore guys know I would yourself why would you fight and maybe lose maybe get out wrestled here's the only if you're gonna say something about khabib he's 27 oh he really when you look at the body of work from Conor compared to khabib assignment clothes the winds that Conor has are remarkable yes like the max Holloway Chad Mendes Jose Jose Aldo what he did to Eddie Alvarez me ridiculous that's ridiculous read it yeah then Nate Diaz when they Diaz lost like he just look at the caliber of opponents that he's faced from a very young age in some nightmare look at khabib he's 27 no his biggest wins probably Barboza when he was a little weathered but you know but Barbosa is a perfect stylistic matchup for him so yeah we we don't know which could be we know he's damn good but how good he's had one weird moment in his entire career the second Michael Johnson when Michael Johnson cracked him wobbled him for a second and then took him down smashed the gleason tiba2 bow fight got a little dicey too did it yeah but but with with Michael Johnson it's funny to me because Michael Johnson landed that big overhand and people go oh khabib has a weak chin I'm like what he's never been dropped he's open I mean he's been sound Jobson starched Dustin Poirier with one punch don't forget about that Michael Johnson can fucking punch he's explosive his shit yeah I mean he caught khabib and could be got what rock for a second and then weathered the storm took him down smashed him was a total dominant performance yeah if you look at his performance like you look at his rather his resume Pat Healy a tough fighter thought that that showed able true heal he smashed able to heal remember Abel he took down more times than anyone inside that I've done 21 town rifle thing and he was a college wrestler mm-hmm and a strong guy yeah Abel's strong as shit and that's Gleeson T by one is that 2012 that's mm-hmm that's that juicy yeah the real big fight was the Barbosa fight and then al Iaquinta was I mean as is his last minute as last minute gets and he still went five whole rounds with Iaquinta which was interesting for a lot of people like I talked to Eddie Alvarez after that fight and he was like very interesting very interesting yeah I was like this is lot you saw a lot of things in that fight honey he's like yeah he's like you know once the wants to fight got into the later rounds and he's still standing up with guys he like oh ah it's so interesting to me cuz when you talk to anyone from aka obviously they're super Pro could be but they're like dude this isn't even a fight like this what do you took this is one of khabees easier fights he's definitely had way tougher matchups like you're crazy man like you should see kabhi go against ed grew through the all-american Penn State wrestling he fucks him up he takes him down like what but that's you know that's wrestling that's that wrestling you know that dance that rhythm Connors not on that rhythm no you talking about a different animal you talking about a guy who is one of the best fencers in the game meaning can like jump in with one shot and put you out and he can do it moving back he could do it moving forward he can time you and he'll he'll be very common there you will get the very best Conor McGregor he's also no slouch on the ground people think he's just seeing it taken down and like get crucifix right away you're a goddamn mind that trains were Dylan dannis he he's brought in these daghestani wrestlers like he's training with the lead of the lead he's he's you know what could be gonna do yeah it's way easier to train for cab even it is Conor the dark horse fight on the card is Derrick Lewis and volkov it's a great fight Alexander Volkov might be the best heavyweight on the planet what's he won his last six fight winning streak he's a guy who's flying under the radar it's giant to not that his last fight he knocked out Verdun people forget yeah and see like 6-8 if some say yes it's a giant tall long dude who did real well in Bellator world champion but yeah and he has massive experience and you see him in that fight with ver doom he fucked for Doom oh no man he's no problem interesting for Doom just released a statement saying that you sada asked him to snitch I know what's going on with the snitchin stuff I don't know they offered him a lean more lenient sentence if he was willing to snitch and he goes fuck you I love her new and John that then I guess John was like cool I don't either that's what they're saying I don't need a John snitched did you hear Johnston that's that's that's what the statement says but John's manager says he didn't step what statement from whom the statement dude but no I'm not saying John dear let's be very clear I'm saying is he came out that statement and then Malachy goes he didn't snitch and then Nowitzki was like no you said you can give us some info to help us out down the road with other people so you know I don't why yeah you saw that to release an official statement went hold on wait a minute because mouth came out was like no we never agreed to say we're gonna snitch and then you sounded like well well no remember really contract you signed here's this section of the contract he said they would help them out in the future with other people I mean but bring it up Jimmy John's world champion walking around wearing a wire hey guys hey working got everyone else anyone else just exhausted today guys are just so rip you got your secret why are you full hoodie and sweat suit in the sauna yeah I don't I you know I'm gonna go out on a limb here I don't think that John cheated I don't need you don't think he cheated no I don't know I don't know it's very much Ilana I might be wrong I don't think he cheated I think he took something that was tainted I think that's why they're only giving him a year off and I think look I said it on the pot has any skeptical hippo eyes about its shortened sentence it's ready to go right around New York no right around the CS hmm Malky says there was none but I keep saying that and everybody keeps running with it substantial assistance doesn't necessarily mean it has to be on somebody else it could have been on himself what so go up to the part that you saw a session here that's what you saw to release okay IANA said there are two avenues above above antidote and policy allow for reduction of sanctions one individual can get a sanction reduction if he or she provides information that results in you sada or another anti-doping agency bringing forward an anti-doping policy violation against other athletes or support personnel and/or to a reduction can be given if the information results in a criminal or disciplinary body bringing forward a criminal offense against individuals importantly if the athlete or support personnel fails to continue to cooperate and provide credible substantial assistance you sada will reinstate the original sanction that's snitching where I come from but I don't know now I don't think John snitched on anyone to get a shorter sentence we'll find out if Jackson guys are popping left and right all of a sudden but I don't think John did that I think that's just in there maybe maybe or or if I don't know we we do not know it and I like to give John Jones the benefit of doubt and I will say this if I'm a UFC fighter I am hiring Malky to be my goddamn manager because what he's done with John what he did with frickin all his guys what he did with your boyo Romero he goes to back for them no one else is fucking with the Golden Snitch like Mackey does yeah and everyone else kind of just goes off fuck we got busted man not Malky man that dudes going to the end of the earth to fight for your freedom yeah he I don't know him that well I don't know him as a person on you know managers or managers but I'm saying if I'm the UFC because they can't negotiate your sponsorship it's Reebok so what can they really do your contract and now you got to deal with you Sato who's a huge deal right Malky is this fucking dog right now that you want in your back pocket and it's interesting that you sada has just released like they released a statement that they're changing their policies so say if you piss hot they don't and what's really interesting is Sean O'Malley right afterwards said yo pissed hot he said they don't want to announce yeah people pissed out he goes I pissed hot he goes let me tell you something they're gonna check my supplements and we think we've got it nailed we think we know what it is but in the meantime this is why I was removed from this fight this weekend so they're not gonna announce it they're gonna pull you from the card they're just gonna pull you from the card that ain't and they don't announce it that ain't right and then they go through the entire steps and then if you're exonerated you were never accused in the first place see the problem is is with your Sean O'Malley whether whoever you are Travis Brown whoever named any fighter you want if you've ever been you if it's even been hinted if you've ever had an issue and you get that label nothing like peoples go he's on steroids they don't feel big announcement going sorry we don't find anything my Matt we sorry hey Josh Burnett so I've been out for 22 months my bat right what the fuck man give me some sort of compensation that's true also you so it took you how long to figure this out I can't work during that time period right and because of you I can't work and you made the mistake how are we gonna make this right oh I bet you can go fight now that didn't seem especially for Josh she's like 37 it's not young or how about Frank he's actually older than 37 Josh might be 40 yeah he's not he's long in the tooth even doing for a hot minute yeah I mean he was but think of your John Jones though dude right let's say he let's say you're right and he didn't do anything nothing on purpose and it was some bullshit supplement and he's been dragged through the mud rightfully so after a woman pregnant all that but with this that's a different thing that's a different thing with this you're like what the fuck man right I I could have fought Brock Lesnar I commit double I could live in DC's life but because of this I've been out I've been my name's been tarnished forever yeah but there was something in his urine there was a substance and that substance is a performance-enhancing substance the real question is did it come like there's a lot of people that got it from supplements I mean this is happening all throughout sports but then there's people that say no they're saying that it happened from supplements but really that's just an excuse for huapi for them getting popped that's all most people yeah the majority side with the problem in John situation is that he tested negative and then he tested positive and he tested negative in a very short period of time which means the amount that was in his system is a trace amount which is not anything you could take that would impart performance enhancing benefit no they said it like having a drop of steroids and a huge vat of water like that's it's not going to benefit him now some people and not me man I'm with you I may be did take something that he wasn't supposed to but I don't think it helped his performance but some people say a well that he was micro dosing so it didn't get out of a system in time that's why such small trace amount but at the time if they were testing being a higher potency maybe I don't think you can microdose this shit though I have no idea Jim I don't know but but listen they said he didn't do it here's the shitty thing though now DC's upset because they're like KDC we're gonna strip you have one of your belts and John's gonna fight for it but they haven't worked that out yet maybe try the Gustafson john jones situation is still hasn't been resolved yet ding-ding we're gonna find out this weekend you think we see out the card yeah I think this weekend they'll have to announce they have to announce a fucking month away man I mean who where else do you do that neat that you know this is a great card I'll see the main events ridiculous but that math Square Garden card is a better fight better butter overall fight yeah no I think it is - this is like the the big fights on this card or nurmagomedov and Ferguson versus Pettis never coming off versus Connors a fight for the ages I mean that's absolutely one of the biggest fights in the history of the sport that's a giant fucking fight I mean undefeated champion who just smashes and mauls people against one of the most enigmatic charismatic fucking superstars the sports ever known and he's coming off of a long two-year absence from MMA where he fought the biggest boxer on the planet earth arguably the best boxer ever and went 10 rounds with them and then he's going from that to fighting Nermin Chamitoff again for the title this is a giant fight huge right big at the biggest fight in UFC history for sure Conor has changed the sport I mean he really so forever he's a different thing he's different than all all the rest of the fighters he's just different he's so much more of a superstar yeah he's more literally like he's more of a he's the biggest celebrity yeah what the best talents they've ever had and not doing other things too he's like fuck your movie suit he's he's that to me I know firsthand he said some crazy offers and we're kidding paid at like no I didn't want to do it he says he wants to be loyal to the game he said there's plenty of time for that bullshit when I'm done fighting brilliant yeah I mean that's the way to do it I mean I think that is one of the things that did Ronda in that she was doing everything I mean they had her doing movies they had her doing teach at dinner in brothels the skill set with Conor - a little different he has the skill set yes yes but it's a more comprehensive camp to gain there was a kill ease heal with Ronda was the camp I mean you look if you're fighting someone like Amanda Nunez you better be fully prepared it's just different to you know with the female Division II it's still growing so you know she what she was in her time period was one of the best of all time was the pioneer of the sport but you know there's so so much in their infancy of starting with mixed martial arts they're adapting fast so Ron didn't get better when everyone else got a lot better I thought they caught up to her she don't have the skill sets of it and I think there was I think you're right I think you heard her game didn't advance but I think there was also I mean just look she was so fucking good compared to them in the beginning she was just so good and then she was doing everything she was doing TV shows movie just the wrong people around from her management to her agent Brad like the whole thing was the nightmare the whole thing's a nightmare so she's doing all that stuff total worked out all these distractions and worked out financially up to a point well when I think we're big ones big ones I mean it worked out in the sense where you know she's doing something out she looks happy she's in the WWE she's a huge star over there she's actually really good at it yeah she's killing it over there for sure WWE apparently she's like a natural at it right so she's the champ over there not getting hit in the face all right is that working down it yeah well well he's still get brain damage yeah so I guess kind of worked out yeah but I mean when you were talking about khabib and Connery talking about there's two most skillful lightweights of all time yeah well one guy is a the best grappler we've ever seen in the UFC and khabib the others the best striker we've ever seen The OC one of them for sure I think he's the best far as timing as far as planning all together his movement we've never seen anything like it not even I think what he does is completely different than Wonder Boy does we've seen a one I can go watch I'm not taking any credit away from Wonder but I'm saying from Wonder Boy coming over with his kickboxing background into UFC that we've seen some of that one of was just the best thing is you've never seen Connor fight a guy like Wonder Boy whereas you've seen Wonder Boy fight Dare until you've seen Wonder Boy fight someone who's that kind of a striker never seen Connor fight someone who is as dangerous standing up as he is Jose Aldo yeah but it was a different weight class really like remember Jose Aldo is a fucking assassin yeah we like what he did to Jose eight for whatever reason puts this shade over Josie Josie was so good man up you're the killer striking was amazing every was hanging off his Brazilian nuts and they get starched in 13 seconds right he's all right well then the question is like did Connor catch him when he had already taken in a lot of damage like after the second Chad Mendes fight people started to question because the second fight you know that was a rapport great yeah no it's good point but then and then he fights a young max Holloway you know they're both young that's not an easy fight beats max Halloween has a torn fucking ACL right and yeah I'm seeing his knee does down he fights Dustin Poirier like you look at the guy like Max Hall a champion that's Emporia he's fighting fucking Nate Diaz now he could easily be the 155 champion Eddie Alvarez champion he would add Mendes champion what do you know about but you have a Chad Mendes super last minute notice no cardio didn't have a cam but I'm just saying when don't win brother yeah it's true it's true but there's a caveat next to our shirt but still um what are you hearing about max Holloway because he they're fighting that they just got announced in Toronto yeah he's good to go bad weight cut from what I hear real you know bad way cut yeah so how the fuck is he gonna make that weight again probably go what do we do last camp and redo everything he's so big dude he's so big or taketh big tooth oh man he figured yeah but he hasn't been doing it as long like that I think the thing about the weight cutting is and this is like one of the things that I've been learning talking trishna sand guys who diet and guys who get ready for bodybuilding competition like talking allie norton last week who's a he's a scientist like a legit PhD as well as a guy who's competed in bodybuilding it's like he's your body does not want to do that and your body tries to protect you from doing it in the more times you do it the more and more difficult it is for you to do weight cutting is the number one primary problem with mmm a hundred percent you gotta listen to Conor McGregor's interview they did with Mack life you talked about weight cutting what did he say he's just III think I missed that part but he talked about it how you know the weight cutting was an issue and how dangerous it is and it's not good it's fuck you he touches on that yeah Dustin Poirier talked about that too and he said that he thinks everybody should go up one weight class but then you know what is happening with this 165 pound title because they were gonna have Nate Diaz like dust and both those guys came out and said they're gonna be fighting for the title they came up with that game plan which I love they tried forcing the UFC's hand did you have their idea which is hardly them that come on I mean that's the plan and then the UFC's like no they're not like Danny goes I don't know why they keep saying this stuff Nate's but they sign the contract they're fine at 55 65 no they're not fine at 65 really no that-that-that's they're not fine Nate Diaz and uh supporters thought it'd be great to find it 65 for a title really that's not the UFC's idea do you see any data so the UFC I had to repost like no it's 55 so I was like Dustin hey hey what's up what's up dude man oh let's do this man let's say we're gonna fight it's great alright fuck it you know I'm a fuck you up I'll fuck you up yeah it's I thought it was and they tried forcing the FC's hand and then Dana came out now that so people and then when they told me it's not happening you know it's there's no belt there's no six five pound belt nate was like got fucking I'm out what's what is this this is Nate saying I'm happy to announce I'm bringing a new blade is that 165 pound belt super fighter division what does that mean it's just it's just my trolling the UFC which is hilarious hmm and then Justin goes it's been a long journey wait here we are New York City first everyone sick for our town title UFC 165 I like how he hashtag fuck Jitsu shout-out to even words it's hilarious but then you look at it and Dana White absolutely no truth to it no but here's the thing if there was true to it maybe you could sell that title better that that card better if that's the title fight but you know exactly what you should do they fucking teeth what are you waiting for what have that as well as the main event do all right another main event why not go I fuck my ego let's do it Nate Dustin 165 world title new division everyone's all crunk for it if Jon Jones or whoever we're trying to get out it works great that's gonna hype this thing every more but a month outdo that I would love dust important Nate Diaz can headline this fucking mask regarding card it's insane not to announce someone but I think they want something bigger I think they want Jon Jones but but at 165 title why not just why not just the appetizer that's that deep heavy appetizers into Celtic here's the craziest of crazy questions please here's the craziest of crazy questions DC is supposed to be fighting Brock motherfucking Lesnar right up for the heavyweight title next but that's next year John Jones versus DC for the heavyweight title in Madison Square Garden it's not happening but why not because DC area said he can't they wanted to fight yeah why cuz he wants to find out light heavyweight and why John and I think Dana wanted fight heavyweight but he wants to do it at light heavyweight he doesn't want to do it every way he doesn't want to fight John it at heavy light heavier he's been saying listen somebody needs to pull him aside give him a fat bucket of Popeye's fried chicken because that's his favorite bye bye fat Buck you mean fat bucket of cash so I was gonna say next okay a briefcase slide the print trucks had their briefcases it has those click click this you lift it up oh if I'm DC I'm not doing that I'm going hold up I'm gonna fight Brock in january/february I'm gonna get paid don't beat the shit out of Brock right that's a big payday for a big payday and then have John fight Kane have John fight steep a at heavyweight let's see how he looks if he looks human I'll fight that fool but if he looks like uber a matte heavyweight I'll see you on the other side and I'm fucking retiring that is a fight right steep a versus John Jones at heavyweight and Madison Square Garden that would be a giant fight huge fight that's a giant headliner that's a headline a garden now here's one for you though why not like see Connor versed could be the same biggest fight of all time UFC history pay-per-view I don't think so but let's say DC order beat Brock John beats t pay John DC the trilogy at heavyweight for the world title you don't think that's bigger than this fight this weekend to me it's bigger no it's not bigger cuz just Conor McGregor's a bigger what is this we might see Daniel Cormier John Jones trilogy at heavyweight uh-huh see what I'm saying see when I'm trying to force my boy DC and he doesn't want to do stay strong DC nothing and take the fight no take the fight Brock listen John's been off a long time you remember when he came back against ovince st. Preux wasn't the best I know this might be the time what a great story for DC for you if you were beat John and then ride off in the sunset imagine that and then rides off in the Sun so how to play devil's advocate what forgets headkick that you know a heavy weight losses bull Elton was like well there you go Wow look John is if not the best ever he's one of the best ever I think it's the best ever with Mighty Mouse having lost its it's a real good argument I think in terms of like the overall ability to get things done you got to look at what he's done he's never lost he only lost to Matt Hamill and that was a bullshit loss we took the guys he's fought to fought away beat him two killers remember when he choked Leo it out and just dropped him this system fell on a clump and then that then what he did to fucking Vitor Belfort submitted tour was like your black belt big after Conor McGregor not keen on facing GSP next but interested in Anderson Silva get that shit out of my face come what why would he not be interested in facing GSP but he's interested in facing Anderson and his sense of 185 pounder we'll see what happens next but I don't think GSP is next he doesn't have anything for me personally I'm not going to shut the door on that down the line you know what would be another great one Anderson Silva I think he thinks Anderson is slow down George is not slowed down yet Georgia 55 verse Conners amazing fight well at 70 it's an amazing fight they're not fighting at 70 no no no way nope not happening what makes you say that makes you say you've seen George looks pretty spelt well I saw one picture of him when he was in the sauna when people say he's making a test cut to 55 that's your boy for us what can ask George that's George just call him up right now call up you things didn't give us a real answer on anybody me neither sometimes Bryan does the nightmare it's probably rude right yeah they're like what you're on here hey it's it's Rogan and job is there any way you're gonna fight and like dude cuz my problem with that is like he's leaning in and that that image of him at 170 is in the middle of a fight so he's all pumped up with muscle his muscles are inflated you know hey he might actually be trying to make 55 he does look very slim there this is what I've heard through the grapevine GSP wants to wants to fight and the fight he wants out is that 55 but it's only if Connor wins really he doesn't think beating could be would be like a legacy fight for me well I'll tell you what in terms of pay-per-view that would be a giant fight cause GSP yes especially after GSP boy beat beat Bisping got 800,000 pay-per-view buys after - how many years out of the game for four years over your lay up full year layoff comes back beat and I'll tell you what man when he did my podcast he's super lucid he's they're a hundred percent yeah like all that wrestling good brilliant that rested him good smart smart guy that look like a giant fight that's a giant fight and he probably Valle nerble at 55 yeah it's a good night it's good fight for Conor good night majority faster I mean would it be fair would he necessarily be faster 55 I don't think so I think you'd be so diminished yeah I think he'd be solid off his technique still there but I think 70 that's George all day 85 not so much that boy looked thick yeah but he said he had a real hard time keeping that weight on it fucked up his intestines yeah whatever his digestive system was thick so he's eating all day trying to keep the mass on yeah he's got some sort of a stomach issue no colitis yeah that's right yeah from and he said he got it from just eating like a fucking pig while he's training like he was always like almost throwing up Jesus Christ yeah yeah not good what else is on this card this weekend pull down that man what do we got Michelle Waterson Felice Herrig that's a good thought if I get little Pettis fighting juicy a forum yeah in the boxing world you got Deontay Wilder Tyson Fury fight man still in the press conference Wednesday oh I know that's an interesting fight let's get funny with Teddy Atlas said about Deontay Wilder just how hard he can hit he called him Thor how great Teddy Atlas it's great that was a fun interview yeah I didn't get to the vein but he mentioned something of it where he was saying how he thinks an issue and I never really thought about till he brought up I've never thought about it how in bought when boxing became a little corrupt and got a little weird for him is when the fighters started to have their own promotions in in with the boxing world right like the promoters and if I was working together and now we're starting to see this now with the UFC we're going down the same road with counter with McGregor promotions and UFC now they're in cahoots right he's also talking about how the promoters will take out the judges to dinner you know and it's like that that's a total conflict of interests oppose me even if you're not paying them they're they're eating at the nicest places drinking the nicest wine is so sketchy yeah so it's legal in some sort of strange loop holy way it's very strange yeah what else is coming up down the future what else is going on like what's another big fight dissent the December card you got cyborg Nunez happening now the December card in Toronto no December card Toronto's Bryan Ortega a Hollywood right there's and so there's another December card that New Year's card you know when they do it right 500 so there's two pay-per-views there's like British is the place that Valentina Shevchenko versus Cesaro Eubanks what is bumped up at the vacant flyweight title were headlined UFC 230 I thought but I thought Johanna yeah hey is this just coming out today just how I wish I was about to show you a tweet that said that they were talking about moving it up and it was in flux and then when I went to look for it oh wait that's gonna headline mask regarding what I've lost all energy of my body but oh yeah because that gets my dick harder than Dustin Poirier versus Nate Diaz for 165 pound title note no offense but I don't even know who Cesaro you banks is and I'm the commentator for the UFC I've never heard of her uh I'm not being a dick either I'm just saying as far as headline mass Square Garden you got some nerve whoever put this together let's see a video on this young lady I'm sure she's absolute monster she is Congrats she looks scary how many fights does she have she's won in the FC she's one file up one fighting you have seen she's born to toe for and to okay and what happened with you wanna she must got injured or some shit well this is Bret Okimoto he's a remember ESPN thanksor at the UFC no supposed to face you wanna but that may change two of the switch happens ok per sources they've discussed moving Valentin Shevchenko is this the previous yes and then he made another one saying that it's locked indirect Wow what's that guy's name Christopher yes Chris underscore castaño that's hilarious he put that Britney Spears what yeah that is these poor girls it sucks for them but but the magnitude of massacre guard and you're thinking it's gonna be sick I was thinking Jones fucking Cain Velasquez I'm too steep a Jones DC last something that would just blow my hair back Mike hold up Valentin against the girl is four and two with one fight in the UFC for the flyweight title isn't the middle montana they stripped her because she didn't make way for one fight what huh those are your friends Jill hey just kidding listen man I don't want to be a promoter fuck that you just keep doing it fuck that job fuck you'll be working now I was gonna say we could have done the campaign and just frickin yeah I am I know when is everyone together when are you not working I don't know what a minor arrogant well I'm uh I'm chilling out for a while now that uh I got that that I did in Toronto on Saturday night was my last big show for a long time Alan you know Jill quite a while because you got to get another hour yeah I'm at like 25 minute 24 minutes you're still gonna be doing set sorry it might be nice taking a little break they'll take this week off just the week off yeah it's relaxing and going to the UFC this weekend yeah hanging with the family yeah I'm just looking forward to just I did it it's out now Michelle and then I need a we need to wait till October is over so I could do some mushrooms it's over October you can induce over October I don't drink or smoke really I have nothing to be so no say you're doing it I mean I mean yeah I do it year-round but sure I want to get involved in the fitness challenge yeah that's he let's do that I got an extra one of these things really yeah all right let's do it okay I just worked out with you guys that you're in for all right I'm in what is it what do I gotta wear can I turn into headband no you put it around your waist Oh sick around your chest and then I download the app yeah all right gives you one does a guy ordered in an extra one fuck yeah thanks dude all right I'm in dude yeah buts not much for me though cuz I don't really drink or smoke anything like Stanhope's the baked one yeah he's got to go to a doctor stand up is getting measured he's getting his blood work done and the doctors gonna go you should be dead I met him for the first time at the comic store a super nice guy oh he's the best of us he heard about forever yeah really nice guy - he's a sweetheart I just think guy's gonna be mean to me for the reason it's my own complex but he's super nice it's either gonna be mean to you yeah yeah because a few whom have been yeah sound people do they think you're infringing on their turf you know I get it it's stupid comedy is everybody's turf if you can do it you can do it as long as you don't steal it's everybody's turf as long as the crowds laughing you don't steal yeah laughing yeah I don't belong to be there yeah don't steal and you know come up with your own shit and be nice to people and everyone should let you in we're all freaks and misfits the idea that one type of freakin misfit is okay but another type isn't yeah you know I had to deal with that my are especially early on are you self-conscious early on because your dude and you have tattoos reeks of conscious of it yeah that's why to this day I always go onstage with long-sleeve shirt so people say oh like one of the things that people said about strange times like why don't you wear fucking shirts that fit you because I don't feel good ensure it's to fit me I mean I don't mind wearing shirt that fits me to the movies or to a restaurant or something on stage you're self-conscious about it loose things that don't show muscle they don't show any I don't want anybody looking at my body yeah couldn't go on stage with a fucking tank top on do you like fuck this guy right any skinny jeans on but Theo goes on stage with tank top and it's all good no no I can yeah problem don't tell Brian he can probably get upset testing of ripped nah come on to our bodyweight work you know when I've found a legit massage lady oh my god this lady tortured me the other day do I know her no she's uh she is a trigger point specialist and she gets she's a strong lady and she gets that fucking elbow and you're back a big girl oh yeah she's a big hand she's big lady that's how you know it she's fucking strong breathe hard yeah she broke me that distracts me but it's good for you dude my whole back this day still sorbs two days ago I got the massage in the areas where she broke down our sore like she fucked me up but she minds that it was in an hour long though she did 90 minutes was she dripping wet with sweat sweating like hey it's like pros and cons right it's like you either get the Baker who sweats and takes up all the oxygen in the room or you get the soft asian girl it's not a good massage no I don't want that I want to get hurt yeah me too because she loosened up a lot of shit that was bothering the fuck out of me I realized the importance of that and I haven't been doing it I'll tell you what when I do yoga regularly I don't need as much massage but I think even then you need it you needed everything to be kinked with all the kinks to be worked out broken down and yeah I love massages man you know the Russian Olympic team I was reading something about Russian athletes they would get massages every day it makes sense did you ever have that guy Brian Fogle on your podcast Brian Fogle he's a guy that directed Icarus no I did it you see occurrence I saw like ridiculous she'd have him on he's amazing here's my thing Joe like when you had Teddy Atlas on for him to come on three hours you have that Brian Fogle or whoever when they do three hours on this there's not much more I can cover sure I'll throw in some dick jokes or something I got I'm talking about dicks in fashion but once they go here like I don't wanna you know know their conversations their conversations it for three hours yeah but believe me you're gonna cover in a different way it's always how it is you're gonna have your own take on things especially as a guy who's actually fought professionally and actually played football my only thing is is admit it's my own things like if I hear on your show for three hours I'd only go over it on my show I'm like I know this guy it's a mystery anymore I see what you say I'm saying I see what you're saying but I don't think I don't think that way you know like I when I heard Jocko on Tim Ferriss I didn't say oh I don't wanna have that guy on because Tim Ferriss covered it thoroughly which he did different yeah different I hear you though I hear ya like with Justin rent he's like dude coming to town doing rogue and I'll do yours after Mike you're talking about kids and water in Africa for three hours and Rogen's really don't need to do mine bro well he's been Raphael Lovato yeah like I'm not you know where could tribute into his fight for the Forgotten we're donating money and we're also a part of the cash app donates $5 every time someone signs up for the cash app you use the promo code Joe Rogan all one word and the cash app sends you five bucks and the cash app sends Justin Ren's fight for the Forgotten that's cool man five bucks yeah they've raised thousands of dollars just doing that and building wills they've built two wells already they're in the process of building more you guys are doing are you guys gonna do a benefit a comedy benefit I would do anything I'll help out but he doesn't think come on my show to do if he's here for three hours I'll do whatever you want but same like make sure I don't forget his name it seemed like I was on the plane the other day and this I don't mess up his name be a dickhead and Oh Ray Bourque I've seen ray Borg a son no babies having these surgeries and I saw someone post a shirt that Ray Bourque go to Ray Borges Instagram our Twitter and he posted sure he goes all these proof proceeds from the shirt go to help me pay for my child's medical bill and so someone goes shop look into this and so I clicked on it and I see it you know have a two and a half year old son I see his son on the like the the frickin breeder respirator broke my heart man so I DM to him and Ray I I'm sure bunch of people hit you up man there it is i DM Drake is use that we need help with the medical bills I will pay for your medical bills ray I will cover it man so when I when I say here I get emotional because I see

got brought up on that but I reached out to him and I think he thought like I'm sure I'm not gonna donate like a hundred dollars or something man right yeah well maybe he just was overwhelmed you know that's what I'm thinking that's why I'm sure he listened to show him I know he listened to buying the kid I just thought of it now well imagine the amount of time that it must be taking up to not just train but also to deal with the son and his son's medical issues and the family and the bills and yeah my son stubs his toe my heart drops man yeah it's hard man falls on the ground like crazy did you ever feel so vulnerable in your oh my god I'm terrified of the world now terrified I'll be driving my car I can't slow down man do you think of people different no you have a kid percent I'm Way more

a father that some people resist yep where it becomes the primary focus of your life it becomes a big big big deal but if you make that transition the love that comes out of that and the change that it brings about in you and the benefits for your child they're so substantial oh I mean and it's so cliche so it's the best thing I've ever done straight up man I've had a cool fucking life is my far

barely it's an illusion that's going quick yeah I always have thin hair fine fine they're not thick hairs you know but I swear even if I shaved my head the first time I shaved my head back when I was fighting I was like so stupid I didn't want anybody to grab my hair that was my thought if you shave your head someone can't grab your hair yeah so stupid but I was like 17 or 18 but I remember thinking like god this is so freeing it is nice like yeah you don't think about you just wash and then go no there's no nothing but you you got a stylish cloth you're a little shitty well when I was fighting I did it when I was fighting I shaved because I remember I was getting ready for a jujitsu tournament and I was fixing my hair in the mirror and I was like what the fuck right how's this gonna help that I shaved it the next night that's good moon and I do that for my entire career until I retired and like it's time to get my sexy on whoa I grew this shit out whoo yeah I can't pee on you you don't have cauliflower ears and a shaved head like Bravo's not hiring that guy bro relax so Bravo hired you and are you liking it over there I do like it what is that like working for Bravo I know I thought you were gonna make fun of me when they went so Jericho no who's on the show with me he came he saw one of my sets came in the back and you and Bryan were back then I was like comp out to get roasted by Rogan and fucking Callen you guys are so nice about it why would I make fun of its I thought a good gig it's a great gig free personality is really funny shit yeah original I didn't think it was a good gig you know the guy who does one of the producers who does below the belt on Showtime michael Davies at MC row I was talking with him because I were doing this Bravo shit with Andy Cohen because you watch Bravo yeah all the time yes no you don't him literally all the time give me give me a question name a show and he's like you really do guys do you were putting the show together should audition for it and I was like I felt weird about I talked to my agent like I don't know if that's for me man he's just auditioned see what happens but then I went in there and did a chemistry like test with Jerry O'Connell he's hilarious Oh Jerry O'Connell all right he came backstage yeah yeah see I didn't put the two together yeah I didn't realize that he was backstage because he was doing that thing yeah Jerry's he's a very nice guy he's night and he's funny as hell and I thought all right this won't be too bad like I know my real housewives but I was like how many of those shows do you watch i watch Real Housewives of Orange County married emedicine Atlanta New York below deck my wife she she's been DVR and Keeping Up with the Kardashians yeah and it was on the you know when you turn on TV it's already recording so that's playing so I sat there and as the show was on my jaw got more and more slack like this look yeah it's pretty crazy my eyelids got heavy and I just got my brain started drying out quick cosmos I think I like it for me because you know fighting what I do when I cover fighting when I was fine it's so serious right I got into that stuff right I was like dude I just got done sparring Shane Carwin let me go home and eat a bag of Twizzlers and watch Real Housewives or watch some silliness a minute fricken here we are sometimes it's fun when those bitches go off on each other they're so mean and you know the thing is like when you get them on camera and then they know they're on camera so they try to be extra mean on camera oh dude oh yeah they know exactly hey I'm just keeping it real I'm just being real bitch God being real kunti I know it's cool with seeing Jarek on who's been in the industry forever but then Andy Cohen who's a producer on it and then we have Kelly rip on the show he's just around these like entertainment monsters like to see the way they work and like they're there for a reason like you see Kelly Ripa now fash is and like how it's just professional she's she's she's a monster or Andy Cohen who puts all this together like oh he's a monster she's still doing that show with Michael Strahan she does it now with Ryan Seacrest the same show same show sculpt kellian so Strahan retired he went to Good Morning America oh okay and there's like a little bit of beef oh no exactly what her in him yeah she was I can't believe you're leaving there's some weird beef I guess when I think a with the beef I don't think might of though I bet he is mama ha yeah big old fella great football player - seems like a real friendly guy not too friendly yes well too good on the mind very charismatic dude he's amazing he's made no attempt to fix that gap in his teeth zero kind of like that me too I saw Matt Runyan one time he's he's a super athlete you know it's amazing that a guy that's been playing that much football has knees like houses knee still wear I agree it's very strange what's going on there I'd like to get an MRI maybe you got injected with some freakin stem cells maybe same veins mm-hmm dude they fixed me the fuck up and I still need to do I keep saying I'm gonna do it my fucking right shoulder was so jacked and now it is it's like I don't have a problem with it at all there's nothing wrong with it your whole body feels better well they do it intravenously and when you did do it intravenously like takes care of little things and it takes care of things over a course of like a few months like like over one and two and by the way what I had done here in America is nothing and compared to what dr. Neil Reardon is doing down in Panama yeah what TJ Dillashaw went down there and that's why TJ thanked him when he beat Cody and he won the title yeah or defend the title against Cody and that's why Mel Gibson was on talkin you know with Neil Riordan yeah everyone swears by it dude Mel Gibson's dad was 92 on death's door couldn't walk now he's a hundred and walking around goddamn yeah just good they go there every few months every few months get jolted but what you do is it's it's not as good but it's similar yeah well they do it in America it's not it's not as extreme you know and they're doing tests on it it's called they're called exosomes but X is something they used to think of stem cells that we're doing all the regenerative work but now they think that stem cells are releasing exosomes so now they just take exosomes and they put exosomes with platelet-rich plasma and they inject them directly into injuries and they've haven't they're having tremendous results just tremendous results dude I had a fucking full-length row huge products gun my neck I mean your hair is gone that doesn't exist anymore I got a new MRI there's no more tear that's fucking magic that's a magic you have to have surgery yes I was gonna I was I was trying to put it off that's what I was trying to do I was like eventually I'm gonna have to have surgery now I'm like I'll need surgery I see it from my neck what's going on do you know it got injured when during the Travis Browne camp and then in my last fight when which is four years ago she crazy thing about for long four years ago when I went to go take down Travis hit all his weight he sprawled and landed on my neck and if you look at tape my neck folds like this with his hips on top of me I should this guy Tech in my neck and ever since then it's been fucking just not great did you ever get an MRI I got one a while ago and there's one of the what do you call them one of the things are dead one of the one of your disks yeah one or dis is like black black yeah I guess one of the disks there's an issue with one of the discs yeah what's that about I don't know they don't know what that means they did this is a while ago I should do it again that was right after the fight I should do it again after the podcast we'll talk cuz I'll send you to my doctor I just said in Kenny Florian down there oh yeah yeah I could use it yeah they're doing well then one of the things they do for discs that dude they do stem cells as well but they also do something called Regina keen that's the thing that Kobe Bryant and Kate Manning they were going to Germany to get done and now they do it in America they've been doing in America for quite a while now that's what fixed my neck when I had a bulging discs in my neck and my hand was going numb Regina Kane fixed me and you saw my sneak yeah I just gotta make a priority yeah just I'm so I've been so busy I'm being stopped it's nice though yeah look you out there hustling hustling a little birdie told me you got a Showtime special coming out got a comedy special come on shit are you gonna film it in January or it's gonna come out in film it in jail filming it the sprechen Theatre in San Diego oh shit what Dana I think it's on the 27th how many shows you filming - nice that's good I know fours ideas ideas good yep it's not that Saturday the 29th of 26 26 you in town I am now a shop special AUB special i am son big boy moves yeah alright remember right san diego there okay location san diego yeah big boy moves man do you feel weird about filming something you you feel pumped about that super pumped about it a super pumped about super excited about it i know the the product the quality is gonna be great i guess for me it's more of like like i told you you're the first person I told but I like I wouldn't go to the Comi store and might be like y'all what's up dude doing economy you know like I just I feel weird around other comics because I feel like they're gonna judgment like what the fuck you don't know it's not that I listen to them I just don't I feel like that like if maybe there's comics have been doing it for 10 years and they have no big time special or you know it's like I don't want to hold resentment toward not that can deal with any of that but that's why I don't share it with everyone well I tell comics the difference between you and them is that you have a professional athletes work ethic yeah and comics have very little work ethic yeah they're lazy as fuck that's the number one problem if you'd say what's the number one problem with comics jerking off in front of woman number two lazy that's a number three just self-sabotage like that a lot of comics I see doing the same material over and over like well that listen me and a special on Showtime doesn't take anything away from you it's good level playing field they give out a ton just cuz Chris D'Elia got a special on Netflix doesn't mean they took it away from you right there's room for everybody yes yeah either you're just not funny or you're not putting in the work I have nothing to do with it or yeah I mean guys don't like to edit either that's another problem they don't like to chop their things down and boil them and make them better you know they have a bit they say it a certain way and they like to say it that way forever can't do that no comedy is a living thing it's like a living art form it's constantly changing and evolving like I had a friend come to see me and then they came to see me for months it's like dude that fucking bid is totally different yeah you got a tweaked it yep gotta always be tweaking I think don't the only way for me to tweak is do it on stage I can write it different but I only find on stage 100% so I have to do this full weekends Thursday Friday Saturday that's where to to to to to just roll yeah I find that even with theaters when I'm doing two theaters a night I get more done than just one like one one thing about these big places you're just doing one show yeah you're better oh you really better out like one of the things I'm looking forward to is somewhere around December I'm gonna start booking clubs and I'm gonna you know I'll do like Oxnard I'll do like levity live in Oxnard I'll do like the Comedy Works in Denver Alex yeah I'll do some maybe even the punchline in San Francisco even Sacramento you mean San Francisco - is there a fence Lane isn't there punch I'm doing punch line in Sacramento that's great - to some that's a great little gig but it's near a lot of cracked-out people I've been there before men parking lots I stay far away drive on in yeah yeah the parking lots sketchy but though clubs awesome so you just read to him yeah that's the that's the deal you do you know you have to have those four set weekends five set weekends where you just every you know if you'll have a bit that you come in on Thursday and then by the time Saturday rolls around that bits alive it's cracking yep you know but it's also one of the great things about being able to work so much in LA like Thursday night I did four sets Tuesday in store three sets no I did three of the store and one of the Improv Jesus yeah I did two main room shows I had my show in the main room I did scour stone show in the main room and then I did the oh our and then before that I did a show at the improv I liked improv and probably not bad you know now that they push that fucking piano piano yeah Jesus that piano was stupid like how many people use that fucking piano that you're blocking half the stage just Bryan Callen doesn't use it you'd get on the necklace by the pianos hilarious but not anymore Brian they get rid of it sorry Brian sorry B yeah I mean who would use it Chris Robinson yeah that's it that's it that's it just an old-school thing to do well yeah it's like I think it's like a witty thing to have like how many people will have a piano in their house actually play the piano what a dick move a piano in your house especially if you have the back part Oh Belle I know like your mesh it you know fucking runnel I have people over and play it would you interrupt Super Bowl fuck yeah like we're gonna take a moment and I'm gonna fucking I will now play everyone put your pizzas down yeah we're gonna drink white wine do you ever think you get to the point where

theater I went to see Annie at the Hollywood Bowl was it good no you took your kids yep yeah you don't like that stuff though no see I like that stuff I was thinking about all sorts of other things where I was going over my act I couldn't enjoy it I was so bored I know the story that's part of the problem that's it's like doing a see King Kong hey guess what King Kong dies the end you fuck spider-man to over it yeah I mean yeah we know the story yeah spider-man's gonna live he's gonna become spider-man I mean maybe there's some possible twists and turns if they're gonna redo it but at the end of the day King Kong dies true and Annie they didn't change it goddamn word we're your kids loving it or they're like now there's a board too that's a problem yeah but you know it's a fun went well this might be too much how old are your kids 8 and 10 Nightmare Before Christmas live there's any healthman goes that shit dope that was good last year's a grown man they also play they have music but they also play the movie but they have the actual character yes like them the girl away from home alone the mom yeah she's the boys mm-hmm Danny Elfman yeah Danny Elfman has that big dick energy does he he just rolls up there like fuck he's just a Scientology Scientology yeah get that Tom Cruise energy Wow bro that wasn't that word energy it does worry ship energy bro its spaceship

other gay things no I'm just trying to live bro trying to embrace the New York vibe odd way live okay everyone's been talking about Hamilton forever are they really mean talk of the town is the first time I went in front of me who's ever talked about bro I just feel like it was a big deal so I get there right and I'm like guys that's me cool and they wrapped the entire time and so an hour and a half goes by Michael that was fun and we go to get up Michael ourselves getting that guy's like that's intermission there's another hour and a half on it no fucking way so I thought you know what yeah

Konica Bebe's not selling any comedy tickets right come on talk about calm you want to talk about just life I'm down you want me to break down the fucking Broncos game or khabib Connor it's not

did not vibe with the person who was the DJ anybody know a real issue yeah and then you come off as a dick like some things I'd be like god I don't talk about that like you know time I know I don't
