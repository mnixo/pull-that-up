three two one boom hello jack what's up nice to meet you man nice to meet you finally yeah keep this sucker like a fist from your face good first of all dude you started a company when you started Twitter when you guys first started did you have any ID there's no way you could have added any idea what it would be now no but one of the things I always try to emphasize with people and their people like ah Twitter's crazy like how could it not be crazy there's never been anything like it before like imagine trying to predict the kind of the president of United States uses threat Twitter to threaten other countries yeah I mean that comment did you think it was gonna be when you first did it well you know we were building this thing for ourselves and that's how that's how everything starts we wanted to use it we wanted to we wanted to you know stay connected with each other when we group text like a group text we loved our phones we loved technology we we actually started this as a hack week project out of a failed company called oh do is podcasting I remember that yeah super early on we were we're really creative folks but we weren't that passionate about we're podcasting was going in our particular I mean we just got a lot of competition early on iTunes just released their podcast directory but we knew we wanted to work together we knew we loved this idea of one button publishing we loved this idea of collaboration we loved this idea of being anywhere and being able to share what was happening that was that was the idea I mean that was it and that's what we wanted it to be and I think the most beautiful and also sometimes uncomfortable aspect of Twitter is it we really learned what it wanted to be and the people helped create it like everything that we hold sacred now the at symbol hashtag the retweet those were not invented by me or the company those were things that we discovered things that we discovered people using and we just observed it and we we noticed what they were trying to do they're trying to talk with one another they were trying to collect tweets around topics with the hashtag has anybody figured out when the first use of hashtag something was created yeah it was um it was actually our lead designer Robert Anderson who leads our design in the cash app hired him Foursquare later on but he was the first one he was actually communicating with his brother and he put at Buzz his brother's name is Buzz and it just kind of spread it wasn't in mass but people were doing it but what was most interesting is not what they were doing but what they wanted to do with it they wanted to address each other and that's that changed the company completely that changed the service because I went from just broadcasting what's happening to conversation and to being being able to address anyone publicly out in the open which came with it a lot of power and also a lot of issues as well yeah the the use of hashtags like looking up hash tag you know fry fest or hash tag you know anytime there's something weird that's in the news that's that's such a unique way to find things but to go on Twitter and to utilize that it's a mean it's it's interesting that you're that this guy just did it just contact his brother well that would that was the estimable the hash tag was this guy Christmas you know and he was trying to he was trying to tag he was trying to tag around topics and he was tweeting about and again that spread all we did was made it easier we made it more accessible we we enabled everyone to do it with the @ symbol we made a page that collected all mentions of your name with a hashtag we allowed people to search immediately so you could tap on the keyword and you would see everyone talking about that or tweeting about that specific hashtag so these things were just emergent behaviors that we didn't predict and they became the lifeblood of the service what's fascinating to me about something like Twitter or even something like YouTube is that there's not a lot of other ones like it there's just this one thing like how does that happen where this one thing sort of gets adopted by everybody and takes over and then just becomes this overwhelmingly massive platform I mean there's really there's Vimeo there's a few other video services but nothing on the scale of YouTube and that's the same thing with Twitter there's nothing on the scale of distributing information in a quick short 280 character form like that we um III don't think we could plan for it I don't think we could necessarily build for that I someone said recently too we just you know gathered a bunch of our leadership last week in Palm Springs for an off-site and someone said recently that Twitter was discovered and I think what's behind all that is that it it it hits something foundational it hits something essential and my co-founder biz likes to say that Twitter can never be uninvented it's here it changed everything that the use of it has been revolutionary and it's just a simple idea of you know if you could text with the entire world if you could actually reach anyone in the world or anyone could see what you're thinking which i think is also the beautiful thing about about text and the and the medium you can actually get it someone's raw thoughts and anyone in the world can see that instantaneously it becomes this subconscious it becomes just like global consciousness and it gets to some really deep places in society and and some of those places are pretty uncomfortable well it also gets to some really deep places psychologically there's there's some there's a weirdness to it right there's a weirdness to sending texts particularly at anonymously you know and there's so many accounts that are just an egg you know there's so many accounts where they're clearly designed if you like sometimes someone will tweet something mean to me and I'm like hmm won't know what this person is up to so I go to their site and it's just them tweeting mean shit at people all day long like it's probably some angry person at work and they're like I'm just gonna find people and fuck with them all day yeah when did you realize or when did you realize I'm sure you're aware of it when did you realize that this was almost out of your control in terms of like the scale of it there were that there wasn't there wasn't one moment there wasn't one moment that it just felt completely resonant it's just it's it's unfolded into the next thing in the next use case and it just keeps surprising us with how people are are using it we you know it definitely um recently I think we've identified some of the areas of the service that we need to pay a lot more attention to twitter is unique in that it has two main spaces one which is your time line and those are the people that you follow and you know when you follow someone they've earned that audience and then it has this other world where anyone can insert themselves into the conversation they can actually mention you and you'll see that without asking for it you can insert yourself into hashtags and to search and these are areas that people have taken advantage of and these are the areas that people have gamed our systems to in some cases artificially amplify but also just to spread a lot of things that weren't possible with the velocity that they're not possible before now when this is all happening what's the conversation like at Twitter when you're recognizing that this is happening that people are kind of gaming the system like what it how do you guys how do you mitigate it what's the discussion well early on it was um it was pretty surface level like how do we change some of the app dynamics but more recently we're trying to go a lot deeper and asking ourselves the question when people open Twitter what are we incentivizing what are we telling them to do when they open up this app we may not explicitly be doing that but there's something that we're saying without being as clear about it so what does the like button incentivize what does the retweet incentivize what does the number of followers and making that number big and bold incentivize so I'm not sure what we shouldn't I'm not sure if we should incentivize anything but we need to understand what that is and I think you know right now we we do incentivize a lot of echo chambers because we don't make it easy for people to follow interests and topics it's only accounts we incentivize a lot of outrage and how hot takes because of the some of the dynamics in the service not allowing a lot of nuance and conversation earlier on pseudonyms this you know this ability to not use your real name incentivizes some positive things like it allows for whistleblowers and journalists to might fear for their career or even worse their life and under certain regimes but also allows for people like the example you mentioned of just random fire and you know spread of abuse and harassment throughout so those are the things that we're looking at and how do we how do we enable more of the conversation to evolve how do we increase the credibility or reputation of accounts how do we identify credible voices within a particular domain not just through this very coarse grain blue verified badge but if you're an expert in a particular topic how do we recognize that in real time and show that so that we can provide more context to who you're talking to and if you want to engage in a deeper conversation or just ignore you or block them but what is the conversation like while you're at work like when you realizing that all this stuff is happening and you're realizing that now I mean it particularly because the president uses it so often it's such a I mean it's his preferred platform for communicating with the people I mean even more so than addresses it's really it's very strange what's the conversation like in the office when you're trying to figure out hey what's our responsibility here how are we supposed to handle this or how do we I mean you're you're in some ways what Twitter is doing is it it's really kind of its flavoring the public narrative its flavoring the way we communicate with each other in this in our culture worldwide yeah I mean the the conversation has definitely evolved I think in the past we just got super reactive we were reacting to all the negative things that we're seeing and that led to a lot of short-term thinking more recently we've just looked much deeper we we don't react to the to the present day where we look for some of the patterns and you know we we have a we have a company that is not just serving the people of this particular country the United States this is global we have global leaders all around the use all around the world using us in in different ways some you know more with the higher velocity some recognize more of the power some put out statements some lead conversations but it's looking at all those dynamics and not trying to hyper focus on any one particular one because if we do we're only building it for one portion of the population or only one perceived present-day crisis well what I'm trying to get at was like okay like when things come up like say if you find out that there's people from Isis they're using Twitter and they're using Twitter and posting things like what is the conversation like how do what do we do about this do we let leave this up do we recognize this as free speech do we only take it down if they're calling for murder or hate speech like what how do you handle that well it evolves I mean because like we first saw Isis were in the world to Isis and we needed to change our policy to deal with it what was the what was the initial reaction to it so once you realized that people from Isis we're making Twitter accounts and they were trying to recruit people and doing all these things what was the what was the thought process oh it's a question like what are we going to do about this we haven't experienced this before we need to nobody asked me you don't sleep pioneers no yeah but there there are people who have experienced in different forms in different mediums so we reach out to our government partners for instance or law enforcement partners we reach out to our pure companies to ask if they're seeing the same things that we're seeing we have a bunch of civil societies that we talk to to get their take on as well and we try to balance that across you know very spectrums whether it be you know more organizations that are more focused on preventing online harassment all the way to the ACLU and the FF who are protecting the First Amendment online so we won't we try to get as many perspectives as possible take that and then make some informed decisions but also realize that we're probably gonna make some mistakes along the way and all we can do to correct some of that is just be open about where we are that's probably where we failed to most in the past is we just haven't been open about our thinking process what led to particular decisions how our Terms of Service evolved in terms of service as an area in our industry is just it's a mess no one reads them you know you sign up for these services and you quickly hit accept yeah and we expect people to read these rules of the road but they haven't read them and have you ever read them I have read read Facebook's I have a read Facebook's yeah not on it I'm not on Facebook flat a Facebook right just kidding what about Instagram you've read theirs I was uh I was in the first ten users of Instagram really kevin was intern Kevin Systrom was an Internet odyo and I was one of the first investors of Instagram and loved the service I don't think I've ever read their Terms of Service mmm yeah that's what I'm saying even you even me but I read ours and you wanted things I noticed right away is you know you read our you read our Terms of Service and one of first things that we put at the top of the page was copyright and intellectual property protections mmm you go down you scroll down you see everything about violent threats and abuse and harassment and safety and it's not that the company intended for that to be the order it just we just added things going on but even a read of that puts forth our point of view like we're actually putting copyright infringement above the safety the physical safety of someone so we need to relook at some of these things and how they've evolved and how they reacted and but is it above just because it's listed a second I mean is there essentially all in the same one sheet there only one sheet when you when you bring it up when you discuss it first is that really critical they're all they're all part of the Terms of Service yeah but I think that ordering matters like what what do we consider to be most important right and we have to consider physical safety to the to be the one thing that we protect the most and so icicle threats physical threats Don saying daxing anything that impinges on someone's physical safety this is an area where I don't think technology and services like ours have focused on enough we haven't focused on the f-off platform ramifications of what happens online so what do you do like like here's a good for instance this situation with this young kid who had the maggot hat on and the Native American gentleman who was in front of him banging the drum and then people are calling for this kid's name they want his name they want his address including Kathy Griffin like how do you how do you handle something like that well because that's essentially request for daxing yeah and and that's that is a new vector that we haven't seen in mass and this these are these are the cases that bring up entirely new things so we have to study it we have to see how we reacted what happened with a network but this goes back to the incentives like we are incentivizing this very quick reaction and it's taking away from some some more of the like considered work that we need to do to really diagnose what's happening in the moment and it was it's such an interesting case study to see how that evolved over just 48 hours yes and that's one of the most fascinating new cycles or stories in the new cycle in quite a while because it's nuanced there's there's many different levels to it yeah and a lot of like really neat jerk reactions totally and but we helped that well it's just that's how some of the dynamics of the service work but is thanks for the service or is it the way people choose to use the service like if you are a thoughtful person you wouldn't just like for instance the original image that was distributed came from an account that's now banned right and so it was it was discovered that that account was a troll account what how does that happen and what what was the the thought process behind that because the image that they posted was a legitimate image it really did happen but wasn't it was a part of an actual occurring event so what why do you ban the person or the troll account that put it up I don't know about this particular case but it's likely that it was found there's there's a lot of what you see on the surface the Twitter and some of the actions that we take on the surface but where we spend a lot of our enforcement is actually what's happening underneath so in many cases we have trolls or people like the case that you mentioned whose sole purpose is just to harass or abuse or spread particular information and oftentimes see these accounts might be connected or they start one account that gets banned they start another account but we can actually see this through a network lens and we can actually see some of those behaviors so that might have been one of the reasons I'm not sure in in in that particular case but you know what the how do you know do you know because of IP addresses do you know because of the the variety of things so it could be it could be trying to use the same fund number same email address IP addresses device IDs all these things that we can use to to judge what's happening within the context so we do have a lot of occurrences of suspending or temporarily suspending accounts because of activities across accounts um and and that that happens a ton but what what I mean what I mean in the in that we're helping this right now is like some of the incentives like just just imagine seeing that unfold and when you see someone with one take it kind of emboldened something to follow along and then this mob kind of rules yeah so there has to be a way for us to incentivize a lot more you know more considered and more nuanced introspection of what's going on yeah give everybody mushrooms know how are you gonna get people to be more considerate I mean what what this is essentially your engineering social behavior right yeah provide more context like it in an example let's take Briggs it for example okay so if I followed a bunch of accounts that like like Boris Johnson who was constantly giving me information about reasons to leave I would probably only see that perspective nigel Faraj yeah and those and those a lot of folks just will not follow accounts that have a completely different perspective or a different influence a number of people do hopefully journalists do but most people won't do that work so this is the only tool we give people follow an account if however during that time you followed the hash tag you follow the hashtag vote leave 95% of conversation the tweets you see are all reasons to leave but there's a small percentage that shows a different perspective and that shows a different different reasoning we don't make it easy for anyone to do that and that is a lot or anyone to follow the habit of perspective follow the hashtag follow a topic follow an interest and because of that we help build an echo chamber right and and something that doesn't really challenge any perspective and not to say that we should force that upon people but we don't even make it easy for people to do in the first place so the way you do that today is you go this the Explorer tab you look you search for a hashtag or you tap into a hashtag and you can see all the conversations but that's that's work and most people just won't do the work they'll stay in their timeline they'll see what they need to see and I can certainly imagine you know why if I'm just following a bunch of people who have the exact same take on this it just continues to embolden embolden Boldin and they see nothing of a different perspective on the exact same at the exact same situation what's interesting to me is the difference between Twitter and Instagram essentially it's not just the photographs what's weird that has happened was there's their shitty people on Instagram as well I mean there's there's a lot of arguments and things along those lines but they don't overwhelm the the initial post whereas with Twitter on a different surface yeah its Instagram is a is a post I mean it's a post it's not really eliciting conversation it's illicit it's difficult to follow the conversations I don't think there's a conversation it's sometimes there is sometimes sometimes people are going back and forth about a particular subject that's discussed in the initial post but it's not it's not very clear yeah whereas with with Twitter it's only converse it's only conversation but even if there's a photograph even if somebody posts a photograph on Twitter and has conversation under it the photograph seems to be like of secondary importance you know it's super super fluid and super messy - yeah the thing is every on Instagram or any any blog you have this this post this statement and you have comments underneath whereas with Twitter everything is on the same surface right it's all one surface yeah my friend Kurt Metzger likes that about Facebook he says because in Twitter he goes I post something and then all these fucking morons post something and he goes you know Kurt he's very animated he's like and their shit looks like just like my shit it's all together I'll piled up he goes but if I post something on Facebook he goes I have this whole thing like this is the original statement and then underneath it yeah you fucking say whatever you want but no one's no one's reading that like they're reading the original initial post and it's clear that there's a differentiation between the initial post than the secondary post yeah I you know there's room for both models but I this conversation most conversations it's it's not you making a statement and me just reacting to them like the our conversation of all it's based on what we say we can interrupt one another we can you know we can completely change the subject I can take control of the conversation and the people who might find that interesting follow it and the folks that don't just stop listening whereas you can't do that in a post comment model yeah it's also text is so limited there it's I mean it's great for just getting out actual facts but it's also thinking it's just so close to thinking like there's no composition right you know and and that's a that to me is the most beautiful thing about Twitter but also something that you know can be uncomfortable like I I can compose my life on Instagram I can compose my thoughts within a Facebook post and they can look so perfect but the best of Twitter is just super raw and it's right it's right to the thinking process and I just think that's so beautiful because it gets took it gets to consciousness it gets to something deeper and I think that deeper how so how is it different than a post on Instagram or a post on Facebook the the speed demands you know the the the character can strength the speed kind of just demanded more conscious present focused thinking versus like stepping back and imposing a letter yeah and composing a letter and thinking about all the outcomes but oftentimes people do compose it as a letter and they break it up into separate 280 character posts yeah what was the thought processing going from 140 to 280 because I did one thing that I liked about 140 is that you can't be verbose yeah you can't just just ramble and you know like it's great for comics because it forces us to write jokes like with economy of words exactly we are we found a lot of resonance with with journalists because of headlines we found a lot of resonance with with comics because of the rhythm and we found a lot of resonance with hip-hop as well because of the bars and just the structure and the constraint allowed that that flow the the thinking was we looked at our you know languages around the world and and there's some languages like German 140 characters you can't really say much can't really say much at all right words are so long there are some languages like Japanese 140 characters is 140 words and what was interesting about Japan was Japan is one of our largest our largest countries we're bigger than Facebook there were ru not bigger than Facebook in America know what the fuck I don't even use Facebook sorry Facebook I don't either I mean I use it in terms of if I post something on Instagram it goes to Facebook yeah but when I go to Facebook it's it just seems like a lot ah but this isn't like Twitter to a lot of arguing but what I will this Twitter seems to be more fun if that makes any sense even though it's there's a lot of chaos when something one of my favorite things when someone posts something stupid and then underneath it is a bunch of gifs you say gifts are gifs I said gif does anybody know yes it gifs I say guess yeah its jury's out a bunch of gifts that are hilarious yeah like I'm just mocking someone relentlessly like though that is one of my favorite things about Twitter when someone like Donald Trump post something ridiculous and I'll go and I'll look at the responses like back it's a public conversation yeah as you can see our owner acts but like it's all the interesting thing about Twitter's is there's not one Twitter it's like you have politics Twitter which can be super toxic you have sports Twitter you have NBA Twitter you have MMA Twitter you have a UFC Twitter you have kpop Twitter you have black horse what are you a black Twitter that's Jamie's you have all these different Twitter's in you and you have a you have a completely different experience yes based on what Twitter you follow me participate in some of them were are like super engaging super funny some of them are you want to walk away from it yeah I got to a certain point where I couldn't read replies anymore I just mmm it's just not is not that it's that toxic the vast majority of interactions I have with people are super positive that may mean absolutely like more than 99% but it's I didn't I don't have time and I don't have time to be constantly responding to people and it just didn't the sheer numbers well I think when I got around 3 million ish followers I'm like I can't do this anymore it's just it's overwhelming like I don't have the resources yeah I I'm a huge believer in serendipity so you you you look at your replies once and you might see something that just like strikes you mm-hmm and that's enough you don't need to read through all of them yeah you might but I also believe that the most important things to come back up what I used to do a lot would I would go through my mentions and when people would essentially used it as almost a news aggregator go through my mentions that people would post cool stories and then I would retweet those and so because people knew that I would retweet them they would send me a lot of cool stuff so because of that because of reciprocating I got a lot of really cool stuff sent my way yeah you're pushing your pushing we're out to expand the network yeah and I reinforced it I just I wanted to thank people for posting cool stuff and they love the fact they would get a retweet and so they would send me like interesting science stories or you know very bizarre nature stories and I'd just be retweeting them all the time code um but then after a while I'm like mmm this is a lot of time so a lot of time so now essentially what I do is I just post something and I just kind of like way what but that I mean that that speaks to what we want to incentivize more we want more people contributing things back to the network back to the back to the public conversation and I I know it doesn't feel like this today for most people but my ideal is someone walks away from Twitter learning something and they're actually learning something entirely new I think it might be a new perspective that happens a lot it probably happens more often than we anyone we follow exactly it's all depending on the on the Twitter you follow and like the you know that health Twitter is amazing you know I learned some like I followed Rhonda Patrick and around asana and wim HOF and ice baths and Ben Greenfield and you just follow them and you just get all this new information about alternative views of how to stay healthy how to live longer and I I can't find that anywhere else yeah in one place like that and then it's not just them broadcasting when they retweet something or when they tweet something there's a whole conversation about it so you know some people say this is you know this has not been my experience or this is not this is not true for me or actually have you seen this connected thing and I I just go down this rabbit hole and I I learned so much but that's not the experience for everyone no well yeah it's not the experience for everyone and it's not really I don't think it's what everyone wants either sometimes people just like to go on there and talk shit I mean there's someone that's trapped in a cubicle right now strapped and they just want to go in there and get in arguments about gun control or you know whether or not Nancy Pelosi is the devil I mean this is this is what you know it serves a purpose for them yeah the thing that gets strange though is who's to decide you know there's thing this is there's this concept there's a discussion I should say where some people believe that things like Twitter or Facebook or any forum where you're having a public discussion should be considered almost like a public utility like anyone has access to the electric power even if you are you know even if you're a racist you still can get electricity and some people think that you should have that same ability with something like Twitter or the same ability with something like Instagram obviously this is we're in uncharted territory and you or you are in uncharted territory totally no one has been there before so who makes the distinctions when you see someone that it's saying something that you might think is offensive to some folks but not offensive to the person who's saying it maybe the person who's saying it feels like they need to express themselves and this is important to say and how do you decide whether or not this is a valid discussion or if this is air quotes hate speech which is a you know there's some things that are hate speech and there's sometimes people use the term hate speech and it's just a cheap way to shut down a conversation yeah we so the simple answer is we look at conduct we don't we don't look at the speech of so if we look at conduct we look at how the tool is being used and you're you're right in that like I think when people see Twitter they see and they expect it to be a public square they can go into that public square they can say whatever they want they can get on the pedestal and people might gather around them and listen what they have to say some of them might find it offensive and they leave the difference is there's there's also this concept of this megaphone and the megaphone can be highly targeted would Twitter as well right so it's not it's not the it's not the speech it's how its amplified so what do you do is like say let's let's say there's someone in the media let's say it's a prominent feminist and then you have a bunch of people or let's say just one person and their Twitter feed is overwhelmingly attacking this prominent feminists just consoling attacking or calling her a liar calling her this calling that when do you decide this is harassment when decide this is hate speech when like how do you immediately look at the concepts there's a fictional account right yes you know person we're talking about but in this for instance what what would dictate something that was egregious enough for you to eliminate them from your plot well that's a that's a that's a heavy action so that's the last resort but we look at the conduct we look at oftentimes as you said like the the probability of someone who is harassing one person it's highly probable that they're also harassing ten more people right so we can look at that behavior we can look at how many times this person is being blocked or muted or reported and based on all those all that data we can actually take some action but we also have to we have to correlate it with the other side of that because people go on and they coordinate blocks as well and they coordinate harassment and they and they coordinate I'm sorry not harassment but reporting reporting a particular account to get it shut down and to to take the voice off the service so these are the considerations we have to make but it's it's it all starts with conduct and all oftentimes we'll see coordinated conduct whether it be that one person opening multiple accounts or coordinating with multiple accounts that they don't own to you know go after someone and there's a bunch of vectors that people use retweet for that the quote tweet for that a lot as well like you know they'll quote tweet a tweet that someone finds and they'll say look at this idiot Twitter do your thing and then just this mob starts and goes and tries to effectively shut that person down so there's a bunch of tools we can use the permanent suspension is the last resort one of the things that we can do is we can down rank the replies so any of these any of these behaviors and conduct that looks linked linked we can actually push farther down in the reply chain so it's all still there but you might have to push a button to actually see it you might have to show more replies to actually see this harassing account or what might look like harassing language and this is manually done no this is this is all this is all automated its automated yeah yeah but how would you love the ranking in the and looking at and looking at the network is is automated right like in terms of down ranking is there a discussion as to whether or not this person's replies should be down ranked like how do you how do you figure that out it's it's a machine learning and deep learning model and they just say I did say I and they and they learned you know and we we look at we look at how these things are doing and where they make mistakes and then we improve it it's just constantly improving and constantly learning and does that feel like censorship to you like automated censorship because I mean who's to decide other than people whether or not something is valid well we're not we're not looking at the at the speech in this particular case we're looking at the conduct like on the conduct of like someone in fast velocity attacking someone else okay right so those are the things that our technology allows it changes the velocity changes how you know to broadcast a message that someone didn't really ask for and didn't want to hear we don't touch if I follow Joe Rogan you'll see every single tweet we don't touch it right right but that's an audience that you earn but in your replies page we have a little bit more room because this is a this is a conversation that starts up and some people just want to disrupt it and and all we're saying is we're gonna look at move in the disruption down not that it's hidden but it's still there but you know you just see it a little bit farther down like there was a what was the incidence with re I should text him right now get him to answer me in real-time but Ari Shaffir got kicked off of Twitter because he said something to Bert like Bert I'm gonna fuckin kill you Bert Kreischer being our good friend all of us are good friends and he's like you fucking dummy I'm gonna kill you or something because I record albums he said he was like gonna steal and I'm break him wanna go jokingly got mad Bert was pretending I think was all bullshit I don't think that really stole his rectum yeah he gave him back to him eventually yeah yeah yeah he's like I'm gonna fucking kill you so what happened there what probably happen there and I'm not sure the particular case but will probably happen there is someone might have reported that tweet one of our agents human agents without context of their friendship mm-hmm or that relationship saw it as a violent threat and took action on it right and those are the mistakes that we're going to make that's why we need an appeals process or Burton needs to keep his fucking greasy hands off Ahri's records right that's probably not gonna happen we we need to we need to make sure we need to make sure that we're reacting in the right way yeah like look we're going to make mistakes we're trying to that the problem with this system right now is most of the most of the work is actually and and the burden is actually on the victims of abuse while they're getting harassed mm-hmm so a lot of our system doesn't enforce or act unless these tweets are reported right so we don't take suspension actions or removal of content actions unless it's reported the algorithms rank and order of the conversation but they don't take suspension actions they don't take they don't remove content they might suggest to human to look at this who might look at our rules and look at the content and and try to look at the context of the conversation and then take action but we would like to move towards a lot more automated enforcement but more importantly how do we how do we highlight how do we amplify more of the healthier discussion conversation again not removing it I we're going to a world especially with technologies like blockchain that all content that exists that has ever created will exist forever you won't be able to take it down you won't be able to censor it it won't be centralized at all our role is around what we recommend based on your interest and based on who you follow and and and helping you to get into that on-ramp but if you look at the architecture it's a given that anytime something is created it's going to exist forever this is what blockchain helps enable down the line and we need to make sure that we're paying attention to that and also realizing that you know our role is like how do we how do we get people the stuff that they really want to see in the fine valuable that they'll learn from that they'll make them think that that will help them evolve the conversation as well now when you say amplify the messages that you deem to be more positive right like how do you decide that people decided people decide people decide it based on like are they engaging in replies are they are they retweeting it are they liking it are they sometimes it's really negative like sometimes the people that are engaging in are engaging because they're attacking someone so Dee is that valuable or is it just unfortunate it's valuable I mean every every signal is something that we can learn from and we can act on but it it's going to constantly evolve right it's these these these models that we have to build will constantly have to learn what the network is doing and and how people are using it and you know our goal is healthy contribution back to the public conversation that that is what we want we want to encourage people into more bigger informative global conversations that they learn from you like constantly aware of how much this is changing society and that you are one of the four or five different modalities that are radically changing society whether it's Facebook or Instagram or any of these social media companies it's radically changing the way people communicate with each other like there's a there's a a giant impact on the way human beings talk you know and see each other and the way we process ideas and the way we distribute information it's unprecedented there's never been anything like that before and you setting up something that you think is gonna be a group chat do you remember the early days when you would say like at Jack is going to the movies you would say like that's how we would say it I would say at Joe Rogan is on his way to dinner yeah that's how people would do at it it's fucking it was weird now that somewhere along the line that morphed in more because that's what the world wanted to do with it that's what that's where they wanted to take yeah and I just think it's so reflective of what the world is and in some cases what the world wants to be so it's a pathway for thinking just a pathway for people to get their thoughts out but a really powerful one an unprecedented method of distributing information it's really nothing ever been like this before no no and in it won't this this mode of communicating will not go away it'll just get faster it will become a lot more connected and that's why our work is so critical to figure out some of the dynamics at play that that that make it that that cause more negative outcomes and positive outcomes I think about it because well I think about it because it's it's just a hugely significant thing but I also think about it because of podcast because podcasts are in a similar way just no one saw it coming and the people that are involved in it or like what the fuck are we doing they're like me I'm like what am i doing like what is this yeah like for me it's like ooh boy I get to talk to guys like Ben Greenfield and and Jonathan hate and all these different people and learn some stuff you know I've clearly learned way more from doing this podcast than I ever would have learned without it no doubt about it unquestionably but I didn't I didn't fucking plan this so now all of a sudden there's this signal that I'm sending out to millions and millions of people and then people like well you have a responsibility I'm like oh great well I didn't want that I didn't want a responsibility to what-what I distribute I just wanted to be able to have a freak show just talk to people like whatever you know like there's certain people that I have on whether it's Alex Jones or anyone that's controversial where people will get fucking mad why are you giving this person a platform I go okay mm-hmm I didn't think about it that way and I don't think that's what I'm doing I think I'm talking to people and you can listen yeah but it's giving that person a platform because they said well no they'll tone down they're like Milo you Napoles that was one arguments people gave me like he toned down his platform when he was on your show so he could get more people to pay attention to him like okay but he also talked about he that was one of the reasons why he was exposed was my show because he talked about that it's okay to have sex with underage boys if they're gay because there's like a mentor relationship between the older gay man and the young people like what the fuck are you talking about and that was a big part of why he's kind of been removed from the public conversation that was there was one of the thing and then there's the discussion like well what is that what is removing someone from the public conversation if someone is very popular and they've have all these people that like to listen to them like what is the responsibility of these platforms whether it's YouTube or Twitter or or anyone what is their responsibility and to decide whether or not someone should or shouldn't be able to speak and this is a thing that I've been struggling with and I've been bounced around inside my own head and I see that you guys struggle with it and pretty much everyone does YouTube does and it's um it is a hugely significant discussion that is left to a very you know relatively small amount of people and this is why this discussion of what is social media is it's something that everybody has a right to or is it something that should be restricted to only people that are willing to behave and carry themselves in a certain way I believe it's something that everyone has a right to everyone has a right to but you still ban people like say like like Alex Jones you guys were the last guys to keep Alex Jones on the planet form you were the last ones no yeah I believe you hung in there until he started harassing you personally right no no he he did not into your house he yeah you know he did very different things on our platform first as the others okay so we saw this domino effect over a weekend of one platform banning him and then another another another in very very quick succession right and you know people I think would have assumed that we would just have followed he didn't violate our Terms of Service right and afterwards he did and and we have you know we have a we have a policy and if if you know that there's a violation we take enforcement actions one might be asking the account holder to delete the tweet another might be a temporary suspension another might be a permanent suspension so what you saying is so like let's use in terms of like him saying that Sandy Hook was fake he did not say that on the platform he did not say that on Twitter he only said that on his show I don't know I don't know I don't know all the mediums he said it in well what we're looking at is the is a is a conduct and what he did on our platform so what did he do on your platform that was like that you all were in agreement that is enough I'm not I'm not sure what the what the actual like you know violations were but we have we have a set number of actions and if they keep getting if device if an account keeps violate in terms of service ultimately it leads to permanent suspension and when all the other platforms were taking him off we didn't find those we didn't we didn't find those violations and they weren't reported but again it goes back to a lot of our model people weren't reporting a lot of the tweets that may have been in violation on our service and we didn't act on them right like a good instance is what's going on with patreon I'm sure you're aware of the sargon of akkad thing he did a podcast a long time ago I believe six months or so ago where he used the n-word and the way he used it is actually against white nationalists and he also said a bunch of other stuff and they decided patreon decided that what he said on a podcast was enough for them to remove him from the platform even though he didn't do anything on their platform there that was egregious and also they had previously stated that they were only judging things that occurred on their platform yeah there's been a giant blowback because of the because people are saying well now you're you're essentially policing and not based on his actions just on concepts and the the communication that he was using the way he was talking yeah you're you are eliminating him from being able to make a living and that you're doing this because he does not fit into your political paradigm the way you want to view the world he used the world differently this is an opportunity for you to eliminate someone who you disagree with yeah yeah I mean that I don't know the nuances of their policy but like we we have to pay attention to folks who are using Twitter to shut down the voices of others right that's where it gets weaponized and we also have to pay attention to where people are using it that put other folks in physical danger and that is where we need to be most severe but otherwise everyone has a right to these technologies and I think they also have a right to make sure that they have a very simple and open read of the rules and and we're not in a great state there are our rules and our enforcement can be extremely confusing to people what has been the one thing that came up that was perhaps the most controversial like I know my friend sam harris was trying to get you guys to ban Donald Trump he was saying if they follow your Terms of Service I just did a podcast with him that should come out today or tomorrow he's I love them to death but what he was trying to do was like saying hey he's threatening nuclear war like he's saying hey Korea my bombs are bigger than your bombs like what else does the guy have to do to get you to remove him from the platform when you guys saw that what was your reaction to that and was there an internal discussion about actually banning the president United States well so the so two things are one it was a context that presidents of this country have used similar language in different mediums they use it on radio they use it on television it's not just through Twitter and even if you were looking you were to look at the presidency of Obama it wasn't exactly the same tone in this exact same language but there were threats around the same country and we have to take that context into consideration so the second thing is that we need the most controversial aspect of our rules and our Terms of Service is probably this clause around public interest in newsworthiness we're powerful figures or public figures might be in violation of our Terms of Service but the tweet itself is of public interest yes there should be a conversation around it and that is probably the thing that people disagree with the most and where we have a lot of internal debate but we also have some pretty hard lines if we had a global leader including the president United States make a violent threat against a private individual we would take action we we always have to balance out with like is this a is this something that the public has interest in and I believe generally the answer is yes it's not going to be in every case but generally the answer is yes because we should see how our leaders think and how they act in essentially forms voting that informs the conversation then forms whether we think they're going to they're doing the right job or we think that you know they should be they should be voted out well it it's very important to see how someone uses that platform and when someone uses it the way he uses it and then becomes president and continues to use it that way that's when people like what he's been consistent and I think I think he joined in in 2009 2012 yeah you look at all of his tweets all the way back then and it's pretty consistent yeah I mean he likes to install people on Twitter it's fun no it's just I never thought he would keep doing it I thought once he became president maybe he just lock it down try to do a good job for the country and then you know after four years or eight years just go back to his old self fuck you fuck the world fuck this yeah and but no he's he's he's just kidding it's just in one way it's hilarious see as a comedian I think it's awesome because it's just it's so hilariously stupid it's so preposterous that even has the time to talk about Jeff Bezos is fair and the fact that he got caught with the National Enquirer getting text messages and calls him Jeff bozo like don't you have shit to do man but as a comedian I am a gigantic fan of folly almost against my better judgment I like watching it's I watch I like watching disasters I like watching chaos when I see nonsense like that I'm like oh Jesus like I'm drawn like a moth to a flame but on the other part of me is like man this sets a very bizarre tone for the entire country because one of the things about Obama like Obama or hate Obama he was very measured very articulate obviously very well educated and I think that that aspect of his presidency was very good for all of us because he represented something that was of a very high standard in terms of his ability to communicate his access to words the way the way he measured his words and held himself I think that that's good for us that's parishioner votes yeah it's like look at that guy he's talked better than me that's why he's the president but you know you see Trump II like he's doesn't talk better than me he does he doesn't use Twitter better he's not he's just this fucking madman but isn't it important to understand that yes I see it as I to it hopefully that informs opinions and actions a hundred percent that's my point that's my point it's like that this is this weird gray area where I think overall I definitely support your decision to not not ban him for violating your Terms of Service like you we need to know yeah you know and it's how do you know how many accounts are BOTS how many how do you know how many accounts are from a Russian troll farm yeah how do you know that so this is a real challenge and something that we're we're trying to wrap our heads around but like one of the things we're trying to do is like let's scope the problem down a bit look let's use the technology we have available to us like face ID like touch ID like the biometrics stuff to identify the humans humans knows that because face IDs not really a valid is it available to you guys do you know you just leaked something we shouldn't no no we haven't we haven't used it yet but you can use it for things like is this human operating this I'd say use it for that since it's completely locked into the local device we don't have access to images of your face or what not but the operating system can tell us that this is the legit owner of this phone and therefore it is it is a human and Technology always has to change people will find ways around that and whatnot but if we go the opposite direction and we look for the bots the problem with looking for the bots is people assume that they just come through our API but the scripting has become extremely sophisticated people can script the app can script the website and make it look very very human mm-hmm so we're we're going after this problem first trying to identify the humans as much as we can utilizing these technologies you know this is is live right now these are these are considerations that we're making and and trying to understand like what the impact would be and and how we might evolve it but we we need to because that information would provide context for someone like this is an actual human that I'm talking to and I can invest more time in it or I can just ignore the thing because it's meaningless now is Apple willing to share that with you I mean when you're talking about biometrics fingerprints or face not the not the data it's just the operating system verifies that there's an individual as an individual and it's unlocking you know like like you know when when you use the are cash app uses us right so squares cash app when you want to make a transfer to someone when you want to send someone money or when you want to buy Bitcoin we turn on face ID and you verify that you are you and you are the owner of the phone and and then it goes we don't get images of your face we don't see who you are oh that's what you want me to think I know that's how lockdown by the operating system should be right sure what has there ever been in any consideration to not allowing people to post anonymously well like what you said earlier about journalists and whistleblowers that is biblical so look at a look at platforms that have a real names policy look at Facebook right are the problems any different I don't know cuz I don't go there before I understand there's a lot of still a lot of arguing there it's the same a lot of political argument if they're the same vectors same patterns that's older it's like older in general it seems I also Naughton really hanging out there but it seems a little bit older it's a lot of Grammys looking at pictures of their kids grandkids and stuff that's what it's made for it's connecting it's connecting with the people that you know and and that to me is the biggest difference for Twitter it's connection with people you don't know well you find interesting and like it's around it's around topics and stuff that you find that you want to learn more about when you saw Zuckerberg testifying and in in realizing like how this platform is being used and what are the dangers of this and then you see these senators that really don't know what the fuck the technology is or it's it really highlights how we wrapped this really yeah well not just a gap a gap in the critical understanding of how these things work and what they are in terms of like how these really important politicians who are the ones who are making these decisions as to whether or not someone has violated laws or whether or not something should be curbed or regulated and they don't really even understand what they're talking about no I mean there's there's a few people do because they're not they're not using it directly they're not using in the way that people are using it every single day and have the same experience that people have every single day and you know in terms of regulatory and and our regulators and our governments I you know we I think the conversation is often about regulators will come in and start writing rules and and setting expectations for how companies or services might behave but there's a role for the company to educate and there's a role for the company to educate on like what technology makes possible whether it be positive and and also some of the negatives that become possible as well so I think we have a role to help educate and to and help make sure that we're you know really we're pushing towards what I think the job of regular regulator is which is number one protect the individual number two level the playing field and make sure that those two things are not compromised by special interest trying to protect their own domain or profits or or dominance within a particular market what do you mean by level the playing field of the playing field so that an individual has the same opportunity that someone else might have or a company might have so okay so like anybody know anyone would account anyone can have a twitter account and you know they have at least you know an equal opportunity to contribute to it and whatever they do with it will change the change the outcome some people might become very popular because they're saying stuff people want to hear some people won't see any following whatsoever because they're not adding anything original or interesting or or or different in terms of perspective where do you see this going when you look at these kind of emerging technologies not something necessarily emerging any more established now but still you know a new thing in relative terms of human history where do you see this going and does it get more intrusive does it get deeper into our lives like what what when you look at new technologies like augmented reality and things along those lines do you see new possibilities and new things that make things even more complicated I mean yeah I mean we just have to assume that we we naturally use more and more technologies more and more things become open more and more things increase their velocity there's more communication not less like this is not going away and it's just a question of what we do with it so we're where I wanted to go is and where I want Twitter specifically to go is I you know I I think it's existential right now that we we we have global conversations about some things that will become crisis climate change being one of them there's no one nation state that's going to solve that problem alone economic disparity being another the the rise of AI and job displacement and and just like us offloading decisions to these to these algorithms those are the things that that no one nation no one community is going to solve alone it takes the entire world to do so so I want to make sure that we're doing our best to get people seeing these global conversations and ideally participating in them because it helps it helps us solve the problems faster I just believe that more open society allows us to solve problems much faster so you in many ways see Twitter as having some sort of a social responsibility and this distally totally totally yeah and I think a big part of is like right now like how are we how are we ensuring that there is more healthy contribution to that global conversation and you know and I just think it's it's so critical that we start talking about the things that are facing all of us not just one nation I do think you know that that's where our current model really puts the world at a disadvantage because it incentivizes more of the echo chambers which lead to things like nationalism instead of taking the broader picture and looking at what's happening around the world to all people to all of humanity what do you do though to balance the conversation or what responsibility do you think you have to balance a conversation in terms of the way conservatives view it versus the way liberals and progressives view it down in shells there is there a responsibility do you have a responsibility or is it just leave it up to the people and let them figure it out the same way they figured out hashtags and and ever else I I think we have a responsibility to make it easier to do that easier house right right now it's just it's just too hard most most people will not particular mindset they will they will not venture out they will not break their bubble um but if you because it's right now on the surface is just so hard to do that I I can only follow accounts and I have to I have to look into and just imagine like you know trying to get an understanding of your own politics people can't just look at your bio they have to look through all your tweets they have to listen to a bunch of your podcasts and whatnot and that's a bunch of work if we shift it more towards topics and interest at least we have the potential to see a bunch more perspectives we see do that though simplest thing is like follow a hashtag follow a topic like why can't you just follow warriors Twitter or you know NBA Twitter why do you have to go and find all the coaches and the players and and the team so we can do that we can help make that a whole lot easier for folks so there's something like brexit or something that so if you go to hashtag brexit you're gonna get the whole conversation you're gonna get the pros the cons the left the right the whole deal the centrists you get everybody versus following the people that you already follow that agree with what you think the probability is higher that you'll get more you'll get more variety perspective and not even don't even follow brexit follow vote leave if you want to leave but within that topic there might be some dissenting opinions and you get to choose whether you those inform you whether that emboldened your position or not but and and again I'm not saying that we should force that upon it but it's not easy to even do that today right the only tool we give you is finding and following the accounts and that what people search hashtags they do search assets right they don't they send their timeline I mean it's a small percentage of people the people that really know Twitter know how to do that but most people they follow an account and they stay in the timeline and what their world is their timeline the hashtags can be corrupted too I mean otally they can be gamed yeah be gamed yeah I've taken over I took over hashtag vegan cat go to hashtag what is what is that it's a rap that's mine now bit in my last my last Netflix special about a woman who said a bunch of horrible things to me because I put a picture up on Instagram of some deer meat I wrote this is some meat from a deer that like to kick babies and was about to join Isis and then I wrote hashtag vegan which was a mistake right to write hashtag vegan tomorrow but the hashtag vegan people went fucking crazy and came after me because I entered their timeline with meat if you could hashtag vegan cat it's all either pictures of see like it says Joe Rogan right thank you I haven't laughed that hard tomorrow hashtag vegan cat it's people that are feeding their fucking cat vegan food and they're all dying and I in the special I say every cat looks like it's living in a house with a gas leak like they're always like laying there like where the fuck is the real food but this is real like this is the conversation but the thing is if someone does something like that like you can like pick a person you know whatever that person is whatever they're doing if they have a hashtag that they utilize all the time for their movement or whatever someone could mock them and then use that and if it's a public figure or someone who's got a prominent voice then all of a sudden that hashtag becomes people just take it over and start mocking them with that hashtag but it has to be done the mouse I mean it has to be coordinated and sometimes people like figure out how to game the system and coordinator in a amplify that message in a unfair way and and that's what that's what our systems are trying to recognize how sick did that cat look the poor fucking cat that was a real one that was a real hashtag vegan cat well it's poor bastards so when you look back at emerging social media like we go all the way back to myspace right MySpace you got Tom Tom was sitting there and you're in your top eight and you know people would like post music that they liked and it was never political it was very often very surface and for comics it was a great way to promote show and it was it was an interesting way to see things yeah but it was it was like like the seed that became Twitter or Facebook or this is one of them I'd I think we at least for us like we got more of our roots from a Ola and some messenger and I CQ mmm because it was you know you remember the status message where you said like I'm in a meeting or I'm listening this music our movie yeah that was the inspiration and and what we took from that was being able to like if you could do that from anywhere not bound to a desk but you could do that from anywhere and you could do from your phone and you could just be roaming around and say you know I'm I'm at Joe Rogan's studio right now that is cool I don't need my computer I'm not bound to this unchain to this desk I can I can do it from anywhere and then the other aspect of of instant messenger was of course chat so one of the things that the status would do is you might you might say like you know I'm listening to Kendrick Lamar right now and I might hit you up on chat and say like what do you think of the new album but now it's all public so it's just it everyone can see it that's that's the biggest difference and that's that to me is what Twitter is it might myspace was it was profiles and you know people organized around these profiles and this network that developed between people and that is facebook facebook facebook optimized the hell out of that and they scaled the world we we were something very different we you know we we started with that simple status and then people wanted to talk about it we we decided that it should be on the same surface it shouldn't be suburbian to the to the to the status it should be part of that flow and that's what makes Twitter you know so fluid now when you look at this sort of metamorphosis or this evolution between those initial social media whether it's AOL Instant Messenger that eventually became like CQ and what was that one that we would use that gamers would use that it was like a live stream sort of message board no it was like for a while people using teamspeak but uh no no it wasn't your well in that recent wasn't that wasn't teamspeak it was like you would go there and share files and stuff and and people would would would go like if I supply a lot of online video games and we play on teams and we have teams go play other teams and he would use this sort of it was like a it wasn't a message board because it was all in real time what the fuck was it called no all right forget it yeah anyway guys would go there and you could send people files through it yeah and the teams would go and meet and it would be a chat like an online chat that would be in real time yeah it's yeah I mean we have a lot of our routes and AOL and semester but also like IRC Internet Relay Chat and Usenet which were the you know these old internet seventies technology IRC is what I was talking about IRC yeah okay okay yeah so Internet Relay Chat is like this giant chat room that anyone can join and so range around topics and that's what's interesting about that is you can see people typing you see it occurring in real time you see it popping up in real time yep you know just I wonder like what is the next evolution of this because because no one saw anything going from ICQ to twitter no one saw anything going from that to Instagram and to where we're at right now where it really does flavor the conversation of our entire culture I mean it before it was just a thing that was happening that was happening on people's computers now it's the thing that's happening on people's computers and now phones and now your whole life it's it's it's a very different influence yeah and I wonder because everything does accelerate things constantly move forward and become more and more more and more integrated into our life experience and I wonder what is the next stage of this if I mean like the the secular trends and you know you look at technology and you look at technologies like like blockchain for instance and I think you know we're we're moving to a world where anything created exists forever that there's no centralized control over who sees what that you know these these these models become completely decentralized and all these barriers that we that exist today aren't as important anymore what do you think of something like gab like gab seems to be a response to the fact that some people are getting banned from other platforms and they're just allowing anybody to come on say anything they want you know the downside of that is of course the most horrible people are gonna be able to say anything they want with no repercussions the good side is anybody can say whatever they want yeah I haven't studied them too much but I do know that they have taken action on accounts as well they have suspended accounts and they have they have learned a service as well what have they suspend that accounts for I don't know it's it's probably conduct related it's probably it might be daxing you know probably right but it's just it's just a question of like you know the rules and if you agree to the rules then you know you sign up for the service and if if not there will be other services but like it I you look at you look at the trends and I think you know and certainly things become a lot more public certainly things become a lot more open certainly the the berries and the boundaries that we have in place today become less meaningful and I think there's a lot of positives in that and I also think there's a lot of danger that we need to be mindful of now you as a CEO as a guy who's running this thing what what has this been his experience in like for you because I got to imagine that it wasn't anything that you predicted no one predicted Twitter right now so to all the sudden have this responsibility Witter changes everything and you're a young guy how old are you 42 that's young to be in control of that much like what and to have it over the time of what has it been 11 years 13 years well there's 13 in March Hill yeah so you were really fucking young yeah like what is that been like for you it's been a it's been both beautiful and scary and comfortable and learning it's just been a ton of learning and evolving and like it it shows me every single day where I need to push myself and what I don't know and and I I think a big part is like just the realization that we're not gonna be able to do this alone and I don't think we have to either that these are these are what the technologies that continue to allow is we can if we have to have all the answers around enforcement or policy what not we're not going to serve the world we have aspirations to serve every single person on the planet and we we have aspirations to you know be the first consideration for the global public conversation and you know if we're the bottleneck for all this we're not going to reach those aspirations so it's just thinking deeply about how we might distribute more of this work and decentralize more of it and look at look at you know the platform itself and like what we need to change to reach that reality and I think we got to look really deep and foundational is it it goes back to you know the your question on 140 one of the things that we saw was you know we shifted to 280 characters and that you know this 140 characters is so sacred you know it became this cultural thing and and I was in love with it and so many people are in love with it but one of the things we noticed as we moved to 280 is that the vast majority of tweets that are broadcast don't go above 140 even with that limitation raised but where they do go above 140 is in replies when people reply they tend to go over the 140 character limit and even bump up into the 280 limit and what did a lot what we've seen it allow is just more nuance in the conversation it allows people to give more context and and and kind of just get their experience on the table a little bit more whereas 140 did not allow that so we have seen that increase the health of those conversations in the discussion so it's stuff like that that we need to question and not hold so sacred is there any consideration to expanding it further now right now we were how about a million characters no well we don't have edit tweets right now so we that's good or bad well if you can't edit a 140 characters you're gonna be really pissed off if you write a million characters you can add those things you know what I would like I would like edit the ability to edit like if you make a typo or something like that but also the ability for people to see the original yeah like edit but see the original like say we're looking at exactly that oh we're looking at exactly that the reason we don't have it in the first place is we were born on SMS we were born on text messaging when you send a text you can't take it back right so when you send a tweet it goes to the world instantaneously right you can't take it back so when we exist anyway I mean no matter what if you send someone something even if you an Instagram people are gonna know the original yeah they screenshot it and they yeah you know they do the thing but like you could build it such that you know maybe we introduced a five-second two 30-second delay in descending and within that window you can edit I'm gonna need more time than that dude if I fuck something up I like someone has to tell me but man you you misspelled that word ah shit did I god damn it these two times autocorrect gets yeah totally but the issue with going longer than that it takes that real-time nature and the conversation will flow out of it like so and then we're delaying these tweets and like when you're watching UFC are you watching like Warriors basketball a lot of a lot of the great Twitter is like just like in the moment just like you know it's the roar of the crowd it's like you know looking across at someone you're in this virtual stadium with and just saying like oh my god that shot can you believe it but isn't isn't clarity more important because you're not gonna depend on the context yeah can I have the ability to communicate quickly yeah but you also have the ability to clarify that's that's where we need to really pay attention because if you're if you're in the context of an NBA game you want to be fast and you just want to be at the moment you just you know you want to be raw but if you're in the context of considering what the president just did or making a particular statement then you probably need some some more time and and we can be dynamic there what's interesting to me is how few people use video like I thought you guys have video on Twitter Michael a bunch of people gonna be making videos and putting those up on Twitter and it's not it's not that often it depends on who you follow it it's huge for some aspects of Twitter it's it's it's less so and others but what aspects is it huge for a lot of a lot of sports I mean we see a lot of like just the the replays and the recaps right for sure you know aspects of a particular shot that people want to comment on I don't like I think it's dangerous for us to to focus too much on the medium whether it be images or gifts or video it's it's more about the conversation around it like that's what we want optimized for it's definitely very popular for sports and in Folly and you know there's a what is a there's there's a bunch of animal attack videos the yeah natures metals a good one and hold my beer that's another good one I mean it's all videos but what I meant was people making a video talking yeah that's something yeah this is what I was trying to say what I think is this in that blah blah blah you don't see a lot of that and I thought maybe that would be something that people would adopt more it's a different speed you know and I think like the the consumption of video I mean you see this in the technology right now like people are subtitling every single video because people might be an environment where they can't turn the audio on or like a video like I have to scrub through to see what's interesting with text I can just see it and there's it allows for a lot of serendipity to find something that I probably wouldn't have seen unless I watched the whole damn video so like the ability to clip something the ability to like index in I think is really critical so it's not to me it's not about the format it's about the the use case in the context of urine now going back to the responsibility that you guys have and you in particular like when this became what it is now and when it became evident that it became this gigantic way of changing the way human beings communicate with each other was there ever any regret or was there ever a moment where you're like what the fuck have I gotten myself into I mean um there's the I'm always reflective of where I am and what I'm doing I think that the the biggest has been around twofold one how the dynamics of the service allow it to be weaponized in order to silence someone else or to drive them off the service entirely which goes against the entire concept of free speech and free participation like we we just can't stand for that we we need to make sure that everyone feels that they have an opportunity at a voice and when you have these coordinated attacks it just it's not fair the second is around you know this this concept of an echo chamber and the filter bubble I just I don't feel personally good about that I don't feel I don't feel that we thought that through enough in the early days I think we should have moved towards biasing the service towards topics and interests much much sooner than we're now considering doing now when you have these considerations when you take these actions do you consult with psychologists or sociologists or historians or people that try to put in perspective for you what the ramifications of each individual move would be I try to read as much as possible I try to talk to as many people as possible just get a completely different perspective and is there any internal disagreement about actions that you take oh yeah there's there's always there's always debate there's always debate but I think my role is to ask ask questions and make sure like are like what what is our goal here what are we trying to do you know and that evolves that of that evolved that evolves like and is this over the long term going to be a net positive for all humans all humanity like how do we balance the considerations of you know how we serve everyone and like how do we get down to something how do we get down to a fundamental answer in a central answer and and that to me is where the real truth is is when you can get to something foundational but I like you know I like conversations with as many people from as many different fields as possible and getting the perspective on it so I ask questions all the time it's interesting the way you're phrasing this too that you you are looking at this as a method to save or to hurt it to help people to serve people you're looking at this as a way that you can benefit society the society can benefit from your platform can benefit from this this ability to communicate you're not just looking at it as a tech company that has to remain profitable and it's one of the more interesting things about tech companies to me I mean there's been a lot of criticism may be justified in some ways that tech companies all lean left but what is interesting to me is that name another corporation that willingly of its own choice takes that into consideration that they want to serve the world and serve culture in a beneficial way regardless of profit yeah I mean because you can you're not really selling anything right you guys have a platform obviously it's financially viable but you're not you're not selling things well I mean we we do our models based off people's attention yeah and and they're paying us with their attention and that's extremely valuable and something that we need to really really honor but I agree with you I mean like look at look at Tesla you know they're you know I I just listened to the the recent earnings call and one of the things that yuan said was look there are two reasons for Tesla number one is to advance you know different sources of energy and more renewable sources of energy because it's a fundamental and existential crisis that's facing all humanity and number two is to advance autonomy because it'll save lives and give people time back and you know then you start talking about how to make that possible and that's where you know our business comes in how do we how do we make possible and we we have a we have a great business we we need to improve a bunch of it but we it it serves what we think are larger purposes which is serving the public conversation we want to see more global public conversations we want to we want our technology to be used to make the world feel a lot smaller to help see what common problems we have before us and ideally you know how we can get people together to solve them faster and solve them better you also seem to be embracing this responsibility that you're you're helping to evolve culture and this is part of the providing this method to communication of communication rather it's helping to evolve culture and this is a this is something that is really only applicable to tech companies in some strange way and it's weird that so many of them share this like I was personally a little weirded out when Google took out don't be evil like that was a big part of their operating model they take that out yes yes right make sure that I don't want you sued pretty sure they removed that from what would you call that there there are operational directive like what is wasn't a code of conduct of conduct and it's not there anymore right they removed it so yeah that's the article that says they removed the clause and this is a weird thing to tell people not to be evil there's another way they changed it to do the right thing yeah oh well what does that mean the fuck does do the right thing mean do the right thing so you can make more money you know like hey we're gonna make money we'll do the right thing it makes more money yeah I mean it's I mean that's that's why like that's why this openness is so critical I mean that's why I like the public comment to me the public conversation is so important is we can talk about stuff like that and like there will be companies forming today that look at objectives and mandates like that and base their whole culture around it and is that the right idea well no but if we're not talking about it we won't be able to answer that question well it's also interesting because Google is so all-encompassing right you have Gmail you have Android I mean that is they are the number one operating system for mobile phones in the world on top of being a search engine there's so much involved in that company and again like almost all tech companies they heavily lean left and they because they had that don't be evil as a part of their code of conduct it seemed like something that was a good idea to have like and it sort of defined what I was talking about that tech companies are uniquely progressive yeah I mean I I don't know I don't know what makes that I think um no matter what like we the Internet allows for a very healthy skepticism of nearly everything yeah um I'm from I'm from Missouri it's a show me state are you yeah I'm from st. Louis Missouri we're all skeptics my mom was a Democrat my dad was a Republican my dad listen to Rush Limbaugh and Hannity all the time I found myself somewhere in the middle but one of the things I appreciated we had a ton of fights and arguments and yell and matches around the kitchen table but like I appreciate the fact that I we could have them and I did it I felt safe to do so and I didn't feel like I mean obviously than my parents but they weren't judging me because of what I said and they didn't force you to be a Republican or a you know like I I think they were good at least showing different perspectives even in you know this in this union that that they have and I don't know it developed it developed a skepticism in me that I that I think is is healthy and I have a lot of skepticism of companies like ours and leaders like me I think that's right I think that's right and people should and we I mean I was I was I or was formed through a lot of the ideals of the you know not I just fell in love with what it made possible and I I never ever want to run afoul of of those ideals and and you know the the the removal of barriers and boundaries and and the connection that we have because of it and I you know I I think often and reflect often about my role and the centralization of my role and of our company and I I want to I want to figure out and help figure out like how we can continue to add massive value and and be an amazing business which is is us and will always be us but at the same time be a participant participatory force in this greater good that the Internet has really started and it's not it's not led by any one individual or any one company and that's the beauty of it and I want to I want to make sure that we find our place in that and we can also contribute massively to it and then I think we can it's just gonna take a lot of work a lot of introspection and a lot of experimentation a lot of making mistakes and failures too well and it's very encouraging that you have that attitude because you know a lot of people I think in a similar situation would try to control the narrative they would try to reinforce their own particular perspective on things and try to get other people to adopt it or try to push it and I think it is it's very important to just have this open discussion and and I think it's very important to review your own thoughts and ideas and all the best ways to do so put it out there put it out there and have other people review peer review is a great process and that's where's the way this podcast has evolved more than probably anything yeah that's the thing I mean you you you did this because you want to learn from people and and that the platform that you've created millions get to learn from it as well and that's just so amazing like I learned from your podcast all the time and in that's what technology makes possible but with that power also comes ramifications and if we're not talking about the ramifications and like at least being open about what we know and what we don't know and I think we're I think we state and post a lot more of what we know rather than what we don't know is so interesting once you guys steal don't be evil put that your own what is that telling our employees to do don't be it's real simple don't be a dick yeah I mean how do we get deeper and just like seeing more conversation around what is quote unquote evil have you guys considered expanding your influence and other venues like you know Google started off as a search engine now it's fucking everything how do you guys considered doing something similar I think we probably did too much of that early on and that's what led to a bunch of issues from from a corporate standpoint we're just trying to do too much it too many times I don't know we were trying to be everything to everyone and like you know we we had a you know a video thing and we had we're looking at gaming stuff and messaging and it lost focus of what we were good at what we're good at is conversation and what we're good as is is public conversation so we now have as a company we have just such a amazing focus on what that means and how that evolves and there's just there's some really cool things that we can do there like we have this we have this app called periscope and one of the things that we're discovering is like a lot of people are using it to podcast a lot of people are using it to share their thoughts and these people come in and you know they chat and have a conversation and one of the things we did recently as we allowed the audio to play in the background it's super simple but what we found was that people didn't necessarily want to watch the the video of people talking they just want to hear what they're saying and that just opened the door for more types of use cases and there's some really exciting things coming out with periscope that I think add a new dimension to what conversation looks like and how it is experienced and how it evolves and those are the things I get really excited about it's like how can we make conversation better and and how you know how how do we how do we make it feel more live how do we make it feel more electric and how do we bring new new technology into it that just opens a door for an entirely new way of talking and and that's the thing that I think has been most educational to me about Twitter is we you know as we as we talked about we started with this idea of sharing what was happening around you and then people told us what they wanted to wanted it to be and it became this conversational medium it became this interest networked and it became a it became a thing that was entirely new and it you know we observed it and we learned more and more of what it wanted to be in we as we get deeper and deeper that we're gonna be surprised by some of the technologies that we thought would be used in this way but it turns out that the the massive use case and the resonant use case in the fundamental use case is going to be created right before our eyes by the people using it now did you guys a choir periscope or was reacquired periscope and what was the thought process when you requiring it we we like the live nature of it we like the the broadcast aspect why do you I can why keep it as periscope why not have it be like Twitter Live there's a there's a specific community on on on periscope and I think it's interesting from an experimentation standpoint we can play with ideas there it's a small Tigers I think uses it better than anybody yeah he's he's he's really good at it and he's he's one that I think has figured out you know just the the knack behind it you know he started every one of them with with this simultaneous sip of coffee yeah he gets his listeners and his viewers engaged right away and then he just goes on and then every now and then he'll you know look at the comments and and riff off them so that's people build up to like he he'll announce that he's going on and then wait a little while say hello to some people yep then once a bunch of people are in the room then he starts talking yeah and I just I find I find that so interesting because that is the future of conversation it's looking at the patterns it's looking at what people are trying to do with the thing and then you build technology around it and that becomes that becomes the next big thing and we just have to we have to hone our power of observation hone our power of like connecting the dots and looking all the patterns and what people are it's what's the question behind the question what's what's the statement behind the statement that they're making and if we can get good at understanding some of those fundamental essential things then we've reached we've we've at least created the probability that most people in the world will find it useful and find it valuable Joey Diaz is the other person who uses to periscope better than anybody alive but he just gets a nose he just gets baked it just gives you a morning was he called morning bong the morning join the morning joint yeah he'll smoke a joint or smoke a bowl in the morning and then just sort of let everybody know do you in sometimes mine doing something and sync with one with with more people is interesting like a we've we've had some folks who are interested in doing meditations through periscope that's a great idea you can I mean if you if you look at at the surface level you can't imagine anything more boring than like watching someone meditate but if you're actually meditating with them mmm there's something powerful about it and like what can we do to improve that experience what about people using it for group workouts is anyone doing that I'm sure it's happened and I haven't seen it personally but I'm sure it's happening how much more people do you have on Twitter than periscope a lot a lot it's uh it's one of those things that I personally just have a lot of conviction around and I have a lot of belief and the format and I you know every now and then we don't have instant hits we just requires a lot of patience hmm and we need to really learn what it wants to be and sometimes that takes time and you know I think often times I've certainly done this we you know we shut down we shut down things a little bit too early we did this at square-like we had this amazing technology and a pile of called square wallet and it allowed you to you know you link your credit card and you have all these merchants around you here in LA and you could walk up to a coffee merchant and as you walked up your name would pop up on the register so you could say like I want to cappuccino put it on Jack and it just automatically charged your card and there would only happen if you were with him like two feet we're using Bluetooth and geolocation whatnot but we you know we had it for about three years and it just didn't take off and we shut it down and I I kind of regret doing that but it also paved the way for another thing that I didn't want to give up on and that was that was the cash app like for four years it was just a slog like a lot of people in the company wanted to shut down the thing they saw it as something that wasn't successful and you know recently the team reached number one in the in the App Store in the United States and yeah like we'd we we were all we were against all these incumbents like venmo and PayPal and and it finally clicked and it's just because we had the patience and the conviction around our belief yeah it's a great app - and the ethics behind it are really fantastic - we're really thankful for the cash app especially my friend Justin ran and his fight for the Forgotten charity that every time you use the code word Joe Rogan's all one word it all goes where I'm at five dollars goes to to that and they've built two Wells for the pygmies in the Congo and there's thousands of dollars and building more Wells right now it's really really cool yeah we're really really happy about that yeah yeah I love it I think it's um it's a great way to save money - I mean when you can save 10% at Whole Foods yeah I mean that's that's real well if the other thing is like the the population that we serve typically are underserved by banks or unbanked entirely yeah I'd say we are their bank account right but more importantly they don't have access to things like rewards you don't get rewards on the typical debit card or credit card so like just you know going to your favorite place and and getting an instant 10% off or whatever it is is out of reach for most people because the financial institutions don't enable that and they won't even enable them to get in the door in the front in the first place well if people are listening to this on YouTube you don't know what the fuck we're talking about the cash app has a thing called a cash card which is a debit card that you get with it and there's a thing called boosts and with boosts all you do is pick a boost in the app and then use your cash card as a debit card and you get these automatic discounts and they're real discounts yep and interests for folks with bad credit there's no credit check you can direct deposit your paycheck right into the app yeah and the fact that you guys do do things like support fight for the Forgotten and you're supporting UFC fighter Ray Bourque son who's got some serious medical bills no it's really really cool yeah yeah I'm really I'm really proud of that I'm really proud of the team it's a it's a very small team but they're doing some big things well I hear a lot of good things about it too I've run into people on the street to tell me they use and they're very happy about it so it's it's nice to see again an emerging technology that's profitable but yet also has a really good really good set of ethics yeah yeah do you have don't be evil and know why don't one of our one of our like equivalent operating principles within cash and square is like under like how do we understand someone's struggle like how do we understand like how do we have the empathy for like what they're struggling with and like when it comes to finance they're struggling with a lot yeah typically they're struggling with the ton what was the the thought process with I mean one of the things that's kind of cool about the cash app is that you can buy and sell Bitcoin with it yeah are you going you guys going to consider other forms of cryptocurrency as well not right now I so back to the internet I believe that it or not will have a native currency really it'll have a native currency and I don't know if it's Bitcoin it I think it will because just given all the tests it's been through and the principles behind it how it was created and you know it's it was something that was born on the internet that was developed on the internet that was test it on the it is of the internet and the reason we you know we enabled the purchasing of bitcoin with them within the cash app is one we want to learn about the technology and we want to put ourselves out there and take some risk we're the first publicly traded company to actually offer it as a service or the first publicly traded company to talk to the SEC about Bitcoin and what that what that means and it made us uncomfortable we had to we had to you know like really understand what was going on and and that was critical and important and then the second thing is that we you know we would we would love to see something become a global currency I did it enables more access it allows us to serve more people it allows us to move much faster around the world and we we we thought we were going to start with how you can use it transactionally but we noticed that people were treating it more like an asset like a like a virtual gold and we wanted to we want to just to make that easy like just the simplest way to buy and sell Bitcoin but we also knew that it had to come with a lot of education I had to come with constraint because you know two years ago people did some really unhealthy things about you know purchasing pickle and they maxed out their credit cards and put all their life savings and in the Bitcoin so we we developed some very simple restrictions and constraints like you can all you can't buy Bitcoin on the cash out with a credit card you have to it has to be the money you actually have in it and we look for a day trading which we we discourage and shut down like that that's not what we were trying to build that's not what we were trying to optimize for we made a children's book explaining what bitcoin is and where it came from and how people use it and where it might be going so we we really tried to take on the role of Education and and and to have some like very simple healthy constraints that allowed to be allowed people to consider what their actions are and in this now when you have something like the cash out which is it's very much a disruptive technology in terms of like decentralization of of banks and and currency and you know to have it where everything is going right at your direct depositing a paycheck right in the app if you so choose and then you could also buy Bitcoin which is another disruptive technology I mean that this is another step towards this sort of new way of doing things no and is there pushback from from any companies or is there oh yeah you know I mean like you just look at like some of the major banks and their consideration around Bitcoin they all love blockchain because of the efficiencies it can create for their business and potentially new business lines but you know I think there is a explain block to defeat before people don't know where the black black chain is a distributed ledger and it what that means is that it's basically a distributed database where you know the the source of truth can be verified at any point around the network and you can see you know this this annotation around how content or how round money like traveled so you don't have to go to an institution so the records yeah there's no centralized check there's no centralized control over it and I think that is threatening it's it's it's certainly threatening to certain services behind banks and financial institutions it's threatening to some governments as well so I just look at this and like how do we embrace this technology not react to it and I you know more from a threat standpoint but like what does it enable us to do and where does our value shift and that's what we should be talking about right now is like how our value shifts and there's always really strong answers to that question but if you're not willing to ask the question the first place you will become irrelevant because technology will just continue to march on and make you irrelevant and it's the people that like are you know growing up with this technology or born with the technology only knowing that technology or are asking the tough questions of themselves that are going to be super disruptive to their business and their their thing right now and there and they're taking actions and you know we're doing we're doing that square and we're doing that at Twitter and like that to me represents longevity that represents our ability to thrive and we we got to push ourselves we're gonna make ourselves uncomfortable and we got it disrupt what we held sacred and and what you know we think is success today otherwise it's not can be bigger than what we have today yeah I couldn't agree more and I think that cryptocurrency to me represents one of the more interesting discussions on the Internet what is money and why are we agreeing that it's these pieces of paper that the Federal Reserve prints out totally it's it's a fascinating time in technology because like that that to me was one of the one of the last big centralized national eyes instruments is is a currency is money and when you think about the Internet as as a country as a market as a nation it's going to have its own currency and but what's interesting about the internet as a nation it's the whole world it is the whole world so the world gets one currency it gets which gets one thing they communicate in and that to me is just so freeing and so exciting yeah I I'm very excited by it and I'm also very excited that the fact that it's only been around for such a short period of time but you know ten years and it's become a part of the global conversation yeah I just Brandt I also think that it's going to open up the door to potential universal languages and I think this is this is yeah yeah that excites me a lot about Twitter is like how do we like it if we want to get the world into a conversation into it not a single conversation but at least being able to see that global conversation like we got our work on technologies of like instantly translate yeah I've got to work on technologies that I can speak as I'm speaking right now and in real time people are hearing it in their context in their language and their dialect that is amazing that is so exciting yeah like just how that evolves and how it how it impacts not just communication like this but music and just like you know how up and rap and you know just it just it it's it's amazing to think about where that where that can go and where that can take us yeah and I think you and I are extremely fortunate to be alive right now during this time because I think it's one of the strangest and most unique times in human history totally I don't I don't think there's ever been a time where things changed so radically so quickly totally yeah and I feel you know we um we're just we're able through technologies like Twitter to at least see and acknowledge some of the issues that we're still facing or we're probably in the dark before and I think that's so critical to making any sort of improvements for for making any sort of evolution and and for making it better for everyone on the planet and I you know and I as as uncomfortable as as you know sometimes Twitter makes people feel I think it is necessary to to see those things and have conversations about them so that we can understand how we might move forward and how we might really get at the biggest problems facing us all and you know that there's some huge ones there's some huge ones right now that if we don't have if we don't talk about it like it will drive us to extinction and like it will threaten our ability to to be no planet to live on this planet I agree thank you thanks for anything man thanks for thank you thanks for doing what you're doing thanks for having the attitude that you have I really really appreciate it thank you Jeff my pleasure bye everybody thank you [Music] [Music]
