the girag and experience is that you and Rodney Dangerfield did you double as Rodney I did double him a few times well movie was this all got a couple of TV shows I'd there's a picture of you guys up there what's up my dad he said ah yeah yeah yeah we I was doing sword fighting then sword fighting oh yeah doubling him and he was quite a character quite a character always leave his pants unzip and so I had one of the actors of them say hey his pants is unzip he'd go up and he says I'm getting air conditioning don't bother me and he did just did it as a swerve a joke all right you know it was dead right with like the robes and stuff you stole yeah is like balls why I've talked about this before but I worked at great woods concert center in mansfield massachusetts when i was a kid yeah i was amongst the security personnel there and so I was backstage and I got to see Rodney as he was preparing for his show he would just have a robe on and nothing else he was wearing slippers and he had a robe on and he was walking around back there this before I'd ever done stand-up comedy but I was like that guy is the shit like look at him he's just he's literally as comfortable as you can get he's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and it's because he could you know he was like cuz I can whatever i'm just gonna wear a bathrobe it's comfortable i like the way i love the way you lord he does it because he can't ya because he keeps fucking Ronnie did he knew he was Rodney Dangerfield hello everything said anything and he played it straight and apparently a super nice guy like everybody I know that did business with him or had any interactions with him always came away from it st. Rodney's a great guy my friend Jeff my manager Jeff he was with one of one of his clients was one of rodney's original comics on the HBO comedy series that he did and he said that rodney was just the best just a coolest nicest guy but it happens all the time I know but what's worse than that or fucking your sister having sex with your sister that's worse I think so I victim there but your sister wants it you want it I've thought about that there's one I will go to my grave saying I've never had sex with my sister that's a good move yeah there's some things we want to keep off the resume yeah that would be well you don't even want to do it and then go while I was a mistake never do that again because you can't really erase it which is kind of fucked man because like isn't like learning like one of most important parts of life like shouldn't you be allowed to fuck up but you can't do certain fuck-ups you can't make like you can't be like you know a baby I want to marry you I want to marry you too but I gotta tell you this one thing I know this is not going to change anything because we're meant to be with each other but I fuck my cousin your wife's gonna be like what why did you fuck your cousin wait a minute which cousin yeah okay how far my way well how about I fuck my cousin Mike huh how far was the is it at first cousin or is it uh uh uh yeah if you have to be a first cousin it was your second cousin league well it's gay sex um I think no one's gonna be happy with you you know what why you're saying happy that you fucked your cousin but this is the I was a joke Brody but if it's great branch my antlers if it's straight sex if it's straight sex I think the second cousin is actually like legal like you can not only fuck them you can marry him right yeah Jerry Lee Lewis Harry you're the first cousin can I ask you a question Joe not you're not supposed to it's been on my mind and I know you probably don't want to talk about it because it was brought up well thanks for hanging up on the Internet what was brought up in it well I'm just being real who's brought up and or not you I think you were uneasy with it it was a nice house Chronicle um why would you bring it up again well cuz I heard Joe talked about gay sex like I have to make it clear I'm not into that oh why do you have to make that clear because I get hassled for it sometimes it goes back to you again Brody notice well it's going back to him and gay sex I get parently you can have sex with your cousin it's legal whatever if your cousins are transsexual then it's even more legal depends if you if you're telling someone who writes for salon you're in I read a few girls that have been attracted to their cousins but they always use the excuse they're not blood related hmm and they've well then yeah that's not real I wouldn't have sexual the relative just not into it I think people have done it throughout history here I think it's kind of sick why would you don't see them that often I just think it's sick die I think incest is a sickening thing and I'm sorry it's happened to some young girls or kids or whatever me that would have really anything what if it's a cousin that you really enjoy I think a cousin is too close but what of it look what if that cousin is the perfect person for you what if you know it does it doesn't make sense but you know what the heart wants what it wants Brody and then one should and that's that's not normal and so if you look at the way we treat orcas why the fuck would we ever expect anybody to be nice to us I used to exercise the analogy of of aliens with the younger trainers all the time I'd say look we're aliens to these animals you need to make this animals environment as comfortable as possible bearing in mind always we are aliens just you know what I mean yeah that's part of relating to the animals witches are thinking like that you're just like wait a second like I got its start being nicer cuz if an alien comes down I don't want that I don't want it sounds us it's a stupid thing to say like it's one of those who's your target brother aliens again people like automatically go goofy with it but the reality is it's actually it's the right analogy because we really are aliens in their world and we're obviously supposedly intelligent we're obviously intelligent enough to figure out how to get them we're intelligent enough to figure out how to train them put them in tents put them in tanks rather have all these people come to see him we're obviously intelligent enough to film them there's they can tell there's a lot of shit going on that they don't do but they've got to be like god you guys are dicks like why you holding on to me like we don't hold on it we don't we don't want we don't do that I think we kill things but we don't hold on to them I think that's when the frustration level start boiling for these animals because when they're first there when they first arrived to you as a green animal if there I mean the bottom line is it depends if they're good candidate for captivity but they learn real fast that okay that's the hand that feeds me like I want to I want to I want to develop this relationship if you will which is a relationship of like abiding by this person's rise right then again good-willed animals and the other ones that are just like the same for me there there there there cut and there's nothing you can do I mean you pull blood from them you check that blood there's nothing wrong with them this animals not sick why isn't it eating and then days later why is this animal dead did not want to be in captivity they just starve themselves to death I've seen it so many times why the will to live loss
