tada there's Weiss yeah it's it's it's very yeah this thing's very clunky this Ustream thing ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for tuning in my guest this week the lovely and talented mr. Doug Benson Doug Benson everybody before we get started we have to mention that this show is being sponsored by the fleshlight Doug Benson have you ever fucked one of these things I have not I heard you and Dane Cook talking about it last week they're awesome and it's really like takes masturbation to a whole new level it seems you know it's a very embarrassing thing to purchase as soon as that one bit used her I just would never do that is that just the reason well not that you would you know necessarily mess it up just by holding it or whatever no because you don't have to touch anything I mean no one's fucked it yeah I wouldn't give you one that someone's good yeah yeah that's wrong right you ever fucking not taste fleshlight one no like I just fucked one the other day completely different it fucks it doesn't feel anything like better or worse Oh way worse way worse way worse yeah somebody else told me that I think was Heffron so that he fucked a knock off a fake flash light you said it wasn't very good yeah but these are outstanding it's a lot of research it seems like it'd be awesome but now I totally get what you were saying last week about how it just doesn't it just doesn't feel right in terms of you feel bad about your embarrassing yeah is it so heavy that's one thing like I guess you'd get a little bit of a I've had the light arm workout but take it back right so my volume oh I've had other people talk to me about this thing and it's a it's an embarrassing thing they're like why would you you know want to be represented by this rubber vagina like he keeps coming up it came up with like another person that was thinking about sponsoring the show they don't want to be connected with the fleshlight really that's so weird to me it's childish it really is childish now you just get that that company and fleshlight to outfit each other until yeah you have something like that but then you would never know I mean you know then you show no loyalty to something that you actually believe if you don't believe there's anything wrong with fucking this thing and you want to pretend it's like one of those things where people don't want to talk about sexual things because some are another talking about sexual things is on makes people uncomfortable it's creepy you know but it's a natural part of life and like most rational people at a certain point time just kind of accept that and then you can joke about it and go hey I fucked this rubber pussy haha is it good yeah it's great you should try it and then everything's good but for some people it never gets to that place never yeah well I think it's is I think it depends on how comfortable you are with like other men like they like who you kind of came up with and if you all talk to each other that way or not you know like I had a lot of fairly prudish friends like we'd say dirty things but we wouldn't admit to any of our own personal activities the way that I've seen other groups of friends do it you know like you see these packs of people that all just have a different code about you know whether they fucked a prostitute or not it's gonna come up in one group but it's not going to come up in a totally that's so important so important hanging around the dudes are gonna tell you everything that's so huge embarrassing ridiculous retarded all of it I want to hear it come on that's you must get some good stuff from everyone I know from them but yeah but also like there's that's like really kind of almost a code of stand-up these days is to just be super honest and and it ends up just to be original you kind of have to talk about some stuff that's it's pretty brutal and out there you know yeah you can't really do I mean it's almost like the the Jerry Seinfeld route has been said so many times and gone down so many roads it's like I don't see anything there it's like if you want to do stand-up today it's like you know Jerry Seinfeld as Jerry Seinfeld you know that style is hilarious at it but I don't want to see a new one of those well also he sort of sort of turned it into another thing like he made it popular it's more fun now to watch actors on a show like The Office recreating awkward situations that happen every day than it is here one guy just describing it yeah you know he's a Seinfeld show just sort of brought to life his comedy and that made him a funnier guy to me because prior to that he was a pack of part of a pack of guys that all just did clean-cut observational humor and I love them all I thought they were really funny like guys like him and Larry and you know there's a bunch of them yeah I was a fan of the evening at the improv yeah yeah and those guys were on those things all the time it that I totally grew up on watching that stuff but then immediately embraced stuff that's more you know like you can you don't have to just observe things you could yeah experience them yeah I want to hear like really tell me what yeah it's not what everybody did I want to hear a dangerous thought to admit I want to hear you know I want to hear some some truth that we can all agree with I want to hear something fucked up too I don't want to hear the regular shit I'll get bored with I'm tired of it I wanna hear something you know I like look forward to Joey Diaz it sets more than anybody I like strong joke writing though you know I do that that can get me through yeah but you're right it's like as soon as he starts to be too much about the best is both right yeah of course yeah I love anyone who's a great joke writer and a good performer that's that's unbeatable that's like louis c.k yeah but you write about Seinfeld like he was he was such a brilliant joke writer and deliver like in his style and then to have that show and then you really see where you know Kirby enthusiasm really good to see where Larry David had a big hand in it too because once I started seeing that show I was like oh okay this guy is like the king of creating like really awkward situations that like literally you watch like some of the shows and you find yourself contorting because you're like well you fucking saying you know it's so good it's he does such a good job of weaving that web you know he's one of my masters is he yeah yeah and it takes it up a notch to that it's like on HBO so that the language in those situations can be like that's part of it as he often says you know he often says some he swears inappropriately in front of people yeah and subject can't do that shit on Seinfeld cuz it had to be all TV or appropriate you remember when there was the water bottle in his pants and there was a little girl and you know there was like some implication like people thought that he on a hard-on because the little girl is there I forget how he set it up but I was like wow yeah if you listed everything that he was guilty of in seven seasons of that show he's done some pretty horrible things does the worst thing in every situation you know like I forget what he did to some Holocaust survivors but it was I'm sure it was awful shows like that is so important show you that there's like another level out there you know like I think that's important for stand-ups too don't you think like it's it's good sometimes to watch somebody else you know in so many really good you know watch like a Bill Cosby in his prime or something like that just to really get inspired or and get you know just really kick it up to another another gear yeah it's always good to IIIi think that's a huge part of I hate to give advice to people starting out but one of the things I say to them if they insist on having some is watch as much stand-up comedy as you can and unfortunately we get kind of tired of watching it as after we've done it for years and years but it's still important to kind of check into it every once in a while because it just ups your game when you know what what everybody else is doing yeah it inspires you know it does something to you makes you excited about performing you know I'm most excited about writing after I see like you know I'll see your pal perform I just want to go right you know it just makes me want to create new shit you know well that's the other great thing about being a stand-up is when you have that impulse you could just come up with one great Joe could be satisfied yeah like I hate it when I see a great movie and I'm driving home like I'm gonna write a goddamn screenplay and that that's just too big of a task to really commit to in that moment of excitement you know but writing a joke you know you're excited about writing jokes and you write a good ones like okay I did that he's like 10 20 minutes work and then you're in and sometimes they come in full form well they'll just come to you out of the air it's like a little gift it's amazing you were talking about that with Dane Cook about say something on stage when the crowd is so great the the next sentence after the joke is probably gonna get a laugh anyway but when it gets a huge laugh then you've suddenly got a new end of the joke yeah right out of the ether yeah that's how most of my I you know I do most of my writing on stage just in the sense that you know sometimes I'm a joke that's worked out you know perfectly beginning middle and end but for the most part it's more like this is sort of something I want to try to dress and then just see where it goes and have a good joke ready to go right after it if it isn't you know not ending up getting anywhere yeah I agree with you I do I do both how high do you get before you go onstage well now people think I'm high whether I'm high or not like they just accuse me of it regardless so you know messiah's I want to be which is just you know it's just all comes down to timing you know if you have to race from the airport you have to race from the airport to the gig you might not be very high but if you're if you're chillin that day you know and you're gonna show at 8 o'clock and not much to do in the afternoon other than you know work on your computer and interviews and stuff like that like I get really high for interviews now like phoners yeah me too I love that I love that super because then when they do throw to you you you will talk until they until they stop you sometimes sometimes they don't jump in so you can really get a lot of stuff in I know I find myself like almost like feeling bad for what I'm subjecting the interview or to sometimes because it'll start on some like really innocent question and I'll just start going on about you know the what is the cause of humanity what are we here for like this totally nothing to do with anything we're talking about but in my mind what I'm talking about is you know the whole vision of the world and where it's headed and you know might have been a really simple question yeah they need you wrap it up so they could play some more Kesha yeah and I'm just super banked going on about the universe it's like it's all coming to me and these big waves I just need to get it out it is fun to get high and then right you know or sometimes have you ever done this have you ever gotten high no and I'll crap now I'm starting to have ideas and I'm not in the mood to like I'm not ready to write down ideas right now I want to just get high and watch TV but now I've got it now I've actually got to go to work for a little bit because the ideas are too good to ignore I got way too hard the other day and went on stage and went to the I was at the Jon Lovitz comedy club so you think this dude I was on a plane with Lovitz the other day yeah yeah I got in his eyeline a couple times to see if he knew who I was and he had he had no idea but if he was like holy shit you Doug Benson would that give you a semi well no I wouldn't want I well I love it's I mean I did he has a lot of great things and Andy and I always thought he was a funny guy but he was you know so sad sack acting then it would be hard to be excited about he's a nice guy he was just kind of like traveling by himself you know how that is you just like pump it through the airport like you know just want to get it over with just don't want too many people too you know I'm sure like he must have gone through a period of time where there's some catch phrases that people yell at them or they yeah they say you're yeah yeah he must he must have used to got that a lot but now I'm sure he doesn't get it so much but why don't you use technology to help with your ideas though because I know that you instead of writing it down just like talk make a movie do it audience right there and I'm not starting to get there like I finally got the most recent iPhone oh you did I've made the first video that I ever like uploaded on the Internet where I just film myself doing something and then and then send it out there and I'm definitely gonna do more of that you should it's super super smart and fast and it's you know people love content they want you to keep doing stuff but what were you saying about being at the Lovitz Club comedy club oh I got way too baked this guy gave me a cookie in between the stage Joey did they were like these little what are those little long banana shaped things called I'm talking about biscotti Scotty I see the banana how do you describe that shape heart-shaped cookie [Laughter] cookie canoe this guy I didn't even eat a quarter of one man I didn't he goes they're really strong okay just I took a bite one bite 45 minutes later I was on stage and I was aboard an alien spacecraft while I was talking these people I mean I was barely there a barely there enough to communicate I was so high there's no way I should have been talking in public that's a surreal space when you're on stage there too because of the way they have that does those balcony yeah three floor like in there and the balconies are rather close to you but just up high very shallow but yeah and it's a it's it's kind of excite but also it's different than what we're used to yeah it's cool I mean it was a fun Club what's weird about that Club is how the bar is open and so halfway through the show you're just hearing clinking and yeah and people could but you know what it ain't that bad like San Francisco punchline doesn't have it yeah that works out okay yeah that's far somehow it adds to the ambience though as long as people aren't douchey it doesn't matter but you are right it does give an opportunity for things to get annoying yeah any time you have a bar where people can stand and order a drink you're fucked or divert attention from the crowd okay like quietly because people yeah people start hitting on people and talking the last show I did like where it was a standing room show me and Joey did this show in Memphis and was like this last-minute booking and it was a rock club and so we're like are yeah they have bands there fuck it well you know I'm sure it'll be set up fine and the guys like he wants to do standing room I usually don't I said okay fine fuck it the whole half the room was standing half the room was seated and was really strange I was like you're staying on straight stage and to your right everyone seated and to your left is a bar so literally like everything to your left is like there's like 200 people just standing and talking yeah of course like you're doing stand-up in a bar and bare they're barely paying attention yeah they're acting like a band is on stitch I used to do that the House of Blues too but now after we went to see Stanhope and we had a stand and it was horrible it was like after an hour like your fucking back hurts your neck starts to kink up and so I said I'm not gonna subject anybody this anything yeah it is I feel bad for people when they're standing during the show do you ever say no that you won't do those shows and just I haven't I haven't really gotten to that position where like you know if that's an option and that's gonna get more bodies in the venue it gets less bodies in the venue you lose money but it's to me that's better oh dude let him sit you mean to let him sit yeah yeah yeah that's the thing so I I'm not as big a I'm not such a draw that they're like coming to me begging me to let everybody stand right you know I've been on comedians and comedy tours with Patton Oswalt where everybody's standing and it's a it's amazing how much they'll put up with like David Cross to stay shows all the time and his shows go on forever and he has bands come out and that crowd is okay with it but I don't think my crowd I think stoners would rather sit down I mean I think they're fine and okay with it I would I mean if it was an only an opportunity to go see a great comic you know someone you know even if I wasn't even doing stand-up it was chappal or someone like that I would stand out stand for two hours I mean how often does this guy come to town once a year sure I can stand for two hours for once here but it's not the best feeling the best way is to sit down and chill they sit down and chill and you could really enjoy the jokes when you're sitting down and relaxing everything's more fun it's what's the worst is when they have couches in a comedy club yeah like oh here's the VIP seats and it's like a couch in the back where they not only can get loud but they also you know just they're lounging around not the right it's not the right posture to watch comedy unless you're like you know I like I'm stoned or something yeah you were totally right I like it when this the seats are fixed fix seats into the so they can't even move I'm like if the Comedy Works in Denver I was just gonna say that that place is crazy they got those little tiny trays that are smaller than a school desk or or an airline tray and you just put they just put their nachos and their drinks on it and then the people are in there so tight and it's underground it's really that place is almost perfect the only thing I'd say that I don't like about it is just the you know it gets a little rowdy sometimes it gets the crowd noise is like it's so it's a win when they're cheering for you and applauding because it's so loud but then when they're talking amongst themselves when they're like you know losing focus that's really loud too Denver's pretty they get wild man yeah Colorado people get wild yeah it's a lot of wild cowboy in Colorado yeah and I think the alcohol in the weed both hit you harder because of the altitude fuck yeah it does you're a mile up in the air man yeah so if we start working out up there yeah I've tried tried doing a lot of things there that I you know regret it I went to amusement park there one day oh my god and and it's just like it was fun but you know much more exhausting than going to amusement park should be yeah I can only imagine yeah walking up hills is tough up there I went hiking once and it was like a full-on workout like I was breathing heavy and sweating it's like this is crazy this is not where you want the mountain line to catch you I'll heave in and out of breath and shit can't even make it up the hill that's the way Joe Rogan thinks that there might be a mountain lion well my dog Oh God I lived in Colorado my dog a team oh yeah yeah we saw the mountain lion I've had weed in Colorado you've hidden it yeah at a comedy club and I've been waiting for the day to go but comedy still there like it's so it's kind of like me and Ari we're talking about the other day we started hiding we tip comedy clubs instead of throwing it away and stuff does we'd ever go back smart no it does it I mean it loses its potency a little bit but you're talking about six months to a year it's fine it's gonna be dry and it's gonna hit you harder you're gonna get stoned really yeah Joey likes drying his weed out it takes his veto so I'm like a radiator to like three try that shit out cocksucker I used to keep it in the freezer yeah yeah I used to debate it gets moisture in it that way I like it dry I like it to burn the freezer I it's supposedly you put anything in a freezer it lasts longer be it like batteries yeah I'm asking you that but I mean why put my coffee in the freezer I don't know why I do that yeah exactly their parents did it I just did it because people suggested it or somebody sent it somewhere and then after a while I was like why am I doing this I'm getting through this weed fast enough that I own a hose please another generation right this edible thing taught me a lesson man I will not eat anybody else's shit and then go onstage it was a dick that I'd known and I he's one of those professional I store you buying it from so you don't know you're totally true everybody to me he's always like just you'd have for this and every time I take them up on it it's either much stronger than that implied or weaker than that implied like people are never really that that's what I like about smoking yes the people behind the counter and the dispensary can give you a little bit more specific guidance then you can't with edibles it's always just like yeah dude you're a wall in about an hour some of these assholes put too much in they need to get Amazon refill that you're right no they need Amazon reviews every time you take a you know purple rect from this store this is what happened this is how much we do you know and there was a job in Colorado one of the local newspapers to be a marijuana critic right and I I got the job I signed up for it I in there were like are you serious I might fuck yeah I want to write it was right before we had to move but when I was there I was gonna go to different weed stores and and grade them like it somebody else is doing that now they should I think they gave that job to somebody I remember reading about it somewhere that that yeah that's something they wanted to do you know I read it on some like slep stoner or something some web site was was talking about it I thought of earlier when you mentioned Doug Stanhope it was funny a couple days ago I worked at a club and the guy wrote me a check and I went home I didn't really look at it and I went home and the next morning I looked at it and he had written the check out to Doug Stanhope like it was late he was tired and and Doug plays that club too so it was funny that he Wow wrote down the wrong name he's like degenerate number two you ever gotten no you've never gonna check this is Joe Piscopo on I saying credit well that's just a flat like that like anytime I sign a credit card any kind of credit card slip I always write something like are you free to change the way you sign you yes you can't say that your T's not a beat what I'm saying like say if you have a signature write your signature so supposed to represent how you write it your own very unique way of doing it right is it Park an you just decide I don't like it that way now I'm gonna do this with a star in the middle of it and well you're just dropping them out because then you could get every letter of the alphabet so they know exactly what your handwriting style looks like it's you know it's late but it's your signature you're still writing the same word every time what I'm saying is could you just totally change it up yeah that's what I do every time I change my sign a credit card I do Brad Pitt or I hate tacos so what's the point where it's totally changing it up and if that's cool if you're allowed to do that what's the point in having a signature that because you have to say did you sign this is it's your signature yes did sign that that's it but you know they say Ramona got the one where it's where you're signing that screen thingy isn't that kind of at least capturing the image and checking to see if it matches how you know just printing it I'm just printing it so you could just on those things you could just yeah but type stars in anything well when I was a kid I could imitate gene Simmons signature I could imitate Ace Frehley because I had like copied over their signatures I was like a huge kiss fan and you could someone could do that with you easy especially those little stupid things at the credit card where you're signing your name but it doesn't look like how you write even close who cares yeah you know how I learned it because a girl I used to date would type her name and much like cursive letters and it took fucking like an extra minute I'm just like that's it you're not doing this anymore this drives me crazy it's an extra minute at the cash register I just started signing it for her and I started saying like farts and fuckface and talk I usually just do tacos and interesting obsessions they've got the new taco shaped Brad Pitt flashlight if you'd like to try yep what that reminded me of something though Oh what I do is I have a signature that I sign for stuff with and then when people ask me to sign stuff I just print my name but I always try to say something nice to them so it's at least personalized but they're not really getting my signature they're just getting my name written out mm-hmm how do you use I'm paranoid about this whole identity theft so you won't sign things because yeah Wow I mean why why let someone why like a gene Simmons wouldn't want somebody to be able to do a great job with his yeah well you know you should definitely be paranoid about identity theft when it comes to credit cards but I don't really think you should worry about your signature it's too easy to duplicate just carry around a stamp I mean you'd have to I don't think I mean who has the kind of technology is there to us you can't read my signature and I think when you're signing something for somebody when they show it to people right you know if it has your name on it that's one thing but if you're just signing so anything then when somebody looks at it I think it's nice to go oh that Doug Benson wrote that my signature you can't I don't think that it is handwriting I don't think it's that they're that good at that at recognizing you know shit I don't think that I think you could imitate it you could figure out how to write so many signature and you could probably pull it off close enough yeah you just have to find it somewhere so just have to watch their motion eyeing it if you watch them if you film them do it and you saw like how they do it you could just imitate it well that's where my paranoia sets in is when I'm at the ATM the beeping noise is that the numbers make that takes the privacy out of the number if someone was just watching the site and recording it right they could figure out the numbers easy and then like you know jack you up around the corner and then use your card and take out whatever the maximum is what did you see the new thing there's a new app for Chase Bank that that you could actually scan a cheque front and back and with your iPhone and send it and it deposits the cheque and then you just rip up the cheque well that's too that's too easy what about the using your iphone check in on the plane like the barcode and ticket can be on your iPhone and I just run that yeah my fear is you know what your iPhone is dead then you don't have a ticket yeah and your iphones die man especially if you fucker a new one dies so fast it's you know you make a video and it's your powers have gone yeah yeah you got to think about that if you use in the camera for sure but it came it's such a great thing to have a good camera the other day we were in San Francisco we ate some Chinese food after the show it was like two o'clock in the morning we're outside and I saw it I watched the whole truck you tweeted it and I watched it and I was like he must be so high because you kept saying is the craziest shit you ever saw and I know you're at UFC fights every other week so I know you see some crazier shit than a bunch of strippers in the back of a sort of weird plastic Carly have seen some crazy shit but it was crazy and I was so high yeah yeah I was just like you can't believe it and now to be able to just share it with everybody you were like double rainbow but with with the fuckin van full of strippers it was so excited about it it was so ridiculous to me it was such a sign of the times to me it was like a scene in a movie right before the meteor hit right before the aliens landed and somebody audio takes that Jo's video audio tinges video there's this big this big clear box that pulls up and there's girls dancing it's a fishtank skanks and their dancing I mean it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life it's for the hustler club we had a rewind video to find out then come over because they should be sitting while it's in motion can't be dancing while we're driving they just did like a quick they didn't really like cuz that was what I was waiting for is like them having to get out yeah get cuffed we thought that might have happened we think they might be going to jail like maybe it's illegal to do that because it seems so ridiculous but apparently it's not one of the things that was funny is when we were filming the girl and I didn't film their faces I wouldn't I did specifically plastic I know if I'm gonna put it online you don't need to see your face off for a week that shit's on the internet forever so I didn't use their face but anyway Wilde filming it the girl goes no filming like we're in the club like bitch you're in front of a Chinese restaurant okay you're not at the club if we're at the club and I'm filming you yeah that's a dick move but you just can't come out into the real world in your underwear and I can't take a picture of that that's crazy well that's like the sexy top and the you know keep your eyes up here mister it's like what come on Jesus cry no you know what you're doing right you know how the game works yeah they only want you look they want you to look but you know it's there for everybody my eyes are here god damn it yeah let's do this you're the popemobile for strippers and you don't want us to look at you it's awesome though it was awesome it was just like such a such a just a first of all just a perfect representation of how nutty San Francisco is I wonder if this goes such a nutty it's just that yeah that like probably no one will complain about that no one no no and I'm sure some kids saw it Oh a lot it's just so liberal they're so open-minded it's a weird town man I wonder if that law with sitting down while you turning the corner if it came from like the back in the old days where's like a pickup truck and girls that just fly off the side no I think you have to have your seatbelt on I think if you're in a car you have to wear a seatbelt right I mean that's all you get pulled over for something else I think I don't know they can put I had no idea I thought it was that on charge legal I was in a cab in San Francisco and the crusty older lady cabdriver told me she goes if you ever want to drive around without a seat belt on because I don't she goes I don't like how seat belts feel I don't like to have it on that especially if you got big boobs it must be an annoying thing so she fastens it behind her back so that is so that because because the what the cops look for is the glint of the buckle because you haven't got it pulled down you haven't you don't have the buckle so they see that and then they put they can pull you over for that and then get you on for other shit oh you over glint dude yeah they got over for that and then they go we thought you had your seatbelt off and then they can you know oh we smell marijuana or whatever if you get pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt you're a douche any cop just pulls your hump is gonna pull this person over for us I like wearing it to be honest with you I've been pulled over for that guy told me to do it really and he said he said you were driving
