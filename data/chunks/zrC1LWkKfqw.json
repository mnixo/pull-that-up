you know we fucking work hard and we drink hard we and we and we're like fuck you we have the right to do it I know you're similar to reengineer booze you know some scientists need to get on this whole booze thing and figure out give me the effects of booze you know make it taste like booze but figure out a way where it doesn't wreck your system there's got to be a way to recreate being drunk without testing without making you just poisoned you know I mean really we're so retarded we go poison each other well weed has like so many good effects for if it was my drug but I like I totally am like for all the lot of guys don't get him or don't like it rather Stanhope doesn't like it you know we were boozing and like you know drug guys we worried what was it about the weed that you didn't like well no offense but I thought it was kind of prissy I thought it was a sit around and like there's something about weed and like sitting on a couch and then awesome there's a guitar there for some reason and then now you're hearing a million parodies no it's bad you're doing a million fucking days and everyone's giggling and if you've been going around but if you're hanging around with idiots and they get high you're right you're in for some profound stupidity but yeah but I think it facilitates thinking definitely sure how a lot of people don't like it cuz it makes you paranoid
