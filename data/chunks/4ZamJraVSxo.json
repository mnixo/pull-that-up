and the first sounds of slurp hello Eliza it's a cozy morning what's going on my friend it's kind of cozy right for California it's like a little chill near makes you feel like there's real weather here it does like we're in a normal place yeah normal place with normal meatball like where things change like you get a winter and a summer and a spring yeah no we get a slight chill and like oh my god it's real with the season changing though nobody ages like it's still that perennial somewhere between 20 to 45 year old nobody ages what do you mean everybody in LA like there's like this nebulous age where it's like behavior wise and everything like you're somewhere between 25 and 45 and then on either side of that you're too old or too young but like everybody is this kind of like just you can act like a child here that's an interesting observation it's totally true right because they don't have the responsibility of having to like shovel snow and prepare for the winter and get up and scrape your windshield because there's ice on and prepare for life like you could be like 40 or 45 year old dude and you're like I do improv and I have a roommate and girls are like awesome like oh they're really like Italy really what girls know that I know but fucking do you think so other girls that are like that that's what who's fucking other people that there's like a there's you know there's certain people that we know okay what I'm say we know that we've run into live that are on this show business path and they are fucked and you know they're like like a stampeding herd of buffalo that are headed for a cliff yeah and there's no way out you're not you either gonna get some kind of a job and you're gonna be bitter and angry or you're you're just gonna keep doing this forever and it's never gonna happen I feel like with comedy in particular it's one of those careers where it's not even you fail up where you just fail laterally like comedy is one of those things where you can kind of just continue to exist in and around it despite actual talent we all know the comics where it's like you're not dead yet they're like no I'm writing ads that go on the back of tickets I'm I'm writing commercial parodies for like comedy dotnet like just write existing in subdivisions of the realm of comedy and they'd think that they're in the game but really they're in the parking lot well then there's a weird ones that come to the store and they come to the Improv and they hang out but they don't really go up ever I don't understand that I don't understand the myth of the hang the idea is that you would be hanging if you don't know anyone you want to meet some new friends or your friends are there but I see people that just bob and weave and I'm like and you act like they're looking for someone I'm like there's no one there you're just here hoping someone talks to you but you've been doing this for so long go home write something yeah but it's not gonna happen I mean how many is one of those things like I feel like you could learn how to play music someone can teach you how to move your fingers in the right direction I mean you might never be Jimi Hendrix you might never be some virtuoso who stands out but you might get good at music if you could put the practice in could learn the math of it comedy's not that my college Emerson College offers now offers shout out to Boston Joe who offers a comedy major and good luck with that right I'm like you're either funny or you're not and you can learn what makes a script funny and you can learn about timing and things but you have it innate ly or you don't know I firmly believe that I do too and the amount of people you know you can't tell someone but there are plenty of people who aren't naturally funny that make a huge career out of things you know because someone else unfunny finds them funny but it's one of those things where I'm not gonna be the one to tell you to give up on your dream like that's not my position to tell someone that but you're constantly surrounded by these like it's almost like this Walking Dead of unfunny mmm like they're just at the shows and they're just there for decades of your life yeah it's hard sometimes they'll ask me to get on the podcast too what what are you saying what do you say oh no you don't you say no oh so you're very good I remember watching you I told you this before we were at the store one time and there's this um cuz you're so alpha like a proper and I say this to you every time I see you like a proper definition of one and I think that like a real alpha male it doesn't seek to disempower doesn't seek to make anybody else feel bad like you're just like this is what I do and I set my boundaries and we were in that back outside bar we're only comics are allowed and this guy walked up to you do you remember this and he was a little bit in your space harmless he was like oh joke I need a picture and you burp you were like you cannot be back here you've got to go well I saw him weasel through he came from the show and then went through the batter that kitchen area and then went it's happened a few times where people know that we hang out back there because we talked about on the podcast we go back there to smoke and then all sudden they'll be like me and you know Callen or whoever in you and comics just talking about sets like are you doing triple e show like what's going on there's no stuff folks and then all sudden someone's right here hey man hey what's up hey dude I get a picture like you're not supposed to be back you said that I don't know that it's like we oh I put my foot down for certain things and of course as you get older you get better about it but I straight-up I don't know that I could say that to someone I allow people in my space and I think you kind of just tolerate it cuz you never know and there's that fear like what is this person but you were very like you can't be here and the guy was like oh so sorry well I'm happy to take picture with somebody but I knew that that guy had gotten into the employees area he had weaseled his way back through yeah I don't yeah but you did that night and I remember watching and I was like I don't know you could do it the problem is with women like men get really fucking creepy you men get really shitty with women if what if a woman says you can't be here you know who knows you who knows what kind of a man you're dealing with we can bring I can I can speak to that yeah and I also remember I was on your podcast forever ago and I had done this show and I brought up this thing I get a lot of in sells instagramming me about this cuz this guy came into our group was a group of women standing outside and he asked for a lighter oh yeah I remember this and all of the beta's you got a lot of great fans but on the fringe ones there were like oh those crew freeloader and I'm like tell you what when someone bigger and stronger than you that has the ability to hurt you comes into your personal space not really wanting a lighter wanting something else your sensors go off make sure that you stay silent see how great you feel I don't think there's any respect for the idea that like sometimes you feel scared and it's not like a cry wolf thing like I'm a tough I don't walk around like afraid but every once in a while show me some knuckles tough chick there they're all bloated from vodka last night it's like yeah you know the thing like someone can do it the right way like someone could say excuse me do you any of you ladies have a lighter easily and that is like no sorry we're not smart okay cool thank you but I've had it happen where somebody they put their energy and they get in it they're like who has a lighter and you're like I don't think what you want is a lighter mm-hmm and I stand by that decision it's all context I think so but it's so it's a technicality right and it's like okay so if you want to have white power night at the Laugh Factory you just have to cut Jamie a check so we're gonna take over the place I think my biggest is you'll be cutting Jamie a check but I listened we have white power night let have to have you in but you not white power white power open mic night there are no jokes everyone is fully erected by the everybody already did see how you can't do see her have you been banned from there no okay cuz I was yeah I know yeah but well I was your first guest on your podcast that you were doing over there I know and you were and that was so cool of you cuz it was a podcast there's no money in it there wasn't you know but you were a friend like I didn't get any like it was a dinky podcast run in the laughs actor and when you decided to leave the Laugh Factory as a venue for your podcast you wanted to expand Jamie said buddy you can no longer do your Sieg Heil in my club diligent to Jews yeah yelled at me and this was four years ago he yelled I I was offered my podcast this is an old podcast to run it out of the improv and so I called Jamie and I said I I got offered my podcast somewhere else and I'm gonna take it there I just wanted to set up a whole podcast studio the ener-d yes yeah they set it up they're like come over here we'll get you advertisers well it will produce this The Laugh Factory they would put it up but that was it there was no business behind it and I was fine with that I wasn't trying to make money and brought me over okay great so man-to-man I called Jamie I go she want to say do you know the man man-to-man I talk to him like a man well I called him up and I said listen fucker no I just said hey I just want to let you know I've been offered to take my pocket somewhere else and I'm gonna take that opportunity I just want to give you the respect of telling you versus just leaving absolutely no problem you're family really and by the way I said no problem mm-hmm that's why this is so insane no problem you're family go ahead I'm making him sound Russian but it's like a weird accent anyway so I go and keep in mind I was like the textbook picture employee they're like I'm one of three women that perform there regularly at the time like headlining women I bake cookies for the waitresses I would bust my hump to get there because there there's times where was written in stone like it's 8:45 can I get 850 I'm running no this is the time like I was I never ran the light like I was really respectful and like an hour later he calls me yelling at me uh-huh you did not say you are taking your podcast to levity which is the governing for those of you know the body that owns a lot of the Improv Xand they're a huge thing he told you told me you're going to the Improv I just said I'm taking it elsewhere it didn't it didn't occur to me to say it but it also loved it he's so big it's like I didn't even think oh it's a competing thing I think of the factory is a couple of clubs and Lebanese more of like an enterprise yeah plus I don't play my factory clothes right uh just yelling at me acting like I did this duplicitous thing he hangs up on me hangs up on me grown man uh and I go on the web site that night my name is taken down off all the shows I'm pretty sure he removed my face from that mosaic of comics outside I am persona non grata and so he's ever tell you the conclusion of this no it really hurt my feelings really and I'm the kind of person if you shut a door in my face I will nail it closed and I call the Laugh Factory and all the girls that are working there and I said why didn't anyone like we're all cool like did no one even stand up for me like I didn't really do anything wrong and this one girl goes you know he's just really stressed a lot of people are leaving the production office so I think he's stressed cuz a lot of employees are leaving and I go left and she said this one girl who doesn't matter the name said this one girl and I go okay give me her number and I called her and I said hi it's Eliza because she works my podcast and I was like I will give you X amount of money if you walk out of the Laugh Factory today and come work for me and it was a good chunk of cash and she was like I was like I need the answer by noon I'll be at Kings Road cafe there was no reason to put a clock on it I was just feeling really he put a power milligan and that's who's sitting in our lobby now she's been my assistant for four years I rescued her she's my angel on my heartbeat and only recently were they like she can come back because my face is on the side of the fucking building oh you can come back now yeah do you come back I went I did one show back did you hey did you see Jamie no I said I said I go I he doesn't need to apologize but I'm walking in with my head held high I'm doing my set I'm not like everybody was super cool he's not there because he forms it out now to other Booker's yeah did he put your video up on YouTube did he film your set I told all I told Brian monarch I go I'm going cuz I'm I'm doing another show there too I go I'm going if you film me I will have a Kramer moment like I will flip out on you in an epic way like it is it is a non-negotiable thing so they said no no I talked to Bill about this he goes nah they don't do that if you ask them they don't put your video up I go yeah I go look for your videos yeah we're in the fucking green room of the Ice House he goes what the fuck old comedy - well it doesn't matter I mean Chappelle that's one of the reason why Chappelle won't go there yeah he went there just to work out and they this is one he was not doing shows and not doing specials and they put all his shit online no no asking him no nothing I think that they the I'm just I think they've got like new management there whatever but like it's it trickled down from the top oh sure there's no way anybody's like just recording people on their own and putting it on the on the fucking Internet no they know that it's not cool and they're doing it anyway I also yeah it's uh for people don't know like how Comedy Works we need to work out like if you if a lies er comes up with a bit tonight and and works on tonight that's if someone records it and films it and puts it online that bits fucked cuz that bits not done that it's a baby you're being judged on that bit it would be like anything if you were an athlete and you went to a workout and they're like well you can't make the team you're like well I'm still working out and I'm not I'm gonna get bigger just not even just that it's like eating a half baked cake it's yeah it's it's just you know the premises cooked like you fuck the premise up it's now it's like it's out there yeah it's tricky because we we rely on live audiences and you know thankfully most the vast majority of people that come to comedy clips particularly in LA are really cool like we have no problems with this it's not an issue but this is a thing that we need you know we need and because everyone has a recording device now it used to be like difficult to bring a recording device into a comedy club now everyone has them by default on the phone my favorite thing is I understand if you're Dave Chappelle and you're like I need your phone zipped up because this is you know sacred material and these are you know we all have our material that we need to make money off of some comics are bigger than others my favorite is one shitty comics or like we need your phones taken away I'm like nobody's checking for your act like nobody's taking your act unless you say something stupid yeah there's that and then they'll try to ruin your career with it should be a social contract The Improv does that with every show I love that and by the way I'm there this Friday night 1030 just announced it just just put it up online I'm also there this week but I don't have my phone with me I'm just doing 15 minutes foods but I that to me I think it slows it down at the improv um OWSLA I've never but it worried I'm more aware mm-hmm they're just not checking the goddamn phone all the time one of my favorite shows that ever did when I was doing that when I was when I prepare for my Netflix special the last couple months before I did all my shows with these phone backs it gets to be a pain yeah especially when you do in giant places but in Miami is the best cuz Miami everyone is doing coke and no one's paying attention to anything and they're all looking at their phones constantly so you could look you could use your phone but you got to leave the building to use your phone so everyone was getting up and going out and coming down and coming in so during the show it was just constant oh my god oh my god sitting down the only place at all the places I did Miami was the only place where people were constantly getting up and sitting they're not even aware that like you're doing a performance yeah like we don't care well Miami's just crazy it's it's own thing yeah it's another country it really is it's wild it's fun it's great place to visit I love Miami I love the food I love the people I love the attitude down there but it's just it's not the best place to perform you said that to me in an airport once I remember everything you say you said that to me now I feel better feeding it but we were in an airport and you were going to Miami I was going somewhere else and you were like if you like something like if you want to starve if you want to start to the open a library in Miami open a bookstore oh but a bookstore cuz I remember thinking well no one makes my name elaborate open but you said that and I always remembered you said that I've only played Miami proper once but I always play like Fort Lauderdale and all the things around it I used to do the improv with Joey Diaz we just go down and do that improv down there and Coconut Grove it was a battleground Florida Club and I love Joel bash cop with all of my heart some of these like West Palm Beach I'm there five sold-out shows for Valentine's Day nobody's laughing I'm like why did you come these tickets cost you money and it's just and then people like oh we did love it it's the weirdest you're pulling from the polar ends of every demographic to comprise a Florida audience well they all escaped to Florida yeah I'm where else the people that are born and raised there whoa that being said Tampa and Orlando fucking fire like awesome mmm maybe it's a condo is a lot of people visiting too yeah Orlando is like maybe that's a Disneyland Universal like that's a giant part of Orlando's people that are visiting yeah and I always like Tampa it was always cool I remember playing the Jacksonville comedy zone I liked West Palm I've always had a good time on West Palm I had a good time cuz I made a lot of money and everybody was nice but I remember thinking like this is like blood from a stone really it was like Valentine's Day weekend and I use a bunch of dudes I get dragged there by their fucking wives it's it's a I always make that joke you're never in the room like though or it'll be in the main room and there's always dudes you can tell the dudes that are there for Marc Maron and the dudes that are there for Rogan because there's like there's just a different tethers two different types of dudes and I always make a joke like if something doesn't mom like I'm like every guys like job where's Rogan that's why I showed up what's she doing here where's Rogan and they always laugh cuz they're like friendly Apes right they're friendly Apes but the you can tell the guys that are there for you these guys are there for mayor and you could tell but cuz they're by themselves I just say they're all in flannel did someone told me they had he had like the highest number ever of single tickets sold in all these different venues I always encourage I like mark of course you do I love duck we're both in a movie coming out together oh yeah what is it it's called Wonderland it's a Mark Wahlberg Winston Duke Peter Berg movie like you and Peter Berger friends I like that guy yeah you guys are the same vibration and uh we're in a movie together and he plays a reporter and I play love interest I'm reticent to say but he was great in the Joker he's great you that Joe come over though I always encourage people there I was like you know you get a damn I'm like I don't want to go to your show alone I might come alone it's a dark room nobody's gonna ever make for them and and you meet at least in my shows you make friends yeah cuz people who everybody wants to feel good it's okay bring it dog come along I've talked to people like that too is it lame to come to your show alone just come on who cares go to the movies by yourself gets yeah there's some good the cool thing about groups are people going to see things is it you're feeding off the vibe of all the people there it's not just it's an experience yeah it's not virtual reality you're worth people it's an experience and you're there and by the way how bad of a comic am i if people are noticing an audience member alone yeah like if that's the focus well the only problem would be like a place like the store they'd have to sit somebody at your table because every place is like a two table but then it looks like you're with them that's right and when I come to pick on you well know yeah then we'll know then Oh PS you the ones by themselves they always seat them I don't know if I asked for it in the Oh are they always seat them in the front so we're some just here alone I'm like that's cool but it's weird you're right in the front well that's cuz it's easy to do right because it's not a table it's a bar you know there's on yeah in front parts like just a long line a large table yeah yeah it's not it doesn't like you're next to someone you could easily be right next to someone you have no idea who they are I can always tell where the like I can tell who's together like shapes go with different shapes and you can tell like where that line is I'm like you're a school shooter you're sitting alone these two were together so yeah the O R is the fucking ultimate University for comedy you learned so much about whether your act sucks or where your acts act like whether or not it's getting better you know it's it's such a we're so lucky I think about that sometimes like when I think about living somewhere else because I do want to live somewhere else and I probably never totally live somewhere else I'll probably keep a place here always because I feel like there's something about being able to go to the store it's so goddamn powerful it's like we're so fortunate that we all work together you know and any given show would be you and me and D'Elia and Whitney and Joey Diaz and Kalin and slight fucking god I'm lucky yes we're so fucking lucky it's like a thick like there's always on the lineup there's always like a dense murderous chunk yeah and I think to myself like wow I'm so proud to post these lineups because these are the people that comic these are the comics that people want to see like this is special for them and that's this dangerous weird energy place is our home and other comics you know people are very intimidated by the store which I totally get because there's a dark energy there but I always feel like I'm part of the Addams Family I'm like yeah but that dark castle is my home yeah well it's a tight-knit group of humans you know we're all real close to each other in a weird way in a weird way but I've never like I'll never go to Brian Callens house like I don't know where you live like not never but like we're close right and I love seeing you guys but like but outside of that for some of us I mean I think it just depends yeah I think we spent enough time with each other at the fucking store on the road with a lot of guys you know so that's different cuz when you're on the road together you really like family you know like if I'm on the road with Diaz or Ari or Hinchcliffe or any of those guys like you know we eat together we work out together we're just bullshitting together walking to the mall together and hanging out like it's all we're together all day and you have systems in place there's like a comfort you bring you know you bring your friends because there's a trust there there's a shorthand my features hunter hill you know hunter no I don't he's huge and he's so funny and it's like I I'm so proud to be able to be in a place in my career where I can foster bring another comic and watch them grow and I'm so proud of him and to get to share my audience with him like that's part of being an established comic that joy it's like having like a childlike of giving them these opportunities yeah and to show them you also have this opportunity to show other comics the right way to tour and the right way to treat a comedy club waitress and the right way to speak to your tour like there's so many shitty comics out there that do things wrong and I very early on decided like these are the rules that I want a tour with and this is how I want to treat people and you pass that on other comics learn from older comics yeah that's the only way we learned about everything really right we've been talking about this a lot lately that there's nothing written written down by people like us by like legitimate established comedians with specials who headline all over the country in the world there's nothing written down by us because there's no rules it's all so fluid but even that just that fact you know like I feel like there's there's there's a book out there that should be written and it should probably be done by us where we kind of just talk about how everyone has a different process everyone's got a different way of doing it because young comics I mean it takes a long there's there's a lot of like wasted energy trying to figure out how to do it and no one can really figure out how to do it themselves until they just have experience and do it but you I want to know how you write I want to know how you what do you do when you have a premise like how do you go up do you do it different than D'Elia does it do you do it different than Diaz does how does Bill start his set right wouldn't we he throws away all his material because he just felt a special right and he started how does he start new you know what do you do and also by the way you can read all about the people that read about comedy and then think that's the way to do it you won't know till you go run and that's why when I you know I had to somebody reach out to me recently like I'm getting up pretty regularly getting laughs pretty regularly I'm like the key is pretty regularly it has to be regularly you know what it's pretty regularly right and I'm like this is a commitment this is a craft this is a passion this isn't a hobby if you want to hobbie you're gonna get hobby a hobbyist results you know that's a good way to put them and so you got to put everything in because it's the only way you know how to operate but just because I write a certain way doesn't mean that works for you like I don't write anything down run some people I remember one comic had a recipe box of jokes and he would go through and each one was categorized is that insane for sure was he good no but everybody's got their way that they do it and if it works it works yeah it's not you know it you can't knock it yeah I think that everyone has their own way for sure and I think you can learn from other people's ways and maybe try them out and also you gotta realize like someone like you is been doing it forever and doesn't write anything down that's very different than someone who's just starting out who doesn't write anything down like you should probably write some shit down yeah a couple key words yeah something yeah and record your sets fuck but it's the thing about it is that there's the the consequences like if you really want to make it as a comic you must literally dedicate your life to it particularly in the beginning like you have to I was talking about this yesterday other day I was like because so many people do comedy now even less did it when you started and not it you know and so many people do it now and there's so many avenues for comedy so many different ways you can do it so many more opportunities I really give the people that do it now that are starting out credit because if I were if I just decided I wanted to start comedy now it would seem insurmountable mmm just how intimidating it is getting in everybody's in UCB everybody to stand up everybody I feel that way about podcast too though you know I was telling what to do podcast I'm like just fucking do it it's a if you can figure out how to do it it's an amazing way to make a living and so many people can do it it's like anything else like comedy like anything else you just start it and do it but there's so many people doing it now I mean the numbers are fuckin astonishing there's no litmus test for like what's a decent but if you're good I really feel like even though there's are 700,000 podcast if you have something that's unique and interesting and you build some people will find it people find it the cream rises at the top and that's with comedy to you know go do your set don't blame anyone else put in the work there's nobody out there who's fucking awesome that isn't making steps toward being better undeniable yes yeah there's nobody out there that's like a brilliant comic and it's like yeah nobody will give me stage time it's been that way for a decade if you are good people will support you a lot of people won't but you have to just move in that direction and even if you are that shitty comic that we were talking about at the beginning like don't let us be the ones to tell you no yeah don't you feel like in this day and age though comics are way more supportive of each other than when you started yeah and I'm at a different level now so I don't it's weird I was thinking about the commerce room when you start there you're like a freshman and now you can become an upperclassmen and the upperclassmen stay upperclassmen like you were an upperclassmen when I started but now I'm also an upperclassmen and these people go from being people you look up to to being your colleagues and among successful comics it's less cutthroat you know and I think because of the pendulum shift in our society people are a little bit kinder or whatever but all that toxic energy that was at the store in particular and in comedy I remember when I started kind of flushed out not really tolerated as much oh it's gone it's a hundred percent kon there's no that there's no like we've got a lady doorman it's crazy place now and and Adam I think to his credit kind of is responsible for a chunk of that chef hundred percent and I think the resurgence of our audience is I would say in large part due to you and your podcast and Maren and his podcast Bret Ernst said this to me a while ago and I agreed with it he was like podcasts people hear it and they come to the store and it's become more of a destination because it for a while like the store was like whatever well there's a prelude to that when Pauly Shore had a show when remember the head and minding the store yeah well when he had money the store I was at the store and I remembered there's this giant crowd in the front bar and I was like what is going on and Pauly was out there and people were like well the show minding the store has really jumped up the amount of people coming it didn't last you know the show didn't last either but there was an impact and I remember the impact we're going oh that's crazy yeah look how many people watch the show it all of a sudden in the Comedy Store became like this destination but now when you think about podcasts like this one there's gonna be heard or in seen by millions of people and the other ones that we've done have also been and then the other you know done fucking how many comics on podcast like total hundreds of them all those are like a free advertisement for the greatest spot on earth for stand-up yeah and you get to say your spots and people come and they just want to be part of it I was in a like a novelty store in Sweden I was buying like a plate with like a cartoon chicken on it and this really cute guy because I like the little things it was like I got it for my assistant it had like a like a tchotchke right and the guy who obviously liked it wasn't his dream job just like a dude and I was talking and he was like I've heard you on Joe Rogan and I was like I'm in Sweden in like a girly plate shop and here's this dude who probably like fucking loves MMA and you and recognize my voice across the world in like the weirdest little plate store and I was like that's the power of comedy like it reaches that far and you get to tour like I got to go on tour I got to go to Malaysia to do comedy it was a like fucking lit they were I to me I did this whole Asia tour and I was like Malaysia is of all the countries I did because I did Hong Kong and I did Japan and there was one more and I'm blanking on it Oh Singapore and of all of them I had not been to Malaysia I'd been to the others and I had less context from Malaysia I knew some of my clothing was made there and I knew that we ship a lot of our recycling there or try to but I had no contacts and it's interesting because you're there and everyone is in a hijab and they're Asian so that's like you don't see that a time yeah cuz they're all Muslim Muslim Imams it look like Asian and like Japanese or Chinese yeah like Asian Wow and they were just the crowd was on fire real I thought it's gonna be super conservative weird I made fun of the Chinese a little bit they were like yes and they just went nuts and they were awesome and I just remember thinking like and some people are expats but a lot of them were just full-on Malaysian and it's all because of Netflix and I was like that's it's so special to have your comment I'm gonna go tour in Russia like places that you have no real context for are feeling your heart and they're understanding what you're saying and it's resonating with people that are nothing like you you're gonna tour in Russia yeah I'm going to Europe like it's just cool and then they know other comics like they know who you are they know who other people and it's just it's this secrets this like language at this community that where you and I are members of and people all want to be part of it right because people want to feel seen and heard and that comedy validates that weird voice in your head and it lets you know that you're not alone and for so many people that feel alone it's so powerful to feel like you're being seen and that somebody understands you mm-hmm and that's why it's so important have so many different kinds of comedy different shapes and colors just so people can choose who they resonate with right I'm never gonna be able to reach everyone and that's okay yeah of course touring and rush is gonna be a trip she let's just did that I'm gonna ask Bert Kreischer for tips did Bert work over there well no but show machine yeah gotta get drunk on a train yeah my right tell you how to get drunk anywhere I got a letter today I'm going to Vietnam and it was in bold and I've been to Vietnam before like for funsies but it was in bold and it was like this like written out like imprisonment will be issued there will be no jokes about do not mention Vietnam War Vietnam like all these things and I legit was like I do mention the Vietnam War so just please remind me day before not to have that one joke it's not a joke about the Vietnam War I just it's in there as part of the set up but some countries like you do military shows they have like a no burden list like you can't there's certain things you can't say you know you do a military show yeah you can't make like drug jokes please not make fun of the president which I get and some countries are like no fucking joke do not say it like so yeah they wouldn't let you joke about Vietnam sorry sorry about all that I feel like I could but then like try explaining contacts to someone that just wants you in jail yeah I was going to China I did Hong Kong and I had Beijing and they cancelled it to honor so random the Tiananmen Square massacre which of course should have been honored prior but it wasn't and they cancelled all comedy not that there was a ton across the land and so but they canceled they canceled it and it's that it's just a thing where we're very lucky in this country you can say whatever you want your rights under your neighbours nose we that freedom is totally not to be taken for granted and other countries are aware of our freedom too and I wonder how long they're gonna keep the bullshit up in places like China I wonder how long they gonna be able to do that because like you see what's happening in Hong Kong where Hong Kong is rebelling against theirs I was there what protests were happening we had to move the hotel cuz it was like in this like Civic area whoa it's I think was like on Kowloon Bay or something and I'll be a thousand percent honest it was so congested and busy there but if I didn't know there were protests going on I wouldn't have known it was and now it's probably grown a lot but I mean it's ongoing those people they got a message and they're not backing down they're not backing down what's incredible is it's been going on for months and months and months it's like new activity people are just in the streets but a lot of people have been shot on video you know by cops and we just watch it I mean and it's like it just happens and it's not a big deal it's insane but we definitely have these social liberties and and I don't take it for granted and some of these country and then part of me is like okay some venues are big some venues are small if I make a joke that you don't like is that gonna be run up the flagpole I don't want to take the chance I know it's so interesting where it's such a strange tipping point culturally in this country and then worldwide you know okay what you know England just had their big elections Jeremy Corbyn lost but he did a video where he was saying how he's running for president or whatever it is Prime Minister what is it over there Prime Minister yeah I'm watching the crown he said his fuckin pronouns he said my pronouns are him he okay can I just put this out there I'm super pro trans I'm Pro fluid sexuality if you are a straight male we know your fuckin pronouns are him he well even if you're a gay male you're a gay male your pronouns your geeky him too if your pronouns are something or what it looks like you are yeah I don't think you need that to me that was very white night he heard he it's a hundred percent white nighty yeah it was very cringy and I think a lot of people like there's like some borderline people like fuck this guy with this he am sure your pronoun I want to say him they Z whatever great he him when you are when you're he hmmm everybody you know it's just such a thing a ploy you know my pronouns are he/him like oh no you didn't you fuck you're 60 years old because what is this it gets other it's it's such a valid thing for other people and then it makes people I roll just a little bit and then I think it takes away from the plight the genuine laws of the trans community yeah which fully supportive of yeah if you want to be called she or her fine I again I'm not down with the made-up words I end up words can all go fuck themselves the sir and zigs well also you wouldn't know unless someone told you like don't get mad at me for not innately knowing that I should have said you should have alley you should have asked the pronouns no you got to tell me no no you have to ask that's the new rule you should you must comply I'm really bad at asking questions Oh like if someone will be like how's your day I'm like great and I talked and I always have to remind myself like how no was your boring day because there's no punch lines in this answer people ask me and I always assume they're just interested and then I realized they're making small talk I should ask I should return the fire mm-hmm right I don't know your beatings are the worst when someone comes over and just starts rattling off about how their day was and there's nothing there nothing like and then I want to try to find a lighter but you know how hard it is to find a lighter and then I went to this store there was no lighter and I was like do you know where I can get a lighter here's the other day somebody was talking to me and I the words came out like a burp I couldn't stop it I just want stop stop telling me stop talking what I did comfortable with that person oh stop talking oh you were comfortable wasn't a stranger that's the difference no yeah sometimes you got to give people a minute they're not as verbally accurate mmm but yeah but yeah mm-hmm as we both think yeah so Malaysia is where is it on the map what sit next to Singapore it's like Singapore's younger I guess Singapore's the younger but they're poor is a lot of expats right a lot of expats a lot of money it's very sterile sterile like it's not like a party but they have a lot of my crazy laws there right if you fuck up that cane you remember the kid yeah that's that was our introduction to Singapore as white America that kids got scars on his ass to this day well here's a I can rule don't go to another country and break their law and think it's cool cuz you're American right like I have such a healthy respect as a proud American I always want to represent well talk about it my axe I'm not gonna do the bit but I really am cognizant of the fact that people in many cases look up to us and or are jealous of us and like with anybody if you give them a reason to be like what an American Pig and I don't I will net like I will always show you that we are as good as we think we are that's what I always say about Hawaii like people say off you go to Hawaii they don't like white people I go no they don't like ass don't like assholes don't litter is one of the nicest places ever do they have a problem with some white people that come over there and act like assholes yeah yeah yeah but like the general look you're gonna find racists everywhere racist against black people racist against Hawaii races against white people racist against Asians you're gonna find that there's certain people that are just they don't like others right that's it's just how it is but for the most part Hawaii is cool as fuck they just want you to respect their land the way that they do and I get it uh it's funny because my mom anything I'm like I'm going these countries she's like don't walk around alone you Jewish be careful and you're at a Jewish by the way like anti-semitism is rampant alive and well yo you can pull it off you don't look anti-semitic like what does that mean you have a tiny little nose well I paid for it what was it like before you got it whacked heared no it was just different it was like you know that's what ever my dad calls it the chin ski hook every one of my family has this nose my Nana whose last name was chin ski and it's just my dad has it looks great on a dude not my favorite thing I gonna do dudes can have fucked up noses and it's kind of noble so my husband has like a big nose right cuz he's got some fella he loves you laugh Italian half Jewish and I said to him cuz I'm like this isn't my nose and if we have a baby I'm like whoa and that can it's a girl and she's got that nose she better be fucking great at basketball or brilliant mmm because just get her nose fixed I don't know be her choice I would want to know it matches your face like if I didn't know good guys jaws fixed I would yeah well sometimes too because I had one you know yo I look and I I can spot one a mile away like a nose job and a lot of people have big noses and they get these scooped out things that don't fit their face because everybody wants like a cute little yeah gosh knows boyish and it doesn't fit if you're like if you've got like a long face and you have this scooped out nose right it's tell like if re got a little nose like yours we'd be like what in the fuck is going on dude had a little elfin nose right but I have a small head I'm small mouth it's a syndrome mmm and I've tiny nose now but uh yeah but that's it I think the blonde hair throws people smell as good as he used to be able to yeah I have your nose holes are probably smaller no my nostrils were always small I had I got when I was 18 so like who remembers anything before that right I have keen olfactory senses I can smell it's like a problem like a wolf like if you had a cigarette yesterday I would be able to tell you now really I it's a problem it makes it difficult for me like what is that one where people not am like where people have sense like we're loud noises upset them yeah I don't know the word what is it I have that with smells mmm and it's difficult just around people and I'm constantly having I'm constantly like being tagged like just mentally attaching things and places of smells like I'm just having not DejaVu but experience fucking useless until I got it fixed I got so much that's the problem everybody says they did deviate or sometime I did I would deviated septum my nose is actually wider I think after the operation cuz they stuff something I had to get these turbinates they're called cleaned up they had they had to cut the inside of my nose out and it was also calcified yeah because you know like cauliflower ear you know that is when guys do fucked up here's from wrestling I squeeze it I have that inside my nose so the inside of my nose was all hard with a lot of people that have been hit in the nose and like scar tissue and just it swells well yeah what it is is when you have blood under skin the reason why you get calcium or the cauliflower ear it's actually what happens is the blood calcifies and the blood actually literally becomes a rock right so like when you see cauliflower ear like I've seen guys get their cauliflower your broken off it falls off yeah there's a video this guy he loses his car flower ears see we can find it Jamie just Google collie forget us on the map it's white it's white like a white stone like now see it really is cows sure yeah so that was inside my nose so they had to open up my nose well you know with fucking forceps and shit carve all this stuff out and then they had to shove these molds like these like to format yeah well it's like foam like like a hard like a you know soft you know dense foam so look at that year on the ground that is yep but that's that's just the calcified part that's just the calcified but it's all the skin attached to it I was relieved probably but guys like it because it makes them feel like a full moon well you can spot a fighter I'll see him in airports I mean they're always also in sweatpants and sliders but yeah that doesn't go away she fought Jessica I and Jessica I fucked her here up and to the point where her cauliflower ear broke off and you could see inside of her head like her ear was hanging down you could lick look into her head it's hard to see from that picture that's not I mean it's cool you're cool with that I think about how sweaty my ears get in these headphones so I can't imagine being punched in the ear repeatedly well I always wore a headgear always from grappling that's why I don't have any cauliflower ear well so you're not like a little tiny peices but you know that little spot little tight spot yeah I always ask if I can squeeze it and they always say yes and it's never satisfying as I don't walk yeah yeah I want to squish it here's Randy Couture told me used to shove it in people's faces like when he was wrestling he said driving into people's eye sockets like that whole thing is a giant rock well props to him for having the precision in battle to be able to do that along all the grappling he's a savage he just had a fucking heart attack yeah it's crazy 55 years old he was working out and he's like um I gotta get a doctor just went straight to the doctor and like dude you just had a heart attack I'm so fucking tough like no notice sir I'll eat my own heart I don't have any sports injuries I don't think I ever played a sport you have no sports injuries at all no I feel like a lot of girls like get knee surgery in high school and stuff like that maybe I just was playin hard enough you don't have you you never played any sports I played sports I just don't have any I played lacrosse oh you were so white so white that's so why it's such a practice go that's the widest sport of all time played lacrosse in Texas so rough sport though cool people don't know people crack people with those sticks what I lacked in genuine athletic ability I made up for an aggression whoa so there's nothing worse than an athlete that's not good but they're very aggressive I think that flavored you as a human but maybe yeah it wasn't cute well it's not cute well I think of girls playing the crosses like hair all over the place and fucking this face in skirts yeah I gotta ejected from a game one time so hard that I wasn't allowed to sit with my team like what's a shade beyond a red card mm-hmm like a black beating heart what did you do I hit a girl with the stick yeah with my car thumb in your hand or something now I have my stick and it was unlawful and they made me sit next to my parents in the stands and it was so humiliating good for you pat you on the head Gertie was pretty good fuck those bitches up I played defense though so I wasn't really a part of it I had a buddy of mine who played lacrosse in high school and I remember taught he was like tell me I was crazy to fight and I was like what's to stop someone from hitting you with those sticks but you guys are running into each other man I could Mike don't kid yourself I'm like you're doing something violent you're just doing something violent under this weird pretend thing yeah under pretend civility yeah boys get pads and helmets and girls do not what the fuck is that all about cuz girls aren't supposed to I mean you're it's a physical sport but boys it's like football with sticks did you like just pick it up like a baseball bat and crack this chick in the head like how would you do it over your head and come down that's not okay right my nickname was that I think it was like oh butcher because like you hold your stick and you come down so hard because you know what it comes out on the field and women are not allowed to be aggressive it's a thing where it's like on sports day like you know we're skirt be ladies represent and you got dudes just running around ripping people's heads off raping villages and one girl takes her shirt off at a World Cup game Megan Rapinoe does something it's like whoa I just got back from the UFC there's three women fights this weekend that's a different thing pretty intense and that's okay now but for other sports it's always expected that women conduct yourselves like ladies right that's not what it's sport it says nothing to do with the real world it has to do with trying to win but it also has violated the rules I broke the rules because otherwise like if everybody was just swinging at each other there would be a tip totally different sport no I was not great and I own that what did you do did you just swing it over your head I probably just came down but a hammer yeah like if you have too much like torque built up like I had and I hit and you're not supposed to you know her on the head you can give a tap a tap to get the ball out of the thing I didn't hit her on the head I think I I probably hit her stick so hard I don't remember my friend was telling me people get concussions high school is only like three years ago I'm like how many people you know you've been getting concussions from lacrosse it was like a lot I was like bro you're in a violent sport it's a violent sport fucking violent sport and it's oddly not a professional sport because I think it would be an exciting professional it's a professional sport but it's not it's not a widely received one I'm gonna make any money playing lacrosse it's like it's bowling right it's not no good they do have it I have a friend that plays professionally and I don't know who's watching it but they do it right but what do you think that it would be like hockey legit yeah rugby should be our football that's what I think I think the mathletes less concussions they had less concussions back when they were playing with those little leather helmets and little tiny pads cuz you just couldn't do what these guys are doing you're just smashing into your head as a battering gigantic super athletes in their prime running a preposterous species undescribable power yeah those guys are so fucking strong when you're around a real professional football player she's huge there are no they look like Brendan Schaub plus right but you know when you're around Shaw how fucking biggie is imagine him plus 60 70 pounds that's these guys I get a joke 300 seen four people here they're so big it doesn't make sense and they're running at each other full clip it's terrifying it's terrifying and it's so bad for your fucking brain that being said I would like to go to a Rams game yeah to see the new stadium yeah I like to go in to learn them one of them big bulletproof hamster wheels you know and play but nobody could see me no so nobody just a skybox cuz field fight what are you talking about game we talk about two different things Rams what are you talking about ball I'm saying go in the audience but being like a bulletproof box why don't you sit in a skybox it is bulletproof that's true and you can do not didn't need not down with the people yeah is that what you want to give us a proletariat well with the Raiders game that's how it wants a Raiders game oh boy a bulletproof box yeah James have boxes on the field bulletproof boxes and about bulletproof honestly I was thinking Raiders but the Raiders game is you the Raiders are going to Vegas now right it's gonna be more violent because there's no loyalty is just people coming and getting fucked up and being like Raiders that's a weird sport or a weird team right because the Raiders are synonymous with thugs yes it's like one of the only sports or one of the only teams where the audience is synonymous with thugs I always think of fraser-smith joke was all these like thugs at Knott's Berry Farm and it's like just like some teenagers it's like boo Raiders bitch and I always think of that like some kid and like a sheet just scaring you and yelling Raiders but I think having a transient audience for a home team is kind of a thing of course people live in Las Vegas but by and large it will be a tourist attraction mm-hmm because it's also in the fall and winter so it's a not sweltering time of year to go to Las Vegas and I don't know it'll be interesting to see like hometown pride and what that fan looks like when you're in a city where everybody's always coming in I don't believe it's real I don't think I mean Vegas is a real town there are real locals there but I don't think there's enough to show like hometown pride especially for something like the Raiders Iran fuck in LA they're from LA and then they're from Oakland yeah and now they're here in Vegas but they're not from Vegas and I don't think the Rams I mean to me I don't really even know anyone that watches football and it's a it's weird that we're getting a football team yeah I wonder what would happen if players were not allowed to switch teams well it's just like a sentence like if you take the oh you're like Larry Bird you're in the fucking Celtics for life you know like there's back when I was a kid I didn't watch sports but I remember like players were on teams like Michael Jordan was on the right yeah I that was how it was with the Cowboys growing up whether she wants it or not like it was a part of your life mm-hmm and all those guys are forever synonymous like Deion Sanders prime time 21 baby look that's the Dallas Cowboys and I remember there was a DJ who passed away who did Kidd Kraddick and he was the kiss FM DJ in the morning that God passed away passed away no as soon as that Art Attack but I remember he would always this is not that funny but he would always say I'm from Dallas Texas where the Cowboys play and I would say that for years because I thought that was like a cool source of practice it's America's team and then I realized all that did was open up the conversation to someone being like whoa Cowboys and I don't have the information to back it up right and I don't want to have that conversation right you'd have a debate about the Cowboys versus blank like saying I'm four years on stage at like a shitty club I feel like I'm from Dallas and you'd always get a guy like no fuck the Cowboys I'm like cool dude not attached to it like this is not gonna be how this hour goes but uh ya know real but it is a part of your upbringing sports dudes love to get angry there's something about sports radio and sports broadcasting they love to get shitty about athletes that guy's a pussy to fucking play I was in Montreal last week and I was just sitting in a cafe and I was just listening to these two french-canadian guys go in on just shitting on other parts of Canada and other cities and the stuff he was it was savage like they eat their own in Canada and it was just shitting on the leaves and shitting on Winnipeg arts a city of degenerates that's why they lock it down at 10:00 like just losing it and then I tweeted I instagrammed about it and then the rest of the Canadians weighed in on how much they hate French Canada became a thing and I'm like not as much hockey well French Canada is a different candidate it's a different thing that's great I love it up there I love Quebec but they bound us a seed they want us to seed since I've been going up there since the 90s yeah people get froggy when it comes to the brexit thing but nobody even brags it the England's not pumped about that Northern California wants us the seed well Bret so weird because brexit is you know they're part of the European Union it's almost like Texas leaving the United States my whole thing is whatever I understand the reasons wanting that the second somebody tries to invade like you don't have your own militia you don't have an army well they this whole European Union thing is very new though because you cannot just easily when you're in England you got to go through the whole thing when you're going another country and it used to just be such a chill thing mm-hmm and now it's a little bit of a nightmare I haven't done it I haven't done it haven't traveled to England since the whole brexit thing has been going on I did I went through touring and it should have just been like just hop on a plane to go to your other countries just stuck in customs hoping someone comes for you I don't know enough about the arguments pro and con to comment on it honestly well and it truly doesn't matter because we don't have a vote in it but I know the dude looks like a British version of Donald Trump yeah he looks like there's got fucked up yellow hair the whole deal it literally looks like their version of Trump like a wonky ER if it's possible younger version walk you're hotter a little bit they say America sneezes the rest of the world catches our cold you know like we do something people will start to imagine if dudes with fucked-up blond hair to start taking over the world I feel like that was Hitler's vision I feel like that's where they were right was crazy was like Hitler didn't look like that brown hair I think he even had like a Jewish grandma brown eyes every Jew knows that Jewish grandma I think it's something like that look at that guy come on what he looks like here's some dumb and dumb anyway he's not hotter he's just younger when Trump was younger he was way harder than that didn't know that guys terrible terrible looking no I doubt a lot of Trump supporters this weekend his Colby Covington was fighting the OSI and he's a big Trump supporter you know I got to say this this is not pro Trump but this is pro your own rights we have this thing in California I said something I was in a writers room and I said something about someone who I knew that voted for my family that voted for Donald Trump and they really they someone was like someone in your family voted for Donald Trump do you still speak to them and I was like don't get hyphy with me this idea that you can't I understand he represents all these horrible things but we have to be able to have conversations you know in this country and on both sides and other liberals at times and I say this as a person who's fairly liberal it's terrifying just attacking your own allies and creating no space for a conversation well liberals used to be when I was a kid and my parents are hippies and we lived in San Francisco when I was a little kid and so I always thought of liberals as being the people that were like open-minded you know not wanting to silence people letting people speak they're all about people just being whoever who they are and not not trying to enforce like rigid patterns of behavior and thought on people but that's not the case now because they think they're doing the right thing I think they're combating something that's awful and aggressive and regressive you know that's something that is that they feel like the country that they know and love is slipping away so the conservative so does everyone but the response to it is not the right way to go about it the response to it is to show a great example of what your your ideology represents by being a good person by being open minded by being kind instead people are being super super shitty there's so many super shitty people to think they're doing the right thing because they're progressive and although they want good things they want gay rights and they want racial equality and they want people to be able to make more money and it wasn't me happy and healthy attacking anyone who from the get-go doesn't agree with you because by the way if you if you and I disagree and you calmly want to have a conversation with me I am very open to having my mind change of course I want to be on the right side and I want to do the best thing if you yell at me and you call me stupid call me and you're attacking me and you're on the defense from the get-go or you're on the offense from the get-go but just as a person with pride you're gonna want to be like you know what I don't want to hear and fuck you because you represent now all the good intentions like you're the representative of all that and I don't like you yeah so you are um you're an ambassador for your cause when you speak I'm really into the environment and plastic and stuff like that and I am very specific about how and when I post about things because you don't want people to get activism and you don't want to be the person who posts about everything because then no one will listen to anything right and you don't want to call people out specifically because just because somebody carried a plastic bottle that day doesn't mean they don't drive a hybrid you don't know what people are doing right did you see Chris Pratt yeah Shane I think literally what I'm thinking of and while I love that he did that part of me is like that's a little holier-than-thou shamed him Jason Momoa is so fucking hot so hot he's on but we were so especially on line we're so quick to be like you're not doing it right we do it with feminism too and you have no idea right the pious good life that person is leading and you're judging them on a snapshot on which you don't want to be judged on well they want to judge people the thing is about it's a lot of what this is about people that are on the fringes it's the the ideas are great right but the people that want attention for espousing these great ideas oftentimes are the fringe so the far left and far right a lot of it what it is it's just people that are ultra aggressive about enforcing their ideology and then they're really shitty and they want other people to comply and so you get these people that represent the right and these people that represent the left but they're a lot of the ideas of the right in the level it's nothing wrong with being fiscally conservative there's nothing wrong with being Wiccan yes right and you want less government in your money there's room in there for conversation but when you go far right and then you go far left then there's no room and when you start to vilify people yeah from the get-go uh and when you start expecting people I oh and Benjamin who is just basically as like in a tinfoil hat somewhere and like living off the grid he offended a lot of people right you're staring at me yeah and almost no and he said a bunch of them about trans stuff and I remember there was this girl that I was friends with on social media didn't know her but just followed her cuz I liked her writing that's it and she deems me one day and she's like she's like oh and Benjamin like how could you be like maybe I had I don't know if I'd interact with him on Twitter I'm never on Twitter because I think it's a toxic fuck hole and she was like she's getting mad at me and I go what are you talking about she was like he said all this stuff that's anti-trans and i hadn't heard anything but let me let me say what he said okay and here's the thing he went off and do a spiral right but I agree with what he said what he said was there was someone that he knew someone who works in Hollywood that had a three-year-old that they were turning trans right and he said that that was child abuse that was what led I don't disagree with this crazy situation totally this is my no I agree with it 100 percent don't disagree with that I agree with child hundred percent you wouldn't let that child decide what it's eating right so that's some really great joke you don't let this is I wish I could remember who was they said you don't let a kid pick their outfit why the fuck would you let them pick their gender first I just made yeah but it's somebody did it right I'm not gonna do the joke but so that aside and the spiral side which I didn't even know participate and like it's whatever like those are your choices that's what you're saying I had known because here's the thing that cost him dearly his agency left him and then comedy clubs banned him for that that was the beginning he just steered into that skid well that's but that's what started the skid right what started this game there was something else about like he called someone who had written a look that's not the point of what I'm saying went south afterwards never managed those things my point was I knew none of this so I'm just like going to brunch one day and this person starts attacking me offline how can you be friends with him and I go whoa what are you talking about she's like he's saying all these horrible things and I attack you in person she's in my like direct message oh and I this is my only point is I said I've known Owen most of my career let me go read what you're talking about and she was angry at me for wanting to gather information this person is a trans writer who I literally until that moment didn't know his trans cuz I was just a fan based on merit like I just like the writing mmm-hmm and I said how dare you shame on you as a journalist you should applaud that I go and collect my facts they want compliance like immediate instantaneous company and I said I'm an ally and I am Pro trans and I'm Pro gay rights but you do not get to bark at me on a Sunday morning when I have no idea what we're talking about and getting mad at me and I don't trust anyone who says they're an ally about I'm a total but you say that if you say I'm an ally only I vote and I eats mrs. Doubtfire that's a little an alpha power she is just the term allies gross it's it's okay when other people use it like he's an ally that guy's a now is she's an a-line I get that that's a good way to use it but when you say I'm an ally I'm like yeah okay nobody well i'm pro-trans good for you and I blocked that person I was like you don't get to bark at me mm-hmm and tell me for any cause yeah I too many fucking people live on Twitter it's not good it's not healthy folks I don't life talk to people Twitter is it's become like a subway bathroom wall like people just told me the exact same thing last week's is now it on phone okay because you're just screaming into a void and all it does is just it just nets negativity so they're just waiting for you to fuck up mm-hmm by the way anybody who's ever said anything awful to me on Twitter who I've seen in person they say nothing and I'm new I'm hearts the only way people should talk it's face-to-face yeah louis c.k said that to me we were talking about this and he said it's just talk but it's written down so people think it's like more than it is well because people but people would say these kind of things and he would go you get like she send retweets which are basically pitchforks but like if you said something like if you said something about someone like so you said something about Bert or something like that you know and he said it online like fucking Bert should know a lot about getting drunk in Russia if he read that it sounds so bad it's like what the fuck there's no inflection right buddy right but if you just said it to me we're hanging out and then you saw Bert and hugged him I wouldn't think you're hypocrites right right right so it's it's like what Louie was saying it's just talk it's beneath what it's written it's talk without nuance or infection because not everyone has mastered grammar or punctuation it's worse especially for us cuz I say things we talk shit you know like even now you and I are going on everything and I'm like I'm gonna face a firing squad of betas when I get on my Instagram later blood Rogan and not you listen there's a certain percentage of people that are gonna attack every woman who comes in the show pressure that just happens but how he's almost always I break that jessiemae Jesse man got like super positive doing it better than you know what's up oh now she's the only one that I've had up but maybe how do you know cuz she told me do you check maybe she's just like a half glass half-full kind of girl he was just high all the time I don't know I don't know anything she's high all the time oh yeah I am NOT I know it's like not cool I am NOT a pot smoker yeah and I water nope I mean I did a tripod my brother grows Elon Musk moment you know man man did I didn't think his yeah I didn't think he looked as weird as everybody thought I was weird but because he was like trying to like hold it in or whatever do you know that my brother has a marijuana farm that's what my brother does where Northern California and he does it like he's got a gun like he grows his plants we're not a farming people but he that's what he does it's a great way to make a living right now makes his living and I am just not I would like to like it because it seems like what's wrong with it to you what is I just think you're gonna be hot boxed in about 10 minutes I thought that wasn't a real thing it's a real thing I've got places to go you'll be more jovial and outlined you work I mean I'm good more community-oriented later the day see I think it makes me I always people always like no this is indica into coach and achieve open your month and I always feel like it makes me think about death and I feel uncomfortable and my mind just starts racing yeah me too I don't want that because I already think about death I'm already uncomfortable it gives look I think I need humility in every form but it is an excellent form of humility to me it helps me it helps me be more humble it helps me be nicer to people no it does you are nice I am nice so what do you reason why I'm nice this isn't my pot head is maybe a nicer person I've always been nice but I have less not nice in me than I ever did before I think that just comes with age maybe two for sure you're very old yes very ancient no barely alive uh I'm halfway dead for sure unless everything goes amazing what is that oh that's uh that's for my friend Maynard he sent me that from his farm we were talking about one of these phones like a black jacket no that is that gigantic monster is a tarantula hawk that is a quaint name oh yeah something out of a beast you arey they kill tarantulas they sting the fuck out of them and lay their eggs in their body those are monsters they're so big it's like a little bird so he was explaining it to me and describing how fucking big it was then he sent me one a dead one from his place pretty cool I don't think it's dead I think it's waiting that's Maynard from tools bug that's fucking Santa weed cloud in the room it's floating over her side of the room ah yeah it's trying marijuana's try to talk to you it's like Eliza we have creativity for and you get it everywhere it said all the shows they give you and I just you don't have to I don't you don't have to you just no need no need to do you do anything like do you meditate you do anything to try to alter your state I do a lot of deep thinking I'm not as good at meditating as I would like but I'm very self-reflective that's good and I do a lot of do you feel like women that are confident get kind of like more heat like men that are confident don't really get that much heat from women right it's almost like expected but women that are confident get hate like when I if I did a woman's podcast right like a woman's podcasts or a woman's pot comments like you was a girl that I did your podcast I don't get hate which from women sure uh no I don't get what I wouldn't get hate from women but I think for certain Matt like sometimes guys podcast they want to hear you talk about guys shit you know I talk about football for at least five minutes and I hope my talked about how you were violent as a lacrosse right so are you rock hard or what Miller well I think it's um it's not something that I think about a ton because people always like always feel confident it's just it's not like I took a pill to become that way I just always operated just the way I was supposed to some people like you some people don't but I think I think people get insecure and I think insecurity for men and women manifests itself in very ugly ways whether it's women hating other women for being more attractive whether it's you didn't get laid so now you're gonna go shoot up a group of people yeah and insecurities I talk about this in my book is just such a personal ugly thing and people it's you are constantly putting it on others I used to be that a girl can have a hot body and there was zero consequences no it never was out it was never that girls didn't like it but there wasn't like publicly espoused consequence we didn't have social media right oh definitely there was hot girls are always called sluts right always and forever gold diggers or something like that but salem witch trial all the men hot bodies oh yeah but that wasn't real do you know what that was about the Salem witch trial was it was about Oh God they had a late Frost and the late Frost cause fungus to grow on their wheat they thought that fungus contains lysergic acid which is a very similar to LSD so while these fucking people were eating their bread and using their wheat and flour they're getting acid poisoned so they were thinking that everyone was witches hmm and it was always probably men that couldn't get laid and now you're talking about in America because it was different that very particular thing but what came to check to make sure that I'm that this hasn't been debunked well tell you that what came before that in the witch seeking out of witches in Europe mm-hmm um it was this widespread thing of course to spread Christianity but they'd have which committees like go from town to town to find people because everybody needs like a scapegoat and then they check you for marks and of course a mark could just be a birthmark and then there's trial by fire trial by flow you know they used to tie women down and weigh them down with rocks and if they drown they weren't a rich witch Peter survived then they knew they were witches right you're fucked either way I listen to Erin man keys podcast lore and he talks about this stuff all the time and he talks about what I'll lure Ella wari it's awesome about folklore all different kinds and he talks about the different trials so you know and it's all stuff like that we're like you're kind of damned if you do damned if you don't regardless like if you we set you on fire and if you scar then you're not a righteous man and if you die you were righteous whoops-a-daisy so this is the thing was the point o witches had hot bodies you're talking about the women having good bodies know what I was talking about is that women when they go on a man's podcast a lot of times just the get women or men rather will hate on them I owe that what's going to say that women have like today women your body shaming or you're showing an unrealistic body type and you're feeding into unrealistic body expectations I've seen that a lot saying that to another woman yeah yeah there was an ad that was pulled in England in the UK because it was like a gym ad and this girl was in a bikini she had a hot body I figured what it was for thing was a gym something like that maybe sunscreen or some shit but this girl had a hot body and they made them pull the ad because it was promoting unrealistic body expectations but I was like what isn't well here's the thing it's like it's a girl like she's a real person it's not unrealistic you can do it you can get really fat - that it is are you bench body but to me that's not maybe an England that's unrealistic but in LA that's just normal that is not unrealistic realistic no it's just here's my thing here's my thing it's a hot girl let's say that's her body okay um I do think we have a problem in our society like my boobs are real and because they're big my whole life I mean my adult life people are like or those two through and they can't believe that and I'm like someone's got to have real tits for you to ask if they're real yeah they're real some some big ones are real and it's offensive but it's also like people are just it's almost like we're so fed all of this fake stuff that when someone actually hasn't my eyelashes are real and they're long and people always like those gotta be fake I'm like someone had to have had real eyelashes in the first place to measure other eyelashes against so when someone's big or strong we always assume that they're faking it cuz sometimes our noses are fake right but some girls go crazy with the eyelashes on their heads but my other thing is like I can judge that girl silently I don't have to say it to her face like you don't have to be a piece of shit about it right well that's the thing about social media is you just attacked that girl I don't want to be high and I feel like I'm high name definitely know how I feel so high do you I don't know I've been playing with this chord too long you might be again paranoid I am a little sweaty really my name is cuz he got severe cousin finally me too yeah yeah oh the heath on yeah yeah it was cold in here when we first got in yeah I find those like 59 degrees I think it's just your body heating the room hmm I come on your podcast because I genuine enjoy interaction and I do think you have a really smart cool audience of mostly people that think like you I think as a woman or just as a person anytime you open your mouth or leave the house there's gonna be people like you people who don't right so you just don't focus on the ones that don't because I have found when someone doesn't like me it typically has nothing to do with actually me well there's the thing that people do when someone's very opinionated where you wanna for some reason like combat their opinions I've seen people do it even the things that they don't necessarily disagree with yeah they just become a contrarian just like the fuck but that's what I'm saying it has nothing to do with what I said it's something in you that you're bothered by and I really try and being autodidactic and and being self reflective when I don't like someone I really try to examine what it is and sometimes it comes out I'm like oh maybe I'm just jealous I'm just jealous you use autodidactic don't be jealous you just do really well snuck it in there without anybody a lot of time it is jealousy versus oh I really hate their stance it's that but sometimes it's also there's an incorrect way of thinking about people like when someone's confident or someone's brash for whatever reason like we get competitive might fuck that guy that's dick yes instead of getting like huh what do I care as long as he's not being shitty to me - you think about it that upsets people because deep down you're reminded that you're not that and those are all the things you want to be sure oh he's confident oh he's strong oh he's good-looking oh I've seen that was men yeah oh yeah for sure I I all the time if there's like an attractive guy you know they're like oh isn't he pretty short and it's like maybe he is but does that help you it's know if a guy short do you feel better now you know will they do that's the only way they do yeah but it's not real see the thing is when you shit on someone and wants to being funny if you're being funny I'm all for you but if when you're when you're just being mean about someone like some football player look who's a fucking poser you keep you off of the ball like is it really but could you do that job come on man with a freight train coming at you fucking pussy he's just not as good as at football as some of the best people well and it so takes away from I'll use feminism for example when I do have a genuine criticism of someone you're so rarely I talk about this on my special but like you're so rarely allowed to voice it cuz it's like well you're just jealous I'm like or I am in fact doing the correct feminist thing and judging her on merit of what she has done and I dislike it and it has nothing to do with her being beautiful I think the there's obviously issues that women need more equality in in this country I think the issue with the concept of being a masculinist or even the concept of being a feminist is that everyone automatically thinks you care about that more than you care about Jen you general humanity right because you're isolating gender you're saying I am a feminist I'm a woman I support women I would support women's rights and women's values and I support feminism empowering women when people hear that they go okay you like women more than men but might not be that it what it is is I support the idea that we could be treated equally because men and I love men I love breaking balls with male comics I married a dude I have made out with some hot dudes congratulations again I am actually a gigantic frat boy trapped in a feminist body but that all we're fighting for is just to be treated equally and not be made to feel horrific that's it I'm not asking for special treatment I get it I have zero problem with any of it of course not but I my thought on why people react so strongly to it I get it signing away your like rights but I think that like when people hear it like they kind of have that feeling like oh she's one of those oh she's a man-eater it's like it's a risk it's almost like the word is so heavy so heavy that it doesn't necessarily accurately portray the intent well it's so fraught with historical weight yeah and I do think that's changing but I also believe I pick it's a word I had never used until like three years ago and I picked it because I was like well this sort of applies I don't read feminist writings I don't the idea that as a woman you're constantly being preached to by other women like preaching to the choir right what it is is I think on a granular level I enjoy having conversations and most men I know or like they're not these oppressive horrible people and we always look to the extreme left or right to prove our point when and there's a whole population of people who think and feel just like you and that's the key is finding those people yeah and communing with them well Europe you've always been very Pro male you've never had problem with men but you you're also you're confident in ambitious and when you're both of those things and people hear the word feminist they go oh she's one of those like she's gonna be annoying you're not know but there's that thing and I think it goes back to what we're talking about earlier it's the fringes yeah it's not like all men fucking men that want to sue you because they can't do it that's actually more of a guy who's just trying to sue people but I guess like okay straight Pride Parade we were talking about this in the phone straight Pride Parade guys right like that kind of shit all over the worst don't worry but just the idea of having that people that say all men like the kind of feminists that say all men I'm like you're part of the problem because that's just as bad as some guys saying all women are sluts right you are just as bad for marginalizing anyone I was hearing this woman talk about sex and she was like women want this and women wants to Zona podcast women want this and women want you to slow down women want you to be Jen I'm like no no no some women some women do I mean I know some women want to get ravaged look you're talking to a girl who speaks in generalizations for a living like women do this but by and large I don't joke for sure and by and large most you know these things are right because these it's you proved it over years and years but I also like sex podcasts are like so not my thing well it's just so crazy to speak for all women yes like trying to speak for all men so if I said men like to be ball gagged men like to be kicked in the balls men like to be tied up and pissed on their shit they want you to shit in Tupperware and send it to them well that's true some men like that that's real let me ask you question okay does that get into that territory where now you're on stage and you and you have to start saying some not all speaking for me if you personally I know for me well we have this thing where we are we don't look at things granularly and we're like well they said also they must mean all and fuck them well for me it's been a little bit of a chat where it got in my brain Joe who's your buddy your roaming yeah don't worry about we're gonna be fine I have a dog it's outside I keep remembering I have a dog very sweet you want to talk about her the little situation sure it's crazy this little girl was on their way to China no no she's from China yeah well they import the meat they were gonna eat her they were gonna eat her she has a scar around her nose where her mouth was bound like it's all around it's very sad I noticed that yesterday I thought she just cuz she's a white dog I thought she had like tear marks and then I noticed and went all the way around and then but I also realized that she lets me kiss her on the mouth so she's not weird about about I got her less than 24 hours ago yeah I was I make candy every year for the Comedy Store Christmas party I make it for all the employees and it's actually a really difficult thing to hand out because out of uniform I can't remember who works on who doesn't like you know a couple waitresses I remember last year I had my bag of candy it's his homemade sponge candy and I went up to this girl and I just said do you work here meaning if you do I'm gonna give you candy right it was as if I had set her mother on fire she goes no sweetie I'm a comic and I was like I just walked away but it's like but are you because I don't know who the fuck you are but also like don't be a bitch yeah well just say no just say no I was just trying to suss out work there you know so I brought this candy do it every year I'm home yesterday I asked my husband to get sugar and we didn't have we had like you have a thing of sugar because he accidentally used all of it making something whatever so I chef we had a holiday party but you know when you say he accidentally used it you say it like he's in hell well he didn't know no he didn't realize he had used so much in making his cranberry thing and he said I thought I had I left you more but I needed more oh so I called a friend I said can I have some your sugar she's like why don't you just go to the store at the bottom of the hill and get it like this one was dog well I go there and they're these two what are they uh beagles and they were for adoption and I really want to talk and there was a giant husky that was like your size and I was like maybe I'll have a husky it was too big and I'm starting to like convince myself like maybe I have a beagle and the lady was Chinese she was like we have more dogs in the car she opened up the car and there was like seven cute little white dogs and I picked up this one and I just started crying my dog died while I was on tour in Japan I never got to say goodbye to Blanche and I'm just crying and I'm holding this dog and she's white and I was there to buy sugar and it like I do the girl thing where I'm like and she's white and it's sugar and she should and it's cosmic cut to me just putting $300 in a cardboard box with no receipt no paperwork I gave this Chinese lady my phone number and I have a dog now her name is tofu so this lady goes to China and brings him back yep Wow that's heavy and they were all like schedule moved to go by Laurel Canyon you know you think that's so many fucking la people that love dogs in that area so many people and it must work because she wouldn't set up shop always a good spot for dogs you could have dogs here you know like everybody has a fucking dog you know what's really weirdly not a dog friendly city is New York yeah well it sucks I mean unless you live right next to Central Park it mean to have a dog yeah yeah yeah if you're in a fucking apartment you're in a seventh floor walk-up and your dogs got to take a shit Jesus Christ you got to walk down seven flights of stairs no dog out yeah and then the dogs like sniffing like hey fuckface see all my shit already and there's so much garbage my dog one time found all the pieces to a full Thanksgiving dinner on the streets there's so much garbage New York gets gets weird and then you have to pick the shit up too you know I saw there was a bunch of people in Brooklyn the cut man because they have this they have these trees and then they have the trees sort of fenced in and then people were taking the dark putting it over the fence letting the dog shit and then picking it up there putting sides up there they took pictures of these people put signs up and like this is not a toilet meanwhile all of them four other cigarette butts in the street a lot of them I lived in Brooklyn for seven weeks this year no shooting my show and I was appalled you think of New Yorkers as this intelligent race and they're all just thrown my cigarette smokers almost universally do that it's where do you and I I hear I just went on a rant about those reasons like where do you think that's going mm-hmm think about it your friend John actually I confront him about that he's like God somebody gets paid to pick that up nope I did too a comedy store working the other day he's heard I go what are you doing you'd be better and he picked it up you have to shame someone so that they remember people I love and respect do that in the back parking lot of the comedy store I'm like what are you doing man you're littering you gotta say something I don't think of it as littering there's something weird but like but think of it right think of it why do you think they don't think of it as literary because it's always been done and they think someone's sweeping it up it's not only are these cars engines going in our oceans and in our fish these could set fires it's overall health and also don't be a piece of shit don't throw things on the ground yeah not even food like we all think you throw an apple core out it's okay it isn't that attracts animals it doesn't like to parts where it should've on the road driving by of wood in the fucking wooded area but people just throw trash out nobody considers realize that like this is your community and this is your home yeah and it I won't even drink out of plastic and the cigarette thing is one of the weirder ones because I I always felt like maybe it's because they're they're treating themselves like shit yeah here's a question you're driving down the road with your window up and smoking a cigarette so you know that the smoke needs to you know the smoke is bad because you're letting it escape why not just roll up your window and smoke it in your fucking car and kill yourself quietly mmm why do you have to have it open or smokers that stand in the doorway I'm like it's not any warmer near the doorway if you're smoking outside you're just making it so that we all have to smell like cigarettes leaving the building they don't give a fuck about that smell that smells weird because the smell of pipes is actually nice tobacco's yeah yeah someone has a night like to smell of cigars I like the smell of cigars it smells good to me the smell of cigarettes is always shitty and I don't know why we can't put perfume doesn't last cigarette smoke lasts for days and I that's OHS the kissing your clothes like nothing else what have you yeah isn't it something pretty you could burn just like waving around your body some sage type deal to do what get a good smell like instead of like perfect you yeah wave it over your cooter put on your feet so my vagina burns just no no no like get smoke everywhere Oh what if you did poo pourri that stuff that you spray what he did that on your body and then walk through a cigarette would it deflect who would win who would win the bad smell the good smell who will represent us in a science off i mocked by this lady the other day i had to stop because i was tying my shoe and this lady her perfume was so strong i literally wanted to stop tying my shoe and move away from her you know some people just go ham with the perfume yeah like i know that's not what you smell it i find it more often is with cologne oh yeah i'm just like oh it's gross yeah it is gross because it triggers something you're like this feels cheap this feels like i'm 20 in a shitty bar you want see a dude doing a cologne commercial I'm always like do you wear that stuff man no hey Brad Pitt you really wearing Cologne he doesn't have to does he do cologne commercials probably in like Japan he does right yeah yeah Julia Roberts has that one it's a weird European one where she's got her hands tied to like marionette strings but that was a thing back in the day the day meeples it's on that side right in front of you we're here too but the weird thing is back in the day like actors would never do commercials because if you did a commercial we all knew even people who were non act and at the end yeah there was something wrong something go for somewhere right I mean wouldn't you here's a million dollars just say that you like this beverage now everyone sees everything yeah but back in the day like we'd find out that like Oh Julia Roberts does big-time commercials in Japan you'd be like what here's the thing there will be no day of reckoning like I always think about this with acting you make a shitty movie seldom is anyone ever in an interview gonna be like remember that piece of shit you made like you never have to atone in person for a bad film choice because no one would have the balls to shit on you for trying to make money and make a living there he is Chanel there you are I remember that commercial that is so preposterous if I was Brad's friend I played that every time I went over his house I would walk in with a boombox I'd have a way if he came over my house would be on every television and I'd go tell me when he's at the door tell his other door ready go play that's peak pit right there - where do the hairs legends of the fall hair yeah that's it that's the fucking man who lives in the woods hair look at him hey dude he's beautiful man beautiful house beautiful Jays mom oh I was on set with this actor named Ryan Hansen who's in like Veronica Mars and he's really and we were he was just we're talking about like would you rather and we were playing this game and he was like who's used to literally pass I'm like no one it will wreck your marriage but I just said I thought Jason Momoa was hot and he just goes all he would treat you right but then when the time came he would fucking lay it down and I was like yeah put that velvet scrunchie on me into it okay so many different kinds of hot weird that that do is describing how another guy's gonna fuck you though we're a little weird at school it was cool okay during lunch this is hot handsome fella I mean you ain't got to really and that scar is from a bar fight is it so manly mmm yeah it's not like painted-on legit he could have lost it I could of but it doesn't yeah he's okay right like old Frazetta paintings of Conan yeah big scar across his forehead cut into his eyebrow I feel like you would want that but you would want a face car hmm right uh I probably kept fighting I definitely would have got one I would have got some fuck if I just kept fighting yeah I don't want to face good I've got a small one do you what happened alaskan malamute bit me on the face long Thanksgiving I'm sure weird ones those Malamutes bite people in the face I will be honest I was taunting the dog I was like eight and it got its revenge I hear about German Shepherds biting people in the face doing a German Shepherd Oh - I've never had one but I respect their great dogs beautiful dogs no they're smart and a Belgian Malinois as well oh those are real smart the movie I just did I had to do like a little half day of training with a Malinois for the scene and I had to like hold its collar before I let it go and that dog pulled me yes I got fucking strong no joke have you ever seen some of the videos where they jump up like these preposterous hi yes to grab things like a vertical yeah we just saw honey feet straight up in the air they jump off people's shoulders and straight up in the air it's I don't know where they get the propulsion they're just ridiculously powerful athletic dogs that are designed to attack people yeah that's what my tofu is gonna be yeah I mean they're yeah I think so she's got a nasty vicious yeah four five pounds she fucked you up but those malam waz and German Shepherds they need work one of the things that people do they make a big mistake is they get a dog like that and they don't do anything right it that's a working dog like if I had a dog like that I'd take it with me all over the place I would run it every fucking day we would throw a ball with it you got to give them active things to do it's German it loves precision and productivity well it's a guard dog yeah you know it's it's bait look at that look at that dog yeah I mean what in the fuck that dog can fly don't gonna be in the NBA and then how about how the dog lands like it gets on this thing but they know how far it's gonna go all right that is an insane amount of athleticism that was a human I mean though we're watching a dog combine yeah it's like the Hulk that would be like leaping through the air like the Hulk it's always hard for me at the airport when I see like a like a drug-sniffing working dog but it's like a yellow lab I'm like I can't pet the yellow lab I don't I don't you could ruin the dog I don't want to ruin the dog and his chances at retirement you could ruin it I'm not going to yeah those drugs drug sniffing dogs make me fucking nervous because I'm like what are they looking for no need that's the truth but you can only teach a dog to look for one thing you know you can't stress the truth the truth you can't teach a dog hey I want you to look for guns and coke right it's like residue right right right do you smell gunpowder do you smell marijuana like what do you smell like what do you what do you train you train the dogs smell hair and mushrooms bring them back right find them find me little fuck you're definitely the heroin cuz I think you can make more things out of that well it's one that kills you it's one of the reasons why they should look out for heroin fentanyl I think it smell fence and all that would be nice they could smell fucking anything but I feel like fentanyl it's more local I'm actually no I don't know what I'm talking about I feel like with prescription drugs like that's more like it ravages a community and I don't when I think of like airplanes I think like wait being pushed through from other countries but I don't know I think it's all things math that's everything it's the really fucked up part about it is it's almost like what we're talking about with football that football be safer if there was no helmets it doesn't make sense drugs would be safer if they were if they were illegal feel that way about prostitution yeah and I'm gonna actually broach this here I was gonna write a joke about it was gonna say it I believe a state-issued if you apply for funding uh for support you're going to school like a loan or the state's paying for you to go to school you get a scholarship you should also be able to apply for a state issued prostitute if you are a little socially awkward maybe you haven't had sex because men get weird if they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is or they haven't had sex and you're going to college let's get you a prostitute let's get you having sex twice a week so you you're not afraid of women let's get you a little less weird let's fund a prostitute well I think if it didn't have the social stigma behind it there's a lot of people that would choose it over working at Wendy's great there's a lot of people that choose it but what is the social stigma is that there's something wrong with it right because it's a woman saying I want to do this with my body that's what's upsetting it's sort of that but it's also well in this country it's also connected to sex slavery we think of it as like if someone is doing that that maybe maybe they are a sex slave like maybe there's someone who's I think that's less on people's radars and it more has to do with the puritanical idea of there's a little bit of that but I mean that was one of the things that they were accusing Robert Kraft of you remember Robert Kraft who owns the Croft or craft it's craft right he's a guy who owned the New England Patriots went to a massage parlor in the game a happy ending and then the next thing know that you know they arrested him and told him there's a video of it right and they were you know they're trying to get him to plead guilty and all these all this different shit that was going on to a guy who's like insanely insanely wealthy who just was going there to get jerked off but one of the things they said was that it was that he was participating somehow in sex trafficking and so they were accusing him of that they were that was a big part of what the police were saying well it turned out that none of the girls that worked there were sex traffickers they're just prostitutes and the woman that did it to him she was like 40 years what has happened if it was legal none of it regulated so they were using that term to they were accusing him of this thing and using that term like the brand we are you telling me that shame there was a news story where they used a buzz word yes yeah it is about right but it's a buzz word that's it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you would want someone to face whether they just went there to get jerk drop or they participate in sex slavery right you're not a part of a ring I mean you are because the ring ends with you so because there's a demand for it there is a supply so that is by and large a part of the issue and I say there's not knowing a ton about selec slavery but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very quickly weed is a great example mm-hmm right no you could do that and even we've done this with women and bodies in the way that we look at people who are overweight and we look at people with different things like we are getting to a place where it's less of a thing I think you could do that with prostitution I think so too and and it's fine and look at it as like this is her choice and if there if there wasn't an exceptional exorbitant demand for it it wouldn't be a thing yeah it's just you you can't tell people what to do with their bodies any other way except when money's involved that's where I have a problem with it except when taxes are involved yeah but it's it's it's not even that it's it's it's a societal position right if we were gonna vote on it most people would vote on no prostitution because they don't want their daughter or their sister or their mother to be a prostitute that's how--that's or or them they don't want to be a prostitute that's why they would vote on it but that's the only thing that's completely legal to do like not only that but it's what sells everything when benefit is fucking selling cologne he's selling I'm a hot man if you if you got my cologne you might get some pussy I'm looking right at that mouth yes look at them it's beautiful actually look that is the thing that is is fucked up about all this like a woman can have sex with as many people as she wants for free but if she charges then also the script you can charge for a backrub like what the fuck like why is it you're like I'm getting off either way but it doesn't just doesn't make any sense yes I agree with you it's silly it's restrictive when it comes to the idea of a woman taking control of her own body no taxes being paid and the idea of someone being a whore because of our puritanical roots in this country all those things combined make it a volatile topic but at the end of the day if she's gonna make money that's gonna go back into your society that's gonna be put to good use it's gonna be taxed it's gonna be in your community what do you care what she's doing behind closed doors if it's safe and it's regulated just like weed all of a sudden there's standards now there's a way to sanitize this yeah I think so and they did in Australia they did it in Nevada yeah I'm parts of it parts of it um but in Australia they have minutes full-on there you can do whatever you want they have they have brothels but I think it's also one of the things that we're conditioned to have a perspective on it's similar to the drug issue like I don't want my friends or my daughters or my mother or anyone I know to be a prostitute right so we have this like this position on it I also don't want them to do coke but I don't think coke should be illegal I don't think anybody should be able lock you in a cage cuz you want to get coked up imagine if it were legal how many less people would be dying just in a drug trade yes and how many more people would be aware of how much you can do because you'd get actual coke what you're getting is being cut because you're getting it you're buying it from people that aren't companies right if you're gonna buy something from Nabisco Nabisco sell coke put the ingredients on it it'll be 100 percent coke you'd be able to get real coke real coke Briscoe flavored cocaine moreover I mean look in Europe the way that they are with alcohol like Italy for example kids have wine when they're little and sure there's alcoholics they're weightless it's less of like a rum Springer freak out when you are able to do something that's a great way to put a rum Springer freaked out that what she's talking about if you don't know is the Amish have a thing that's when they turn like 18 right that they get to go ham they get to do whatever they want they could watch TV they could drink smoke pot and fuck and they go crazy for a short period of time and then at the end of that time they can either leave the church forever or come back and most of them come back right because that's all you know also you're probably so hungover make me some oak cake get me back to cutting logs real work out fuck it but that's the truth when you're saying is the truth like when you repress people that's when they want to do things really badly Oh for everything and we have this obsession as humans with regulating other people's bodies Minds everything with religion with laws some of them are put in place to make sure we don't accidentally kill ourselves but by that same token if you are dumb like we always have signs like don't touch a live wire let them touch it if you're dumb enough to do it well you should know you should have a sign says don't touch a live wire because it can kill you you read that sign you still touched a live wire that's nature doing its thing no that's what that becomes if you survive is you suing the state well the sign wasn't big enough well that's a problem it's a big problem yeah people sue we're very sue happy in this country other countries something happens to you you break a leg on a city bus your legs just broken that's it it's not someone else's problem yeah other countries don't even think about suing people over the shit that people sue for in America it's a weird game but it's also you know it's there to protect you it's there to protect you I think a lot just and discussions with my husband about like food safety and in this country everything is so sanitized this like anodyne food system we have where everything is wrapped in plastic and refrigerator and it's all there so that a health and safety inspector can say this is okay you go to Europe food is just out and people are fine right because companies I think it has to do with health and safety of course but also liability so much of our regulations and rules are really put in place for liability issues making sure that somebody doesn't get sued versus your genuine concern for your safety because we're so able to just it's good and bad living in America you can sue if you feel you've been slighted but you can sue not to really make a point just to make some money yeah yeah it's not perfect it's not a perfect system it's also super complicated there's so many different rules and regulations and laws and things on the books and it's just if we if we made if we made three top rules right now will do for all don't want your gun don't be a see say see you say hey I don't care you don't say how about twat can I say twat old twat everybody everybody kids are saying it again it's like Liz its back yeah it's back no what else is fresh fresh to death fine like that's fresh fine someone's fine he's fine hmm that's coming back guys

friend of mine is ears daddy it's a non gender binary it's not it's a it's like a thing that girls say it's like what is it it's like like a young Daddy like it's like a hot term of endearment right

like you just this is how strongly you feel and I what I agree with the sentiment I would never wear a shirt that said fuck on it and I was like it's just so jarring to read fuck that big that the rest of the sentiment for me evaporates yeah I just think putting curse words on your shirt is just so aggressive it's definitely aggressive I saw a guy with a t-shirt on in Vegas that said I'm with Trump fuck the rest and the fuck the you and the see had been turned into asterisks so you had to figure out that so like you saw click the rest you saw there okay and he saw the what's missing I was

you send a girl at an unrequited dick pic and you just write what do you think about my penis she's gonna no one gets more dick pics than Whitney I told her she needs to write like a book and publish all these just blur out everybody's face and publish all these dick pics there's us know leave the decks she shares him to us in this group text and I'm in with her she like it's me and daliyah and Swardson and she'll send us his pictures these guys send her we're all like you got to write a book this is write a book have you seen so many there's an app that blurs out part of the picture to make it look like your dick has been blurred out it's awesome like if you're just in and then I'll just put a blurry thing next to your leg did you see that one dude that they took down his photo on Instagram and all he was doing he was wearing shorts just a really muscular gentleman with a large hog and he was wearing shorts and they're like like boxer briefs and his dick was so big that you could see it in in the boxer briefs so Instagram took down his fucking photo now that's not cool a dick in briefs as per restriction it is shrouded and it should be rounded good way to put it yeah and it should stand you are on point with the vocabulary in this podcast so there what the famous jason derulo yes you said I didn't see this no it's like google it it's real reason and dude the guy's got a big hog he's a very well-built gentleman all-around very muscular and handsome with a large hog put the photo up right now Aliza drew over there look at this sleeve this gentleman first of all what does this guy do he's a singer and justanswer gonna be the new cats that's what he does he's gonna be the new cats how the fuck is a guy that manly in any way you can't you can see by the outline of the heart oh my god yeah that's quite a hard look at but you know what it's not terribly you gotta look for it's not terribly prominent it's not should not have had that taken down what is he gonna do he's good you got a problem because he's got a big dick is that really what's getting it taken down who complained some asshole he should put it back and just blur it out did he put it back up did he blur it I don't know I couldn't you should just put it back the way it is really should protest it he should it's nonsense I'm with that got shredded with a large hog congratulations sir shredded with a large hog yeah he's shredded with a large amount the American Dream it is the American dream he's you're shitting on the American dream Instagram you're on Americans if you don't like a shrouded hog he did covered up what he did pixelated he put a big cat he put another dick over I do put a Subway sandwich there that's fucking hilarious yeah I don't he should be congratulating ons physique as well that's some long hours in the gym right there that is some high weight low rep yeah a hundred percent that that dude is that dude is working out yeah it's working out that's doing shit and showing his hog what is the problem folks is that when we're scared of hogs behind cloth also who says social media has to be a bastion of purity Yeah right it's widows in the garbage wasteland I love Twitter for that Twitter shows all kinds of fucking and sucking and chaos maybe cuz Facebook owns it I don't know probably yeah I think they just don't want porn on it they don't want porn in and most like really violent bitches are there hidden like you have to click on it I'm okay with that cuz I follow a lot of like nature accounts and maybe today I don't want to see a baby seal Club you know and it's good to know that those images are there so it's present in your mind but define porn is that porn and that guy's not porn right so what's where do we draw the line here Twitter would have no problem with that Twitter keeps up most things in fact they took down when Tim Dylan did that Megan McCain spoof when you've you ever seen that well the best fucking things on the Internet Tim Dylan as Megan McCain do you know Tim mm-hmm you know it's him Dylan oh my God he's fucking hilarious is a big heavy gay guy who does the best Megan McCain oh okay vault he's a hilarious but you you can't put a label on this guy he's brilliant okay and he's so fucking funny pull it up for Eliza go get it well bring him to spaghetti break give you some volume what's going on yeah what's all the way along here moment mom it's way is it not warm you I think what is happening no it's not fuck I mean I get the joke no no no no I need to get it on harder he goes hard in the paint see if you'd sort that out Gillian sorted out anyway um I but but anyway Instagram took this down this video you can only get it on YouTube and on Twitter now Twitter left it up Twitter leaves up everything I think two of the highest forms of comedy are people falling and men dressed as women oh yeah it's never not funny here but bring from the beginning but here's the thing Meaghan became blocked him on Twitter well I wouldn't love that idea yes she did yeah they've asked someone from Meaghan is asked to be on this podcast and I would have her on with Tim in a heartbeat and we're going to be raised in captivity it'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever lived my name is Megan McCain and I'm on a new show called the view and Donald Trump that fucking riverboat casino captain is talking shit about my father my father was tortured for a hundred years for this fucking country and he came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman fuck you Trump I'm gonna wear my father's skin mask and I'm gonna primary Trump from the right come on the view bitch if you're that tough come on the view you want another side to get a car club dance you want this shit but I won't fuck you because the only person I'll fuck is dirty riverboat casino captain he's fucking genius he's an animal finally and a good dude - really really good dude um what was my point Oh Twitter had no problem with that I left you a speech what about speech that's funny he's being funny come on he's not inciting a riot he's not calling for anyone is it her favorite thing ever no but where do you draw the line then it's not her he's making fun of her saying things she never said it's funny it's funny but also it's like if you're gonna get that taken like where where is that line where is that and no one can laugh at anything now right I completely agree and who's deciding unfunny people exactly unfunny people are in charge of comedy in in studios in meetings and pitches in comedy clubs in audiences and the fate of your career rests on in the hands of someone who is not qualified to handle comedy not only that the hands of someone who wants to let everyone know their work let everyone know they're adhering to progressive ideology let everyone they're upholding these community standards they all decide are important to be stivity and I was reading about this girl got fired from a show they didn't bring her back because she she said that she had all these requests for people being cast on the show she wanted an interracial couple she wanted a gay character she wanted all these things and they didn't do it they got rid of her and she was complaining that they got they there they're not in favor of inclusivity imagine if you wrote a show just imagine you're a writer you wrote a show got the show you had this idea I'm gonna do a shop a coffee shop and these people worked in have them interact with customers some crazy stuff I've got all written out and someone who you cast you say okay you're gonna be Thelma you're gonna be the waitress she's like yes I like that yes okay and get it she gets the part then she's like I need you to have a transgender couple right I want you to have an interracial couple I want you to have I want this to be inclusive inclusive and they're like what is this lady doing well are you writing the show are you an actor now the I I'm all for all of these things I think sometimes what we have to be afraid of is tokenism you wanted always to be an organic story and we do have a problem with not populating our worlds with enough variety because white people see white things and people see things a certain way you never want the tokenism like I never want to think I'm somewhere just because I'm a girl I want to be there be no rub but it's tough because where do you draw that line for my sketch show which comes out in the spring for my skit for my writers I wanted a diverse writing team because I wanted to make sure that my that we were not someone inclusive but also that we were making a smart show that wasn't just from one different perspectives but you also wanted quality wouldn't sacrifice quality just to get a Democrat know and so what I did was because to me this was an infallible way to do it I had all the writers packets cuz people submit writing packets and samples I had their names taken off of it so that when I read your packet I was reading it and I could only base my opinion on the content of the comedy good idea I ended up with three Jews but really we had 28 submissions and there were some we liked some we didn't we know we narrowed it down but I never knew what the person's name was or what they looked like until I said I liked it and we good for you that's smart that's a great way to do it that's a meritocracy that's what you really want you know and the thing about this inclusivity it's like yes you you want a world where everyone gets a chance but you don't want equality of outcome it doesn't work that way what you want is people to rise to the top and when you're dealing with like mathematics you're gonna get a lot of European Jews alright you got a lot of Asian people why because they've they've studied that like pretty extensively in their countries it's been a part of their heritage for a long time it doesn't mean that like you're you're being discriminatory against Italian Americans it just means like these are the people for whatever reason that are more invested in that particular way of thinking and you could we can begin to create opportunities and ways into things so that in 20 years maybe it is Oh everybody goes to see whatever ethnicity of doctor we can create these opportunities yes but nobody wants to sacrifice performance just for that but that's why go out of your way to include someone but it can't be a chronic we're just mandating things and that's for women that's for anything I want to be somewhere because I'm good yeah yeah hundred percent we want to concentrate on as having people have the quality of opportunity to explore different things that they want and that should be there and it should be programs created and sometimes it's a well we need to take X amount of this many types of people to create that but if you're given the chance and you do well you're even that much of more of a hidden gem I always say this with when girl I see like a lot of girls get upset like and I can't get on this show and I can't do this and that but when you do get on a lineup and you fucking crush you're the one everyone's going to talk about so when you're given this opportunity to fucking nail it like it might be hard getting in there but when you have that chance you can't use things as a stepping stone woman and as a crutch the next so just know that like if you're the only girl in a lineup for example and I'm speaking from a world that I live in not for anything else and you fuck up people are gonna think all women are like that because you were the sample yeah I would prefer them to not think about it all y'all think about being the best that they can be no don't concentrate on your gender at all you don't but I think it's something that's always brought up and put in our faces so if you have to just know that if and when you do succeed and you are good or just as good people will remember how great you were and you will shine more than just like the other average dude the 12 dudes that were on there well I think that's one of the good things about comedy communities is that when people are good they get respect merit-based like I said there's no brilliant comic out there not getting any credit yeah whether it's Ali Wong crushing or you or you know name the woman Whitney named a woman who's good when they're killing they're killing cuz they're a great comic and everybody gives them props it's not this thing where like the men aversion by the way to do the men but to say the guy thing if you are a mediocre like male comic especially now you're not going anywhere but because there's so many people doing comedy and the odds are so against you you've got to fucking bring it and that gets rewarded for sure we've all had to up our games because it's just so much is so popular now yeah it's exciting though I love a competition it's great time for all of us it really is it's just the comics are more in control you can make more comedy there are more opportunities when I started in comedy like nobody paid you for spots and now you get paid the comedy started but like small shows nobody gave you money there weren't that many I remember I had to run one there there's so much more out there so you've got to go and carve that out for yourself because it's definitely there for the taking yeah it would be interesting if there was a service that let people figure out like how to start off as an open-mic er like like an la-based service like if you pay like five bucks a month they'll give you a newsletter that shows you where all the different spots are and yeah or it should be a little harder oh yeah figure it out and then once you figured it out you got it and or it's your friends ask around there are shows my husband always jokes cuz we pass a Baja Fresh I'm like I did a spot there once like everyone abandoned CBS I did a spot there like their comedy is going on everywhere a lot of coffee shops right yeah I went to see Poetry Slam once you ever see a poetry slam they take it so seriously it's one of the most pretentious forms of entertainment that's ever been created well that like staccato speaking yeah yeah and good doesn't mean you can't be good at it but in terms of overall pretentious level it's probably the the highest percentage ever you hear people that are saying that you should do that now you should wave jazz hands because some folks have a real problem with loud noises and if you clap when you like something it hurts their ears gotta be kinder more gentle I notice younger people snap which I think I did a college game five years ago and I was like okay it's not it doesn't feel as validating as a progressive applause but that's like from the 50s with jazz clubs yeah it's very it's cool I don't want girls do what I'm like yeah I'm cool I'm young cool well - I'm young cool it's like it's also a competition how loud can your snappy is it based on skin thickness oh yeah cuz your hands are thicker than mine and I have little crickets nips someone's listening to this just loading a shotgun Gregg the fuck do you snap into my ears for a Swedish plate shop yeah there's different kinds of snaps - right isn't there one like you can go across like the top of your thumb with like your second finger instead of this it looks like a dude thing like how dudes like like different whistles or what's this thing yeah that's the one they do what is that I'm afraid of no what is that supposed to be like what honestly I don't think everyone's doing it but it's it imitates packing a dip like the dip can borrow yeah that's it because that's exactly what it looks like my fingers don't make noise that way my fingers don't make noise that way I mean they make noise that way ligament on the ligament was that good I probably not doing good things to remember arm farts those were huge in your kid make arm farts everybody figures that out my kids figured it out they thought they're so smart I'm like bitch I've been doing that forever you're just trapping oxygen or this like yeah hand farts yeah it's just a dry fuck yeah yes old people old people people that can get that whistle that's so ear piercing or anything though their lips in a way I can't whistle the wefts I suck on my fingers I have to put fingers I didn't chew on each side see I always want to do the finger whistle I can't you did it well not really that's real a whistle reserved for calling dogs yeah gunner Brixton right and then you do it or when you want your significant other in the bedroom to fuck right I guess let out that whistle look it's time do you need the whistle no you can have a drum set I could literally be like babe is it time to fuck yeah you said my name come on let's go I'm always rowdy I'm always ready guys I'd turn down sucks that's what I've heard girls talk about that not like you know that they're the ones who wanted it and the guy was always saying no I was like you're doing or he had herpes or he's whoa interesting think about it great he's like oh not today I definitely I've had people talking about that I'm like he had herpes Wow good point if he's and by the way if he's having sex with the internet like I think there's also that like he it's uncomfortable right most people have it so that's probably what it is or he's coming down from like doing too much coke yeah or there's that good people feel like she would know I mean I don't maybe I did a girl and I didn't know she was a coke head didn't know until after I dated her I didn't date her a lot like I saw her rarely she seemed pretty normal you can conceal that drug just like late nights like I've got a friend who's a total coke head but other than the fact that she talked really fast you didn't no no no I dunno but you wouldn't know oh one wouldn't know well that's that what adderall is is people that like have an affinity towards that kind of thing and they could do it every day that's a that is a giant problem that's that drug and you see people that have when they're on it they have this unfounded self-image like unfounded belief in themselves like delusional belief in themselves it's very it's a very strange drug it hubris until form yep it takes away all of your inhibitions it's about expressing how good you are at things and everyone else sucks you find you know you find all these faults and people you don't find any in yourself you have unfounded confidence and your ability to get things done like it's a weird drug it's a weird drug and a lot of fucking people are on it but how good is Scarface oh it's amazing it's so good this day and I don't even think his axe everyone thinks these accents bad I think it's great right it doesn't sound totally Cuban it's exactly what a Cuban person sounds like maybe no no I know a lot of mean Joey Diaz inside like that but but he's an American person it's not doesn't it's it's off its off for sure but but it's really good to find a generation of impressions yeah oh yeah it's it's an off impression but it's it's a really good off impression has influenced almost every rapper oh yeah do you do you remember the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where krazee-eyez-killa had Larry David over his house he's played Scarface 24/7 big screen it's like a Bible yeah but I mean it was one of the ghetto boys but it garfish americantale yes what he did sure yeah I got the girl from nothing yeah certain man made his way up yeah even how he came over here me yeah I can tell he came to the land of opportunity and he had it until Miami PD fucking shot him up have you ever seen cocaine Cowboys oh my goodness one of the best documentaries of all time my friend Billy Corbin made it cocaine Cowboys want and cocaine Cowboys too Billy's been on the podcast a few times he makes bunch of different documentaries but those two they're just fucking gems it shows you how god damn crazy Miami was in the 1980s there was one year where the police academy the graduating class half of them work murdered and the other half of them went to jail even with the jail for corruption it was brutal coke everywhere yeah all these pilots talking about coke all these hit man they got hit man on film yeah talking about all the shit they did it is a crazy duck it's a brutal drug it's well it's also would define Miami yeah there's my buddy Steve was an ophthalmologist shout out Steve Graham he was an ophthalmologist during his residency he was in Miami in the emergency room and he he would tell him tell me about dudes just horrific wounds yeah just all this in the face just everyone's getting fucked up and shot and stabbed it's like even just from coke like just from doing so much of it getting into your holding murderin pshaw I mean it was a goddamn war till is I mean not until is but still is a war like just the trafficking of it and what that does to our neighbors to the south have you ever see the video of the Coast Guard pulling over the Mexican submarine that's filled with cocaine yeah can they jump on top of it bang such as ex machina moment like who's the guys banging on that we all want to bang on a floating submarine jump and HAP be the kind of man that has the balls to jump on a submarine while it's moving through the ocean yeah that's that's a savage move let's let his fuck all that stuff could be avoided if it was legal if it was legal he'd be buying again you'd be buying fucking coca-cola cocaine which is what our grandparents had yeah legalize it sanitize it regulate it tax it Bob's your uncle yeah do you know that they still use cocaine to make the flavor for coca-cola I challenge that a coca leaf maybe coca leaf that's sometimes but not actually take the coca leaves cocaine is a byproduct of coca leaf exactly you're correct they take the coca leaf they extract the cocaine and then it's the number one medical supplier of medical cocaine takes that stuff from the coca leaves that they can via sure flavonoids that they use for coca cola that's why it tastes so good it tastes so good it's so good they did this experiment where they put some coke coca coca cola on the floor and then diet coke and bugs wouldn't go near the diet coke yeah that's cause it doesn't have sugar stooop I don't thinks I think it's I think it's whatever they put in the diet coke yeah but they probably wouldn't go down the floor for water either they know what sugar is like they were sugar works for them yeah but sugar works for them I'm just saying if a bug doesn't want it but you know how you get like flavor from sugar bugs don't necessarily get flavor they're going to it because they're probably attracted to smell of it because they know it's going to be effective for whatever they're trying to do with it I'm just saying the guy who propelled them it did I prefer though I prefer the taste of Diet Coke it's lighter I like a diet coke on occasion with a little bit of lemon mmm how about some lime racist against limes yeah big-time that's where I draw my line everything else I was okay with but this we got a real problem get sparkly water they ask if you want lunch yeah regular will always get lime yes which is kind of hard to find outside of the country the line what depends on that you go to a lot of countries are like we have lemon I'm like lemon and it's not the same but some people just don't have limes yeah they don't get it fucking losers yeah yeah get some limes in your life get some limes now jumping grow lemons you can grow lime not true no different soil it's just different is it yeah you know you see a lot of lemon trees in LA you don't see any lime trees maybe it's just people suck maybe I just I think we have a an aversion to delicious things here really I really feel like there's so many fruits that we sleep on that like what like durian I have some in my house right now does it stink I think that my freezer it's freeze-dried I brought it home did you like it I liked it fresh there I thought it was really cool weird but I do it is like a party trick just to watch people's faces contort mangosteen super tasty mangosteen jujubes which is I found out recently an actual fruit not just a candy really dried jujube it will change your life and I brought it to set and all the Asian girls were like yeah my grandma uses them and I'd never heard of it and we just what do we have apples and fucking grapes sometimes we have melon a little bit of melon cantaloupe right everybody thinks it's funny to shit on melon I love melons honeydew dude I love them when it's hot out a cold cantaloupe might be one of the best fucking things you can eat in your life Barbra Streisand once said her definition of luxury was not having a scoop down to the skin in a cantaloupe like not having to go a little bitch mm-hmm is tasty but she probably throwing straws in the ocean to write off her balcony to the people I went around last night at the comedy show I was like why is everyone having a straw men shouldn't use straws if you need a straw great what about women some women use it you know what your lipsticks not that sacred but then the lipstick you're crushing up bugs you're wasting it I don't know what about paper straws you do you need a straw let's say that you are not medically incapacitated any form do you need a straw other than a smoothie I do cuz it's a good way to make a point what's the point so like if I was drawn here I go well maybe you should get your shit together I'm gonna suck on the straw we start look it's like it's like well the old timey guys take a hit on the cigar and I told uh get the fuck out of my room it's a good punctuation yeah I would argue Gergely sip like I started this this conversation with is equally a shady right like oh and maybe you should eat my shit it is there's just good it's actually kind of better no more stress because your your guiding your face no straws are good and they're they're good for a reason it's a good way to suck liquid through quickly shouldn't just be automatically tilt your fucking hand back like a savage you could just pull on the straw really like savages drink tea with their pinkies up it really is biodegradable plastic it's very possible you make it with hemp fiber it's not hard they know how to do it it literally goes back in the earth and 80s the thing they know how to do a lot of these things and we don't because it doesn't make money or it people don't they want to mak there's a profitability now there's a giant business with all of these dang straws you can shift over to making hemp plastic it's it's really not that hard easily and what kills me is people like look no straw I'm like but the whole cup is plastic these are I'm just saying we waste a lot of these things you got a Yeti that thing is awesome yeah I have one pretty good can I have one of yours too far there's already got a free 100 free one for you great hundred percent it's got my face on again it might feel weird when I get back drinking the coffee I've gotten one before so I'd like another one give it away gift it what did I do with it I have it I think I just up to the plastic lids on Starbucks cups those got to be a problem the huge problem can't do it with paper right let's take a bottled water yeah that's ridiculous who the fuck would buy that it is ridiculous I didn't hear Jamie is outrageous you're not no one's that thirsty we're telling Jason Momoa if he comes here he's gonna shame us all tell him I said I sort of water I can a can sells water and a can't oh that's why he's shaming it Oh fucking I thought he was just virtue yeah I didn't know that either I just
