the girag an experience right and yin you can't trust if you're a team in 80 year old billionaire you can't trust a girl who's willing to fuck you with tapes exactly so that is like a lot of like it's like three people fucking up you know what I thought was the most bizarre about all of it apparently I was correct and that what she as far as the most recent story is that she was supposed to record his saying his conversations because he would say things and then forgot he said him right so he's got he's dementia right 81 years old he's old as fuck so he would say crazy things and then she would record them and you know and let him know like what he said right well in this case somehow another it got leaked how it got leaked to speculation but he knew he was being recorded right that is true so you can't it's against a lot of record anyone like what if they don't say anything is just bathroom noises and stuff yes law still even if they don't talk in absolutely in California they don't know about it it's against the law you're not allowed to record your essence can be like if you just put a tape recorder down behind the toilet they don't say a word they just that you know that and then they leave that's still against a lot even though they don't say it it's there just their spirit being in the room the noises of them being recorded there are actual physical presence being marked by the sound of their feet I think that's probably illegal really that's what is it a criminal do you say so myself guilty as fuck why Josh it's a really weird question he's like this so smooth if you take a tape and put it behind you say inver pointless imperfect whatever whatever and the girl might happen to be a stripper whenever whatever mean that's that combination it's never gonna happen but if it did it's just I'd know that you were recording her pooping just interesting because I guess so accordingly no no Brian that's not interesting fucking space is interesting we talked about that you play them up any like oh you can't require people poopin all the real issue with putting all of your eggs in one basket in life and that basket being athletics and especially athletic especially combat athletic yeah the idea that you're going to have some sort of a long and successful fruitful career by throwing your bones and another person trying to separate themselves from their consciousness that's quite ridiculous yeah because just the very act of doing it in preparing for that very act if to the amount of damage that your body and your brain even indoors this but we have this idea in our heads that you know a guy has to be an undefeated champion yeah you know you my son is going to be a champion someday like man if you're really lucky your son won't be a champion yeah really lucky your son will learn the valuable lessons of martial arts as far as like character development and as far as your ability to overcome what seemed to be unsurmountable obstacles but to become a champion you have to be a crazy person yeah if the crazy person who's obsessed with nothing but that and that will take over your life yeah and I feel like having worked obviously with people like that you know shadowed them and and recognizing that mindset um uh I you know and I find to like there's just some point at which like there's some gifts that are just bestowed by genetics or something and done matter how hard you work you're not going to quite get to them maybe that level that separates the real and you won't know that until you hit it you know what I mean you're not going to know that wall until you run into it and I feel like for some people like I was talking to one guy just a guy at the gym and and he said something more or less like the best that he he ever felt in a fight was when he was up against someone he knew was better than him and he knew he was gonna lose and if they fought a hundred times he'd lose a hundred times but he that guy he made that guy see something about himself he got that close to him it that the other guy sort of recognized I'm a frail I made out of the same crumbling stuff that he's made out of and so you know sort of pierce that Teflon armor that that I think some fighters carry around with themselves he's like that's that's all I could do that for me is the victory I still lost but I made that guy discover something about himself that he hadn't discovered up until that point because he'd never been tested to the point that I got to I wasn't able to test him I thought that's another part about just being recognizing you're able to do you know and it may not be beating them but it's you you find some other measure of success you eat first of all you being a veteran and you you being unabashed in your love for soldiers and your respect for your fellow military members when you got on top of that cage and after you know they were cheering and you were yelling out to all those people that you love them I mean this is all off camera man we'd cut to commercial and you're on top of the cage and you're just yelling and all those people let him know that you love them that's some intense intense shit yeah overwhelming emotional near shut down yeah I'm walking out to the cage I see this dude he flies for the 160th which is like the Special Forces wing of aviation the last time I saw that dude was I was handing him my shot buddy you know I'm like it's a big thing in Special Forces community were real tight you know like I'm handing him my brother that has bullet holes in him and and I'm like I don't let him go and he's like hey I got this this is what I do you go do what you're supposed to do and get back to work that's the last time I saw this dude was handing him my buddy on a medevac then I'm walking out of the cage I was like holy shit there is that dude from the 160th that I handed my shot buddy to totally overwhelming that after go in there and fight and then uh you know nice 5th Special Forces Group is co-located there so I saw a bunch of dudes from like the Green Beret regiment yeah it's entirely too much motion I just wanted to like curl up and cry yeah it's a completely different kind of it there's you on top of the cage up there in that photo that's just an intense intense picture that picture should be framed and on your wall somewhere because that is one of the greatest pictures that I've ever seen if you could cut me out and just have the dudes no no no no no you need to be in there for reference yeah I mean but that's your attitude what you just said cut me out and leave the dudes that that really is your attitude you you really don't want that you were saying while you were up there that my job is is in here is easy what you guys do you guys are my heroes yeah you know good memory yeah I remember everything it's disturbing haha scary don't get if I Joe Rogan really
