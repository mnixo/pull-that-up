the girag an experience how much of a real issue is it when people get fat is mold or just know it's fat just add itself and being fat itself how much of an effect is being overweight it has a big effect right in that's less of a actually it can be triggered by toxins but it's more of a metabolic energy thing and that's the other side of what I do with the supplements that I make it's it's about increasing mitochondrial function and if you have a few linked on energy management problem in your body and being fat is a great sign of that you need to figure out why and you need to correct it because when your body works well you shouldn't be fat have you noticed this trend where you're not supposed to bring up the fact that people are fat and it's called fat shaming have you seen this I've seen some things on Facebook icing discussing fat or even better celebrating the fact you're thin is fat shaming Wow there was a woman fuck what about thin shame well you know what it is man it's just people trying to find some sort of an excuse for why they are the way they are and an excuse to continue to be the way they are without feeling any repercussions from socially from other people this is a woman she had this picture she put it on Facebook it's her she's in a bikini sure like a little you know one of the CrossFit outfits or something on and she has her three kids there oh I saw that picture and the picture says what's your Excuse and people were saying your fat shaming you a lot of people have different lives like whether or not someone has a different life and whether or not that someone has a different issue with their body that's not what she's saying she's saying what's your excuse because this is what she's been able to do you're right everybody's different you're right some people have a bad situation that are in financially some people have bad genetics some people they've been taught poorly whatever diseases all the above but that's not fat shaming she's celebrating the fact she's thin you know in this this fat shaming thing that people love to say now is it completely alleviates any responsibility you have for your own physical shape it's like they want it they want to take it out of the equation that that social aspect of being fat like there's a reason for it reason for it is it's not healthy for you there's the girl if you look at that picture up there what's your Excuse yes but either there's a reason why that exists is because people see what you're doing and they don't like the way it looks on you because they're scared of it being on them yeah but someone see a morbidly obese person the reason why they're staring is not because of trying to shame that person it's a natural freak out your body recognizes oh shit that's possible too I could do that goddamn I better not do that I don't want to do that that guy looks that looks awful oh my god that guy's going to die that's not fat shaming that's a natural thing that people do with a recognize success and failure in their environment and that success and failure is as much social success and failure as it is physiological health if you see someone that's super unhealthy coughing and smoking a cigarette yeah that feeling is not cigarette smoking shaming okay that feeling is you recognize that someone is doing something incredibly unhealthy and that possibility exists for you to here's here's the thing Joe that feeling is not a rational response it's a self defense system in the body that happens before you even think about it this is the body going like like naturally animals don't want to spend time with other sick animals either like they'll move away from the sick ones and when we see someone when our body our meat operating systems see someone who's sick we naturally want to create space but here's the thing so I weighed 300 pounds I was fat for like half my life and let me tell you every fat person on earth knows they're fat they do not feel happy about it and they desperately want to fix it but they don't want you to rub in their face Dave Asprey because that's fat shaming you make me feel bad you show your six-pack if you just pull that up like 15 minutes a month bitch boom and show that six-pack on Instagram your fat shaming yeah Arian now you could fucking salute work out every morning an hour and a half a day get yourself in shape take a picture and people will be angry because they didn't that's amazing that would be a salary that's not in this cried well they of course but they're saying your fat shaming they're angry because they're trying desperately stuff that doesn't work and when off does not work often in fair point there's some people who just have given out I would say most I would say most people who were talking about fat shaming or just stuffing Twinkies down their fucking mug the people talking about fat shaming have emotional issues I would guess but they find support online that's what I find fascinating people agree with them the people that called that woman of fat Shamer there was a lot of them she she had to apologize but she was disingenuous in her apology I feel a lot of compassion she explained why she was disingenuous she did some interview where she was talking about you know like when she said what's your excuse like she can't came up with some sort of a reel to soften it down version of what she meant by what's your Excuse you know what she meant is she's not fat look I'm hot what's your Excuse here's my kids I'm hot it's pretty obvious what she meant and she was like what's your excuse for not meeting your goals or what I kind of get mad at when people say your Excuse is that you're lazy and your excuses that you didn't work out enough and you didn't diet enough because I did I beat myself up I broke my metabolism I broke my thyroid gland working out all the time eating a low-fat low-calorie diet and all it did was make me fat and sick and tired like it doesn't work so it's it's really annoying when you get these people who are genetically gifted have a good metabolism and never got a chronic illness or whatever the heck works so they could basically look good without too much work and they stand up there and say you know you didn't do enough of this but when the fat people try and go for a jog when you weigh 300 pounds you try go for a jog it's destructive on your tissues so you get all these fat people who are trying and just failing miserably and feeling bad about themselves because they did it because they got the wrong advice like that's why I started just putting some of the stuff up there I don't have to work I don't have food cravings all that stuff I struggled with like for a lot of my life it just isn't something I have to think about anymore and it kind of upsets me when I see you know fat people who are feeling guilty and like fighting all their willpower on these on these cravings that they're just like they're doing it wrong but they don't know they're doing wrong so then they feel guilty and they get caught on all this emotional stuff and like it's unnecessary yeah it seems like there's got to be a way to get healthy food to people and make it a part of everyone's everyday diet but then you start considering the numbers people in Los Angeles and there's 20 million people getting everybody grass bread beef and getting everybody and CT oil take over some golf courses we have to put cows on them is that what they're gonna have to do you could feed an awful lot of cows and some of these brown you're not gonna stop people from golfing too many rich dudes like golfing it needs to be a fast-food company that just takes over and just starts doing it because that's the biggest problem is people just need fast food you know they need fast food there's actually healthy right there's a couple attempts there's a guy from one of the early Whole Foods guys and some McDonald's guys got together and like they'll make something that's I'm forgetting the name of what they're trying to do but they'll make something that's better than it was but is it going to be non-gmo even is it going to be gluten-free now probably not because we have to understand the core tenets of what makes us healthy and we have to understand those widely before there's demand for them so the number one predictor for whether going to be obese or not is your income level the poorer you are the fatter you are that's especially true in America and that's a food quality issue and it's it's just not fair the way things are set up that way but if you're poor you have a hard time getting food that doesn't make you inflamed it doesn't break your insulin it doesn't contain things that make you weak in it and like it's tragic it shouldn't be that way but that's how it is there's a blog I read about Finn privilege just to sit there that's another thing that's another way of saying fat shaming the other side of saying fat shaming is that being thin you are enjoying thin privilege and that by radiating success and all now not just dating success but the way people dress you and the way you move around in society that you enjoy thin privilege and what they're trying to do is compare being in shape with being a white male like white male priviledge who's white male privilege is almost shameful you know it's almost shameful to have this white male privilege while people are stuck it's it makes you feel like they like if someone talks about white male privilege what do you think of you think of someone being aloof to the concerns of brown people and poor people and racism and also aloof to the fact that they got super lucky they got this lucky roll of the dice and we're born in this way that allows them to be I mean if you think about white males think about white males and you think about wealth majority of like super wealthy people are white males the majority of the people that are in positions of power whether it's presidents mayor its what white males so that white male being a white male and have that privilege is almost like being a pig it's like being the man so thin privilege they've figured out a way to make being thin being a pig that is so thin privilege not on fat not on lazy not see that's all really food like just you know RiRi I didn't read renaming words to mean something yes it's it's a little bit of that but it's also it's you pulled up the blog right Brian just pull up one of them ah it's it's also alleviating themselves a person responsibility in finding a new victim or a new new culprit and the culprit is not their own lack of self-respect or their own willpower or their own ability to discipline themselves or their own ability to educate themselves on proper nutrition that's out of the equation that looks no longer their responsibility now instead they'll concentrate on thin people having an asset fits in an actual airplane seat and you know being able to squeeze on an actual escalator you know all of these things these fat fucks are complaining about calling thin privilege you've got a knock will power of that list there is no lack of willpower and fat people you will power is a finite resource you have so much you can we prove this beyond a doubt what do you mean willpower there's a whole book about this now and I'm of course forgetting the name of the author but they actually show that there's so many decisions you can make I wrote about this while back there's decision-making fatigue and there's X amount of willpower and you can apply that willpower to change the world or you can apply that willpower to say no to the bowl of chips in front of you right and if you're a fat person and your energy reserves are low and I say this from personal experience the amount of willpower takes to get up off the couch and walk across the street and do whatever you going to do it requires a hell of a lot more power more willpower than you would think it would as a healthy person because your cells aren't working you don't have the energy and yet you get up and you do it in every step you take is sapping your willpower in a way a healthy person doesn't have oh I see what you're saying yes so you're saying that even though willpower is sort of an individual characteristic and some people have and some people don't with fat people it's almost like catch-22 because although they need it to drop weight they're not going to have it because they need it to just move around their energy levels are lower so they have less willpower and they're using the willpower to do simple things that are effortless for you and it's not effortless for a fat person that is such an interesting point and one that I really didn't consider that's a very unique point because I I never really considered that fat people like it's almost like they can't help themselves it's almost like they're so or it's so much more difficult for them to pass on shitty food than it is a regular person well think of it like this okay if you're a regular person that's thin privilege alright so some people are real people so now it's a trannie thing but let's pretend that you're a fat person Joe and we have a bagel sitting here okay good luck pretend to bitch sorry can't help myself so the jokes there the bagels can be talking to you over and over since I eat me alright and a healthy person says I don't actually have a craving like fuck you bagel right but if you're that guy I love bagels if you're a fat person that bagel is going to constantly sit there go eat me eat me eat me and every time you say consciously I'm not going to eat the bagel you are spending your willpower wantonly so every time you see an ad for Mars on TV no Mars bars or whatever the heck the latest candy is and you're like I got a craving No so you spend your entire day saying no to your biological systems that are starving for energy and this is why you're not depleted you're not lacking willpower you're wasting your willpower saying no to foods that are calling out to you in a biologically unnatural way because your energy systems are broken broken and you have less willpower than you should have had because your cells aren't functioning right your hormones are broken so never say that fat people are fat because of a lack of willpower the fact that they're walking is a testament to their willpower what they're lacking is knowledge and they're lacking tools and when fat people have those things they immediately go and they get thin again okay but if that's the case then what makes someone go out of their way and get that knowledge what makes someone change their diet what makes someone make the difficult steps to start going to a gym it's kind of willpower Dave Asprey there's there's definitely willpower component to it but things like social support will increase the amount of willpower you have things like encouragement and also things like like dying or being disabled or finding a diabetic ulcer on your leg and your doctor telling you you're going to lose your leg if you don't work their ass out that can temporarily increase willpower enough that you get yourself cellular energy kicked off did I was reading a thing the other day it's just I've been railing on about this lately about the idea of people are going on about what they're calling fat shaming and fat shaming is making people feel bad for being overweight and I read this one article where this woman was talking about how she was being fat shamed because she went to a family function and everyone was gushing about her cousin her cousin lost 20 pounds and that they were making such a big deal out of it that it was clear to her that they were judging her for not losing the 20 pound so it made her feel awful and she didn't understand how they couldn't understand that what they were doing was fat shaming her gotta buy life by complimenting someone on losing weight your fat shaming the person who hasn't lost the weight Wow and then it made her feel awful and that it was incredibly insensitive of them and that you know it's I'm fascinated by that kind of thinking I really am I'm fascinated by that sort of like like reverse victimology sort of a thing where instead of you being the victim of your own handiwork you become like a persecuted person because they don't accept you for the flaws that you have or even mention the possibility of those flaws existing by virtue of complimenting someone for having gotten over the same flaws that you possess hilarious I think without even knowing the specifics on his own particular issues anytime somebody's so willing to embrace the victim role I smell trouble right away yeah I'm like you know there's a reality to losing weight that we had this Dave Asprey guy who's an expert in a lot of aspects of nutrition he's a fascinating guy and one of the things he was talking about where he was giving overweight people a pastor saying the level of addiction that these people actually have for food to say that they don't have willpower is really unfair because they're so overweight like a lot of these folks are so far gone that they used up all their willpower just to get up in the morning just to walk to the bus stop just to go to work just to get their their their chores done during the day like they don't have the same level of energy that a healthy person has so to tribute them to having like this this this like backlog of energy they're not tapping into because they're weak willed it's not that like they're there already so far in the whole it's almost impossible for them to get motivation they have to get something like incredibly extreme has to happen to them and I thought that was really unique and looking at West people - yes yes people have shaved people to depress you can see the in with people that are ruining their life - whether it's through addictions you know you see that as well it's like why can't they see it the way other people see it well it's almost like they can't like they're so trapped up in the momentum of whatever it is whether it's gambling or food I mean I've seen people with food addictions that you can watch the gear spinning in their mind when food is nearby like they know they're supposed to lose weight they know they're not supposed to be eating it but the the gears start spinning in their mind and it becomes the primary focus of their existence get that fucking doughnut I need that doughnut that doughnut is huge this it's it's critical for fueling whatever the whatever trouble is going on in their mind and it's a weird aspect of human beings and you don't do that any favors by pretending that encouraging someone who lost weight is a bad thing the idea that socially that's responsible because you're fat and you're near them no it's actually responsible because that terrible feeling that you have it's supposed to be the bump that pushes you towards eating a salad instead of a cheeseburger should be the bump that makes you write down everything you eat that day and state some goals this is what I'm going to do I'm going to use my willpower to overcome this horrible obsession that I have with shitty food that's also possible it's also possible but by you going home and blaming everybody in the blog that you've projected yourself away from any potential benefit from having these bad feelings again is the same as about the competition is somebody who never learned how to lose in the same invoice in criticism like you got to get a look at it it feels like shit but that feel like shit correct it so it doesn't feel like shit anymore you
