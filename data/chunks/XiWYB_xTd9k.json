- one Kevin Ross bringer of gifts good to see you brother thank you very much for that bag oh you're very welcome it's very cool people let you know a Kevin brought our giant heavy bag filled with sand that has Dawei North of 200 pounds oh yeah right I think it's about 250 yeah a lot of fun getting that in my car by myself is that your preferred method for conditioning your shins for sure for sure you know the thing with Qing conditioning a lot of people do you know they smack themselves in the shin with bottles and kind of stupid things like that yeah you're not really creating what you need to which is a overall conditioning overall strengthening of the nerve the bone all you're really doing is deadening little spots in your nerves but that's the worst thing you can do without strengthening your bones you're deadening the nerves but not strengthening the bone overall and if you're not doing that you're gonna think your bones a lot stronger than it is but it can't handle the impact so with with a sandbag you're you're you're covering much more surface area and you know applying it in a realistic situation where you're able to throw kicks repeatedly at this thing and what you would you really want to do is do it to a degree that it's causing a certain amount of pain but you're able to do this daily with with repetition because that's how you continue to develop just like getting stronger at anything you know it doesn't happen overnight you got to just do this every day just at the end of your session knock out a few kicks and then again tomorrow night and again the next day and you slowly and steadily are they able to go harder and harder and develop this strength and conditioning in your shins so the idea is that you're making like these little tiny micro fractures right yeah for sure and yeah like I said you want to be able to cover a good surface area so you're hitting it all it kind of at once as opposed to like little spots which is what happens when you just whack it with a batter or something like that my experience was whacking it with a bad as everybody kind of quits you're like hey I'm gonna condition my shins and then just go what the fuck am i doing and they stopped doing it well the thing to with with when you're able to kick like that is you can kind of slowly build up you know you start a little bit lightly and develop a little bit stronger and you kind of create a little bit of a crease and you know as you get going you your brain can kind of wrap itself around it a little bit better and then you still going harder and harder and by the end of you know your five ten-minute session you're putting some serious weight into that and you're not you're not noticing it as much yeah we were talking about your your need that you had a fracture and you need that you didn't realize you had yeah that's this it's we're like the thing that disturbs me maybe the most in kickboxing and so I've only seen it a few times is when someone checks a kick and their leg snaps in half you know like Tyrone Spong when you fought gokon sake or Anderson Silva when he fought Chris Weidman anything that snap of when the the shin gives out like that can you prevent that from doing this obviously it's one of those just freak things that happens you know clearly with those guys you can have the most conditioned Chin's in the world but you catch them the wrong way wrong time they can happen in it's rare but it does happen and it doesn't really matter how long you've been doing this how strong your shins are sometimes things just break I always wonder how many guys have little breaks and they don't know about it - probably a lot yeah a lot yeah they said that's what happened with Anderson but Anderson threw a kick and he broke it before that like he felt something was wrong and then went through that second kick and it snapped in half that's what that's why I did that yeah yeah that makes sense well Weidman was checking it perfect he was checking it right at the top of his knee yeah and you know that's a big thing with you know fighting a lot of a lot of people tend to just blindly just pick their shin up you know as opposed to paying attention to where it is on your shin that it's hitting just just like when you're kicking you need to pay attention to what piece of your leg you're hitting with which piece of your shin you're checking with and the higher up on your shin it is that the harder it's going to be and when you're southpaw versus orthodoxson throwing that inside leg kick you're you're you're coming upwards at an angle which is tends to be like low on your foot or your your your ankle and then you're checking with high up by your knee so you have the smallest part of your shin connecting with the the hardest part of somebody else's and with that that's just the one that tends to do that yeah it's a shin on shin contact is such a brutal thing like I think everybody should experience it once yeah you know just crack oh yeah and you know the funny thing is it doesn't matter how long you've you've done this for you we watch these fights and assume that they don't feel pain and that it doesn't bother them but even guys with hundreds and hundreds of fights you see in the next day and their gimping around pretty good yeah you know we have this idea in our brains that eventually you're gonna get to a point when you just don't feel pain and it doesn't bother you but eventually realize that never happens you know it is better to get that out of your head now you know Muay Thai and kickboxing and anything that the bone on bone is it's going to be painful and that's part of the art of it you learn how to place your kicks better and pay attention to what you're doing and yeah of course you you develop your shin conditioning and that kind of thing but it always hurts it's always gonna hurt it's such a brutally effective way to fight and it's so interesting that Thailand perfected that yeah I've always been fascinated by that like you know you think about the entire world it's an enormous world and people have been fighting in this enormous world from the beginning of time and this one island they said hey I got an idea well it's a cultural thing over there you know it's part of their upbringing it's like baseball over here or soccer in other parts of the world where everybody kind of does it to one extent or the other and you know clearly if you're doing this from time you're a child particularly when it's a job like it is for them over there and it's a it's more than just for fun it's not for fun it's it's like this how I survive this or working in the fields you know and that completely changes their mentality about it and that's why when you go there it's like obviously the skill for sure but but the mentality and their reasons for doing this like it's so different it's so different yeah and they start so young and there's they're they're basically sent to these camps and they start fighting like you know before they're like 10 years old yeah oftentimes yeah a lot of these kids you know they're their families send them to these these camps and that's where they're raised you know they're raised in a gym to be fighters and to work for the gyms I mean that that's really what they're doing is they're working you know they're they're they're getting money to send back to their families and they're not doing this for fun they're not doing yeah hobby I've always been fascinated by the way the tie spar as well because I think it's really interesting that given that they do fight so often and their livelihood depends on it and that it is not a game they've really figured out a bunch of things and one of the things that figured out is hit the pads hard hit the bag hard spar light yeah yeah there's there's give-and-take to everything that we do and we're trying to maximize our learning and minimize the damage or the the risk of injury that we're taking and we have the opposite approach here in America oh just beat the shit out of each other and you know that's good that's how you're gonna get better but you don't really develop when you're going hard like that you're learning how to be tough and you're gonna how to take damage and you're you know learning how to be in the fire like that which is important but you're not really developing you know when you when you're playing when you're practicing when you're not thinking about getting injured or knocked out you're able to learn new and apply new things and new techniques and and and practice things that you normally wouldn't it's like when you're worried about getting hurt you're only gonna focus on the things that you're really good at you know you're not going to try these different approaches and that's what really limits a lot of our development you know a lot of you see a lot of fighters their their ability kind of levels off at to a certain degree and they don't they don't continually develop as their careers go on and they also don't last very long either because of the amount of damage their their bodies and their brains are taking you know each one of us only has a fine number of shots to the head we can take and end shots of the body we can take and do you want to use those in the gym or do you want to use those in the ring you know I think it's really about finding a good balance between that you know in the beginning all I did was just go crazy and spar super hard six days a week leading all the way up to the fight and six days a week you were sparring hard really yeah yeah and with guy I mean the smallest guy I had to work with coming up was probably 20 pounds bigger than me and you know in a lot of ways this helped me develop and gain a lot of strength and confidence and and ability to take that kind of punishment but it also did a lot of detrimental things a lot of stupid injuries a lot of damage and you know over the years I've come to develop and get more on to the tie approach of things and and practice and playing and you know finding when the time to go hard is and when the time to to learn and develop is and what's counterproductive and what isn't how do you make that distinction like how do you know when's the time to go hard you don't you don't really I mean everything that we do is a process of trial and error you know and I think once you kind of understand that you can think clearly and and apply the things you need to in the midst of that fire fight watch it which you know is really what shuts a lot of people down in the beginning they can't process the information that's happening because it's so intense and and that is why it's important to kind of have that in and have that fight like such a waste scenario in in the gym but once you've done that and you've had the experience and all of that I think it's it's so much so much more beneficial to start going towards the other direction especially if you want to stay in this sport for a good amount of time and not take unnecessary damage for really no purpose whatsoever it should to me it should be the exception and not the rule you know like have those hard training sessions ins once in a while especially if you can get working with people that you're not used to because because you know obviously when you fight it's you don't know what they're really doing in there and it's like working with a stranger and in the gym we we know each other so well that we tend to just work on those things in our practice but but that's how we develop and if we're not doing that we're really limiting ourselves it's got to be difficult to find the right balance in terms of like what gym you're training at like what were you training at these days I'm down in San Diego now I moved down there two years ago at the the boxing club oh there's that Artem yeah yeah sure ocean look Bevin's place yeah yeah and Levin was is there too Artem sure ocean yet small Artem he he we met almost 15 years ago he was actually the janitor at this gym had just moved from Russia and now he owns three of them and is this amazing gym owner and business person which is it was just an unbelievably fascinating story that he has in an inspirational thing and but yeah that's where I'm at and now and I kind of bounce back between San Diego and out here Gina lives out here so I kind of go back and forth now that place is it's called the boxing club right yeah but it's my time yeah yeah there's that another gym out here called boxing works which is which is the one I turn out in Torrance and same thing it's a Muay Thai gym and both these gyms are Muay Thai and kickboxing related yet they're boxing why do they call boxing works is just to get people to join I don't really know you know I don't really know why that happened or how that happened but yeah it's kind of ironic that both those places are seemingly boxing gyms and they're not at all what made you make the move down there a lot of things I I'd always planned on ending up in San Diego I mean that's the one pull of it down yeah and I've lived all over this country since you know moved all over the place since I was a little kid and San Diego was just where I always planned I'd be one day I didn't think I'd move down there until I was done fighting but through the process of a lot of things and you know transitions in my life it just kind of was the right time to go it's the perfect balance cuz it's like a city but it's not a big city yeah and it's got a lot of beauty like there's beautiful hills and the ocean is beautiful like but it's not that crowded it's like it's alright I shouldn't even even be talked about it yeah and what I don't want people to move once you go there it's it's tough to want to be anywhere else ya know the energy that's there that the the way that people are you know you you have all those things that are in other cities but all everything that's perfect and in one place it's it's very unique in that sense I think there's a lot of positive aspects to the military presence there too because I think there's so many discipline people down there yeah there's like a lot of health conscious fitness oriented and discipline people yeah because of the fact there's such a giant military presence down there like there's so many people that are involved in the military and so many people that are involved in the military have a lot of discipline trained a lot or interested in martial arts in particular yeah you know it's just I think it flavors that community mm-hmm yeah it's it's it's a wonderful place I love it lovely I don't go there the problem is the fucking drive whoo that Drive yeah well every time I work in San Diego I leave here at like 8:00 in the morning oh yeah yeah just like let's if I have to work there at night I'm like let me just fucking get it out of the way yeah get that 4-hour drive out of the way early yeah you know if you like for me if I leave at around 10:00 10:30 I can usually get there in about two hours before traffic hits but there's this really short window of time but if you miss it it's a rough one yeah my friend bill burr takes helicopter down there yeah well he's been taking helicopter lessons we should all get some helicopters and well he doesn't have his own but he takes lessons yeah and so you know it just hires one and he'll actually fly as a co-pilot who's like the you know flight instructor explains everything to make sure he's doing everything right yeah and then you down there in an hour yeah oh yeah have you ever been in a helicopter I haven't they kind of freak me out of it you know they just seem so sketchy they're sketchy yeah yeah but if they're well-maintained like anything else you know he took me up in one and we flew over in eyes and over Matt it was crazy flying over Malibu because we did it right after the fires always he got to see all the houses that were burnt to the ground nuts man and like Point Dume so these just huge estates are probably worth 25 million dollars is burnt to the fucking ground it's like and so many of a man Malby lost like six hundred structures this wild man it's hard to wrap your brain around the the damage that was done and then I saw this scale which showed you know what the California fires are and what the Australian fire oh my god that's just my friend tom is there right now and he said they had to divert his plane he was supposed to fly into Melbourne and they diverted it to Sydney because they couldn't fly through the smoke and 70% of the countries covered in smoke and a good percentage of those fires were started by people yeah it's fucking around like throwing cigarettes into the bush crazy yeah they said half a billion animals are dead jeez yeah that's terrible it's insane and they said that the koala bear like so much of their habitat is destroyed there there in like grave danger yeah it's yeah I mean like it said like something about like 80% of their range has been destroyed yeah it's crazy no koala bears only eat like I think they only eat eucalyptus trees yeah that's all they eat just kind of fucked up me just they found what works yeah they're in the one thing it's like I do too only these blueberries you know like bro what if they run out of blueberries yeah yeah I don't think they can eat other things I think that's like their digestive system is evolved to eat eucalyptus leaves yeah yeah that's horrible it's fucked up man when you look at the map of where the fires are it's it's crazy it's like multiple stiff like it's like if we had like multiple states like Texas Wyoming divided all on fire at the same time that's what it's like over there yeah it's hard to wrap your mind around it is have you ever been when there's a fire here not not close enough to really feel like that but but around and even just them in the general area I mean you realize how quickly they can spread and just take over everything and yeah so devastating I've been evacuated three times yeah from where I live and this last one the house is across the street from a house burnt to the ground yeah and then two houses down the one of those houses burnt down on my block ten houses yeah it's fucking nuts man I went to walk the dog today and we're walking by these just empty Lots where these people used to live mm-hmm no you know what bright side nobody died hopefully everybody had insurance but it's just it's humbling when you see it coming because everybody's like they're the firefighters are doing their best they're just they're dumping water they're doing their best to create firebreaks and everything again but there's nothing they can do it's so big I mean it was so big it was just coming over the top of the mountain he looked all the way to the left and all the way to the right just nothing but fire and these guys are just constantly circling over and dropping water down and doing their best but it's like it was crazy and that was nothing compared to up north Northern California yeah Northern California people died on the fucking highway they couldn't get out of the way of it that was terrible man that was so bad you know I was up there probably about five years ago when these were going on and they were just popping up everywhere and and there was some that were pretty close to the gym and having to like watch and see where their axes they were close through the apartments who lived in them like we might have to like get out of here because they just pop all over the place and they hopped from one place to the other with the wind and everything Henry cejudo almost burnt to death you know the story about him he had to jump out the window barefoot burnt the fuck out of his feet yeah like he didn't even know it was going on he was sleeping and then all sudden he's waking up he's like what is happening and he looks out the window and everything's on fire it got to him that quickly mm-hmm scary shit man but it's it's that you know that's fucked up about it but we all had to go to like me and my neighbors and some friends of mine we all picked a hotel we were in town we all went together but there's like a weird camaraderie about when shit like that goes down everybody was happy it's horrible that those things kind of happen and they make you realize like what is important yeah and you know it's the same thing like when you when you travel overseas and go to third-world countries like they seem to have a very good understanding of what life should and is about and why I'm here we have everything everyone has everything and everyone's complaining you're not everything and we're miserable and we're spoiled and that's that mentality it's it's so unfortunate it's like that the more you have the more we have to complain about and forget what what is important in this life it's weird that it takes something like that to jar you it's you should be able to learn from that and then carry that lesson yeah but that lesson is like sand in your fingers marriage how quickly like after like 9/11 or things like that no how long does it last yeah and such a traumatic thing like that you know we have like a week or two of America let's let's let's get together and let's take care and love each other and then I forgot yeah well I've I mean to make an analogy with martial arts one of the reasons why I enjoy being around martial artists and why most of my friends are good percentage of my friends are martial artists I feel like training all the time and getting humble particularly in jujitsu because you can get tapped out a lot and you you know you just train and you get tapped out and you keep going so I'm getting knocked out yeah it's not like you know you can only get cracked in the head so many times in sparring but you you develop this kind of humility that is it's it's everybody kind of understands it and there's this feeling that you get where you understand when someone's trying to kill you all the time like on a regular basis some dudes trying to choke the fucking breath out of you and so let's get their arm wrapped around your neck like the rest of the world seems easier you know and I almost feel like human beings are engineered through through evolution we've sort of been designed through natural selection to learn how to survive difficult things and when the difficult things don't exist we make things that aren't difficult difficult yeah very much so very much so you know for me I feel that training and martial arts and fighting and all these things that it clears the static and the noise out of your life and it allows you to focus on the things that are important and not be so distracted by fluff and nothingness no no and even a day or two of not training I like I feel that stuff seeping back in yeah and it's it's it's substantial you know and like I don't know how everyone's not running around shooting each other because just a few days I'm not doing this I'm like I'm gonna kill somebody because because I loud just the stresses of nothing to get it there need to make this sound more consistent just push that a little bit further just because it's you do man cigarette things like Hello I don't have a voice alright how about that that's perfect alright um how much longer do you think you're gonna compete I have no idea man how old you know I'll be 40 this year oh shit yeah that's the magic number you know the since the day I started you know I didn't start till I was 23 yeah and so what's tell your story because it's an it's a fascinating story cuz I love a guy whose life is fucked up and then he figured something out yeah and then becomes a role model and in a lot of ways that's what you've done yeah it's a long story and I am I'm actually in the process of writing my opera up biography right now which I've been working on pretty consistently for the last five years something that you know I really was doing it for myself in a lot of ways to have an understanding of the things that I've been through and the things that I've learned and processed and acquired over the years which is you know in a lot of ways it's been extremely rewarding and doing all this but it's also been in very difficult very painful and emotional going back through all these things that happened to me in my childhood and my upbringing and things that I'm even to this day I'm still trying to process and understand a lot of and my story yeah well your story of not starting till you're 23 and for that too much partying yeah so summarize a lot of this you know I was I grew up in a lot of different places moved around a lot and you know my parents split up very early me my mother and three brother four brothers sisters you know we basically lived in somebody's basement for in the beginning and we're living on welfare and bouncing around from place to place and so much of that shut me down emotionally and you know when I was kid from what I'm told I mean I've really not much recollection of my childhood because I blocked so much of this out and so it's been really difficult for me to write this book because I don't really have many memories I have almost no memories of that time in my life where I felt like a child that carefreeness of childhood and I've had to you know talk to siblings and friends from back then and look through photo albums and slowly things start coming together and you know that that's why a lot of this has been really therapeutic but I was a fighting I always loved boxing and was very intrigued by it and martial arts you know Bruce Lee was always a hero of mine and but I hated violence coming up I hated it but I was intrigued by it so one of a really good friend of mine we lived in Colorado for about a year or two he would get into fights on a weekly basis in school and I was fascinated by it and I'm like wow that like you're so brave and so strong and I felt like such like a weak I was very allowed like weakness to overtake me throughout the the the events of my life and I was very shy didn't talk you know I was always athletic and that kind of thing but but as far as confrontation in that I'd like it just shut me down and I didn't like it it upset me a lot and you know when people would be angry with me and so I had this this strange dynamic where I was drawn to fighting and I was drawn to violence in one way but if I also hated it a lot and was scared by it but but over the years you know I thought about I was like oh maybe I'll try boxing one day and that'd be really cool you know I was fascinated watching two people in the ring and all these people are watching and they're there with each other regardless of their skill level and you know just thinking about what would it must be like in there to do that you know and fascinated me but it but again like I said I love martial arts so I wanted to be able to kick people I want to be able to elbow people and knee people and I never saw any fighting that was like that you know as I was coming up I mean you'd see Taekwondo and karate and a lot of point sparring and that kind of thing and forms and you know even that I thought was fascinated but I wanted to fight like boxers did and I just never really saw anything like that and one day 94 this is right when we moved to Vegas I was watching ESPN like 2:00 in the morning and they used to have Thai fights on once in a while and this fight came on I got this next fight is guy moot I fight between so and so and when that started I was immediately hooked it hit something in me that just like lit me on fire I was like this is everything that I've been looking for this is something so different and it just spoke to my soul and it fascinated me and I was like if I am ever gonna do this that's gonna be it's gonna be muy Thai but you know for various reasons uh it scared me one I didn't know how to be able to afford it um I didn't know if my parents wouldn't even let me and you know coming up the way I did I was partying and drinking all the time even at that I mean I started drinking when I was like 12 years old holy shit yeah and by the time I was probably 18 I was physically dependent alcoholic I had to drink everyday in order to keep my nerves I'm shaking mymy held my hands would would tremor how much were you drinking a lot a lot every day I would drink every day I would go all day throughout the day a little bit at night I would just be pounding 40s fuck constantly you know and that's all that's all that I did I that's all me my friends did was you just drink will you drink every day and it was hard how did you wean yourself off that starting whit eyes would but what did it I as I said I learned about it in 94 over the years every once in a while I'd see a fight and oh I want to do this so bad in 98 I actually started calling around gyms in Vegas I was like oh if I'm gonna find a place to do this and for me it was one of those things all right if I'm gonna do it I want to do it right and now I want to do it to fight and if I'm gonna do it to fight him what is the the the fastest way to get there and I was like I need to take one-on-one lessons I need to I wanted to learn from a tie you know and that was not to say you know like Americans or anybody else can can't teach it but I was like if you're gonna learn you might as well learn it from the source and the only place in Vegas that taught muy Thai one of the only places that even taught Malita indefinitely only place that had Thai instructors was master toddies Jim and I called the gym you know went down and talked to one of the instructors and when he let me know how expensive it was gonna be I was like there's just no way there's no way imma be able to do this and for me I also knew that if I am gonna go after this I'm gonna need to stop drinking stop party and completely alter my entire existence I'm probably gonna lose all my friends um everyone's gonna laugh at me I didn't even know how serious I took myself you know I was like I laugh at me when I say this you know like it's and if you knew me back then he'd probably laughter like what do you mean you're gonna fight he's stupid as a stupidest thing I could ever think of and one of my best friends mo he for whatever reason this one night we were up on the roof drinking and smoking weed and he we got to talk him just about life and he was actually born with a heart defect I can't remember the exact name of the disease that he had because in hospitals this whole life he was eventually gonna need to get a heart transplant and said we're gonna do with your life you know I looked at him like he was asking me what would I want to do when I got to the moon what do you mean would oh and do with my life and he's like oh well I always wanted to fight in expecting him to laugh at me about this he was like well why don't you why don't you do it you know I told him well well I feel old already I was 18 at the time I've already felt ancient then you know when I told him all my reasons and all my fears and doubts and all these things he's like you know women he's like if anybody can do it you can he's I gotta think you should and they're really that always stuck with me maybe I can and in that moment you know I felt very motivated and one it's do it but bide you know continuing to drink and all these other things I just put it suppressed it into the back of my mind and then about a year later he was in the hospital and he needed to get a heart transplant and they basically he was basically at that point I was like you're gonna be here until you get one or you're gonna die and you know I don't think any of us realized how serious it was or maybe we just didn't want to he ended up passing away while he was waiting for the transplant and that just obviously devastated me to no end and through that night through my drunken coping I was like I'm gonna do this I'm gonna go after this dream you know my friend he didn't even get a chance to fail at a dream and I'm too scared to even try for no reason just out of fear that was literally my only reason not to do this other than you know financial and all those other surface things but it really just boiled down to fear and I was like you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go after this for him you know he didn't get a chance to live i'ma live for the both of us but you know unfortunately his his death sent me even harder down that downward spiral of alcohol and depression and three years later I I just had a realization one day I was like if he was still alive he'd beat the fuck out of me for wasting my life I've been wasting my life for 21 years because I'm afraid you know I'm afraid and a mom I'm too afraid to fail I'm too afraid of all these stupid reasons that that all of us give ourselves in order to make ourselves feel better about not going after things but really they're just that they're just that they're just excuses they're just things that make you feel better and they're bullshit they're all bullshit almost every excuse we his total bullshit because there's people with those excuses and with all those reasons and more and they're able then they do it and like what is your excuse and it just it just smacked me in the face one day and I I was at that point when I could not ignore it any longer and this was going into 2003 so I always like made it my new year's resolution to do this and you know one night I was sitting down with my father and we'd have these pleas he'd get into these long talks with me because just I was always very quiet and he'd like tick me off to the side and his way to kind of talk to me and get to know me better and he was like so won't you tell me something you've never told anybody you know I'm like we came him that you want what can I like I killed somebody when I was little I'm like like wracking my brain what I could possibly tell him and you know that that kept replaying in my mind you want to fight you want to fight you want to fight and very like quietly so like I happen to fight one day and he said what he's like I want to fight and he's like what do you mean you want to fight and you know I told him and he's like well why don't you and I told mall these reasons he's like well I cannot help you with all of your fears and doubts in this but look I'll make a deal with you if you quit drinking and dedicate yourself to this I'll take care of every all the financial things in order to let you do this I was like he said we got a deal I was like all right yeah and he's like Oh points Tao is drinking a 40 at the time he's like what about that drink in your hand I was like well I was gonna start tomorrow so I don't want to you know maybe I can finish this but you know I understood even at that age like you can't put things off like that it was like you know do if you're serious about it you're gonna do it now so I dumped out the rest of the 40 and the the sink he had in there and two days later I got into the gym and was it hard to wean yourself off the alcohol though if you were physically dependent on it was it was both extremely difficult yet I was so focused on this goal that none of those I I had to overcome so much not just the physical dependence of the inalco but but my lifestyle and I changed so many things but I'd been putting this off for so long that I knew there was there was no time for me to waste you know I was so focused on this that like once I made that switch in my mind like I'm gonna go after this and there's nothing that's gonna stop me and I've wasted so many years already that everything I'm doing is is gonna be playing catch-up you know there is no way for me to get to like I'd look at you know that like Sancha and guys like that and they're like I'm never gonna get there so everything that I do has to be to get me closer to this goal and I can't allow you know my physical dependency or my doubts or any of these things slow me down because everything I'm doing I have to play catch-up you know and having that that focus allowed me to overcome all of those those physical and emotional and mental challenges and of course that's not to say it was easy was extremely difficult it was extremely difficult but it was you got two choices you know you can you can allow these things to slow you down and hinder you and weaken you or you can say I'm gonna go forward anyway it doesn't matter how afraid I am it doesn't matter how hurt I am doesn't matter how tired I am this is what I want and I'm gonna put everything that I have into this so that way when I'm done when my or my life is over when I can't do this anymore I can look back and have no regrets that I didn't allow these things to slow me down I didn't allow the excuses that we all have hinder me and keep me from doing this you know because one day we're gonna wake up and realize we could have gone after these things and we didn't because of X Y & Z but really those things aren't aren't anything you know do you stop and think about those moments when you first started this because that's a profound life shift I like to go from being a guy who's kind of aimless and partying a lot but knowing that you should do something with your life to finally doing something like what was it like when you finally started training well what did it feel like when you actually because you hadn't had you done anything athletic before that you know I was I was always asked like my whole life I was always really good at sports I hated I hated the team aspect of things though my despised being on a team of any kind I loved playing sports for that for the love of it you know but any time I was on like a team I would just hated it I despised it and you know by the time I was like I think 12 I completely turned my back on anything team related because I felt to me it felt like it just ruined all the beautiful things about the physicality of of athletics you know it put this this mmm this honor it hindered me in a lot of ways you know and having to rely on other people you know was always a big yeah you know it's like it doesn't matter how hard I work because this person might not have worked at all right and you know that's why I'm so drawn to fighting because it's it's even though you do have a team of course it really is everything is on you the good and the bad there's nothing you can point you can point to all these other things but it's really just you so yeah I I think back and I look back to that time and what was the first day like it was do you remember yeah yeah I do it was so I started out just doing private lessons mmm I didn't even start doing classes until maybe six months to a year so I was I was doing private lessons on a daily basis my trainer master Chen who was one of toddies original instructors he had me in the gym like 6 a.m. is minimum so this is January in Vegas which is brutally cold but you know a lot of not a lot of people realize and their gym had no heat all the windows were like broken so there's no insulation or anything and I was I was just I was I was so excited you know so nervous and you know obviously I wanted to do really well and perform and everything was just everything was so new that I didn't really I don't really have a lot I couldn't even really process it so there wasn't a lot of something really a lot of thought that was going to it I was just I was just excited I was just constantly excited and motivated and wanted to my whole goal was to fight you know I was like I want to fight even if it's only one time so everything I did was with that mentality you know it's like I want to get better I want to get better I want do everything that I can at every moment and I put every ounce of myself into every second of the day was geared towards this you know it was singularly focused on this goal can you remember the first day yeah I remember the first day of footwork yeah oh man the first day the first day he has me up in the ring Oh must have been maybe the second or third day because there was I know there was other people there and that maybe they were just hitting the bag and stuff so there there was a couple of the other pro fighters there or other they were Pro fighters I was nobody and I'm up in the ring and so this is day one he's like shadowbox I've never done anything fighting relay time like what do you mean like I don't even know what that is you know what I'm saying like what do you mean shadowbox so like so much of my everything in my career has been like thrown into the deep end can you swim kind of thing and like this forced learning curve you know you know I didn't get babied into anything you know it's like alright shadowbox go ahead and ever you want all these fighters like staring at me watching me I'm like whatever you know it was it was it was traumatic in a lot of ways but having to confront that and face that particularly Meek's I'm naturally a very shy person a person that doesn't speak ever to anybody I mean even now you know I'm still very quiet but if you me back then I was basically a mute you know and I had no interaction with especially strangers and people I didn't know and even the ones that I do I'd still barely even communicate with so all of this was so foreign to me this was like an alternate universe that I was in and yeah it was it was it was so scary but it was like you don't have a choice like get up there and do it or get the fuck out of here you know what I mean so there wasn't there wasn't time for me to really think about it or like even be really nervous about it's like do it shadowbox like and in and this instructor you barely spoke English it's not like I can like say hey well I don't really know what I'm doing and maybe you can show me some things just like go any that's very much a Thai approach it's like just do it I'm not gonna tell you how I'm not gonna explain the steps just go kick the bag or hit it just do it and yeah it was it was scary but then once you got some momentum once you had a couple of weeks under your belt and this started becoming a real normal part of your life what was that feeling like what you realized like hey I'm fucking actually doing this yeah it's this is actually happening well every day every day I was taking significant jumps I mean as I said I've always been naturally athletic so I was picking this up like quick really quick I mean even within a few weeks people thought I'd been doing it for years you know and a lot of that you know does come from my fisk ality but but my drive to do it and into it to to have my sights set so high that you know I was taking these quantum leaps every single day so over over the weeks and over the months you know it just it really felt like I was like oh I'm on I'm on track you know I'm I'm on the path I should be on I'm gonna I'm gonna be amazing at this you know this is great I'm natural at this you know I'm gonna be um being a champion one day I'm gonna just be crushing people and you know everything everything was pointing in that door you know with my my development and you know started eventually going into the classes and sparring and all those kinds of things and you know it was always like when do I get to fight when do I get to fight when do I get to fight and I think it was nine months in I finally got I got to fight and I was like oh this is it this is this is my moment you know I'm gonna go out there you know I'm gonna crush this dude and then I'm gonna be you know on my way to the big time not that they're even you know back then there's no big time there was no this wasn't this was before YouTube this is before anyone even knew what Muay Thai was you know yet to tell everybody you did kickboxing basically which just crushed my soul every time every time say well it's like kickboxing and you know for Muay Thai people to have to say that is it's devastating it's like someone say well it's like karate you know it's no disrespect to any of these other arts but but to say that it's that in order to help people you most of the time I would just say yeah yeah yeah it's like keep boxing instead of having to explain to them what it is and yeah so nine months in I got the there was going to be a fight in Salt Lake City Utah and a bunch of the other people at the gym were fighting as well and we were all going to go up there and compete is this an amateur fight yeah yeah head gear mm-hmm no yes head gear but you know the funny thing was we had head gear but we didn't have shin guards we had eight ounce gloves and we hadn't eased the head well which was a trip so anyway so so I was like oh yeah great we get the fight and I was so excited and my pops and Gina and we we drove up there and you know like I said I really felt like I was on my way but when we got there the guy that I was originally supposed to fight I remember if he backed out or it was just that he was closer and wait till somebody else you know and that was kind of the thing back then we would just show up at places and be like you gotta fight for me or don't you and they didn't and I was like I was devastated I was devastated I'm like I did all this work I was so ready and now I don't have a fight and you know my turn is like well is there somebody else you get and so the the the the promoter you know he's calling around coming around and then he find these like well there's one guy that's going to take it but he always you buy 20 pounds and he's had about 30 fights already I was like let's do it I don't give a fuck and I was like I didn't do all this for nothing you know what I'm saying and you know and again that like that was just our mentality the way that we came up and the people that we came up under was you fight anytime anywhere anyone any style any weight it doesn't matter and so yeah I didn't even I didn't even really think about it as far as like that goes you know I was like I get to fight that's a fucking awesome man and uh I felt I felt confident in a way but it's also that you have no idea what you're really doing like you can train your whole life but if you've never fought you don't know anything anything you have no concept of what it's like to be in there you get the hardest sparring in the world with a complete stranger and it's night and day between a real fight and sparring and so it's like yeah you you you want to feel confident going in there but you have no concept of what it is so it's really just fake its fake confidence and I got a fucking crush man so I got there and I you know I have no concept of like pacing myself or anything so I just like I'm like sprinting at this guy and in like 30 seconds I was done I couldn't breathe I couldn't think I couldn't I could barely even see felt like felt like I was underwater and it was it was the worst thing in the world cuz nothing this guy was doing was hurting me and every time he'd hit me the whole crowd and all I wanted to do is just say it is it's bothering me this isn't hurting like I wanted to like tell everybody like this isn't hurting me I can't breathe like all I'm really trying to do is not pass out right now and and I I mean like physically I I couldn't do anything but but I was able to last for a while and do a couple decent things in there but by the third round he was just battering me kneed me in the face and you know he did he just kept clenching me up and we're just kneading the piss out of me and there was nothing I could do and they finally stopped it in the third round and I was devastated man I was devastated and I remember walking like I was I was walking back to the the locker room everyone in the crowd was like cheering for me like oh that was awesome and like like a job good job like what is wrong with these people like that wasn't good that was so terrible that's terrible and I was like laying in the back I'm bleeding all over the place and my opponent comes in he's like dude that was your first fight so yeah man I hate to see you in like a year or two he's like that was I was amazing and you know that really I really stuck with me know that that one that he said that and also just the the impact I saw that you could have on people that that it's not necessarily about whether you win or lose that it's what you show in there it's the heart that you show it's the the spirit that you show and you know I had like a day or two and I was like maybe this just isn't for me you know I thought I thought that this that I was gonna be so good at this I thought that it was just gonna like skyrocket to the top and I got crushed man I didn't even make it out of the fight and like maybe this isn't for me but I was forced to face that day one like do you want to do this regardless of how good you are regardless of you win if you if you can't win and maybe you can't be the best in the world do you still want to do this yeah I fucking do I love this so much and me having to face that so early on was was was extremely significant I sought so many of the people I trained with would go on these undefeated streaks like 10 15 20 fights but inevitably you will lose and if you haven't had to confront that early on eventually you do most of those people never fought again or just like crush them mentally where they weren't able to overcome it but I had to do with that the first day and overcome and be like you know what that doesn't matter I'm gonna I'm gonna bust my ass and Jimdo make sure that never happens again and I went on to win like 19 20 fights in a row from there and you know that was really a significant moment in my career where I had to confront the the reality of this and you know that so much of fighting is is this as a perfect metaphor for effort for things in life like if you really want something you can't always focus on what the results are or the immediate results like winning and losing and all of these things are so much of that is just on the surface ego level of things yeah and when you break it all down like what is your why are you doing this I'm doing this because I love it I'm doing this to improve myself I'm doing this because it's what keeps me healthy mentally physically spiritually and all of these things and that's the most important thing and yes it was an extreme motivator to be better and you know not to let that have happened to me again but you know really it really made things clear to me early on like what's important here also just to get over that it's so it's so psychologically important that you like you were saying you just kept getting sort of tossed to the walls everything you did was difficult it was almost symbolic of your journey that you were forced to fight someone who had 30 fights and 20 pounds heavier when you had no experience the trusting the process is you really only trust the process if it's difficult yeah you know that whole expression trust the prize well if you're fucking everybody up what do you mean trust the process you're out there just flocking everybody up course I'm trusting I'm the man yeah right but when you get your ass handed to you and then you have to rebuild and you have to realize well there's a series of variables in your encountering variables and speed and in in aggressiveness and in styles and in trickery and some people are better than others at figuring you out and some people have a style that's tailor-made to defeat your style and it's good when that does happen yeah and not just to trust a process but to appreciate the journey yeah yeah and sometimes people they just want success mm-hmm yeah of course we all want we always want things to be good it's it's kind of that same mentality of you know like you want to give your kids what you never had but a lot of times you do that you end up with a spoiled brat who has no concept of work ethic and what really takes and you're hindering them even more so than than you were cuz you had to like confront all these things right you know what I'm saying and it's it's unfortunate that so many things that you would think would help us or really hurt us in the end and it needs to be difficult it needs to be a struggle and of course you want help along the way but though the harder you have to work that in the long run the stronger you're going to be the better you're going to be the more independence you're going to be the more self-sufficient you're going to be and all of these things are gonna better you so then a lot of ways is like maybe I should make my kid's life hell and then he's gonna be really strong and he's gonna be an entrepreneur and he's gonna change the world I don't know yeah it's it's hard you know I have children it's uh it's tricky I think you don't want him to have a hard life but you do one of the most difficult things too is we're all on our own journey and what's beneficial for one is detrimental to somebody else so yeah it's good to have advice it's good to have somebody that believes in you but that's not necessarily going to help you just because sometimes that might end up hurting you you know having a people that do believe in you and telling you how great you are and you know opening doors for you and in all these things you know in many ways those things can be extremely detrimental and you don't you don't develop the things that you inevitably will need in the long run you know and there's no there's no one way to get anywhere you know it's there's so complex and there's so many variations of things that that that apply to success in anything I have one favorite day in the weather in Los Angeles the weather in Los Angeles is perfect right it's just so often it's like 80 degrees and sunny it's like 90 percent of time 80 degrees and sunny me and my friend Brian and my friend Steve Rinella we filmed this television show called meat-eater and went on a hunting trip in Prince of Wales Island in Alaska where it's the rainiest part in North America it's so fucking rainy you you think you're gonna stay dry in your tent but there's no such thing as dry like and I realized this one of the first nights I had to get up to take a piss in the middle of the night and I had a headlamp and I turned my headlamp on and inside my tent was like it was raining because it was so much there was mist it was moisture like so much moisture that turning on the headlamp was like you you were like doing it in fog like everything was wet my sleeping bag was wet my clothes were wet and I was like oh you don't you don't get dry there's no dry we had one day we had a fire one day we figured out how to start a fire actually using Fritos there's a pro tip if you ever fucking Fritos are made with some fucking crazy toxic grease that they work great as lighter fuel like if you like them they stay lit for a long time and then we were like taking like the inside of logs and like using that wood and wood that was like maybe under the bottom of other wood so it didn't get as wet we slowly put a fire together anyway I was there for six seven days we got back to LA and it was 80 and sunny and the feeling of that Sun I was like this is the same Sun I always experience but it's always just you know it's normal it's no big deal it's just California weather another day in paradise but not that day that day I was like fuck this is amazing I was driving on the street my face felt good like everything it felt good and I called my friend Steve up I go dude I've never been happier like this is like the happiest day I've ever experienced yeah and I think it's because we were suffering in just cold and rain for seven days yeah like you need that yeah other one cuz if you just have these goddamn sunny days you like everybody out here in California he just spoiled baby well it's like the if everybody's winning nobody's winning rises nobody's losing so if you don't have the good and the bad you don't even understand you can't appreciate the good or what the bad can be yeah there's the helpful things that it does and you know yeah we don't want that but but those are the things that help you grow and those are the things that that we never really need you know I hate to well I don't hate to because I want to do this I'm going to toss a little hand grenade at you and you know see what you want to do with it here but I've been thinking about this a lot lately and you know wanting to communicate my story in these things that have happened to me and then this opportunity came up and this opportunity to reach a lot of people and to there's that quote that says be the person that you needed when you were younger you know and and Gina has that honor wall and it stares me in the face every day and I realize that I now and the person that I needed when I was younger and if somebody would have opened up their mouth and let me know that I wasn't alone in that that I wasn't so isolated and so many so many horrible things that we all deal with is because we feel isolation we don't think anyone could understand and we don't think that anyone else is going through these things and and if we did just that knowledge of not being alone would be so significant but when I was 14 years old I was molested by my stepmother and this went on for well over a year close to two years and it was obviously detrimental to me and these are these these are things that I'm just now finally starting to be able to understand and and realize like what happened to me and realize how young that was at the time you know when I meet of a 14 year old kid like you're buckin baby you're a baby you you know it's like when we think about ourselves when we were younger like at least myself I'm like I still feel the same I did when I was younger I was just little you know what I mean yeah but you don't really understand how little you were until you have like a little 12 14 year old kid standing next to you like you're nothing like you don't even how could how could that happen in like thinking about how so I study that said one in six males are abused by the time they're 18 which means every one of us probably know somebody that this has happened to you know and to think how devastating it is to women but but what turn man it's it's it's it's such a different thing because you're almost it's almost viewed aspect well and when it happens from a woman you know it's almost viewed as like a good thing yeah like it's a positive thing like oh I wish that happened to me when I was a kid like I want to I want to be molested and you know we're not able to really understand it and understand the damage that it that it does and and you know I I if I wouldn't have felt so alone and so isolated at the time I you know I don't necessarily know if things would have changed but I definitely would have wouldn't have felt so alone you know and it felt like there's nobody in the world that could possibly understand that there's nobody that and who can I talk to about this you know like I can't talk to my friends a couple of my friends knew they thought it was the coolest shit ever you know they're like I want that I want that bad and I'm like well was your stepmom too which is dude it was it was so confusing you know as I was I was very conflicted by it you know like I couldn't understand it at all and then to have person like mentally manipulating meeting mate and make it like oh it's not a big deal it's okay it's almost like it's a good thing you know like it's like there's nothing wrong you know it's it's you know I'm not a stranger and this you know even prior to that as I said I started drinking when I was 12 but but this really just derailed me so much and made me internalize and put up these barriers and walls around me and things that I like I said I'm only even just in at this age starting to understand like the negative habits that this created in me of distrust enough of negativity enough of you know having to be having to be alone and not trust people and you know so many things like that that you know like Gina's probably the only person that I've ever talked to in depth about this I mean my couple of people my family know and almost none of my friends know I've never spoken to this to anybody you know III I try to go to a therapist once and talk about this but I started realizing like this therapist is getting more out of this or our interaction and then I am like he's you know like a overweight person and he's like self confident self I'm like oh geez man like like who can I I can talk to about this and you know maybe maybe I can't talk to anybody but I am in a position to where I can reach out and let other people that know that they're not the only ones going through this and that has been weighing on me so much lately especially over the last few years none like you are in a position to be able even if you only helps one person that you can you just don't know how to like well I could write about it or I could do like a video blog or something and I've been thinking about this a lot lately gonna how do i how can I do this and like should I do this and like I don't that's like a good thing it's not like I'm a like psychologist or someone that can like help with this and but I just felt like I need to express this and and and and communicate this in and maybe it can do some good for even one person and in if I didn't like that would haunt me forever i I had an experience when I was 13 with a girl who lived up the street who was 21 a couple times but is very different than your experience it was I mean I'm ashamed to say it it was kind of fun you know it's it was different it was I couldn't believe it it's very weird yeah but it definitely like kind of screwed up my idea of what boy-girl interaction was I didn't go from like thirteen year olds most the time they're like you want to kiss old you I don't know yeah - you know this girl grabbing my dick and pulling her tits out she was a woman you know she was 21 and it didn't it didn't hurt me like your story like your story hurts like it sounds like you were betrayed and you were you were saying also that the fact that was your stepmom I mean with me it was like what the fuck was that all about and I don't I I didn't tell anybody yeah I didn't tell anybody for like fucking years and years later I probably didn't tell anyone until I was in my 20s and I think I probably told a girlfriend when I was in my 20s yeah and she was like when was the first time you ever fooled around like Wow because that was really the first time I had ever fooled around with anyone was just 21 year old woman what else it was the same thing for me you know I I didn't even kiss a girl in tow is I don't know 12 13 like it late late yeah cuz I was such a shy person so I went from just kissing to that I there was no in-between I think the same with me I think I don't even think I kissed I think I kissed her yeah I think she was the first person I kissed you know yeah and you know to just have your innocence ripped away like that and to be thrust into this adult thing you know obviously the situation was that much worse it being you know my stepmom and it being being molested and you know it it's such a different thing than a woman are being raped forcefully raped so it's way different you know but psychologically and emotionally you know it's it's it's it's devastating it is it is obviously and you're living with her as well yeah yes that's the whole thing's terrible and you should have went on for a year longer than year it was probably close to two years how did it stop I stopped it actually you know this was this was something you know I never obviously I never felt right about this I was a very conflicted by it you know no I was like just definitely isn't a good thing like I don't know like I know I definitely I didn't understand how bad of a thing it was you know I mean and again she was very manipulative and you know anytime I would kind of bring that subject of like yeah I don't think this is okay you know this is this feels wrong and she's like you know you know and find this way to you know rationalize it or make it okay and you know but time went on like I just like there this is bad how old was she she was probably 30 young 30s you know now that was another thing like once I got to that age and then I saw a 14 year old I'm like what the fuck like I didn't even I couldn't even conceptualize how twisted this person was until I got that age how could you how could you look at a baby a child and and do that how could you do that you know that expression hurt people hurt people yeah and you know in in in and unfortunately a lot of that for me is helps you like rationalize it and make it like oh well you know she's fucked up and you know even even my father you know after you found out like he kept this lady around for a while really yeah after he found out yeah I mean they they they kind of split up and divorce but but um they kind of work together still and you know he kept her around for for quite some time and you know that alone was extremely damaging to me and betrayal such a betrayal and such a such a traumatic thing that I didn't even really understand how damaging that was after the fact until really till recently you know because I myself would rationalize it well you know he didn't want to like like be an asshole and like sent her off like she was an alcoholic too and you know you know it was like oh you know he's just trying to you know make this horrible situation like okay for all of us and you know I didn't really think about like how fucked up he was in the whole situation and like how how much more damaging it was in the long-run to me by not having my father protect me like if Mike this happened to my child I would fucking murder a woman that did this you know I certainly wouldn't keep her around you know and I certainly wouldn't like just handle it handle it the way that he did you know and that was that was almost it magnified the the damage that much more so because of the way that it was handled you know and to not have that to not be taken care of by adults by not be taken care of by my father by the people around me that who were supposed to love me and take care of me and and and they did the exact opposite like they fucked fuck to my world up you know and III put band-aids of alcohol on it my whole life you know and it and I understand like why I why I did that and why it was I mean I really was trying to kill myself really I mean when you look at it that's what I was doing I was just doing process of it you know and that's that's that's what we do it's like we don't want to take a gun and kill ourselves but I'm gonna I don't want to really live and I want to like I want to check out of this place sooner the better so I'm gonna do everything in my power to make it happen and that way I can't say I killed myself but I was killing myself everyday and putting myself in situations I were extremely dangerous and detrimental and damaging and that's what I was doing and didn't you know a half of my life was I was just destroyed and you know I'm trying to use this second part of my life to make up for that make up for the damage that was done and to try to turn a horrible situation in a negative situation something that I could easily point to and allowed destroy my life which is what I was doing and trying to do the opposite you know it's again with it that the fight approaches like you have a loss you have a horrible thing happening you have an injury what are you gonna do with it are you gonna let it destroy you and break you and never do this again and then be depressed and bitch and complain and whine about it we're gonna say yeah shitty things happen to all of us fucked-up things happened and we all have the excuse to let it destroy our lives and to use it to make ourselves feel better about mmm drinking and drugs and just being an asshole and you know like we all have reasons to be dicks and we all have reasons to you know take it out on other people but that doesn't mean that you should and that doesn't mean that you don't still have a choice it's that victim mentality and that this is something that I I just just started understanding because you know that that term victim is telling me I'm like yeah well I almost fucking victim but what victim mentality really is is feeling like you don't have a role to play from that point yeah you might not have been able to control these terrible things that have happened to you but you do have control over what you do from there you have control over whether you use that to go into a more positive light or you use that to to drastically damage you and you know be this burden that you carry well sometimes I think when someone like you goes through something like this and comes out on the other end what you can do by talking about this can set a path for so many people to understand that you know someone looks at you you know they see fighting on television and they they they see you on the internet and you know successful Muay Thai fighter and you know you look cool you have this beautiful girlfriend everything seems so positive you know when you're a young kid and your life is shit like mine was clearly like yours was you you look at these people like they're nothing like you they're aliens they're there's some different things they they're they're there it's the world is opened up to them so easily yeah and they're better than you when someone hears you talk about your experience the alcoholism the abuse the isolation the feeling like a loser and all the things that are so relatable to so many people when you can talk about this you can you your your setting a map that other people can follow yeah and this is something that's so important in culture and in human beings we're all part of some strange evolution of the human race and the things that our grandparents went through were likely un-fuckin'-believable horrific the things their grandparents wore it went through we're probably magnitudes worse and this is just how human beings have gone from being monkeys to being what we are now and it's happening very rapidly yeah and one of the things that accelerates this understanding of consequences and of the ability to rise to the occasion and overcome obstacles and to be able to use adversity as a tool to better yourself it's someone like you what you're doing right now is very very beneficial to so many people millions of people listening to this right now and so many of them this is gonna resonate with them they're gonna say oh this guy who is this fuckin badass kickboxer MoIT excuse me wait I play bad ass dude who's just like you know like people admire you and to hear this is so it's so powerful I mean that's it I'm so glad you said it I'm so glad you talked to all of it from the beginning you know your your earlier struggles to this because this is medicine for people man there's a lot of people that are hearing this right now and they're going I can do it too I can do it too yeah and that's that's always been a motivational thing for me to try to be honest with the the things that I deal with the ups and the downs and to to show my losses to show my injuries to show to be vocal about the doubts that I have that that I still have that I still deal with you know it's it's easy to look at these people in the spotlight and be like they don't deal with fear they don't deal with pain they don't deal with doubts they don't deal with feeling like they're inadequate yeah I think I'm it moves a clip or something you were talking about the imposter syndrome yeah and I'm like yeah like it doesn't matter how amazing you seemingly are on the outside to all of these people like we're all just human beings we are all just individuals that have made choices and have steered our lives in certain directions but but it's almost like when you make it tool points like oh they don't deal with this anymore yeah I deal with the exact same fears doubts in all of these things that I dealt with day one to this day I'd still deal with them those same questions they've never gone away ever going away you know you learn how to handle them better and you learn you should get strengthened by them but but they don't necessarily disappear and a lot of times they can get worse over the years because now you're now you're in a position where you're expected to be a certain way people have people have expectations of you you know you you're supposed to be this superhuman being or you supposed to be extremely calm are you supposed to only put on a plus performances and you're not allowed to fail you're not allowed to be human anymore and the when we can humanize these things and in it lets people realize that they can do it too you know we're not we're not necessarily made up of anything different than anybody else you know we've just gone through a process of learning and developing and diving off of cliffs that we didn't know where they were going and you know that's that's what we all have to do you know like the people and these spotlights they're they're just human beings yeah and the more you that you you meet them and read about their stories and you know that's why I live with reading autobiographies like jeez like that thing's these people if I don't come they weren't handed anything if more than anything it was more devastating and detrimental and they've had to overcome more than you could possibly imagine and in it wasn't just given to them they had to work and strive and struggle and fail fail over and over and over and over and over and over and over again until they got to where they got to instill do they still do they still fail constantly we all fail constantly yeah well failure is a gift yeah once you make that switch do you understand it like you can view these losses or these things that happen or these struggles as you know I always view them as challenges like are you gonna quit are you gonna give up I always view like when I'm tired in the ring or in on a workout of me like you won't quit like fuck you man you know I view that like that that that voice in your head you know that the devil that's looming over your shoulders like you're gonna quit your failure you feeling like you know what fuck you I'm not quitting I'm never gonna quit I'm never gonna stop and there's nothing you can do so keep talking but I'm going forward is there a time will you ever get past that and you understand that you're never gonna quit and instead just concentrate on the task at hand or do you think that that that voice that you're duking it out with that you take that motherfucker to the grave you definitely take it to the grave you I think we feel like we get farther away from it and we get stronger and we get more confident but it never gets far that you never get farther away from it you know like it like I compared to my alcoholism it's like I could go ten years without ever drinking again but all it takes is one bad day yeah we are all one bad day oh yeah being in the worst situations ever and that's why it's so important to you know you look at people on the streets and things like that like you know easy that can happen yeah like how many bad days are bad situations would it take to turn a successful person into that not a lot no we're all just balancing on this very yeah delicate thing that you know it seems like we're all strong and safe and all this like well when the power goes out and you know that the world's gonna go to hell like that yes we just pretend like it's not right that's how we get through the day so but yeah like to your point is I don't think we're ever any farther away from those things that held us back before we get stronger than we learn how to process them and we we we understand it more and we understand that the series of things that we need that will take us down that road or or get us farther away from it but it but it's just right there you know and no matter how much we learn and develop I think you know sometimes I mix it a yurt it's like the higher you get the farther you have to fall and and it's the more you can be aware of that that you're never gonna get farther away from it you always need to be diligent that you always need to do things that are going to steer you in a more positive way I think that it that is like the goal to to not falling back on that that's I think the worst thing that we can do is have this belief that were past it no that's never gonna happen again I'm I'm not an alcoholic anymore I'm not a drug act anymore I'm not depressed anymore that's what that's what's helped me is is I I did think I one day I would be so far away from it that it would never be a thought anymore but but by knowing that it's always right there that keeps me sharp yeah you know it's like that that you need that thing to keep you at your best or else we start to get lazy it's that that that same concept of having people that push you in the gym or in life or or excetera if if you don't have somebody pushing you you can only ever push yourself so hard you might think you're pushing yourself really hard but you don't really have a basis for where that is so like for myself I always run my sprints on a treadmill because the treadmill doesn't lie this is how fast you're going and this is how long you're doing it now you can go out on the street and say I was going as fast as humanly possible you're always gonna hold yourself back a little bit you know that's just the way we are as human beings you know that that safety net that we have ingrained in us to not go over that edge but if you're not pushing that edge you're not developing and you're always holding yourself back a little bit a little bit and no matter how hard you think you're going or how honest you think you're being unless you have somebody aside so important to have people in your lives that that keep you in that sharpened state you know that that that that that question you yeah that that push you and you know like like for me jeana's always been that way for me that person like she's not gonna look look at my mom and let me bullshit you know it's keep me honest you know sometimes to do an extreme extent and like give me a little bit of a break here you know it's like that person that that pushes you and it's uncomfortable to be pushed and you don't want to be pushed I want to relax I don't want to like sit on the beach and drink beers and do all these things but is that gonna help me get to a better place in my life a better place in my mind in my heart now that's gonna allow me to just like be a lazy piece of shit and just drift off and die and be no benefit to to myself or anyone else for that matter so as uncomfortable as it is to be pushed and as I what it is to be pressured into want to excel we all need those things you either improving your or your decline yeah and I think that's such an important thing to keep in mind like it's only one or the other yeah there is no in the middle it's like the concept of balance you never find balance because once you find it you lose it you're always jumping on both sides of this line too much or too little you're are they going too fast or too slow yeah and we're trying to find that perfect balance of everything and you'll never can find it but knowing that you never can find it forces you to be diligent about all these things and to constantly be trying to find it and the more you try to find that the more you're going to develop and learn ways that aren't the right way and then finding what what does work it's like trying to find your calling and your passion life is like you don't have enough to necessarily know what that is but Whittle it down by what don't you want to take what do you hate what do you hate right don't even look like what you like what do you hate I don't wanna do this I don't want to uh said I wanted this I I'd learned very early on at a young age like I do not want to go down this path that I see everybody on this go to school get a job have kids get married retired I like III don't want I don't want that I don't know what I do want I just know that to me I don't want anything to do with that and I'm gonna go in the exact opposite direction whatever that is as long as I'm far away from that that's a swarm gonna be well it's one of the benefits of being an outsider yeah when you're an outsider and you see all these people that are supposedly doing the right thing but living these sort of empty meaningless lives that they don't enjoy particularly that they don't enjoy you know and then you know when I was a kid I always looked at normal people living normal eyes I could never relate I never understood it you know I also grew up from a broken home and we were also on welfare and you know the whole deal good I think a lot of motivated people come from a place of despair when they're younger you know and I always had this thought in my had that one day I wouldn't make it one day I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it and then one day I realized and I don't know when I realized it probably went like on paper had already made it yeah I realized oh there's no such place like this is not real like you can't ever you don't make it no man no one makes it yeah like if every day you have to be trying to do better every day you have to be trying first of all there's no perfect human let's accept that you're always gonna be flawed you're always gonna you're always gonna be subject to fits of rage and envy and and all the things that you wish that you would never have in your mind so you're gonna constantly be working to make sure that that never happens you can constantly be working to make sure that you are always evaluating your perspective on life and always looking at things from meditate constantly meditate make sure that you approach life with a learned perspective like you're a better person you were the day before and whatever you're trying to do whether it's fighting or whether you're you have an art form that you practice whatever it is that you're doing you're trying to do better every day and you never even if you you'll accomplish someone like when you know you accomplished some amazing work of art that's just that day the next day you got to go back to work like if you have a world championship fight and you've trained for eight weeks and you win by knockout the spectacular result and you're very happy with the result you got a day or two to relax yeah you got a day or two and then you're like fuck okay now what well now you got to get back to work and if you if you think that there's someplace like a movie where you're holding hands with your loved ones and the fucking Sun sets go on and the credits roll that's horseshit and we have this idea in our head that there's this place that you can get to where you have air quotes made it yeah and I'm here to tell you that motherfucker doesn't exist I mean obviously I'm not the most successful person in the world but on paper I've accomplished a lot of shit and it doesn't mean a goddamn thing every fucking day every fucking day I get up and I'm like I gotta figure out how to do this I gotta work on this new bit okay I got its podcast today I gotta be on point let me think about this let me read this book let me come you know whatever the subject is let me get--aw let me get into it you you have to if you don't you're you're gonna feel like shit yeah it's that at that destination mentality yeah destination yeah it's just a journey you're never gonna get there there's doesn't exist there's nowhere to go as soon as you get there like jeez I'm just as far away from that thing that I thought because as you develop your the things that you think you want develop - yeah one day I'm gonna be rich but the richer that you get the richer you want to become well then you start filling up your life with these meaningless destinations right which are material objects I want to fucking yacht bitch yeah I want a jet you know and you're like I want a bigger job Tom's got a fucking jet but I want a big jet I want to show I'll pull my jet up beside his yellow no motherfucker there's levels to this game you know and that's what people do and it's they fill their lives up with meaningless possessions and they're you know aren't happy a band-aid to cover up the like what is the real thing here do you not me really successful people I know that are fucking medicated to shit all of them a lot of them a lot more more more more more so than the people that aren't in jazz should the people that struggle they're on a better medication for real the struggle of like like a hard working person that can get get done with a day of hard work and have a feeling of accomplishment and then go home to your family and get going again knowing you have to get up in the morning and do it again knowing you don't have enough money to buy a yacht but knowing you have enough money to put food on the table and there's a satisfaction to being able to provide that that's a better medicine well that's the thing with with why it's so important and vital to to travel and you know go to this third-world countries like these people literally have nothing and are inviting perfect strangers into their homes and giving them things that they do not even have themselves like why are these people so happy why are they so at peace right because they understand what's important that it's not this materialistic thing and and that's not to say that material are bad but we view them as these these these objects of success and and I've made it and I've things are perfect in my life and they are they do they exact opposite in a lot of ways if you don't have a good grasp of what's really important in this life and and and unfortunately a lot of times we need everything taken away for us to really understand what those things really are yeah you can appreciate some things you can appreciate a nice car or a nice house but if you get really caught up in them you are trying to fill up a bucket with a hole in it yeah and it's never gonna fill up yeah you're always just gonna look for bigger and bigger things to try to fill that bucket up and and you're gonna feel full of anxiety all the time chasing that you know and there's no real there's no real satisfaction then that's why you know when you look at one of the things that people look at when you look at people that are extremely materialistic that you know where the the most fancy jewelry and drive the most fancy cars and the biggest houses we always think they're shallow always I mean isn't that funny like the thing that you would look at in terms of like Mallick markers for success Marcus is like material things are the big ones right there the big markers for success the big house that's the big one right yeah ass fucking mansion look everything big everything the big fucking rock on its finger yeah big chain you know big this big that there's nothing there there's nothing there and so ingrained in us from the time that door born cuz it's hard to get yes that's why it's a trick it's one of those things it's hard to get so you think you want to get it yeah because there's a lot of things that are hard to get that are worth getting for sure right I mean becoming a great fighter is hard yeah but it's worth doing because once you do do it and you you realize like like there's an expression that I've used before but my tagua no instructor said to me when I was a little boy he said martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential yeah and I remember that I mean like oh shit like and I've used that many times explain it to people but that is the benefit of getting good at a martial art yeah like you go through this difficult thing and then through that you reap all these personality rewards you reap these character rewards you reap this understanding of what you're capable of right if you are capable of making it through a brutal camp and getting up in the morning when you know you don't want to that alarm clock goes off and you're like I don't want to fucking run but you do it you go out and run and you do it every day and you get through it and then you're successful and you realize that you have this incredible endurance because of the discipline that you put in you realize that you have this incredible skill and it's understanding of how to fight correctly because of all the time and the hours and the focus you're a better person because of that right that's a real goal but that yacht you know like the like well I'm gonna I'm gonna work 16 hours a day so I can get a bigger yacht and then you know I need a house with bigger windows I need a it's this is a nonsense to that like look I'm not saying if you can afford a nice house get a fucking nice house it's great to have a nice house what I'm saying is it's not the end yeah it's the you you are the project your mind is the project yeah how you treat people is the project how you your the way you are with your family and your friends and your loved ones and the people you communicate with get better at that yeah that's that's that's the goal in this life the goal in this life is how we treat each other I know now I wish these were things that we were taught no no no it's better it's better that you didn't learn that because you had figured yes cuz you got to figure it out yourself n because you can explain it to people that's you in particularly you can explain it to people having gone through this horrific adversity and come out on the other end with a message yeah and so other people that are going through some tough shit you've got the medicine the medicine is your you've actually experienced it and you know it's a map it's a map of the territory it's not it's not a fucking pill that you can take and all sudden everything's going to be better but what it is is a map of the territory and you know and and a knowledge hey you can get through these woods and on the other side there's a beautiful green meadow and there's a lake and it's really nice yeah for sure you know I think that that was one one of the benefits of the way I grew up which was just really hard and horrible but I got to see firsthand both sides of money you know I went from living in a basement with five of the people and living on welfare to living with my father and a mansion and it's like oh yeah all this money and all this stuff is just emptiness and in meaningless and and it doesn't necessarily equate to real happiness you know like why are we all chasing this so hard and I got to see that firsthand very very early on I was like I don't want this well it's a trick it's like the same reason why people love to play video games because they're difficult but there's no there's no real reward unless you're a professional video game player and you make a living doing it nowadays there's no real reward you just get better at it and you get some sort of a sense of satisfaction and I mean there's a there's something to be gained from it in fact some video games they've actually shown can increase your cognitive performance and other things similar to the way chess does right but the the trap is that they're hard to do so when we see things that are difficult human beings are sort of puzzle and problem-solving oriented we see puzzles we want to solve them we see mysteries we're gonna find out that's why everybody's into like Bigfoot and UFOs and shit cuz the mystery yeah oh what is it what do you think it is like we have a natural inclination to try to solve things like that yeah and we think that because in life look if you try to solve where the food is you survive that's what made us alive that's why our DNA has been passed down for all these hundreds of thousands of years because our ancestors figured out where the food is you know they figured out how to drill a hole in the ice and fish they figured out how to you know how to survive and this is why things that are difficult to do or attractive to us but we have to be able to differentiate between things that are difficult and meaningful and things that are difficult in bullshit yeah my foot you know Bryan Callen my friend Bryan Callen sets up to me once we're really young and it was the perfect thing we're both in our 20s and he said how you want is enough money so you don't have to worry about what something cost when you go to a restaurant yeah he's like everything else is bullshit I was like you're right yeah being able to have enough money to just get a nice meal at a restaurant and not sweat it yeah everything else is gravy yeah well you know they've done countless studies on this like once your basic human needs are met you know you have the food shelter yeah everything from that point on is doesn't correlate to any kind of happiness and in many ways is the exact opposite you know creates more stress yes yes like what how much do you really need and if you the more you you think you need the more problems you're creating and the more distractions you are from the important things in life and developing as a human being you know you're developing all these materialistic things but you're not developing yourself emotionally and mentally and spiritually and yeah like just as soon as you realize that like why am i chip what am i what is the purpose of what it is that I am chasing yeah I think the study was like they said $80,000 like everything over $80,000 like you really don't experience any much more you know before that you're you get into like forty thousand thirty thousand well nice struggling it's hard to feed yourself yeah becomes very it's a weight on your shoulders but once you hit a certain number it's like yeah you're gonna be alright yeah yeah you never be in the street yeah you're living like I remember I lived in this apartment I had this kind of shitty apartment and then I moved to a better apartment and then I was sitting in this better apartment I was like I'm kind of used to this like I'm used to this like this is just home now there's a feeling when you get with your home like alright I'm home now I'm in this other apartment it just cost more money yeah you know okay I remember thinking that like is this better yeah I mean I guess it's better but it's cost twice as much like now I gotta fucking think about how I'm gonna pay for this bitch yeah well I I think about like when I had like five dollars in the bank room when I had five thousand dollars in the bank right did I feel different I didn't feel different at all no you know I might have felt different like when I go out to eat and the check comes pay for this kind of thing but but emotionally I didn't feel any different whatsoever yeah and yeah I think that's such an important lesson for all of us to learn and you know earlier the sooner you figure those things out you know the better like so many things in life we figure out so late if ever you know when we're kids we look at adults our parents some those in authority and they called they got it figured out yeah you had a really good joke about this about thinking the older you get the more you you understand life and how things are going on but the older you get realize nobody knows what the fuck is going on and everyone's out here just winging it yeah like I don't know what the fuck I'm doing I'm just kind of trying my best but but I'm like oh maybe I should look to my parents for advice like jeez they're really just adult kids what the fuck they're talking about yeah the bit was do you remember when you thought that grown-ups were real like I used to think that one day I'm gonna be grown I was crying I was young I was so upset one day I'm gonna be growing up and everything's gonna make sense yeah and then one day you're at the supermarket and the guy goes paper plastic sir you know what sir I'm a sir am i growing up fuck this is it and then you realize no one knows anymore than you about what this is all about you might have more data yeah in your head you might have more experience might be a brain surgeon you might know how to build rockets you might be smarter than me yeah but you don't have any fucking idea what this is yeah no one does you cannot know you can but everything is there I'd like to think there are there are really no facts everything is a theory because we could all be asleep in a dream right now or hooked up to a machine like nobody knows that for sure so how can you possibly say anything is factual you can say things are factual with the information that's in front of you but that information might be bullshit in 10 years from now I might say might have a completely different perspective on things that we're doing now that we think are right and like this is the way life is the way the world is it was like ten years ago people had a very different approach to things you know what we can say is as far as we know this is the case and this is what we know is repeatable yeah if you do this if you put two bricks on top of two bricks you have four bricks we're pretty sure but we might be in a dream yeah like we could all be wrong and that's why I think it's you know so stupid to to judge other people's beliefs be like Oh your ways the right way you got it figured out and the everybody else is crazy but you think it and like don't you think that they think the exact same thing you do well there's a problem today and there's a lot of people out there given advice and this is what's interesting sometimes advice it resonates and then you get older and wiser and you realize that advice is really fucking stupid because you have it's there's people that are giving advice and they're there they work there there's like a lot of value in motivating people right look when someone's a like a legitimately motivational person whether it's like wim HOF the Iceman or someone who's like really done some things there's something about them that that their inspiration is fuel it's it really does something to you but then there's a lot of people out there that are just saying shit cuz they think it's gonna be motivating to other people and it sounds like horseshit yeah and it only tricks dummies yeah and that stuff is painfully prevalent yeah there's so much of it there's so many people out there that are trying to offer advice and they're trying to motivate people but then you go hey man what have you experienced and as they've had a Placid dull life filled with non accomplishments yeah the biggest accomplishment is tricking people into thinking they're good motivational speaker mm-hmm like the get-rich-quick things oh there's so many of those this is how they've gotten rich sure yeah dude I was watching a documentary on one of those guys one of these Internet guys who rents houses and rents cars and tries to pretend he's this big baller and and spends all this money and you know and ran a bunch of scam dating sites and all these different things like this is what this pursuit is odd it's a fucking odd thing as a pursuit of tricking people into thinking that you're more knowledgeable than you actually what resonates with people is like what you were talking about from the beginning in this podcast when you're talking about your life and how you felt and your own real legitimate experiences and the feelings of inadequacy and then the finding the light at the end of the tunnel and all these different things that are just you're you're you're relying you're your life's lessons and experiences those are extremely valuable for people yeah those are extremely valuable but because people know they're extremely valuable there's a lot of bullshitters out there that are trying to concoct these things and then trick you and like this is how I got this mansion yeah you can get this mansion too you can make I'm gonna show you here on a white board this is what you could do like they're just horse shitting yeah but there's money in that and so there's a lot of them there's like they pop up all the time I get emails from them I get a fucking Instagram messages i I see them like hey I want to come on show motivate people my mom I'm really about motivating people like bro you're 22 the fuck are you motivating you ain't motivating shit you know go move to Nepal for a year yeah and it's also such a it's a tricky thing because like for even for myself it's like of course I want to motivate people I want to help people and yes but you can start drifting into that now I'm a motivational speaker yes I'm not being honest yeah communicating the full spectrum of the things that I'm dealing with and going through and like I'm only gonna focus on this positive things like I'll just do this this than this and you know you're gonna go to the right way and oftentimes because they don't have someone in their life like the way you were describing Jeana yeah someone is gonna hate fuckface so much you you have to have some of your life that's wrong with you that's real with you and for me it's my friends it's definitely my wife she doesn't bullshit me about anything yeah those those people are giant in your life you gotta have people that check you guys they have to know you too they have to know you you can't hide anything from them we haven't we have a lot of a lot of us tend to have these with the word be I don't know these people in our lives that like they're only there because you're doing something for them oh yeah like yeah but those people aren't pushing you there yes men yeah the Paras are this parasite thing they're not it's not a real relationship it's not a it's not a relationship you're gonna grow through that's a that's a relationships gonna make you feel good yes and in a lot of ways and it's fun and comfortable it's like but if you if that person can't get to the core of you yeah and really like when you tell me something I know it's truth because you have no other reason to just say bullshit right you don't owe me you don't need anything from yeah yeah that's giant for people you can't like this is one thing that I've seen many times of celebrities yeah when they go off the rails and they're you know they don't hang out with other people like them so they don't have real friends they have these employees and people were and it gets real sketchy and everyone that they talk to and interact with need something from them and they assume this position of authority where no one can question them like no one can call bullshit no one like you gotta have peers it's very important and you have if you don't the respect in the friendship of your peers like man you're adrift yeah you're not tethered you're out there in orbit just fucking floating around you're another dimension and ya not gonna get there too very easy yeah much much easier especially for successful people people start kissing your ass yeah Mick oh this is nice I don't need I don't need to deal with this bullshit I'm gonna have these people around me that make me feel good and say yes to me and bring me all the things that I want and give me no stress when I meet people I thought I'd go you should do jujitsu yeah go get choked go done and that's helped tell you the truth an important thing any anything physical yeah yeah is extremely I think vital for everyone I mean particularly kids coming up yeah putting kids into athletics and martial law yeah like and if you don't like martial arts look you can't fake a marathon yeah 26.2 needs to be run you need to go left foot right foot left foot right foot till you hit the fucking finish line period end of the gushin yeah if you don't do that you don't get there you can't fake it you can fake a lot of shit yeah there's a lot of shit you can fake but moving your body you know you can't really fake that you gotta do it yeah you know a 90-minute yoga class is 90 fucking minutes its hottest shit and you're in there sweating your balls off and you know you got to get to the end yeah you got to get to the end you know and it's just it's a small thing that's a small thing yeah you know life is a big thing but these small things that you can do they'll help you understand what's necessary to get through the big things yeah and there's there's it's all macro and micro it's all connected in some strange way yeah yeah I'm glad you talked about all this stuff man all of it from the beginning you know and then leading up to the the thing with your stepmom people you know people need to hear from God like you that looks like you know you're a cool cat got your shit together you know it it'd be it would have been very easy for me just to come on there and that's the bullshit about yeah I mean that kind of we can do that do though yeah we can definitely do that you know I it's important for me just to be honest with all the aspects of my life and to not start drifting into that just you know this surface you know this is who I am and you know image image mentality and you know I I'm very aware of not wanting to be there though and in trying to always express myself on the strap yeah yeah yeah the image thing's a trap it's not bad to look good but the this to concentrate on your image above truth and honesty it's a real trap you know and espares fighters fall into that category a lot because fighting is so fucking it's so perilous yeah don't know what the future holds you have no idea every time you train you could tear an ACL you really have no idea every day is and you're relying on your tissue to feed yourself right your tissue and your cells and and physical motion and action in order to that's what you do for a living it's it's so perilous there's so many things just so many things that could go wrong and and when you know you think about an actual fight itself I mean the anticipate like I think back to this past weekend with cowboy and Connor I'm looking at cowboy like the what the weight of the moment you know in his eyes you could see I'm warming up and he talked about there's this video that they played before the fight which he he goes through all of the nervousness of the experiences before he fights and he goes through all the faking it and smile and pretend and he's cool and meanwhile inside he's freaking the fuck out and all that stuff that adds to this need to make everything look great yeah yeah for sure yeah we we want to we want to be viewed as superhuman yeah yeah and we're none of us are no my favorite piece on that was Mike Tyson in his prime era Mike Tyson that documentary we talked about his mindset and walk into the ring now he's afraid yeah yeah I'm not losing yeah oh my god oh yeah once again sign and that's Rob's oh my god yeah that gives me fucking goosebumps every time yeah you know cuz he would just put himself into this state of mind mm-hmm you know custom model used to hypnotize him when he was 13 oh yeah oh yeah I didn't know about that till he was on the podcast I don't even know if he ever talked about it oh yeah but he was talking about how when he was a kid like this guy he went from being this really you know poor kid who was abandoned no love a constant crime and terrible poverty around him to all of a sudden he's getting all this love for doing this one thing for smashing people and he's found himself with one of the greatest boxing minds that's ever lived in custom otto who was explaining to him fear and motivation and all these different things and he's hypnotizing him so he's hypnotizing this thirteen-year-old kid to smash people and saying you don't exist only the tasks yeah and he's putting him into this mindset and so then when he gets into the ring he's just fuckin steamrolling people yeah like it was almost like a science project like custom otto found at the end of his rope right he's old man about to die he's been through great champions like Floyd Patterson and he trained all these great fighters and now he's got the greatest one he's ever seen but he's a dying man and this kid's 13 mm-hmm and this kid is just he was in 190 pounds and he's 13 Teddy Teddy Teddy Atlas said he would bring him to these smokers and no one would believe it yeah he would go how old's that they would go how's that kid he goes he's 13 he's like get the fuck out of here he's like okay how do you hold you think he is it was like 16 all right he's 16 put him in there was a 16 year old and he would smash some 16 year old he was just built insane he just had insane genetics and then on top of that he had the greatest mind ever when it comes to motivation and understanding you fear and boxing the guy who studied it his entire life and he's a hypnotist and he's hypnotizing this young thirteen-year-old kid to smash people and the results youngest-ever a heavyweight champion and one of the scariest fucking fighters in the history of sport there he is in the Catskills I mean that's also raised in isolation in the fucking Catskills up in the mountains yeah fuck what a story it's a goddamn movie yeah oh and then more than you think about like how amazing that was for him as an athlete but how detrimental that was to him yeah as a human being and all the things he's had to develop with so much later in life and like yeah you understand like why he was fucking nuts yes you know they don't expect these people to be normal when they're doing this thing why do we expect that right like you you you you you want these people to be these amazing athletes and these savages and these things but then when they're human beings on the outside oh well that's that's a piece of shit like you can't have it it's definitely I have it both ways well it's also human beings are so incredibly nuanced and when someone does a thing wrong we want their hole to be wrong everything who they are we want a 1 or a zero wheel on a black or a white and particularly when you're dealing people like fighters that are dealing with this insane amount of pressure and this incredible emotional rollercoaster right and then on top of that why did they become fighters in the first place almost all of them I mean let's say let's just be real generous that say 75% 75% of them came from a fucked up childhood there's 25% of them maybe they just really enjoy competition yeah but 75% came from a feeling of deficit seventy-five percent came from a fuck you I'm going to show you yeah they came from this thing and people that come from that thing they're not the most balanced folks yeah they're gonna make mistakes you know and compassion and understanding and and the ability to forgive there's a those are some of the most important aspects of community and friendship and of the human race we have to be able to be compassionate towards people that have experienced a different life than we have and we have to be able to forgive people when they fuck up and we can't just write them off and that's one of the weirder things about today with this whole cancel culture shit yeah like people just want to decide you know like based on a tweet someone said or so some things someone did that's it you're canceled forever get out you kill them death off of their head yeah it's almost like there's too many of us so we we just don't value it's almost like people in traffic we don't value each other because there's there's so many people that we just have a whelming abundance of human beings you can cancel somebody yeah you even think about them get rid of them who's next you know it's so much easier for us to be judgmental yeah have a voice and to say you're wrong I'm justified in the way I am because I've never done that so I'm a good person you're a person we don't look inside me like we're all fucked up will ya horrible things go to really awful things to each other and these people are in the spotlight so it's easy to point at them and make yourself feel better about the things that you haven't done ensure or justified in your actions but but like we're all fucked up and we all make mistakes and we all need some sympathy and love and we all need these things yeah we're all human humans need love we need sympathy we need the understanding and we need to be able to say I'm sorry and we need other people to be able to accept that we need to be able to communicate with each other and this also cancel culture I think is born out of social media because the most bizarre way to communicate ever a one-way like text message to the world yeah you know it's like that everybody's gonna see then everybody sees that you don't know right and then also people are sending these you know really disingenuous ones just hoping that people like them more because of the things they're saying which is like a sport now it's like let's see how many likes I can get oh I got ding ding ding then you feel just yes your opinion yes and then that becomes who you are I'm an activist but you're just complaining to the void it is screaming out into the world yeah that's you know we're living through strange times man well it's the canceled culture and I view it as the team culture of everything is what's I think one of the more detrimental things to our to humanity is you're out there on this side or that side and our sides right your sides wrong when most of us are somewhere in the middle yeah but we can't have an in the middle conversation because it's you're with them or you're with us yeah I want to know how people think if I disagree with them I like talking to people I disagree with well that's what I you know that's really a one thing I really love about your show is your ability to communicate with people even the ones that you obviously don't agree with but you're able to talk to them and to hear their points of view and not be like oh you're fucking idiot or like even if you're nuts like and talk to them and and that is something that is so missing today is our ability to communicate with people that don't agree with us like just because you have a different opinion than me doesn't mean we can't meet in the middle somewhere or learn from each other yeah or or you know a big thing for me coming up was we can learn from everyone even if it's what not to do yes that is so vital in Ino in everything but like for me and training was like now this person doesn't want the fuck they're doing but maybe one day I'm gonna face somebody like that so maybe I should kind of get a little grasp of their mentality and yeah that just applies to life's like maybe you don't agree with their thought process but it you can at least understand it and know what it is you do and don't like know what your beliefs are you got to take a step outside of your beliefs to understand if is that even what you believe or is it just the way you were raised in the way you grew up like do you really believe these things have you ever taken a step outside of them or or listen to somebody else's alternate perspective on what they believe in and have an open mind to it oh yeah I know that kind of makes sense a little bit it's hard because you don't get that many conversations with people where you disagree with them and it's not confrontational usually they're confrontational or you're confrontational so it always starts off on the bad foot I've I've learned how to do it from doing this podcast and one of the most surprising things about doing this podcast is I've learned how to talk to people better yeah I didn't think that was a thing I thought I just just was talking to people but then I realized somewhere along the way way not only people listening but sometimes I'm annoying okay how do i how do I do this where I'm less annoying and in learning how to do things that are less annoying I've become a more compassionate conversationalist I understand how to talk to people better and I've gotten its I apply it to my whole life now I've gotten better at it and I've see people who are bad at it it's so frustrating like I have some really smart friends and you know I talk to them and they just fucking interrupt each other and they interrupt you and they don't let anybody talk they're not listening they're just waiting for their time to talk and you know it's it's so strange they're not able to ever consider other people's opinions they think that everyone but them is wrong and it's you know it's basically like you know how it is when you see a YouTube video where people have no idea how to fight you see them fight you know that thing that is so crazy I've this day I'm like I've been doing martial arts my whole life I don't want to fight anybody but I see people fighting they have no idea how to find him I imagine myself if I was in a street fight with this guy I'm like this is I would be like why are you doing this man this is so crazy you don't know what you're doing hey yeah hey you're crazy you're gonna get killed you're lucky I'm nice but that's the same way with conversation there's a lot of people out there having conversations have no idea how to talk they don't they're not even really listening to you yeah they're just like why are you doing that why are you arguing you're you're in a conversation you don't even know how to have one yeah you're not listening you're just talking you're just using someone like a like a wall that you're throwing a fucking tennis ball off of it's bizarre yeah yeah yeah well you had you had a kitchen statement on this and then I think it was your last specialties like you have two idiots in a room it's the more confident one that they listen to yeah and it's that that concept of you just just say more words and you know have more in opinions in you don't have to think just be loud and make a lot of noise it's a game they're trying to like checkmate you yeah instead of like having a communication and conversation they're trying to like socially dominate you and this look I used to do it for sure yeah um I mean I think it's a learned thing you know you people do it to you and you go man I got fucking kicked my ass not conversation I get better at kicking people's ass and then you get better sort of bulldogging people or talking over them or talking loud or having these like these sentences that maybe you could pull out of your ass every now and then to shut people down it sounds good and it becomes a sport yeah instead of what it really should be which is sharing ideas and communicating with people like I mean if you're really into the sport of just debating people and shutting people down and insulting people okay that good for you but people don't like listening to that that much yeah well people like listening to for what I've bought from my experience is someone actually talking to someone someone actually expressing their thoughts and then the other person considering their thoughts and either agreeing or disagreeing but people are so happy when you could do that without real conflict yeah you know I've had some people on that I just five years ago I would have I would just said you fucking moron I would have screamed at them what are you talking about you're an idiot you go fuck yourself jump off a bridge but instead of doing that I'd be like okay why do you think that and tell me tell me what about this and then and here's what I think let me tell you what I think you tell me what you think yeah this level to do that in a nun like snarky wave yeah oh yeah you think that tell me more but but yeah like it's how you get the best out of people though that's how you understand who they really are and it's so valuable so value but for me it's just for me I know it's valuable for people that are listening but just for me as a human from my own education it's been everything yeah everything I've learned more from talking to people on this podcast both from talking to scholars and scientists and and really intelligent people and morons yeah you know I've learned a lot from talking to morons just just the awkwardness in the way they process thoughts and the way they view the world and the way they've chosen to communicate that you learn from that just like you're saying like sparring with someone who like doing has terrible habits yeah oh look at this guy what the fuck are you doing that yeah but you learn you can learn from people you know well I think that's something that that really separates you from a lot of people I mean like yeah their shows are people are very opinionated and loud and you know people like that and that kind of thing but your ability to communicate and to bring out conversation regardless of what the subject matter is makes it very intriguing and you can learn a lot from regardless of who the guest is like you learned so much from these people because of the way you're able to communicate with them the way you're able to bring out conversation and get in depth with all of these subjects well I'm genuinely curious about most things and I'm genuinely curious about the way I think like why do I think that way so if someone thinks different than me I'm genuinely curious like why do you think there's an instinct to go now you're fucking wrong I'm right but I just go oh I know what that is that's trick don't do that it's that's dumb don't think that way just try to find out this is not a game it's not contest yeah find out why this person thinks this way mm-hm and it's better for everybody yeah but it's just a lost talent like a lot of people do and I didn't even know it was a thing till I started doing podcasts it just took me a while like podcasts or like anything else for me at least as I'm doing it I'm trying to get better at it and I realized I used to not be as good like I can't I never listen to my podcast but if I did listen to like the old ones from the beginning I probably look fucking terrible Jesus Christ you know plus most of them I was high out of my fucking mind I don't know half what I was talking about while I was saying it I was ruining conversations left and right but these conversations for me are like it's like going to school it's like every day I'm going school about humans you know going to school about whatever the subject they're talking to me about but also going to school about how you know the more people you talk to especially like this no cell phones we're wearing headphones and there's one of the reasons I like headphones is cuz your voice is in my ear yeah you're not over there you're right here man you're we're locked in and this is exactly the same way that other people are gonna hear it which is a very unusual way to hear a conversation yeah you don't think about it that way but most the time when you hear a conversation your voice is louder because it's closer and they're over there yeah yeah and you're talking to each other and you know maybe you check your phone or maybe you're distracted by other noises but when you were in headphones you don't hear anything else yeah so you're locked in and when when else would you and I and we're friends I've known you for years when we'll be able to sit down with this yeah for hours now just across from each other in each other's eyes just talking yeah yeah I never thought about that with the headphones big yeah that's interesting it keeps you from talking over each other too much - because conversations are improvisational right you know you have a dance partner you know one step on each other's toes but you do it casually it's just so you get better at it and it's for more than two people it's mandatory like when you have three or four people on a podcast you cannot do it without headphones or it's just talking over each other like I learned that doing those fight companions oh yeah cuz everyone's drunk and then they have the headphones on it's sort of at least calms some of the over talk you know yeah that makes sense yeah it's uh it's a journey man like everything else you know like everything else it's a journey if doing it right your relationships being a parent being a comedian being a fighter being a doctor I'm sure you if you're concentrating on it you get better at it yeah I'm sure yeah I think I think just the understanding of it's a constant balancing at it's a constant development the sooner you come to terms and understand that the better off you're gonna be but yet we get locked into these ways of thinking these ways of living and so your did that wait till you die and a lot of people are and to constantly be questioning yourself and to be searching I feel like I'm a seeker I'm seeking different ways to do things different ways to think different perspectives on situations but particularly ones that might be like stuck on like this is the way I think this is what I believe like I want to explore what my beliefs and feelings and viewpoints are on everything yeah I think that is how you gain a better understanding of what this thing is what this thing we're experiencing is you know what nobody knows what the hell it is know what it is yeah I just got you know there's some scientists that are they they're trying to they've written a book about it but they're trying to come on the podcast to lay out all of the reasons why this is a simulation yeah and I'm going over some of their work and I'm like this is fucking so crazy yeah cuz if if they're right like what are we doing yeah we're playing a video game yeah if they're right yeah and then there's the thought that maybe that is what life is period and that this idea of like oh one day we're going to create an artificial environment that we exist in that's going to be indistinguishable from the real world that we existed now maybe it's always that yeah maybe it's been that from the beginning and evolution is actually a part of this long game mm-hmm and that this cycling of life and life and death and all these things is just a part of this insane long progressive game yeah yeah great and lined up and I'm going to think about it and you know who can say that that's not the case yeah no nobody nobody can no you can't you can't and the more you think about it you might like check out reality to a degree so it's it's a scary thing I'm also genuinely curious as to other people's perspectives like they're sometimes I you know I love reading people's takes on current events takes on people and takes on like movies and music and all because I I've disagreed with so many of them and I know like what how is this person viewing the world like I would like to be them for a short period of time if I knew for a fact I can come back and be me again yeah I want to see what are you seeing like how do you are you in pain all the time like are you just what why are you mad at stuff I get like what is it you know like is it an emotional thing or is your mind just wired different look we're all assuming right that water tastes the same to use it does to me and that like the sunshine feels everybody knows sunshine feels good but does it feel the same I don't know what your sunshine feels like right yeah you know I think about that a lot one thought I have is like this is white we both say it's white but maybe this looks completely different to you yeah this white looks yellow yellow yeah we call it the same right because we're we agree and that's like so much of reality is just something we all agree upon until we don't until we change our minds but there's so many people that see and feel and think very different things and we look at them as crazy because the majority of us say that's not the way we see or sure but all anything is is an agreeance upon what this thing is and is that is that what makes things real that we agree that it's real well we think about other things that people have tastes for like food for example there's people that enjoy certain flavors like spicy foods for example and there's other people that fucking hate it my wife's mom she can't have anything with an e pepper or anything anything even remotely Hodge oh it's too hot yeah no everything's too hot yeah and I can't make these hot enough I'm pouring hot sauce on everything like what is she feeling like what is it like I wonder if she had my taste buds like what is it what am i experiencing different than her what you know what people that love certain kinds of music there's people I've tried so hard like jazz because it seems like a cool thing like like it seems like you you must be a cool guy if you like jazz yeah like my good friend Alonzo Bodden hilarious comedian loves jazz goes on jazz cruises does stand-up on these cruises I try man I try listen to it I get some of its kind of cool but if I choose between jazz and other music might get the fuck out if it's one music that I could just wipe off the face the planet I don't know probably be like dumb country songs but outside of dumb country songs I just I don't know what they're experiencing like what is it about it that's resonating why does some people go bonkers for some movies and other people think they suck yeah like what is it yeah one thing that always trips me out is I think about like people with you as lunatics and like what if they are seeing reality and we have blinders on you know because when you take into account what a finite percentage of what's really out there that we're able to see without perception and you know if compared to like x-rays and gamma-rays and all of these things like we have such a tiny filter on everything that's really going on out there yeah we don't really see we don't see shit compared to what's really there and like maybe these whacked-out people are just seeing more of what's happening and that's what makes them nuts because they're like not seeing all these demons flying around and all these colors and like we just have we have a filter on that so we can like process information we're like and it keeps us sane but that's I mean what's really going on out there but you think about how small amount of acid you need to take to completely perturb the way you view the world yeah you know I think McKenna described this Terence Mckenna disc acid that the potency of acid is like it's literally like full in terms of like the amount that you need in order to have an effect he made it an analogy like an ant deconstructing the entire Empire State Building in a matter of seconds mmm like that's how potent it is in terms of volume you don't need a couple drops of acid in a huge human body and you're tripping balls for seven hours yeah you know that's a chemical disruption of this very delicate ecosystem mmm so if your neuro chemistry is off in any way up or down sideways screwy you got too much of this or too much of that yeah which we know is the case with everything right like some people are born with bad eyesight some people are born deaf some people are born and they have problems processing pain they don't feel pain correctly some people are born and they must have an imbalance of the chemicals that are floating around inside your head yeah and their view of the world is radically different than ours yeah and also those chemicals can shift depending on for your personal experience like life abuse children that are abused their chemicals in their head as they're developing are off they're different their brains are different they process life different because of abuse people that have experienced extremes trauma extreme violence when they're young PTSD they're processing things differently the people that have-not yeah what's even crazier about that as I read a book called it didn't start with you and it talks about how these things are passed on generationally from like trauma your grandparents head is passed on to you through your DNA and it and it and it changes us like how much is passed on to us that we have no control over then alters our the way we feel things we see things all of these [Music] experiences that people have that just get passed passed down like that without any outside influence just just through that process of being do you have any children no when you have children you see it in a really weird way like my middle daughter my 11 year old is an obsessive yeah like she she's a obsesses on things and tries to get better on them or you gotta try to tell her hey time to go to bed she's doing like backflips in her room and shit like stop stop go to bed like you got to go to bed but that's me yeah and I always thought it was fucked up I was like I thought I was doing this and I probably was my whole life to try to show that I had value because I felt like I was ignored and I didn't know my dad and I always felt like an outsider and a loser and I always felt like I would become I would throw myself into things to show that I had value and I would get really good at things to show that I had value and that would be this obsession was like me trying like trying to escape the existential angst of my existence and just the the constant anxiety and this just feeling of just inadequacy trying to escape it by being obsessed with things but also trying to prove through getting good at things that I have value because the first time I ever felt like I was worth anything it was when I started getting good at martial arts like and then people started respecting me I was like oh I have a thing that people think I'm good at know that I'm good at this thing that became my identity and everybody just threw myself into that but my daughter's growing up with none of that like she's all loved and she's all smiling and happy and she's not depressed she gets a lot of hugs and she has friends but she's a fucking psycho and I'm like oh you got that for me like you got my crazy gene but you got it without all the fucked-up parts right like you're not sad you got it without the sad thing you just want to get good at stuff without like a happiness to it and also a feminine happiness to it instead of a masculine like I just wanted to smash yeah that's all I wanted to do I just want to smash things because I was angry she's not angry so it's weird to see this obsessive like completely obsessive behavior in terms of like trying to get better at things and she accelerates it she excels at so many different things that she gets good at yeah she gets good at things and they become her whole life like all day long obsessive like it's really weird but in a happy way and it's so it's it's strange genetically yeah you know and you know you've met my dog Marshall the fucking nicest dog in the world right he's so nice no that's a genetic thing that dog is a golden retriever and when he like when you come over to him and he starts whining is so happy and he wants to get pat and he runs and grabs a toy always he always wants to bring you something okay I didn't teach him that yeah I've got him for three years I've had him since he was a little tiny baby who's like six weeks old when I got him never had a rough day in his life every day's been fun but he's learned through his DNA that he's supposed to retrieve things and bring them over and that you are happier when he brings things over because that's the DNA that's in his system it's not he didn't learn it yeah this is literally inside of him from the box like right out of the box look at the ingredients oh he likes to bring you things yeah because his ancestors brought you things his ancestors brought other people things and they were rewarded for and they said oh they give me treats and they like me more when I bring things so I'm gonna just keep when you you know you shoot a duck out of the sky and they get that duck and bring it over and everybody gets happy so it's in him yeah it's great yeah I don't think we understand what what DNA actually is or whatever fuck you dude DNA is just a name right whether the components of the life-form that are passed when two life-forms breed and they make another one I don't think we really understand it I think we we have a rudimentary understanding of the chemistry involved but in terms of like personality and in terms of like the the thoughts that are in our heads like I was reading something by Rupert Sheldrake he was talking about why children are afraid of monsters he's like children that grow up in the city or afraid of monsters they're not afraid of like gunshots and car accidents things that are really scary and they're afraid of monsters because our ancient ancestors were eaten by cats yeah they were eaten and by wolves and those kind of things so we're afraid of fangs things in the dark when you can't see them coming you can't protect yourself yeah crazy crazy it's in there it's in the DNA yeah I mean there's so much of there's so much stuff like that that just we don't understand anything have you ever met someone that has like a legit phobia like a video phobia or arachnophobia like fear of snakes or spiders I know that I have I'm trying to think who that was but yeah it's like where did that come from its DNA Mel guarantee I've seen it on Fear Factor we had a few people that had a legit fear of snakes and spiders they're like oh my god oh my god you see their whole body was shaking and they were trying like hey this I'm even fucking poisonous yeah these are just snakes but there's something about snakes like someone they love or there is someone in their ancestry or some someone survived a snake attack something yeah there's something yeah well I can like so much of that is realizing how little like control we have over everything like how we raise our children or how we interact with people and like what does and doesn't affect us and like the fact that any of this works in any remote ways is insanity yeah like it doesn't make any sense we think it makes sense because it's normal to us but it would really take a step back and like think about it like this is nuts ever thoughts this life is nuts and you know like sitting here with yous nuts a year and talking about life like like some of the people you've met through this and like you're like how did I get here like what is this like I feel that way too fuck is going on what did I do to get here like this is weird what did I do to get here yeah I think I really believe in some strange way that this thing made me do this yeah that this podcast like almost like the universe made me do this yeah and it sounds like so pretentious but I'm just being honest I feel like almost like this thing has a life of its own and a mind of its own they tricked me yeah it tricked me and and it played on my obsessive mind to just keep doing it to keep doing it maybe you get better at this hey keep doing it bringing on other people keep doing it keep doing it and through this untold millions of people been exposed yeah tell us differently we've had three a billion downloads over the course of ten years so I don't know how many people that is yeah how many individuals but it's a fuckload so all of these different people have come on and expressed all these different ideas and so many different people are hearing them in their earbuds whether in traffic or when they're at the gym and all these ideas percolate inside people's brains and that it gives them different perspectives and then it makes them maybe explore things maybe I'm gonna try jiu-jitsu maybe I'm gonna try yoga maybe I'm gonna try eating better maybe on I try doing this and through all that you see a shift in the culture of the human beings there that have been in that have been affected by all these people's conversations yeah and for me it feels like I just I'm getting sucked into being here yeah like I'm like okay and then also like me getting better at it it's just me it's like it showing me how to extract better information and get out of my fucking way don't ruin it and make it better for the people that are listening yes really what it feels like that's a note so crazy even saying that sounds like hippy bullshit well and you think about like why are we attracted to certain things certain people certain sometimes retracted to people that des and make any fucking sense be like everything you do and say and make me feel it's like everything opposite of what I really want and but but I'm attracted you and think these yeah like like bring a certain thing out of me yeah develop me in a certain way where nobody else could do that like you this person does that for me for some reason or this action this sport this thing like why am i drawn right right right I shouldn't be like it's fucking horrible and like it hurts and like all these things that doesn't make any sense at all but nothing makes any sense at all like it doesn't make any sense in like that I think that's why it's so vital to follow your heart and follow the things you feel because everything else like knows what the fuck is going on like nobody can tell you what you should do should do to be successful or to be happy or to be all these things like you got it listen to what's inside of you yeah it means you could be wrong you could listen to what insight inside of you and you could be wrong but you have to learn how to like decipher that voice better yeah like I've been wrong about things that I thought I wanted and then you go okay this is why I was wrong I was delusional or I was kidding myself fixated on yeah hmm yeah or I was thinking that this thing was gonna bring me some sort of peace so he's gonna bring me some sort of some sort of just normalcy yeah you know and then it doesn't happen so you're all right well because there is no normalcy nothing is normal everything's crazy we're all nuts yeah nobody knows what's going on all those things that should be a t-shirt yeah nothing is normal everything is crazy no one knows what's going on at all the sooner we realize that the better would be like we're all in the loony Moon yeah yeah it will definitely be easier that's why I'm I'm always scared of drugs that make people confident my favorite drugs marijuana because it does the opposite of making me confident mm-hm it makes me paranoid it makes me it makes me compassionate and it makes me also like : jeez this is crazy yeah like that's why I like it yeah I like it because I think the drugs that make you kooky we should all be a little less confident yeah you know we need each other a lot more than we like to pretend and this life is like this temporary thing that we're going through we have a certain amount of heartbeats and then who knows yeah the lights go out and hopefully go to a better place but yeah well I think the thing it does - is it strips that that veil away like that veil of feeling like everything's in balance and normal and you know life is like this is life like life is fucking weird man we're super weird super we distract ourselves with normalcy and habits but take a step back and like this is nuts this is all nuts and we pretend like it's normal and it's cool and everyone's like in agreeance that like we all know what's going on no fuck's going on we're all living in a spaceship flying through the atmosphere yeah we're all tripping balls over here we're just all doing it so it feels normal but we can find some moments of comfort and happiness in the chaos and that's what we're we're all seeking yeah you know we're all seeking these moments of comfort and happiness and camaraderie and and friendship you know we're all seeking love - we're all seeking the good feelings yeah but you got to get through the shitty ones to even appreciate the good feelings it's a catch-22 yeah yeah but just understand that you need any good in the bad no you don't know what good is unless you have bad yeah it has to be that way so we're getting towards 3 o'clock here we're almost gonna wrap this thing up um what are you doing now in terms of your career you're still fighting for Bellator yeah yes torchic boxing which very I'm very thankful that they have that still yeah yeah I'm you know I'm a gigantic fan of kickboxing in Muay Thai and it's always perplexed me why it hasn't caught hold in America more than it has yeah which is something we could talk about for hours yeah I'm very thankful that paramount network is still invested yeah huge shout-out to Scott Coker Scott Coker amazing shadow shot there is and they got that big fight this weekend with Julie bud and cyborg which is cool but yeah I'm still fighting for them I don't have anything on the books right now I'm waiting like I always have been since the beginning of time you know something you think is gonna change like eventually I'm gonna have all these fights lined up in like I've never known when the next one is and certainly not when the next one is after that but yeah I'm hoping something will come up and you know as far as how long I'm gonna keep doing this I don't know man I could be done today maybe I'll decide I don't fucking do this shit anymore but um I think I've always had a healthy understanding of that like fighting is what I do and I will always be a fighter but this isn't it for me like I have so many things that I do in my life you know I'm I'm a writer like I said I'm working on my autobiography right now I've written two books so far I'm an artist I paint I draw play a piano a little bit I speak you know I'm a Renaissance man do you think you'll be more invested in art you're done I don't know you know I think I'll definitely have more time to do it you know as far as how much I'll do it as a career I don't know you know what from me art has always been something that I do it because I love to do it if it starts becoming a job where it's like you need to do this or you need to do that I think that would make me lose a lot of love for it yeah you know those things yeah so but I think you can get through that without it becoming a job I think that's a perspective cuz the end of the day it's still art yes like just because you have to do it for a job like like what does that mean just do it yeah you know I mean like if you think oh I have to do art now now it's a job it's like you know the expression marrying your mistress well I think you can just do art yeah you know you just be obsessed with it like you are if it's not a job yeah and then the other parts just sort of take care of itself yeah well I like everything I do I feel is artistic expressions you know my fighting my actual are sure my writings and those kinds of things but I don't think I'll ever be like have be stuck on a job or one thing you know because there's I'm just too interested in too many different things you know I think I'll always be balancing many different aspects and certain times I'll be more focused on one thing like my fighting obviously that's a very finite timeline on that but once that's done you know that's going to shift and I think it will always be that way to one extent or another I'll be always be doing a multitude of things and exploring and developing and learning and yeah like I said I'm a seeker I love it when you're done and you want to do something else come back in here talk to us and tell us what's up I would love to man this has been really great my pleasure brother always I appreciate you man thank you now if you have an R or ladies and gentlemen thank you goodbye that was great thank you [Music]
