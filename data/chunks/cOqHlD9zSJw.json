so I might plug some dates early do it do it and we're live Jud how are you buddy yeah judd apatow here dude you know Sussman real well not only do I know your manager Sussman chess husband when I was a kid I loved comedy so I got a job at the Eastside comedy club that would dress in Huntington on Long Island this is about 83 84 he was the bartender and he used to give me rides home because I lived really far away and I used to take a cab home and spend all the money I made as a dishwasher on the cab ride home Wow but I just wanted to be in the club near comics Eddie Murphy was coming in it was crazy and I swear to god this is no BS you have those people in your life that you remember who were insanely kind and cool and Jeff Sussman was like that as a young kid I was maybe 15 or 16 I thought this is the greatest guy of everybody so nice to me it gives me a ride home he's funny and I'm so glad that he's rich now he's been my manager since I was an open-mic ER yeah he discovered me as an open mic ER in Boston who were his first clients Bob Nelson yeah Bob Nelson at the Eastside comedy club nothing funnier he used to do a show once a week and one of the things he did is he would just turn on the radio and scan through the channels and do improv based on what was on the radio so for those elevated music he would do a dentist routine if it was heavy metal he would suddenly do like a heavy metal guy and it was incredible yeah that guy was huge at one point in time and then I think he blew a fuse or something I think he's a very religious person now and he still performs in Branson it's a nice way of saying he blew a fuse because I did depends on your view of things I guess maybe he's happier than all of us maybe highly unlikely yeah but maybe but God was he funny I mean truly as funny as people get and then he built a thing on stage you have to imagine this like a wall on the stage and in the wall he built two doors and he would do all these bits where he would come in and out of doors as different people yeah and then he did anything where he would like come out of the door like run out of one door across the stage and in the other door and then run out the that door again as a different person so it looked like he was chasing himself like it would have a gorilla chasing Bob but he would just change his body language as he ran in and out of these doors it was really creative no one has ever really done stuff like that since even well something happened somewhere along the line where carrot-top owns props they don't no one does props anymore remember when we first starting out there was a prop comic Sandra it was Dennis Miller used to do props when he started I heard that he used to put his lips through a 45 record and I forgot what the bitless and I I threw a couple of props first few times I went on stage I remember bringing a light and putting it to my finger to make my finger look like et's finger I can't quite remember what the bit was but that's how little material I had isn't it funny though that that genres just sort of dissolved and it is funny as hell I would to see carrot top in Vegas I mean it's a ridiculous show I laughed my ass off I brought my whole family we really laughed hard I mean that is a funny Chandra of just ridiculous stupid prop jokes yeah carrot top gets way more shit than he deserves he's very funny oh no he's very creatively funny I mean I've always for the silly guys you know I love you know of the smart people and the inventive people but this silly guy is also pretty great and it's hard to write super silly jokes that make people laugh out loud like there's comedians were funny and you're like oh that's funny then there are people who actually make you piss your pants yeah and the one thing that ketchup did that made me laugh was he's Reds rather crowded somebody's like giving the crowd shots he's handing out cups and really fast pouring shots and they're spilling on people if he's reading around giving people shots and and then he like turned to some ladies like oh okay give it to you you're pregnant but she clearly wasn't pregnant belike and it got really awkward oh no that's always the best when you make that mistake are you allowed to just give people shots like what if you have an alcoholic but they're just there they're sober but you are like so influential they go off fuck it one drinks not gonna hurt and then boom you just throw their life off-track carrot-top wanted it to happen yeah you got to be careful with that no uh I certainly am NOT pouring booze for the crowd but I appreciated it as someone observing carrot top I appreciate that too but I would think as a performer you'd have to be really concerned I know too many people that you give one shot they're dead they found they're dug Stampler from house of cards maybe Carrot Top is getting pre-show releases there could be a whole system it could be enough up of how he knows who to give the shot stick yeah he survives in Vegas too that does there's not a whole lot of people that do that anymore yeah there's like Penn and Teller and yeah they've been there forever right but their shows a magic show right and then there used to be like a lot of residence yeah they were doing stand-up George Wallace Rita Rudner George George Wallace quit doing that right yeah he didn't a low time and he had enough at something he explained to me how hard it is like you have to you have to fill that room like every night villain rooms let me say as someone who makes movies and is terrified that people will show up fill in rooms scares me as well like we have a movie the big sick it opens in New York in LA this weekend and then in two weeks it opens around the country it's a command on Gianni Holly Hunter Dre Romano based on an experience that happened to command on Johnny when he met his wife and he was he's from Pakistan and his parents wanted him to have a an arranged marriage but he fell in love with an American woman and then she quickly got sick and had to be put into a coma and it's this really hilarious fascinating true story about him hanging out with her parents while she's in a coma is this a very unique story but it works great it's like 98 percent on Rotten Tomatoes it's like one of those gem movies that comes around every like four or five years what's it called it's called the big sick and so like right now I'm terrified you know will people go will you get off your ass for a great hilarious movie to go to a theater it's the same thing with a stand-up you know now that I'm doing some concerts I do like track like how they're selling it's a scary thing that they go yeah don't worry about this Cydia they always sell late and then you look at your numbers for months and no one bought tickets then like in the last two weeks they sell out or do you just not tuned in at all I try to tune in to as little as I possibly can yeah other than like doing the jokes themselves doing the shows themselves you know family hobbies yes I don't tune in anymore I just feel like there's no reason to have fuck you money if you don't say fuck you so I'm supposed to be saying fuck you right now yeah but not really saying fuck you just there's things to think about and there's things to not think about like there's like the things that like you don't have really any control over yes like whether or not people buy tickets yeah you're fucking hilarious yeah good job Apatow what are you worried about man my super successful you've done some of the greatest movies of all time but the things that always drive me is the terror of things that working out you know that's what keeps me on my game is is to be scared that's why I'm gonna tell your crowd right now that's good because that's one of the reasons why you're still good but just let me help you out dude you've you have some of the greatest comedy movies ever just chill out no I can't chill out Joe I can't chill out the climate to tell people I'd be at the Columbus theater in Providence Rhode Island July 25th uh early with the plot yeah and then Richfield Playhouse on July 23rd in Ridgefield Connecticut then I'm at the the Wilbur in Boston that's one of the great the best place right the great place you have a website where people can read all these because they're not going to remember they're probably their car right now they're like fucking the Wilburn Boston July 24 the Wilbur calm I don't know see this how about your website yeah I want a website I've got nothing you don't have a website I don't my supposed to I thought websites my kids make fun of me if I even talk about the web like if I say like kids yeah let's find out on the on the World Wide Web like dad no one calls it the World Wide Web anymore my daughter yelled at me the other day she said dad no one emails don't email me text me hmm and she acted like I was talking about ham radio yeah you might want to tell your kid to shut the fuck up exactly ridiculous well I don't want to email email everyday what he talked about I guess the kids don't the kids don't have attachments I think that they don't need it because there's no attachments my kid never has a PDF to send that's true and they don't spell your they don't care every kid spells you are every fucker there it's like their yeah and what how old are your kids I have a 20 I have a nine and a seven girls oh yeah mole girls I'm 19 and 14 old girls chaos chaos and gang up on me and the teen years are rough they're rough they turn on you a little bit genetically I think they're supposed to like push for their freedom and turn on you for well I also think they're so confused there's so many hormones raging through their system that didn't exist it's like they're a new person like if you if you stop to think about how you are when you're 11 and then how you are when you're 15 it's only four years later and you're a totally different human yes I tell them that I say you're acting hormonal right now can you please stop they can't help but we talk about the chemicals I have this book it's called yes your teen is crazy and then whenever they give me a hard time I just take it out and just reading it in front of them but it is all about how their brain isn't even cooked yet right your brain isn't really cooked till your early 20s yeah and your impulse control and everything is gone and that what you're supposed to do as a parent is model sane behavior and if they if they see you not lose your shit thousands of times maybe that will program them to handle problems well hmm but they are going to freak out a ton and you shouldn't get that mad out of them at them because they're not capable of not freaking out but that is a hard advice yeah it's hard advice and when you get down to the youngest one like my my youngest is seven yeah and I'm like don't you have your shit together yet come on everybody else is older than you let's go let's go so they don't get a full shot but the younger kid always thinks they're allowed to do what the older kids do it gets scarier as as you have more kids right because they go well my older sister does that so aren't I allowed to do that now and you're like no you're seven yeah uh yeah it's it's a really weird time I think especially in California you know marijuana is basically legal it's a it's a difficult debate to have with kids yeah when it is legal you can't even pull out that it's a legal card right I'm not worried about marijuana at what age though would you not worry about marijuana I'm not worried about it at any age if you're seven year olds like you know what someone hands on a tab laughs absolutely don't want my seven year old or my nine year old to be smoking pot but I'm not worried about pot I'm working about alcohol yes I'm worried about alcohol and I'm worried about driving I'm worried about like teens drinking and driving that's that that freaks me out like her being with her friends as they go to high school and that that freaks me out because kids just don't know what their tolerances are they don't understand the effects of alcohol on the the body and your ability to react that's all cause it's all about uber got the lift and that is one thing I noticed that all the kids are there seems to be a lot less drunk driving because they all just uber oh it's amazing if you can afford it but if you can't afford it I guess you're still screwed yeah you are screwed if you can't afford it but it's pretty reasonable if you're just moving around a general area like if you're hopping around West Hollywood and going from the store The Improv like people do it all the time it's a couple bucks it's not that big a deal and it's like it saves you all the worry and hassle of being a drunk are you a neurotic dad or a calm dad I try to be as calm as I can yeah you know it's a certain amount of neurotic that seeks in seeps in every now and then but I try to be really calm yeah yeah no don't you know the thing is just everybody does it everybody grows up just have it have it be fun much as possible I have a friend an older gentleman who's had a bunch of kids he's always he's always says to me you know you gotta let him go through it you know they're gonna good they're gonna do the drugs it's fine they get through it they figure it out you know you got they're gonna have sex you can't stop it you're gonna let him go through it though they'll figure is your friend a dude from The Big Lebowski it's a it's literally a John Goodman I saw the dude was uh what's his face not John Goodman the other guy what's his name me Jeff uh God fuck Oh Jeff Bridges Jeff Bridges yeah he's a dude yo he's they dude yeah in the movie right yeah I saw the other day I haven't seen in years I was fuckin crying laughing it's a good they used to be my movie my litmus test for whether or not I could talk to you like how do you feel about the Big Lebowski shit I gotta go yes we did an episode of freaks and geeks where he shows John Daly's character Sam where shows a girl the jerk and she hates it and he breaks up with the cheerleader at school the jerk good for him I had with a girl in high school where she hated et and I was a rough underwear it rough fun to survive back then you have a certain music and there's certain movies you're just not allowed to like or hate yes yeah well that's a funny thing with my wife and I is we violently disagree on a lot of that stuff we don't have like one or two violently yeah there's there's one or two like the main things that mean the most to me in the world where my wife's like I can't I can't I don't like it at all and then stuff that she likes it I hate that more than anything I think that's good I think it's good especially with your spouse to have like very few interests in common and I think all those people that do everything together a fucking weirdos man they always freak me out that that is interesting yet because it's a it's like stand up my wife I met her when I wasn't doing standing I did stand up from the time I was 17 till I was 24 I met my wife when I was 28 or 29 so she didn't know anything about stand up till three years ago when I started doing it again yeah well it would cost you to do that I remember when you started coming around ever his like look at Judd I was doing it's funny I I I when I stopped when I was 24 I was pretty burnt out so that was 92 and I was getting a lot of writing work the Ben Stiller show got picked up this sketch show we did for Fox and that kept me busy and I was making you know a lot of money compared to the $500 a week I was making doing stand-up on the road and I thought well this is the universe saying you don't need to do stand-up and you should stop maybe your friends are funnier than you and I'm living with you know Sandler and I'm hanging out with opening up for Jim Carrey and it's it's daunting you know it's like trying to start a band and your friend is John Lennon I just feel like a dick and it would be weird to not feel like a dick he like I was cocky with Jim Carrey you know yeah I'm funnier than this guy I mean I'm a sane human being I know I know what's happening um and I was also a little bored of it because I was so obsessed since I since I was 10 and you know I did funny people I did a little stand-up to write jokes for funny people so I was writing jokes but it was for Adams character and then I started hanging out with Amy Schumer working on trainwreck and she would come back from these tours and I just got jealous I thought that sounds like the most fun thing and then one night I said to her I'm gonna go up tonight just to make you laugh just to show you can see what it was like when I did stand-up and then I told a couple of stories I had told on talk shows that I knew would go OK and Amy was very excited hoping I was gonna bomb like she was thought this would be this funny thing Jud bombs at the Comedy Cellar and I did pretty good just cuz it's stories I know work ok and then the comedy started I said hey any time you want to come back just pop in we'll put you up now no one ever said that when I was a comic because it was hard to get stage time and I thought wait a second I'm getting treated like somebody who who gets to show up and go on stage I have to take advantage of this and I went on every night the entire shoot a trainwreck no matter what time we finished shooting I would drive straight to the Comedy Cellar Wow and I had the best time and then I came back to LA and started doing the improv and the Comedy Store in Largo and and then I would put these benefits together at Largo once a month and and to me that was the most fun because I could book a show and get like Shandling to come and Randy Newman or you know Aziz and Fiona Apple and we did a malls benefits and I always liked producing things like that and then slowly my act got to the point where I thought I'm you know I deserve to be here this isn't some freak show well you know the difference between someone who writes for television movies and and the difference between that and a lot of stand-ups is when you're making a living writing and producing and directing and doing your discipline you're right yes actually right you have notes you have books you have you're opening up your binder you're coming over your stuff so many comics don't do that I remember when I started I was opening for Larry Miller what are the legendary oh yeah a medians and he he would have these incredible but some of them were like 10 minutes long he had a great bit about about drinking it's one of the best standard bits of all time and he had a bit about Thanksgiving and a skiing band they were all like 10 minutes and they would get funnier and funnier and one day he said to me you know this is a job you got to sit down every day write jokes you don't just go to the mall and watch a movie every day like if you sat down for two hours at a desk and treated this like it was a job that deserved your respect you'll be a hundred times better than everybody else yeah and I didn't listen to his advice at the time but I do now like now I sit down alright let's try to write it up yeah yeah I show up with like notes you like one of the rare guys at the Comedy Store you'll show up with notes exactly I know nobody has notes if it has like a little like a business card with three bullet points on it and I'm a little more of the you know the Shandling tons and tons of paper till you're drowning and Confused Shandling you know that's a sad one man well fun dude that was oh the best and I'm doing a documentary about him yeah for HBO and so the most fun part about it is he always went to the comedy magic club and did stand-up even in ear is where you didn't know he was doing it that's where I met him at the comedy magic club then I was I was great yeah he's just I mean it was like for me I was a huge fan of Larry Sanders show and Larry Sanders show that's what Paul Sims got to start yes the producer of news radio and so when I you know when I saw him was like it was one of those ones like oh wow so that's actually Garry Shandling right there right there were Judd Apatow right there a weird one and he and you do the comedy magical they tape every show since the 80s have every show taped yeah and I said can you give me the last 50 sets that Garry did at the comedy magic club and this is you know from the last few years and no one's ever seen any of these jokes except the people at those shows he didn't do them on TV he didn't do them on talk shows there was no special some of the funniest jokes you've ever heard just him you know working on the craft how about going around being so funny yeah but he did a lot of notes he was a his discipline guy he was well in the 70s he wrote so many jokes I found these binders hundreds and hundreds of jokes in every loose leaf binder like a guy sitting at a desk all day just crafting like two sentence perfect jokes yeah but there's like the balance right there's that there's crafting the perfect jokes and then there's just being able to be loose yeah and fun and hilarious well you also used to go on stage with just a set up and he wouldn't know the punchline and he would say the setup and hope the punchline came which was pretty wild he you know one of the one of the great things about doing a documentary get to ask people for footage so Seinfeld gave me the dailies for comedians in cars getting coffee when he interviewed Gary and then the people who made the movie comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the dailies of a sequence that they only use ten seconds of in the documentary which was Jerry and Jerry going to the comedy magic club and doing sets and also there that night is Nealon and Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes it's all their performances and then their entire conversation for three hours hanging out backstage and it is unbelievable the conversation how funny it is and there's a moment where Chris Rock is doing the joke about how Nelson Mandela got divorced that even Nelson Mandela after decades of being in prison he could survive that but he couldn't survive getting out and being buried it's divorced immediately I forgot how he worded it but there's a shot of Shandling alone in a green room watching rock do this bit and as he's doing it Gary's like saying what he what he's like he's guessing what the bit is as rock saying it but in awe of Chris Rock and it's it's a really beautiful and that's what the best part of doing this documentary is is just finding little magical moments that no one would ever see if you didn't dig deep what made you decide to do this we did a memorial for Gary when he died at the Wilshire Ebell theatre like a thousand people showed up and I made about five mini documentaries about Gary to show in between the speakers and I thought oh this is a documentary I should just expand this and now it's like now it's like the OJ doc of Gary it's a big long epic documentary I think people don't realize how good the Larry Sanders show was yeah like people forgot you know if you go back and watch it again that was a revolutionary show and it was on the air it really was so people don't go backwards like my kids don't go backwards digging that far like to them you know looking backwards means I'll watch all of Parks and Rec right they're not digging into the 90s right they go to 2015 and people forget that when the Larry Sanders show came on the air you know with the shows on HBO it was like first in 10 or not necessarily the news or dream on you know Gary was the first show on HBO that made HBO go oh this is what HBO should be we should be the quality network with all with these kind of groundbreaking television and you know Gary was a guy who got offered all the talk shows he got offered to replace Letterman he was hosting the Tonight Show for Johnny Haman Leno would would take turns doing it and he decided he'd rather satirize it than do it mmm you know and he wanted to explore the people and not be a talk-show host he wanted a show like the world of ego that is not just talk shows but just show business he was fascinated with people's need for attention his own need for attention his own vanity and narcissism and he wanted to explore that and and satirize how we just want to be liked so badly like what we do to be liked which prevents us from actually feeling loved because we're so obsessed with approval do you talk to JD are you friends of Jay Leno yeah Jay and I were talking about what it was like to host the Tonight Show and how much more funny has now doing comedians and cars are not community cars Jay Leno's Garage yeah and because that's what he really loves yeah he really loves cars and he gets to be himself while he's doing this he doesn't have to have people on it he doesn't want like he just has people on to talk to them about cars and stuff and has comics on and all kinds of people on but you know when he was talking about like having that show he's like yet you would have people andhe you didn't give a shit about and you had to talk to that for Jay that was most everybody yeah because he loves certain things right but he doesn't love sports right he's not a massive movie fan but you get him going on the things he cares about like cars yeah he's fascinated but that I think was some of the fun of watching The Tonight Show Phil Jay interviewing a young actress and you know he doesn't care at all and how is he going to make it amusing for himself at the audience did you see the Hicks bit that Hicks did about Jay interviewing Joey Lawrence he blows his brains out and it forms the NBC Peacock of the wall I always felt that the gun loads I always thought that was very unfair the Hicks and the Andy Kindler criticisms of Leno in Atlanta was you know it is you know one of the great stand-ups of all time I mean in a club you'd see Leno in the 80s nobody touches it he was just one guy and still I saw him recently at the improv still is and you know he made a call to you know to be America's host beat everyone for forever forever was proven completely correct but there was this idea that it was a betrayal of his club persona that some comedians were so mad about and I don't know how you could be mad at anybody for deciding how to run their show because you know as we've seen with other people sometimes snarky guy runs out of gas in two years mm-hmm and you know Jay found the space that was comfortable for him and God was he nice to me every time I was there he's a great guy and always super funny when I was on the show and super nice would put me on when I wasn't doing stand-up just as a director just because he liked me as a person and a really a good class guy and in the Shanley documentary fascinating describing his observations of Gary his observations about talk shows I mean what a ride he went on to that world of being the talk show host there's not a lot of wiggle room especially back then you know as opposed to now now with the internet I think a lot of like subject matter and a lot of languages opened up more you can kind of get it like if you see like what's going on now with with Seth Meyers or you know any of the other late-night talk-show hosts they have much more like look at core bare bare rather yeah Colbert said that you know Donald Trump the president uses Putin like he uses his mouth like who Putin use his mouth as a cock holster but he said that on television with the phrase cock Colts yes they beeped it out you not aware that I'm not I have that city the chromakey long rant and it was really hilarious because Trump Trump came back and it said a bunch of think about Colbert being a tasteless and talentless and being a loser and all these different things and Colbert came back again he goes Donald Trump he goes I thought if there was one thing you understood it's show business and he goes you responded he goes you responded I win you don't understand no funny and it was it was really fucking hilarious well Trump can't help but respond yeah he has no ability to go it demeans me to acknowledge you exist it hasn't understand that and so I think these easily baited into any of those situations which is I think a little is what scares people because you think if Colbert conveyed him what about other countries in very serious situations what baits him into action that he shouldn't take well he blocks people on Twitter yeah he's the fucking president people are trying to they're trying to figure out like is that like a First Amendment issue like was Maya allowed to communicate with the president directly through Twitter well now I can't because he blocks me is he allowed to block people so there's people that are considering lawsuits right now does does a Donald Trump understand you should just be muting people just mute them Donald you don't have to block now you want some - no I want to no Magga I like I like blocking people I love blocking people the second I see anything I blocked somebody even if they say one of my movies was just okay I'd be that mean boom I'll never see you again really somebody says that was it that was pretty good I'll block him block him on almost a compliment almost combo it's weird underhanded stuff if you're not kissing my ass pretty hard you're gone that's that's my Twitter theory I like it you know I don't even need you to call me a Jew that's a funny thing is that when people say nasty things on Twitter they always start sounding like they make sense but then bail at the end you know so they'll just be like you know give give the president a chance you know he was duly elected by the American people and go jump into nothin it's always like the to beat could be these oh they're saying that to you yeah it sounds sane and it always lands like jump in an oven did you stuff exactly yeah that go well do you take a lot of heat for criticizing the president you leti right Jones III Joan it's pretty soon I mean I don't think I'm saying anything that anyone else isn't saying because I have a simple theory about all this stuff which is I don't think rich people want you to be rich I think that people are trying to be told that rich people really can handle everything and if you let the rich people have all the money they're just going to figure it all out and in fact last night was an interesting night because the Donald Trump said he doesn't want poor people in charge of the economy and what what he said that yeah he said he goes I want rich people but it's what he's not understanding is there are public servants who have not made the choice to be billionaires who actually understand you know economic theories better than you know the head of Walmart or something that just because you were able to figure out how to sell M&Ms doesn't mean you can run the economy that there are people that they don't want to be rich they want to help other people and they are very smart about ways to help government work well and you know that's like saying Martin Luther King's that loser because he wasn't rich he's not smart and this only rich people know how to do things I find so offensive and I'm very surprised that people who aren't billionaires aren't more offended at the contempt that they're held in because you could disagree on economic theory you could say I believe in trickle-down economics or I don't believe in trickle-down economics but this is a government that thinks if you're not a billionaire you're an idiot really think you think so you said it last night well it's not it's literally a speech which is would you want poor people in charge of the economy which is the argument for having like the head of Goldman Sachs in charge of the economy but yet what is a poor person how's he defining it is he defining it as an idiot failure or someone who hasn't decided to milk this world for as much money as they can get out of it some people are happy to make a comfortable living and try to be giving to other people and they can be very helpful being part of our government you don't have to be the head of Goldman Sachs to be to be someone who can change people's lives for the better he thinks you just get ahead in that exon the head of Goldman Sachs but sometimes you don't want the head of Exxon you want something that's thought about international relations their entire lives and maybe they've always made 200 grand a year okay that's not poor like what it depends on what your how you define that core yes and how he defines poor yeah I mean we say you don't want a poor person running the economy I think one argument for that would be you don't want anybody who wants radical redistribution of wealth one one article one arm argument while that rather would be someone who says like what we need to do is we need to figure out who the richest people in the world that owned 90% of the money and then just take that money and distribute it to everyone else like this is there's some pretty radical arguments from poor people I don't think he's saying that I think I think he equates poor with idiot he wasn't saying I don't want the you know a Bernie Sanders type he was saying I want he considers like the head of Goldman Sachs to be the smartest man in the world where there are people who who don't seek to make that much money who are very smart and certainly capable of doing things I think he sees people are not the heads of industry as being incapable of being in charge of aspects of the government right because that's his world that's as world as the world of super rich people and if you're not a super rich person you're a loser well that's it it's all a winner loser economy which I find fascinating because he is basically calling most of the world a loser yeah in his world and so yeah you could debate I mean not I always think most people don't even understand most of what they talked about with politics like when you talk about wealth redistribution that a lot of people theories but they actually don't know anything about they have no information that they're no one's read a book about it and it has very few to go very few I mean literally less than one person one being about a regular basis they've seen a few clips on Fox News yes and they have this idea in their head of what it is exactly and I think that's what's wrong with our country is no one knows anything about anything on either side like people don't know you know deeply about the environment there's very few people who sit down and read the study very few people right now are going to read that health care bill that is before the Senate right like how many people do you think what percentage of the country think is going to sit down and read any part of it less than 1/10 of 1% and if you're lucky destroy their lives that they get sick and they don't have coverage and who knows me maybe it's perfect and we don't understand it but people won't bother to know anything about it well it's like global warming yeah you talk to the average person on the right or the average person on the left about global warming and you will see like it's really strange how you see these ideologically driven ideas that they have in their head about what global warming is what causes it and you can almost guess based on their reaction to it whether they're Republican or whether they're liberal yes and people you know obviously everyone talks about this but people have chosen aside and so now anything that that side does people are ok with it yeah and so when suddenly we're so soft on Russia and then all these you know being a Republican used to be so about the evil empire and on a dime it's like people like Russia but look what they did with WikiLeaks Wiggly everyone's turned on WikiLeaks WikiLeaks used to be the champion of information used to be these are the people that are trying to let you know all the shit that's going on behind the scenes we're finding out all these secret emails we're sharing them with the world we're we have a media dump we're dumping everything now it's WikiLeaks is Putin's puppet and WikiLeaks is working for Putin the left is turned on with UNIX was quite fascinating well both sides will switch based on what serves them in the helmet yeah but it's dark man it's really weird when you see the when you see it so obvious and it's so flippant like there's not a lot of thought put into this like yeah you're talking about someone like in Julian Assange I'm not a giant Julian Assange fan as a human being but I think what he's done is pretty goddamn courageous and he's taken a huge hit for it and he's been stuck in this embassy in London forever if he leaves he'll immediately be arrested and who knows what's going to happen to him if that happens yes in this guy is still out there trying to distribute information well it's about is it selective you know if a guy like that is just I mean obviously the issues are is he putting people's lives at risk with mega dumps which I know reveal sources and things like that but also is he you know is he manipulated to release things to serve a different you know political right is he doing it on purpose one way or the other where's the stuff on the Republicans you know if we had all that all the emails of the Republicans planning the Trump campaign we'd have a whole nother story to tell now is it impossible to get their emails do they just have the best computers in the world and there's no way to get their emails or doesn't what the story is like you know that they believe I mean it's it's so hard to figure out what happened here but that seth rich guy according to Kim calm and according to Julian Assange he leaked he was a Bernie Sanders supporter he worked for the DNC he leaked some of the information that showed that the DNC was colluding and what they were trying to do was they were conspiring to keep bernie sanders from winning the primary yes and it proved to be true that they actually did do that and julian assange was saying after that guy got shot that somehow or another he was alluding to that if you work with us there are consequences so you had someone who is a renegade inside the DNC who released that dump you don't have anybody like that on the the Republican side it doesn't mean that the WikiLeaks is corrupt it just means that no one on the Republican side has done that only one guy according to them I don't know if it's true they some people say Russia did it but according to Julian Assange and according to Kim calm was apparently somehow or another involved at least part of it had to do with this Seth rich guy that doesn't mean that they're like trying to exclusively release stuff that makes Democrats look bad it just means no one's done it on the Republican side just because the information doesn't exist doesn't mean there's some sort of collusion well that's I guess the mystery of it I don't really know anything about this at the rich case what did what is that because I know people are mad about it's the guy that was he worked for the DNC and he was murdered outside of his apartment at four o'clock in the morning they said it was a robbery but this there's a giant conspiracy theory too attached to it but I'm just gonna really the facts his wallet was left his phone was left his watch was left his valuables that he might have been robbed of his monies that all that stuff was there so he's just murdered and they never found who killed him and then immediately Julian Assange was alluding to the idea that this guy was helping them and that he was murdered because that and that has been hotly contested and of course the Fox News narrative has like garlic Sean Hannity has made a big deal out of it saying he said we're going to get to the bottom of this ladies and gentlemen weekly which makes me more suspicious that's not true but it is a possibility that he was one of the people that was releasing information I would imagine if you worked for the DNC especially if you were a Bernie Sanders supporter and you saw what they were doing what they were doing is essentially they were they were hijacking the democratic process from inside from the Democratic Party and if you were a Bernie Sanders supporter would be horrifying it would really piss you off and especially if you're someone who's idealistic you've got this idea of like what the future could be under Bernie Sanders and you realize your own party is fucking him in the ass and so I don't know how much he released or if he released or if he was only one part of it or Russia was a part of it as well and hacking to the DNC but the bottom line at the end of the day is expose corruption I mean that's really what it was there's absolute clear corruption in the DNC yeah and everybody got away with it the woman was in charge she went and left went immediately to work for Hillary's campaign and you know it's it wasn't good stuff it was all bad no matter what who no matter who really released it it just showed you how gross the system is yeah to the core yeah all the way around on both sides I'm not a big conspiracy theorist I should be but I should be be I I guess that there's always more going on than we think but I also think that most people are too dumb to not get caught almost every single time yeah you say that but there's a lot of shit that happens where people do get caught eventually and you realize oh like how long were you guys running this what's your favorite conspiracy theory that turned out to be true it's hard to say whether it turned out to be true but JFK is the biggest one and where did you land on that I landed on that it's very possible very possible that Lee Harvey Oswald was involved it's very possible that other people involved too it's very possible that he shot at Kennedy and other people shot at Kennedy at the same time and then he was a patsy and he was put up like he was obviously involved in a lot of intelligence agency shenanigans he went to Russia he married a Russian woman came back to the United States he had been involved in all sorts of communist propaganda shit he was definitely not like an aboveground guy he was a shady dude and it's entirely possible that he was one person out of a plot to kill the president and they put it all on him and they had Jack Ruby shoot him but everybody goes black and white on that you either go Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone own or you go he was innocent and the CIA had him assassinated because he was trying to get rid of the CIA which he was I mean Kennedy was trying to pull us out of Vietnam trying to get rid of CIA he was trying to get rid of the the the the Federal Reserve there's a lot of like super controversial ideas that Kennedy was trying to push forward and someone killed him I always go to this simple thing which is why would Jack Ruby shoot him right yeah cuz a lot of people say oh he was just a patriot who got mad and happened to be there but I which maybe makes perfect sense but if he was told to do it it's such a suicide end up in jail for the rest of your life mission yeah it doesn't even - me it falls them things like that fall apart there that's what they but it's also possible they told them listen just shoot him we'll get you off will we'll find some sort of a way like or they might have had something horrible on him Jack Ruby was clearly embedded in the mob the mob was angry at Kennedy because they helped Kennedy win they helped him win Illinois yes you know I mean they helped him become the president and there was absolute evidence that they were mad at him once he became president because then he started doing things that were against their interests there's a lot of people pissed off at Kennedy that's what's funny about the current Russia scandal because it's a similar thing where there's just so much going on I keep saying people you're not hearing this defense from all the Trump people well we met with Peru eight times right we met with with the English people like they they're just out having those meetings right there's not all those connections with any other country but Russia not only that this whole thing about Flynn and that the the intelligence agencies were warning that Flynn was compromised and that the he could be blackmailed by Russia like they had things on what they had on him we don't know but they're very convinced that there was evidence against Flynn and that the Trump administration knew this and they were still entertaining talks with him they're still bringing him on board and what's fascinating is this world of international lobbyists like Paul Manafort what are they doing you did you see this where Paul Mann affords kids someone hacked their phones and they had all these texts where they were talking about how horrible their dad was oh and how he's responsible for people getting killed oh and there's scene and who knows if any of that's true but there's a entire world of Americans going overseas and being involved in dirty politics and the work of governments like the Ukraine that we don't have any clue about what that is yeah it's on the last frontiers for a really diabolical shit you know like Russia is one of the last like what he had what he is what Putin stands for is like one of the last brutal military dictators it's kind of in a costume yes he's in a costume was the president of Russia but we all know like he murders people that oppose him he murders journalists he murders political candidates that are running against him mean he's he's terrifying guy what do you think it means that that Trump just loves him just not good he just he admires I think he admires the take no shit guy yeah I think he does and I think there's also the possibility that he feels that what Putin stands for is like he's this powerful superpower and it's better to be friends with them there's to be enemies let's just cozy up hey I wish I could do a lot of the shit you do a lot of people talk shit about me on Twitter I wish I could have them killed I mean they're it's entirely possible that he thinks along those lines because I think it's probably from decades of Trump dealing with the mob in New York in Atlantic City and he probably developed a point of view about how you deal with evil people yeah and how you have to make deals and how friends with them I think a lot of rich people think everyone doesn't understand this is how the world works right this is how the sausage gets made mmm yeah and that's why they do crazy stuff because they just go everyone else is naive yeah and just get me in a room with Putin get me a back channel we'll figure it out like right back channel with it's like sitting down with the mob figured out your price for cement that's what he thinks the Putin backchannel is likely we'll figure it out well we'll come up with and I think it seems like Trump elec likes the idea of that what you present is a lie and what you do in private is figuring out solutions and that that's how the world works right that it's all fully shit yeah and that that is the way you get away with everything that's how the world works that's the justification eh that's how the world works which is so different than Bush who was religious and had this thought we are going to go to other countries we're going to take down these leaders and they are going to find freedom and we're all going to change for the positive when they don't have these dictators Trump is an old-school guy who's like you needed dictators to keep all these assholes in line yeah but meanwhile he's kind of right I mean look what happens when you take the dictators out you create this power vacuum the places are way more chaotic look at Libya right it's a failed state now he got rid of Qaddafi everybody's happy Hillary Clinton was on TV they did an interview with her where she's cheering she's like laughing what we Came we saw he died ha ha ha do you see that yeah everything I think that's what makes the world so impossible to manage right now right which is you know it's like we tried this this you know this approach of let's let's make these people a democracy but you can't force people to want a democracy also they're conditioned to being in a dictatorship they've lived that way their whole life and there's all these other people when you get rid of Qaddafi it doesn't mean he's the only piece of shit there yeah there's a million other pieces of shit that are wondering how they get to that guy's position and he's keeping them down and murdering people and trying to keep keep and so their entire life that's the paradigm they've operated under they've watched this happen they've seen this one central brutal murderous figure control everyone else when that's gone it's not all kumbaya sudden it creates this power vacuum and then everybody's clamoring to see who takes that guy spot and now you have Isis steps in and Libya is just straight chaos and theirs seems to be no solution to almost no solution right because there's there's a massive religious tribal war happening where if we if we didn't exist they were they would just be fighting each other right and that's what happened that's what we were warned about with Iraq like people that didn't understand Iraq including Bush did not understand if you take Saddam Hussein out of the picture who's kind of secular what you're left with is this sunni-shia Civil War and you're gonna have this crazy situation where there's two different sects of Islam are gonna kill each other no one saw that coming I mean well you know who did see that coming Janeane Garofalo did she yeah because I remember watching her on CNN and there was a there's a massive protest against going into Iraq before we went to war and she said this is what's gonna happen if we go there and she laid that out well she's a Noam Chomsky fan yeah she said these people are going to attack each other we're gonna made a mess that is gonna be we're gonna open a Pandora's box and there are no weapons of mass destruction and we should wait and we don't have enough information and she really took a beating for being a in strong opposition to invading Iraq and every single thing that she said would happen in the next 10 years happened and she wasn't the only person they were plenty of people I remember when 9/11 happened Norman Mailer was on he was on Charlie Rose like that week and he said this is exactly what's gonna happen and he explained the wars that would happen where they would happen he and then he said and this is what's gonna happen as a result of those wars and and laid out the mess that was created and he said you'll see we do not have the strength to not take these steps I should clarify don't know if she needs a really a Noam Chomsky fan but I know chums Chomsky was saying that like he was pretty adamant about that like very early on I just watched the Chomsky documentary on Netflix it's an interesting guy yeah and it was fascinating and it had one simple idea which also I think a lot of people don't realize which is that our country how its set up is is meant to protect people from the people with money from the landowners as it was more back then and the basic theory is that that the people with the wealth and corporations are not served by democracy if democracy is functioning it is not in the favor of the wealthy or corporate interests and so as a result they always have to be against democracy because if there if Republicans don't have voter suppression then everything is going to change in favor of what the population wants to do so that they'll always be incentives for having less people vote and to to making democracy not function the way that it should because clearly you could have voter motor ID where when you get your driver's license you're registered for the whole country you could have everyone in the country vote by mail you could have everyone vote by computer you could make it so you would have 8090 percent of people voting but that goes against corporate interests and so they fight to say there's you know all these fake codes when there there isn't and so that protects corporate interests and it's a it's a really interesting documentary that just came up I guess in the last year was it called oh we're about to find out it's C I liked it there searching as we speak there's a lot of people that are resisting the idea of people voting online but we Bank online it's ridiculous of course you'd be able to vote well we certainly could get more people voting it's fascinating that there's other countries like Russia trying to to get into that Oh requiem for the American dream yeah it's it's worth its it's worth seeing mmm I mean I I don't really you know some of these things I don't have the strongest opinions on because it II it's it's very complicated and it's I couldn't you said you just you never know what new mess you're creating I was talking to this actor right who does a lot of charity around the world very famous actor and he said you know I was working on this project to dig wells in a community in Africa and then we dug the wells and is incredible for this community and then the neighboring community came and murdered everybody for the wells he goes that's what it's like trying to save people and to help people in the world there's always something that results that you did not anticipate that makes it even more complicated yeah and I feel it's that way with most issues that you think it's this but you've set off that and it takes i we would where I come down is you need an incredibly intelligent person to be in the middle of making these choices and just generally with Trump I don't think he's that smart and I I think that he is very you know a very self-involved narcissistic person and we can debate choices but it doesn't seem like they like the person is the depth to make these calls well I don't think anybody it really is qualified to run 350 million people I just think it's a ridiculous proposition but I think you're definitely right also he sets the tone for the mindset of the country I mean it really is we we have this alpha male chimpanzee thing going on where the one like Obama love him or hate him was a very articulate really well-spoken calm and measured guy and I think that's very good for America to have this guy who's smarter than anybody you know and he's running the country like you feel like okay well this guy is obviously lucky he hardly ever stutters he knows what he's talking about and very moderate no I mean would you get down to it what I find interesting is Obama is so moderate after the banking issues he didn't go after the bankers he didn't send anyone to jail he propped up those businesses so the fact that like the banks so want to get rid of him it makes me go how much money is enough right guys still basically on your side Hillary is basically still on your side they were mad when their bonuses were minimalized remember that exactly I think that Allah held they got billions of dollars in bail money and they still wanted their bonuses I have a contract my contract says I got a bonus they're just thinking about their house new yacht and people got bonuses even though the economy collapse even though the economy collapsed as a direct result of the industry that they were involved in and the businesses they were running they still got bonuses it's really crazy and it what's interesting is it I guess most people they don't connect that and they're not furious like right now they're trying to get rid of the compute the Consumer Protection Bureau that keeps an eye on the banks they're trying to defang them and people you would think that people who want their guns would also say but I would like consumer protection so you don't screw me on my credit card but for some reason because it doesn't line up with their team exactly they don't care about the issues that are that would protect them is that super dangerous to have a right now left I mean it's just because you always you go for independent candidates a lot right you're yeah looking for a third party yeah what prevents their from being a logical third party well I think we had it with Ross Perot right I think Ross Perot was a logical third party and it became very dangerous for people that's one of the reasons why the Commission for presidential debates changed the threshold like you back then you needed 5% in the primary in order to be included in the debates you put Ross Perot in the debate is it a independent and extremely wealthy man who understands a lot about tax codes understands a lot about foreign relations and he became like a huge problem and most likely cost Herbert Walker Bush his second term right yes and then that's why Clinton became president in the first place and the threshold is what now to get in those debates well I mean it Bernie Sanders is kind of an independent right I mean is obviously that his party's not on his side we proved that with the DNC leaks that they're they're conspiring against him this is actual own party which is the same as changing the thresholds of the third party candidate can't be in debates right right it's just another version of that exactly yeah it's another version of that well then you find out the Commission for presidential debates as I it's not even a national thing it's like a privately funded thing it's it's a private company like they can choose like how they like what like well let's make it 15 percent you have to give 15 percent and then they could just change it like that guy was a problem like I was a pain in the ass let's change the threshold yeah what could go wrong yeah are you I mean there are people who feel like left and right are the same thing when you really get down to it or they're protecting the same interests in some way are you a believer in that or not I think that the most of the people that are on the left and most of the people on the right aren't even really thinking about whatever their party stands for they're just like I said they're sticking with the team whether it's the left team of the right team I think they I think radical ideologies whether it's on the left or the right will they share a lot of common traits and one of the things they share is this complete lack of objectivity lack of objectivity and lack of introspective thought and in terms of like what their party is actually doing what it means to be a liberal what it means to be progressive what it means to be Republican what it means to be conservative you just get into this groove like this is what we do fuck global warming it's not real you know and then fuck this and you can't be racist against a white person like you people have these ridiculous ideas on the left and on the right they just dig their heels in the sand they don't think about they just go with it because that's what the party says and it's just a game yeah because after the election Ike's I called a lot of politicians and a bunch of journalists was just trying to get a sense of what's going on how could I get involved what was there to do and it was really disparity it was all reactive everyone was like well we have to see what they do to decide how to react mmm and I was like so you were just super upset there Trump won yeah I could see what was about to happen and everything I was concerned about did happen but they basically all said well you have to let him do his thing to then react and then have the population react to what he did and did you have any concerns at all about Hillary well I think it reminds me a little bit of I mean I'm aware of what those issues are but I do think you know there are large choices that just affect millions and hundreds of millions of people like for instance when a guy like Donald Trump says we're not going to give money to any aid service around the world that says anything about abortion forget giving out abortions if they hand out a pamphlet and it says that's an option they don't get money so if you're a country in Africa and there's only one AIDS aid service I'd like feeds starving people but you also hand out a pamphlet on abortion you don't get any of the money and you know I agree it drops fucked up and a lot of things he does are fucked up but did you have any problems at all with Hillary like did you I had a big issue that she does not seem to understand uh certain issues like the speech getting paid for the speeches right that did her blind spot and she has revealed to still have it after the election that like why did I go there because I got paid you know and I guess they've made you know over a hundred million dollars giving speeches Bill and Hillary Clinton which on one level you go yeah you know people don't understand I'm gonna go do a stand-up corporate gig and it's crazy money there's a crazy corporate speech money floating up yeah but wait a minute you better than you know I'm not defending it yet I'm just saying she has a blind spot - what - the potential for corruption that people see in that and that she when you're when you're getting I mean well one article said it was like 150 billion dollars between the two of them over like ten years or so the fact that she doesn't even have a good game to defend it that you can't go up against Trump and say he's corrupt while you're getting that much money from corporate interests like she never even saw how offensive it was that it's the kind that Bernie Sanders doesn't do so people go well at least he's not lining his pockets with that money Hillary's basically saying I I lined my pockets with that money but I still have my own opinions and the blind spot at least of the outrage of it is something that I threw me but ultimately the main choices that she wanted to make on a lot of issues are so much borne liner that I believed in Trump that although not a perfect candidate you know Trump is doing you know easy he's trying to get this health care thing through and doesn't seem that concerned about the amount of people get kicked off so I I guess that there are certain things I sucked up about it I didn't have a core thing that she's like a terrible person but I think it's it's pretty hard to get me to that place with people I always need a little bit more proof of that but certainly she represents someone who's dishonest though and that's a real problem when you have a leader of this incredible country and someone who's clearly dishonest and it's been dishonest for a long time like when they talk to her about the emails every interview she gave about it she would give varying responses a lot of more dishonest a lot of it was not based on facts when she compared what she said Comey said to her during the investigation versus what Comey was saying publicly there are totally different things oh I I totally understand and I think that there's a lot of politics that's really bad and really dirty and I don't know enough on each specific thing to have a you know position on each thing that she said but I do feel like there are people who are playing the game with service in mind and maybe they're getting dirty or making mistakes with service in mind and then there are people like Trump that I really don't understand why he's there and his general philosophy is let the smart rich people get richer and something nice might happen for you that he's so dishonest on a level that you can't compare to right it's just so I mean he admits that he's a liar now I'm fully with you on this but whenever people criticize Trump or whenever the people talk about Hillary rather the one of the first things they do is say Trump is worse they'd instead of like talking about how weird look I think it's was such an non ideal candidate like she was such a terrible candidate she didn't believe in gay marriage until 2013 I mean 2013 choose publicly stating that gay marriage should be it should not be legal that a marriage illegal marriage should be between a man and a woman and clearly for old leap a little reasons like she obviously had some issue with it at all and I agree with you I feel like there's a part of politics where people you know like say my position was evolving on that when no your position wasn't evolving you just weren't fighting for what you actually believe right and Obama took a while to make big moves on that right but I still think at core people like that are trying to figure out the system to help people and I can't say I understand what Trump is in this for other than to be considered the greatest winner of all time yeah I think that's probably exactly it I don't think he really wanted to be president I think he was doing it sort of boost his brand and along the way he lost a television show right when he's doing all that build that wall shit and running you know them at the wall just got 10 feet higher yeah an NBC was like fuck you man we're canceling your show and when they did that I think he was like oh yeah well I'm really gonna be fucking president now and he kept going and going and going and then he won I mean it seems to me like the whole thing was started almost as a publicity campaign like a fun thing what if his people said that there was a woman in publicity for him who left she's the only person I know who left the campaign for this reason I forgot her name but it was very public this wasn't a it she said it publicly that when it started the plan was to come in second to help the brand to get some fame to make some statements about what he believes with no belief that was possible that he would do better than second in the Republican primaries and then the woman said as it became clear that did a really good shot of winning she said oh I wasn't in it for this and what I find fascinating to watch is Trump slowly getting comfortable with power as as he thinks he's figuring it out is interesting like I mean even the Jared Kushner thing is kind of hilarious you have this son-in-law so now you have a blind spot that anyone in the world thinks it's weird that you give your son-in-law a real estate developer so much power and he doesn't care at all because he doesn't trust anybody except like four people so he's got to give them all the power but he puts them in charge of fixing everything wrong with the inn structure of governments and the middle-east and two or three other things and Trump doesn't understand how insane that appears and also how each task is impossible like this is my signal he's going to fix government and the Middle East the type of guy that doesn't realize well maybe there's one person for each of those jobs is that's where I just go oh he's full-out crazy because who would even do that to their son-in-law maybe his son-in-law is a pain in the ass is like this fucking kid thinks he could do things all right I'll give you the worst job ever go fix government go fix the Middle East I got it I'm gonna prove my worth to you sir and there with his Ray Ban sunglasses and his preppy outfit I mean it you know it's become so comical you know it's a fascinating because it's both terrifying and comical like if this is a movie it's too broad and you wouldn't believe it right you would just go too much is happening in every scene too many crazy thoughts and what I guess I guess what I wonder and maybe you have an opinion about this there are people who say you know it is the destruction of truth when you just make these lies up all day long that you change the definition of truth or even people's ability to decide what they think is the truth is that a philosophy that someone like Bannon is executing in the White House or something that happens randomly and and and is organic out of them that's a real good question I mean there's always the concept absolute power corrupts absolutely and knowing that you're in some sort of a competition knowing that you are there's people trying to knock you down and you're in this position of power and you're shoring up your defenses and I think there's a lot of weird stuff that goes on whenever you're the winning team and you realize you're being attacked at all angles by this other team and then you've got this guy who's the head guys a fucking maniac he's got fake hair he puts a spray tan on every day he's out there is eyes are white no one tells him his face is orange he's saying insane shit he contradicts himself all the time he lies all the time about numbers he's always bragging about how well his ratings are and how shows do really well because everybody knows he watches the show it's crazy stuff that you just don't expect from someone who's in the position of President of the United States I think almost all bets are off at this point that's the one thing that I find promising about this the people are so upset but how fucked up this it is this is that they're going to get politically active and that they're going to realize like there's some real holes in the system like the FBI like the president shouldn't just be able to fire the head of the FBI because you don't like the investigation yourself sane and and and sessions recuse himself but he can fire the guy investigating himself insane it's all insane but I guess what my fear would be is that when it just swings back the other way like you could just swing left right right that's right but are any institutional protections ever put in place because it just swings back and forth like for instance say like we don't you know I'm not an expert in health care but let's assume it's just a shitstorm right and in a year or two whatever millions of people are losing to health care and every day you're just hearing about hundreds of people who have cancer who can't pay for their medicine what happens in this country do people get mad at the Republicans do they vote them out or to somehow not enough sick people there's not enough sick people to make the change I think there's so many issues there's so many in issues that like where do you draw the line do you draw the line at them taking the teeth out of the EPA which is what they're done the Environmental Protection Agency is fuck now I mean they're removing the satellites to track global warming there they're there they're stopping funding for all these different initiatives all these different programs and all these different studies they're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on the planet like that that the stop all that what we really need is Enron and Exxon all these different companies big conglomerates big corporations we need to drill we need to drill we need to frack we need to go over where you know Alaska and we're in the Antarctica get in that ground pull that oil out and and it's it's that's that's scary and then you hear the healthcare shit well that's scary too and then you hear the Russian ship well that's fucking scary North Korea oh that's scary there's so many different things to be scared about I don't think people who don't have cancer don't have diseases are really considering all this health care stuff I think it's one of those things that happens once you have a health issue then you realize how fuck the system is and especially if you don't have the money to take care of it you're like wow like our medical system in this country is not it's not the best we have the best doctors we certainly have the best surgeons and we have some pretty amazing innovative medicine but when it comes to the system itself or like when you find out how much people have to pay when they go to the doctor and how about you have insurance wellhe insurance only cover so much you still have to pay more sure about my mom died of ovarian cancer and I just remember going through those bills and there was a lot of experimental medicine that potentially could save her and you didn't know if insurance would say this is the type of approach that they're willing to pay for right and anything you needed to do you'd have to prove you needed it someone says you needed you know a new cat scan and you've had to that year you might have to go to war to say why you need it now right and I am Rock Ranchers I'm just always fascinated that it doesn't line up for people like say you love the outdoors and you love hunting well don't you love the environment right and so why are you not really pissed or Trump's gonna build a wall and he's gonna take a lot of people's land away to build the wall well I thought that was the big issue for all these militia groups don't mess with our land yeah and so is always gonna do is you know take land away well the wall the only way to build the wall in a lot of places and a lot of private lands I mean it's it's a that's a jagged path to when you're building that wall and you have to you know you have to take away a lot of people's land to to pull that off so that's what scares me the most about America is there's an illogic to people's opinion I think there's too many variables I think there's too many things for people to consider and I think people work all day and then they have hobbies and families and things they enjoy doing and they don't have the time to really sit I mean each one of those issues would require a full-time job all day long investigating except dating and discussing it whether it's Flynn's ties to Russia or what session knows and how many times did he speak to the Russians or what what a Jared Kushner actually do in the Middle East like what is he doing in the Oh like this each one of those is a full-time job yeah what is he saying to Netanyahu alone in the room how do they let him do that he looks like such a dork did you see the pictures of him with the bulletproof vest on overseas and he's hanging around with the actual soldiers and sitting there with his ray bands on this is masking tape with his name magic-markered on it and I don't know it is a it's a comedy I had to say as a creative person who's going to be at the Wilbur Oh when when he had the wall get the Wilbur this is called the mid-show plug everybody the Wilbur in Boston just added a Late Show for charity for the after-school programs for Boston Arts jail I 24th the Wilbur comm one of my favorite theatres in the world and the best crowds amazing it's incredible and it feels like you're in a club there's a thousand people in there but they're all in three tiers yeah and so it's very short it's like three 300 seat comedy clubs jammed in there together yeah it's the perfect layout for common it really is and then I'll be in Providence Rhode Island the Columbus theatre July 25th and at the Ridgefield Playhouse in Ridgefield Connecticut July 23rd and I'm taping my special Montreal the Just for Laughs festival because they seem to be amused by meeting oh that's an amazing place to do it at the festival festival how many shows you're gonna do I'm doing five shows I'm taping four of them oh that's a good move I like that I like when I hear that I hate when I hear someone taping one show no no I I could panic and ruin one show I could I could actually if I did only two shows I could panic the first show and then go okay now I only have one show to get it and panic again who you doing your special for for Netflix oh yeah that's the way to go it was my turn nice and and I haven't done something like that since basically the HBO young comedians special in 1992 with Ray Romano the guy who got fired so you could have your career no I didn't yeah I know he got fired so somebody else could take it and then that guy fired and I go who's that kid I don't know who's in between some guys on the pilot there was a guy on the pile that was not Ray Ray got fired and another guy took his spot and then that guy fired and I took that guy spot Paul Simms is vicious he was gonna get it done all right I was around a little bit of in the the news radio days just as for a friend of Paul's and Andy Dick's and that shows a show that holds up and is really funny yeah well I was just happy that there was a buffer between me and ranks I love Ray yeah I would not have want to be the guy that takes Ray's job I think Ray is one of the first people to tell you he probably was not prepared as an actor at that exact moment what was the wrong gig for him you know the Everybody Loves Raymond was the perfect gig let him write for himself and let him he'll figure it all out and become obsessed with it he's such a good guy oh he's the best Ray Romano is like one of the nicest people I've ever met and so good in our movie the big sick honestly the dream part so funny so real very I mean it's the culmination of everything he's learned as an actor yeah and a person so I'm very excited about that I was doing that TBS thing he's doing like a drama for a while yeah yeah men of a certain age did this I depress dudes let's call that bunch of depressed dudes I called it the Jett Apatow story and yeah he seems so he's so good he was on Parenthood for a while and I've gone to spend a little time with him because this movie but it is funny that we were on the young comedian special in 1992 that is amazing and now you're back at it and now I am back do so again you've done stand-up now for three years since yet since 2004 three years straight yeah and then like what like how many years in were you like I think I've got a special here they asked me to do it a year ago and I said okay give me one more year hmm so that's very honest of you well you know everybody's so good I mean I was performing the other night in the original room and you were in the main room and I could hear the place rocking from the stage of the original baby bike ride was too quiet that I could hear you I could hear your laugh and you just you know talking loud and I and so I always think wow people are so good right now people people are masters at this and I can't be mediocre at it I mean I'm in the same business as you and Maria Bamford and Louie CK and Hannibal and and I have to be able to be proud of what I'm doing yeah Joey Diaz and Bill birders is a different time there are so many murderers out there right now yeah I mean I was watching BRR I would did a Largo show that he was on I was just watching him from the side of the stage and does his level of intensity is so it you know in a way it's so professional and I notice it with you the other night too that you could get yourself in that state where you care so much and you're so passionate and it requires so much energy and focus to get to that place to perform with that passion it's just really impressive cuz like for me I can just get tired and start staring at pages I didn't get tired halfway through like it's just felt a wave of like like after you eat a big meal and you just get tired like you just hit you eight that's what I'm always trying to accomplish is trying to get out whatever I'm trying to talk about with the most power that I can like the most like what's the best way to do it is the best way to do it slow and calm and let people soak in the idea or is the best way to do it to be intense and full like what is like the most entertaining way that I would be engaging this material figure whatever that is and fuck with it and move it around and bring it up and bring it down and that's one of the things where the store is such a great place to focus on that kind of stuff because there's so many killers because the standards are so high that you have to really you really have to be on point and it's packed every night you go to the Comedy Store the main room would usually just be desolate like four years ago it sold out like it's Vegas every night Irene I walk in there like I got some new jokes like can I do how many new jokes can I do when this is a big sold-out Krabbe we changed the face of comedy in LA now I mean comedy in LA is a different thing now the last few years it's also funny how a place like the Comedy Store you know our friend Adam he got who who books it just one guy with good taste booking the club well and suddenly everyone in town wants to run to that club again both comedians have the audience because Adam does such a good job and looking at opening up that back bar where you gave us a place where the public can't go and the comics can go and hang out that was giant where there was a place to chill and hang out people with like you'd be sitting there with Ron why delay I'm on in five see you boys and he'd go out there and do a set then Diaz would come back and all these different people are hanging out they're like wow this place is like something special like they made changes they figured things out they did things differently I I missed just hanging out with comics when I wasn't doing stand-up I was like I don't know anybody anymore like I literally don't know anybody that's the idea of being a part of that community and it is a community of people that are really smart you know really really funny and I think generally a incredibly supportive community to each other yes yeah well I think especially now there's so many opportunities I don't think people feel like is starved I think there was a famine mentality that was going on way back in the day when it was everybody competing for Tonight Show spots yeah and then every now and then someone got an HBO special and that was holy shit there was not that many HBO specials but other than that you had to do talk shows and you had to do like a few minutes on a talk show or you know maybe you were like a Richard Jeni who thrived in that format and you could do 30 tonight show things and then fill up arenas because of that but for most people it was a scratch and claw environment people were fighting to try to get a sitcom and fighting to try to get movie roles and all these there was not a lot but now because of the internet because of YouTube because of social media and then a Netflix which was giant there's so much opportunity like and the comedians have also found way more of an audience there's way more audience out there because people realize that girl looks are so as a new Netflix special oh look Jim Jefferies has a new Netflix special oh look bill burr has a new Netflix special and just keeps going and going and going and going on it's like it's almost unstoppable I remember when I was a kid there was nothing there was just like Robert Klein would have a special every coming year and then George Carlin every couple years they didn't give the hours to many people and there were so many people that probably could have done a Netflix special back then sure and they didn't have the audience they never got the shot and you know and they just sort of stayed at a certain state in their career forever yeah you know it's just this is an amazing amazing time for it yeah and it's good I mean I watch people I'm like God and that's people are fucking great I really like watch people I was watching Ray Romano the other night his act was just monstrous yeah he was so strong haven't seen Andrew Santino at the store oh yeah fine great oh I'm yeah end up here like yeah I mean so good it's it's exciting I can't think about it too much because sometimes I think if there's so many people why do it but I'm trying to make it very much about the audience and me and that you know because I make movies and do TV that my stand-up career really is just about getting to hang out with everybody and my relationship with that particular crowd that night like I don't need it to pay the rent so I could do it from a very pure place because it's just about these interactions that's great you know and so and that frees me up to not be nervous and then I could be a little more daring because it's not going to going to think me if anything goes wrong do you think that it enhances your ability to make movies does it enhance your perspective that's a funny I think that when you don't talk directly to the crowd you get stale as to what people are thinking about you know I can tell I don't know just when I bring up certain topics just what people's concerns are and it happens unconsciously oh this is what people find funny these days this is what people are freaking out about this is what people are happy about and when you don't do it you're just alone in a room with your editor yeah you're just sitting in it with you sitting with one dude for two years and I think I also think you're connecting to some you know whatever you're the creativity of the you because you're in spaces with a lot of people with a lot of other creative people and you're hooking into creativity on some level I've always wondered how comedy writers don't do stand-up can do it I've always wondered like how do they know it's funny like how do they know what's their guessing well it's weird to write jokes make a movie and then two years later find out if they're funny that's horrible that's why people say oh why do you have so much improv because I don't want to be in an editing room put in the joke I wrote realize it sucks and then go do we have any other jokes and the editor says no oh so I always want like I it with any scene I always go well that's where the jokes supposed to be here's my favorite let's get eight more and low and then we'll move on I never think like when there's people like the Coen brothers and it's verbatim you can't change a comma when they shoot it is that what again what is with them yeah it's like a play and I respect it but I do not have the courage to assume when I hit editing that I am such a genius that I will not have fucked up any of this in the writing they have a weird kind of comedy though their comedy is so quirky and fascinating like and I guess maybe it's just that that purity of vision that they have sticking to that script and a lot of people do that I mean Noah Baumbach does that no you can't change any of it but I always think I don't know if if an actors on a set Ray Romano is on the set of the big sick and he's talking about his feelings and he has the scene if I go you know you know did Michael Showalter director that movie hey let him do another one let's just let him change it just patella hit the same idea right half the time he beats the joke you know yeah if you have the right cast well that was what Simms did on Newsradio he led everybody just come up with better lines it was a big part of why the show works so well was like we all felt really invested in the creative process yeah and that's so rare and that's I remember of a Shandling would do that on the Larry Sanders show they would rehearse for several days and in that rehearsal people were allowed to screw around and if something good came up Gary wood would write it down and Hartman was the funniest Phil Hartman really was you know when you really make the list of the funniest people of all time he's just so high up on that list it was a remarkable thing I would go to tapings of that show and SNL tapings and at one point I was talking about writing an HBO special with him and I don't know there's ever been anyone more talent in more ways than him now he was brilliant he he really was incredibly disciplined to when I was on the set with him he was becoming a pilot and so he was in the middle of scenes he would be reading flight books and reading books on aviation and writing notes and taking notes his he was so organized like his scripts he would put them all in a binder he would take the script immediately you put three punch put it in the binder and he would have tabs for each of his scenes and each tab had a different color this is scene one and two and he would have everything set up like that and have his lines highlighted and he would practice them and have them down to like a razor-sharp yeah it was amazing he was a really really really interesting guy very unique I don't think I've ever met anybody like him because he also came out of he was a designer graphic artist yeah did album covers and stuff and and he said that he got Saturday Night Live because he went in for the audition and he was retiring because his career hadn't worked out the way he wanted it to and then someone said you want to go in for SNL and he was so ready to be done that he had an amazing audition because he assumed he wouldn't get it and basically was like fuck this business and then that's the moment when he was purest fighting itself and just got it no interesting guy man he was blackmailed while we were on the show and while we're on the show he and his wife actually had went to a strip club and this was like 1997 97 98 somewhere around there so this some asshole at a strip club got a video camera brought in a video camera and filmed like a fucking video camera back then I guess largely it and he filmed Phil and his wife at a strip club laughing just having a couple of drinks and I think Phil got a lap dance and wife got a lap dance and then they left and he this guy put a copy of this videotape in an envelope and nailed it to Phil's garage door fuck with a note saying Letterman's thing it was scary shit yeah but it was different because Letterman's thing was someone he knew and this was not a guy new and this is a guy who found out where Phil lived and said I'm gonna get this to all of the advertisers that you know you do commercials with and all the people you do films with and I'm going to ruin your career unless you give me money call me at this number the kind left it's fucking number so Phil calls the guy records the thing and what did it in the room with me he goes I'm gonna call the guy now I'm gonna call the guy now and we shove in he goes hey buddy what's going up listen I understand what you're saying but you gotta realize like I don't have as much money as you think I do and I mean this is coming I don't want the tape get now but I mean you're making it out like it's a bigger deal than it is and the guy was like look I'm telling you and there's now that guy's like look I'm willing to work with you let's just come to a reasonable reasonable number so they come to this reasonable number in this whole time where he's doing this he's recording this and he gets it to this private investigator guy and then this asshole meets the private investigator thinking he's going to meet Phil and get paid and this private investigator guy scares the fucking shit out of him that threatens his life and you know takes his wallet from him takes photos of his you know his address and you know it basically says don't ever contact him again or your life will radically change in a horrible way and the guy disappeared well that was weird to be in the room with them it feels like closer to our coastal I'm gonna call him I was like weapon his hands I sounds like an Anthony Pellicano special exactly we were talking about yeah that's exactly we're talking about that's that's a ray Donovan shit yeah it's ray Donovan shit it was weird it was weird to be there for that to see like and it's also to see like that someone would like try to weasel in on him film was just such a nice guy just he knew this dude that was like a carpenter the guy did some work with him they got call them out his halt called him horrible sob story you know we're gonna lose our house and this and that I just you know just keep a little bit of a loan and okay so Phil gives my $25,000 now just gives this guy and then the guy calls him three months later and he asked for another thirty and that feels like what the fuck man you know like he was just almost too nice that's about how it usually goes with that it is yeah you never lend someone money and then they go you know what you solved all my problems and now I'm fine and here's some money back it just you have anybody money oh yeah yeah did anybody ever pay you back yes I I used to tell this story just because it's funny my friend Dave Rath who manages Pete Holmes at some point was like transitioning and starting his own management company and asked me for some money not much but the only guy who ever paid me back and quickly yeah and make sense and and is a great man and is producing my Netflix special ah well that works but the only guy to ever do what he said he was going to do yeah it's always these people that have dude once this happens and this is going to happen I'm gonna be making this amount of money and don't worry about it it's all gonna come but just need a little right now it never happens someone said the second people ask for money they resent you and so even if you give people money they're mad they're to ask and they kind of hate you because you they had to ask you ooh that's interesting which which I'd which is certainly what you feel well there's also the people that think that the way to make it is to get somebody else to get you through like you got a you got a call on favors you gather you got to have connections you got to get your way through that way that that's the way to do it somebody gave you a break man you give me a break somebody gave you a break it's just that mentality is so wrong oh yeah they were I mean one thing I'm proud of in my career is there really was I had no ends at all you know I just you know my parents got divorced they were both bankrupt I started interviewing comedians from my high school radio station at some point I got Jamie Masada from the Laugh Factory who owns the Laugh Factory he had a magazine in the 80s and he printed an interview I did with David Brenner and I think I did another one with Henny then when I moved here in 85 I tried to get spots to this Laugh Factory it was still hard to get up there but I didn't know anybody and the person who really hooked me up was Sammy Shore Wow Sammy Shore started the Comedy Store then he got divorced admits he took it over and made it the great place it is but he started a comedy room in Marina del Rey called Sammy's by the shore in the back of a fish restaurant and he let me book it and in return I was allowed to go on and maybe I got 40 bucks a week and that's how I got stage time for the first year when I didn't know what I was doing I would book that Club which also gave me an excuse to call all the comics so I admired and and it's funny like there's those people at a key moment open the door for you but it's not because you knew them it's just because you're willing to put it all the work somehow right right that's interesting man Sammy's by the shore I never heard about that one do you remember the valley improv they had one in the Hilton and Sherman Oaks no I wasn't around for that and then what year was that it's like late 80s I wasn't here until 94 oh yeah late 80s and this guy Joe drew just the manager great young guy I don't know where he is he used to say to me Judd come in wait around if someone doesn't show up I'll put you up and I was like 19 years old and I would wait there all night every night thrilled to talk to everyone because that's what right when Sandler moved to town and David Spade and and Schneider and that's when I first met everybody and that guy would put me on and you know that's the funny thing about a career it's two or three people who change everything for you this is women marry parent who was one of the heads of Universal and I was I sold her the 40 old virgin and she said Judd the second you hand in the script I'm going to greenlight it I so believe in this idea and you and Steve and I literally faxed her like page 92 108 and then she called and said okay start prepping fax yeah faxed it I'm not crazy now Joe here's my question for you okay let's let's talk my work out for a second let's talk my Omega brain alpha brain brain alpha brain now Pete Holmes turned me on to the Alpha brain and oddly it completely works 100% and it's all based on science I mean we have double-blind placebo yet old studies it's not something we invented in terms of like the the actual nutrients and their their response to human neurotransmitters it's all been documented people have known about nootropics for a long time now and I always feel like I'm the perfect test case for a product like that because most days I go in a room with 11 writers in the morning I'm as tired and as foggy as you can be I do not drink coffee so I don't drink coffee at all I just don't like it so I just the only coffee I like as ice-blended mochas which is all sugar right so I avoid it and when I started taking that I would completely wake up and be sharp without like some weird caffeine buzz or sick from it or whatever and I would see it every day like wow I was funny as hell has to have hours and I did not start in that place so I'm fascinated by your general program like what you're doing all day with all this stuff like what's what's the current Joe program well I'm always doing something you know and in terms of like diet you mean or in terms of what work out what's the diet what's the meditation what's the main tenants of your day well my workout I schedule every Sunday I schedule everything that I'm going to do during the week I say I have to do yoga two times this week I have to lift weights three times this week I have to run twice this week and however I fit that in I fit it in but I oh those things okay so I have to get those things and the only exceptions are injuries and sickness so those that that's the the schedule and then on top of that there's other things that I enjoy doing kickboxing jiu-jitsu work those in when I can then diet the diet is pretty strict in terms of like no bread very few carbs no sugar no bullshit like healthy food a lot of vegetables a lot of me game meat mostly wild game and I take vitamin supplements every day I take multivitamins I take probiotics take vitamin b12 and D and a lot of different things I just I do everything that I can to put my body and my brain in a good place so that I'm keeping my engine smooth I'm changing my oil I'm changing my spark plugs I'm making sure that it's operating I mean it's not going to be perfect but yeah I know that I've done my best to keep it working the best that it can who's the person that advises you on like nutrition because argh I know who taught you how to do it how do you do it well there's a ton of people that I've used as a resource there's a woman that I have on the podcast on a regular basis her name is dr. Rhonda Patrick and she's probably the best resource like I sent her something the other day on some new some new study on saturated fats like whenever I there's some sort of an issue there's a new study on cryotherapy or saunas like the saunders are incredibly effective i don't you ever leave the sauna oh so she was a UV rays or what is it the UM what is it called not ultraviolent um breath infrared infrared yes we just got one of those saunas a giant you know the raising of the body temperature like that and heat shock proteins incredibly beneficial to your body there was a study that were they put out recently that showed 40% decrease in mortality from all causes due to people who take regular sauna like it just literally keeps your body healthier well having that massive exposure to heat in the your body producing these heat shock proteins it just it reduces inflammation it just it helps in so many different areas for people and just you know sit down in the hot room it's really good for your body regular is how many times a week for a sauna I think they were saying four times a week but I mean how hard is that man just force yourself to sit in it and if you have it at home in particular I've got your gym just go there and sit in that fucker for 15 minutes doesn't take long to get all this written out I'm gonna how about this I do everything you'd have we make that a special it's the judge does Joe's programs gear up oh yeah you've got a both gun I got well I may have already pulled up I'm gonna build up like your your joints and all that stuff is getting used to that kind of a pounding yeah there's a lot a lot of shit is gonna be happening if you want to do everything I do so I can't just do 12 pounds on a freeway you just you don't want you I mean it's not even you don't you're not gonna want to do everything I do yes like I have a friend who runs ultra marathons and I just started running recently within the last couple months I'm not running a fucking ultra marathon I'm not doing everything hey I'll do everything you do I would break it would break my feet my knees yeah you got to just build up you have to have time to yes there's something about you know when you run TV shows it's all freaking day every day so people say when you work out I'm like there's no time yeah I can wake up at 5:00 in the morning and put in two and a half hours I got Drive my kids to school at 7:40 that's one thing you don't need two and a half hours yeah you could get a great workout in 40 minutes and that's all you need for the whole day 100% you really can especially if you run like I run hills and I can get it done in a half an hour like a fucking brutal workout a two-mile brutal hill climbing workout in half hour I'm exhausted you know this idea of time like how much time did you put in today like you could work out in a bullshit manner for two hours and not get nearly as much done as you can for a half hour hard just running yeah really interval training yeah yeah Sprint's and then relax then Sprint's again but I just think being active and doing something on a daily basis forcing your body to get used to the fact that it's going to constantly being be working constantly being under stress yeah and it just it gives you more energy it's like you you have more of a gas tank you have more enthusiasm for things that's the scary part about Trump his theory on exercises you only have so much energy per day anything that exercise uses it up yeah and so he doesn't ever exercise yeah that's gotta come back at him at someplace not fucking 70,000 come back at him already but he also I mean he's is not mitigating its stress that's part of it as your perspective enhancing for me the most important thing about I don't know maybe they're not the most important thing one of the best things about exercise is that it gives me a perspective a better a more enhanced perspective because I know I'm not coming at it from a bull body like my body's not tense so I can come at things in a calm way I've drained all the bullshit out of my autistic yeah and are you doing meditation or what are you doing in that way I have a sensory deprivation tank so I do most of my meditation in that you do not alter time in yeah I climb in that float yeah I love that that's one of my favorite things that you ever do it no like you watchin you must especially for you because you're working on things all the time like if you go in there with an idea like I'll go in there with a bit like I got this bit that I'm working on right now that's kind of complicated and sometimes I'll just be sitting there staring at the wall just thinking about this one bit because I'm trying to figure out how to how to structure it it's super complicated bit and I'll go in that tank and I'll just sit there for an hour I'll just try to work out this bit try to figure out if there other angles to it as other ways to come at it the only confusing thing is when I have an idea in the tank and it seems like I got it I got to get out of the tank and I got to write things down that you need a special pad in fact I think I need a voice-activated recorder I think that's a good idea yeah I think that's what I need where I can just talk yeah okay so I need the tank you know it's a I have the spa you have a spa I need a hill to run on hills are good I got I need more of my on it products do you lift weights at all no good idea to do a little bit of something just to keep your body strong it's like as you get older your body atrophies and there's just no way around it especially if you're not using it and yeah the only way to keep it from atrophying is to make sure that you put it under stress you have to lift weights it's the only way since your bone density keeps your tendon strength your muscle strength there's no other way you know otherwise you just get injuries people get back into reason arm injuries and shit just starts falling apart on you see I've had no injuries due to not doing anything that's how I've been protecting my my body but yes I do know that that's the thing to do I remember I always heard about Clint Eastwood doing that and I met Clint Eastwood when he was like 80 and I know he's like he lifts heavy weights that's his thing as like heavy weights and he was a car truck at 80 yeah and so but I don't like uh lifting things I don't even like counting we really like having hire a trainer yeah you know get someone to devise a program yeah have them come to you work you out you don't have to do shit you just show up you know like you could do it in your house they show up at 6:00 a.m. or whatever it is and like come on John I got you for the next 45 minutes you're like all right here we go and just man when you hate that stuff really is tough when you haven't like built your brain to love it I've been playing a lot of tennis lately as a way to wait great wake up and but I do know that I need to do it but man it is it when you're like of the mindset that when the trainer comes you want to punch him in the face it's a tough it's a tough thing I know a lot of it is it being a writer your your day becomes about waking up and engaging your brain all day and so you just like look at writers and eat Chinese food and you kick and stuff around and it's like developing the wrong muscle your whole life or at least not only one muscle and I I know that I have to transition into that but it is it is a tough on the way I feel I official to your writing though it is it 100% is I write better after I do anything and what I do do is I walk really fast around my neighborhood in circles for like 45 minutes every day they said you should do that after you're right they say when you write one of the things you should do is go over what you wrote by going on a walk because it's not enough where you're so worn out that you're occupied by the like it's not like you're running where you're exhausted you're occupied by the activity because I feel like when I'm running hard especially when I do my hill sprints I'm not thinking about shit other than left foot right foot left foot right foot don't fall down keep going we're almost at the hill almost at the top keep going keep going keep going I'm not thinking about anything else but when I walk I can think about all kinds of shit so I walk my dog around the name a lot of times after the right just take him we go for a walk yeah and that's like a walking meditation yeah yeah because I'm trying to read a lot like and you guys talk about it sometimes I heard you talking about with Russell Brand just you know quantum physics and trying to figure out how to quiet my brain and to tune into what is left to do to not be crazy mmm and some of that is exercise what is left to do to not be crazy exactly because I'm such a like pop psychology junkie yeah I read that stuff all day long but lately I've been reading a little more like that you know the Joe Dispenza that is named Joe Dispenza yeah but it's you know it's just it's it's like a quantum physics theory that basically you get into a pattern of how you feel and it's in your cell so if you're a depressed person like your cells are depressed and if you get in a good mood your cells try to get you back to depression because you've conditioned yourself to be in a certain mood all the time physically and it affects your whole body and that you can make a choice to change how you are physically by choosing to be in a certain mood and meditating about a certain mood and that you could change how your body reacts physically so it doesn't want to keep you in the same mental state you're used to being in mmm that make any sense it does sort of I guess I'm always real cautious about what what causes depression and what makes people depressed and what you know I don't I don't suffer from depression so like whenever someone says you're depressed because of this I'm always like mmm okay I don't know how to address that because I don't know what I know there's certain people that do have absolute chemical imbalances but what does that chemical imbalance come from does it come from childhood trauma does it come from just some sort of a part of their body that's not functioning correctly like a bad thyroid or a bad kidney is the brain like very similar is that the case or are they in a bad economic situation in a bad relationship we have had friends and a bad job is that what's causing depression like I think there's a host of variables yeah it's a get in the pattern you don't know you don't know why I mean your family - do your parents did they stay together no yeah so you but my step mom or my stepdad rather and my mom have been together since I was seven yeah so you had the stable yes yeah I think that's why I always think it's 90% of it when you grow up in chaos I think you get wired for certain hyper vigilance and a nervousness and anxiety because you think like more bad shits coming yeah if you had any kind of trauma as a kid I think you're wired to keep your eyes open a little wider which also lends itself to some kind of depression it could most certainly for me that hyper vigilance LED itself to martial arts yeah and then it's also we moved around a lot so I was picked on a lot so it's like I was always the new kid I look this fucking sucks you know that that sort of led me to be wary of others and just you know be internalized a lot of stuff sure I think that's what I did I just went to my room and watch the Mike Douglas show watch Merv Griffin did you know you knew so that from the time you were 17 you're working at Eastside comedy club yeah you kind of knew you always wanted to be involved in common yeah from the time I was 10 I was into the Marx Brothers first then like Cosby and George Carlin and lice listen to Lenny Bruce records as a kid I didn't understand them but I just heard that's the the best person and I always I think I like that comedians just called out bullshit and I must have felt like there was a lot of bullshit around me because I called yeah yeah I like that there's like George Carlin was like no this makes no fucking sense yeah and so I love those people and and the lighter stuff too like just silly comedians who just pointed out the ridiculousness of things so I love Seinfeld when I was a kid and n Leno but especially Carlin I think when I was little yeah well Groucho Marx is pretty underrated and underappreciated to this day like remember when he's hosting that show you bet your life oh absolutely so funny and so dirty and weird yeah wait look people like and even like when you watch a movie like Duck Soup the Marx Brothers movie it's all about the ridiculousness of government and and something drew me to those people I think was also cuz I was bad at sports and so I thought this systems unfair like so I'm a dick because I can't play softball yes it led me to like look for something else yeah but back then no one else likes comedy there wasn't another person to talk to about it now I think everyone likes it but back then there was no one was watching Burt Griffin but me really when I was little I mean it when I was fifteen I didn't like come to school and we would laugh about Geoff Altman on Merv Griffin I was just alone with it Wow yeah I became a fan of stand up watching stand-up on TV like watching like The Tonight Show and evening at The Improv and stuff like that yeah but really the big one the run that really kicked in for me was my parents took me to see live on the Sunset Strip oh wow and I was a teenager a young teenager and I remember being in the audience while Richard Pryor was on stage slaying and people were laughing so hard and I was laughing so hard I looked around I'll never forget this moment because I looked around at the crowd while the movie was going on and all these people were like ah falling out of their chair so there me holding their chest and I was like this guy's just talking he's just talking and he's this funny this is incredible I'm like this is an amazing thing this guy can do like I had never seen real stand-up before I had only seen like you know like someone on the Johnny Carson show do a couple minutes and tell a few jokes that in my mind was what stand-up was it wasn't until and I'd listened to some of the old Bill Cosby stuff and some of the old Carlin stuff on on records but I'd never seen it like seeing the movie live on the Sunset Strip and that planted didn't plant a seed like I can do it but it did plant a seed like holy shit this is possible yeah this is crazy that this is possible it's still the best special it's one of the best ever without a doubt he still he holds up in a very very unique way where a lot of comedy from that era just I mean including Lenny Bruce doesn't really hold up that gets caught because because it's contextual like if you were there in that time it was groundbreaking but that's not groundbreaking anymore because the culture has moved on so far and a lot of that could be attributed to his insight Lenny Bruce's insight changed the way a lot of people thought and discussed a lot of like really important issues at that time but there was something about Pryor's his honesty and his his delivery and his point of view that's like to this day like god he was good iíd was a record they put out a few years ago where they didn't tell you what album it was but it was just bits and I think maybe a lot of bits that were recorded when he recorded an album but didn't make the album like it was just it was it was a in eras like 70's 80's 90's and when you listen to his stuff from the 70s it's so militant yeah it's so Milton and it all works perfectly today like what he's mad about yeah all applies to right now and then when he goes honest about himself and relationships you do feel it like oh there's not many people opening up like this right like there's not a comparable person there's a lot of comedians to talk about their lives but he's really he's ripping open the veins much deeper than anybody even now sure and he was talking about horrific addiction issues that he had back then I mean addiction issues that caused him to light himself on fire yeah I mean when he was talking about that back then who the hell had done that you remember he would do that thing we would light a match and and move around with like what who mom Richard Pryor running down the street like and joke around about lighting himself on fire and and how the whole audience laugh was like wow it was crazy there was some some bits where he talked about having multiple sclerosis near the end of his life and he was still doing the comedy store and on audio they were riot asleep funny brutally honest bits about you know what it felt like to be that sick and I don't think it ever was on an album before when he was doing that um when he was coming back to the comedy store when he was really sick before he died I was the guy who went on after him every night every night for like five weeks oh geez every time he did show I bombed so many times going on after Richard Pryor oh it was death how was he terrible he was it was old and he was sick and he was drunk and he was on pills and he probably shouldn't have been there but he just wanted to do it it wasn't good like he doesn't wasn't Richard Pryor it was like they had it first of all he was really unhealthy so they had to crank the microphone up like he could even hear Oh barely hear and you know he would like I always loved pussy like it wasn't there was nothing there yeah he was just kind of talking and ranting and he would you know he'd be on stage with a drink and people didn't know how to respond and they would give him this amazing round of applause when he got on stage and took forever for them to get him to the stage because Chewie who worked the door and this guy Dave would carry Richard Pryor to the stage and slowly just move him towards the stage and all the time the people would be clapping and then they would sit him down and then they would put the microphone in place and crank that fuckin thing up to ten and then he would do his stand-up but it was it was people almost like paying homage all much paying homage they were there they were there to see the great one yeah you know and he was there he's still alive it's like wow we're seeing like the greatest stand-up comedian of all time he's right there Wow you know it was more of that than it was like him doing really well I was never like a good set I never saw him kill and then you would come out I was heat dick let's go out there and just eat plates of shit people were so depressed this is Oh Ann what was your attempt to to pull out of it I would go on stage and I would say and now ladies and gentlemen an unknown white guy after the greatest kamini of all time this do she look in Italian looking kid I would just make fun of myself for a few minutes and you know and then sometimes I talk about how Richard Pryor was like you know huge because it would take a long time for him to get off the stage too so that was the other thing like I would get introduced by Jeff who's a piano man and I would pass Richard and Dave and Chewie as they were carrying Richard off like you'd have to kind of around them yeah and then get onto the stage and then you'd have to say let's Richard Pryor ladies and gentlemen give it and sometimes PC people's eyes they're like fuck like what did we just see like this soda facing their own mortality yeah absolutely yeah and you know Richard they were like I remember like he wasn't supposed to drink but he drank anyway because they had him on all this medication you like fuck you just kept drinking yeah I was weird it was dark I remember meeting him at a birthday party I went with Jim Carrey to his birthday party and and it was it was sad I mean it was it was sad to see but somebody that ill and then especially when you think of just the power of the guy yeah just how crazy funny he was because there's not that many people just stood the core funny they I remember when Robin Williams we used to come into improv in it late 80s and he would kill so hard it was just no way to recover the room couldn't recover yeah it just and there's not that many who couldn't do that now I feel like people could follow each other now you know Louie comes in and you go on after him and you know and like he kills but like when Robin Williams would come in like he wanted to end the show Brett well there was only one of him then you know and now there's like Louie but then there's burr then there's Diaz and then there's there's a lot of guys now there's Santino and Ari Shaffir and it's like there's so many funny people now or maybe the audience understands in a different way and they can transition mmm you know they they're they're used to comedy and then I go now this guy where the old days you'd come on and there's you know they couldn't go and oh we're about to enjoy this this potpourri of people right once you still see people bomb after someone who kills yeah still that still happens all the time but I think that oh maybe I was more I think what you're getting at the store now and this is what's been really interesting lately is you're getting a lot of comedy tourism like a lot of people fly over from Europe just to come to the store a lot a lot and it's worth it those lineups are crazy some night oh yeah I look at the lineup and go did this audience understand how insane this is yeah yeah and there's three shows going on simultaneously there's a belly room the original room the main room and everyone and you know a lot of guys do hat tricks well they'll do all three rooms and one night the sellers like that the Comedy Cellar in New York there's three rooms and you go in some nights and it's like yeah Chappelle's come in Rock just left really tonight yeah Schumer's here there's only a few of those places I had to follow Andrew Dice Clay and Ray Romano had the cellar once it was like the cleanest guy the dirtiest guy that she you know I had the worst sets after ever the oyster could not follow Martin Lawrence oh yeah Martin Lawrence in the 90s sure I remember Chris Rock says that Martin Lawrence was opening up for him in the 90s or but you know before he did his big specials and that he was downstairs in the dressing room and he could feel the theater rocking and he went onstage and he said he had had some shows where he couldn't follow him the way he wanted to and that's what made him work hard and then developed those great specials right because having Martin open for him scared him yeah well he also said that he did too many crowds in front of white people yeah too many shows in front of white crowds and they were just too too happy and to accepting and the Martin Lawrence would just bring the Thunder dude he was so strong before he put the wet suit on and ran around with a gun in the middle of the city and the in the heat like what whatever fuse he blew but before that that fucking guy would go onstage with a leather jumpsuit on and just destroy I mean destroy in a level that people don't appreciate today people forgot about him I've ever seen Gary Owen yes I was is how it's a two in a set I was playing Bonnaroo and I wanted to go on the night before to warm up and I went to zany's in Nashville and and he's there and I hadn't seen him before and I did a set and you know it was okay we wasn't very good it was just fine and then he gets on I don't I've never heard louder laughs I've never heard louder laughs me and my manager Jimmy Miller sat in the back of the room and we were like what is happening and then we start really paying attention going how funny is this guy like like listening to the material like is this good material or is he pandering or what is it then we're like wait and his materials incredible like he is awesome and it was the biggest labs I've ever heard he had a sustained like killing the crowd you know where the place is just rocking in movies on the glasses a lot of black shows yes yeah and he went full 2025 minutes at 10:00 before he slowed it down and had to slow it down he was gonna kill these people and I swear I thought I don't know if I'm in the same businesses this guy like is this what we're supposed to do well when you when you jumped back into it you thought that three years ago you're just gonna have some fun and go and do it when was it that you realize like I am a comic now I got a kind of like really aspire to a high standard like I have to really tighten everything up I think um you know I would I was watching Louie work on his new set very seriously at the Comedy Cellar and he'd say yeah I got nothing i got nothing tonight and go on stage and just crush and then I played Carnegie Hall and I had a good set for the New York Comedy Festival and then as a surprise I brought Sandler out to do a surprise set after me and I thought I did great and then when he came out the laughter went up 20% where I felt it like oh I'm like at a seven and he's at a nine and a half like it was a difference and changed right and I thought oh there's a whole nother step here that I need to kick into gear I always want the material to be good but that oh there's a way to crush that's hard to do to get that momentum and have the ideas and obviously Chris Rock is one of the best of everybody at it cuz he has so many great ideas but understands how to get the room rock and really hard the cadence and the mass and to find what what is in your cadence that does it that doesn't become obnoxious or loud or just you know just talking fast like how do you find an original way to create that energy in a room I think the only way is constant repetition you have to be onstage all the time yeah and you have to really always be trying to improve it and you have to always be listening to your recordings and you have to have and you got to listen to bad sets to and sets go bad you gotta go why did that go bad let's listen this fucking place you're myself in bumble like oh they didn't even hear what I said yeah that's big well I gotta stumble well I got out of here I gotta go pick up a child oh I'm gonna do my end of the show plug children I got the big sick get a website dude okay Squarespace not do that make your own website so you're saying there's a place called
