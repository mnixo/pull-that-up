three two one and we're live sugar Shawn and Tim Walsh your friend that you work with you here today friend teammate coach brother from Montana Montana people it's good good place yeah it is but for what we do it's not the best place yeah how much training can you get in Montana it's not not the best spot like when I was there two years ago pheasant hunting with Anthony Bourdain and that guy is such a maniac he trains everywhere he goes every day and he found some Club some local jiu-jitsu club in Montana and Bozeman I was rolling with people Brian D yeah Bozeman is probably one of the better places to train but the one thing good about being from Montana is when we're in Phoenix it's like a big process getting a fight sugar how many amateur fights you have yeah I had 14 MMA fights amateur MMA fights for kickboxing couple boxing every weekend man yeah so Montana people just angry just wanna fight you can just like to fight you can just sign up that week and fight so I get a ton of lines no Commission no Commission oh so it's a manly place that Montana yeah yeah it is it's quite manly I mean you guys have grizzly bears and shit whoa el grizzly bears wolves you know I was there two summers ago I went and just was like man I need to figure out a way I'd spend more time here wasn't Bozeman oh yeah Iceman it's beautiful oh yeah it's fucking stunning yeah I definitely want to I enjoy being away from there right now just I grew up there Brown being in Phoenix is like I wouldn't want to be anywhere else I love being in Phoenix the training there's insane yeah where we're at Phoenix is like the fucking mecca man like we get a train with all gusto Mendez to Kineo every day like he beat Hoffman as he beat Cabrini oh he beat Ryan Hall he's you see all these people in almost every mile there's a really good gym like boxing do you have jujitsu gym wrestling gym Henry pseudo has a club there the MMA lab with John crowds like where we train yeah killers everywhere yeah that's one of the best spots in the world for sure Phoenix is there's a few hot beds for MMA obviously la is a big one Miami's a big one Phoenix is a fucking huge will do though yeah the lab like it's it's a different type of gym than a lot other gyms I haven't seen many gyms like stay together and I think a big reason is because of John Crouch he's like one of the best facilitators out there he keeps everyone together if you don't show up to practice he'll text you and say hey where you at we got to get our priorities straight and he really holds everyone accountable and I think that's why it makes it a really good strong place yeah he's one of my favorite coaches he's uh he's just a super no-nonsense guy never blows his own horn not looking for any attention and absolutely knows a shit like when you hear him in the corner he knows his shit yeah he's good to have there in the corner man he just be the leader kind of of everything and look over everything and like he brought up Benson from when he was a small like just starting so it's like we're lucky to be able to learn after that and be around Benson in the room Mike he's got a work ethic like no other like there's no one there still joining the military I heard he was thinking about joining the military I think is too old now is he yeah I don't know about that how old what is the limit I thought you could join the military like up to like 36 or like just once you get across a certain age they have to make an exception for you know yeah beast yeah so we're lucky to be around him like the work ethic he brings in the rooms like no other like two and two wrestling drilling I feel like he'd break any man on this planet like with the pace on you and it's it's pretty cool to learn from we're lucky to see it every day yeah I mean that is one of the most important qualities of important qualities in a fighter right being able to perform under pressure creativity creativity's but I think that's one of the ways places that you excel you really excel in creativity like when I watch you fighting like this kids fucking around out there like you're having fun you're flowing you know when you were telling me today we were doing a little practicing you were saying that you were doing some stuff in fights we just thought of it like why you're doing he just felt like doing it like there's people that can do that and there's people that never do that you know when they're in the fight they're tightened up and their fucking stick into the script and maybe even stick into like the real basics you know like barely even speaking in sentences right I know you can't think a lot of people think too much when they're in there it's easier to say I feel like when I'm in there I'm reacting I'm letting my letting all my training take over I'm not really thinking I'm just reacting to what they're doing and I think that it helps me do what I've been doing is just reacting to certain situations and I just feel like I want to step ahead of them whoever I'm fighting I feel like I'm a step ahead of them he's really good at like the greater the chaos the calmer he becomes and that's the that's the truth the bigger the brighter the lights are the more he's shining and completely calm and before that last fight against uh Andre we watched probably four of Connor's fights right before we walked to the arena and sugar sitting there zoning in on those fights watching the way he walks out watching the way he's good with his energy smart with his energy and you can really see it in the fight the way he mimics them and sugar can watch someone someone do something and he can do it right away it's a really cool talent yeah before the last couple fights before we go to the arena we just thrown fight past watch Connor watch him walk out watch just watch him his body language and Connors he's the man I love Connor I've always loved Connor since since well I remember watching his first fight against Moses first like max Holloway was that first one you've seen in the UFC yeah remember watching him I like that dude's gonna be good I think that was his first fight he blew his ACL out in that fight yeah that wasn't his first I don't think it was Mitch no might have been Marcus permit was it yeah I stopped the stopper image and then he blew his ACL I want to say in the first round against Holloway and he started controlling him on the ground and taking him down but that was a very young max Holloway to you know you're dealing with Holloway when I think he was like 20 or so see ya he was young yeah super super you either be fuck he's a beast too though he's cool remember he came down to the lab once I didn't we just kind of play around spar but he's I'm excited for that he's fine or tagging action by 70s very I'm very excited about that I hope and I get him get get in there hope we can get some tickets that's gonna be sweet yeah dude I'll hook you up he's he's fascinating to me max because he's just this guy that like I knew he was really good in the knees kept going better and kept getting better mag where's the ceiling on this guy and then you saw in the Aldo fight when he beat although the first time and then the second time the second time you like Jesus Christ like you you you really don't know how good a guy is like you see them in a fight and go wow he's really good but then you don't see him for a while and you're like is he better has he slipped is he is he training hard like where is he at like you don't know until you see him again and then when I saw him in that second I'll don't fight him like Jesus he's so much better than he was before he yelled at the end of the first round he looked over at us and he goes demands tired ha ha like at the end of the first round I was like Jesus he was in awesome and Aldo was throwing bricks at him he was really throwing hard in that first round try to like establish some distance at all hit him with some shots but he I mean he hits Harvey and rock him you know all his Max lost he's only a lot well in the UFC he lost to Dennis Bermudez Khan somewhere early in his career he lost it Conor I think he only has two or three losses in his career three three losses who are they to does it say and Dustin Poirier Dustin Poirier Dustin's 2012 good watching him fight that fight against gachy I was I watched it live that was that was crazy he's a good I thought that was kind of how how that was gonna go he's gonna outbox him he was doing some good combos Justin's leg kicks are a motherfucker but he takes too many shots he's just he's so intent on breaking people and just keeping that pressure on you that I mean he's a fucking really good wrestler oh yeah and you never see any of it in his fights I think he posted something that he's gonna kind of switch up did you say that yeah I think he did but then he also said he might only have five more fights left well if he fights that way yeah I mean he's just he's just fucking chaos it's just he's a berserker but it's so fun to watch him it's like you don't want to say anything - um peer entertaining you know I mean fuck yeah he's the Eddie Alvarez fight and the Dustin Poirier fight but they're so similar in a way that he like almost gets the guy with his leg kicks almost breaks him with those leg kicks and then he got caught worked in the Michael Johnson fight so it's like when you see it in the Michael Johnson fight when you see like Johnson's leg just starting to give out mmm we watched Lewis Washington father Luis Palomino in the elephant with an elephant he's gnarly to watch live and he kicks low from real close man generates a lot of power yeah he's like he's literally tying up with you and he's chopping down with low kicks he's got real loose hips with that yeah he's able to really bend his body and chop down nice and tight my god wait yeah come in he fucks people's legs up man he does telford shit crazy when you see guys like that like when they start to get beat you wonder if they're gonna start use those losses as informative or dubrow demoralizing start defining themselves and then start questioning themselves that's why we sugar in training and in a fight even in training like he'll find the toughest guys to go with and you won't go with those guys and I call it they're better than me and start to find himself we'll just use it as informative mm-hmm and learn from it so it's like it's another good mentality he's has super positive good mentality and I think a lot of that comes from eating good and having the right rest and hydrating and eating good year-round not just eating good during fight camps and blowing up and I think a lot to do with for sure even that lifestyle just eating healthy like you said all year round not just getting healthy for six weeks and then eating like shit after and getting injured once I've really started learning about eating healthy a ton of small little injuries went away and my back would hurt every morning is that what you doing wrong before like what were you eating pop-tarts I should looking just anything shitty I didn't know hot pockets drama and any all that stuff that just raised eating you know and once I started realizing what that stuff's doing to my body and how I could feel it mmm it changed change my whole mindset like eating healthy was one of the biggest things that improved my skills as a fighter I feel like just as far as my mental thoughts um my training sessions were so much better well you just saying they eat a lot of sardines I know I said I ate some sardines last night and then I had a son this morning that is a very good food ya know they are dude we're so so lucky to have the internet and podcast and be able to learn from guys like you dr. Andy Galpin like Aubrey Marcus tim ferriss like Chris crasher you ever listen to some of the episodes with Chris Kresser fantastic on information.if fantastic information on nutrition you know there's so many guys like that Rob wolf you know so many people that are like at the cutting edge of performance and diet and Rob wolf is interesting too because he experiments himself on it with his own body quite a bit and it talks about it online and he's getting really heavily into jiu jitsu right now and he does a lot I mean he's really interesting too because he does a lot of ketogenic stuff but really adds way more carbs on Jiu Jitsu days and I had Zac bitter on Zach one the he was the American record for 24 hours his American record for running 24 out the most amount of miles in 24 hours he's yeah he's a fucking beast I don't need that he run and what did he run like he ran 24 hours straight yeah yeah a full day of running that's what we're trying to find the balance though like we're you know you don't want to do that on days that we're not training we're doing we're trying to do keto so we're just keeping the inflammation down in her body but he's bitter guy that I was gonna say he he's a full keto guy he's mostly eats meat but on days when he has there it is he broke the u.s. 100-mile record that's what it was seven minutes per mile for 12 hours that's that's the record that's right what a badass he's a he's a fucking sad wonder his mental thoughts are running I wonder if he's just just in the now just goes he's got to be in a trance but he on days where he's running he way ramps up his carbs so like you know the average person is trying to keep their carbs within like 50 grams or 75 grams to steak he'd oh you got to recognize that for extreme requirements like physical activity ramp that shit up so Rob I'm mostly saying that Rob wolf is really experimenting a lot with that you follow him on Instagram he's big up on that yeah like in we listen a lot of Ben Greenfield - so he's fantastic when we're not training we're listening to you guys it's like we're treating you guys like a College like your guys at our College and then we're going to our jujitsu learning from two Kineo going to learn from John crouch and like I don't know I feel like we're on a really good track especially for sugar now how do you guys know each other how'd you guys meet ooh good story I I was going to commentate and I was with Bellator at the time and going back to Montana to commentates for some fights and doing for Bellator fighting for them yeah and I went to commentate some local fights up there and I saw Shawn he was 18 18 at the time and I saw him I was like damn I kid submitted a wrestler in the first round and I knew at his Jimmy doesn't wrestle all my kids got some good talent so I invited him down after I went him to him and I said hey dude you can stay on my couch for a little bit and come check out the gym kind of figured he wouldn't and I remember I remember the he told me that I was so jacks I knew Tim I seen him on TV I didn't meet him person but I seen him on fella Terry's on the fight master show and after my fight we're at the sting bar like a local bar and he came up to me and he offered me that I remember I think I called you the next day I'm like hey dude yeah I want to come down we figured it out I think I came down a few weeks later months later I came down for 10 days and it was like one of the most the biggest ass when I've ever got in my life remember when we were driving from the airport he was talking like yeah I mean you were going the top I'm like this kid has no idea what he's about to get himself into taking him to the pro practice with all the people because as soon as you get on the team everyone fucking hammers on you I was on you beat you they break you down mentally to see if you're gonna come back so I was there for a full week so Monday is striking a Tuesday wrestling I literally did not know how to wrestle I didn't notice single leg was did not know anything about wrestling I remember a good group of people just whooped me bad I'm never crying leave in practice in high school no nothing nothing what and you what part of Montana you from Helena the capital um but yeah I never saw a boxed a little bit but I never never wrestled didn't really grapple I remember I knew one arm under an arm bar off my back cuz the only thing I knew and that's what I caught that wrestler and I caught him in an arm bar I surprised I didn't even I was like holy shit I just did that but anyway I came down got beat up bad for a week went back say went back to Montana saved up $2000 packed my car drove down he was living with his girl at the time we stayed there for two weeks then we got an apartment and I'd only known Tim a little bit but we got an apartment close to the lab and I just literally went every single day twice a day when he first showed up he like I was gonna I smoked some weed in the night and he was so taken back he's like holy shit he looked up to me couldn't believe that I was doing that drug you smoked weed my god a detective in Montana and I just I was raised like weed not good not good like that's what was going through my mind I thought was bad like really bad we did about it oh yeah one of the few places that went backwards with we yeah they had medical marijuana in Montana and now they're removing it they're removing all the stores when I was there they were like they were having some sort of a closeout sale because they were they were getting shut down I don't know if that's since been amended or fixed no buck and when he moved in when he moved in I was like okay these kids fucking pissing me off he's not picking up his shit he'd not not doing his dishes he eats I mopped it all that fun and I'm like okay I either could get pissed off and kick him out but now I realize I'm like he doesn't even know he doesn't even know so I'm gonna work them I'm gonna try to treat him like my little brother and help him and he was willing to like kind of follow along and then he started slowly starting to eat better started to eat spinach and his back problem started to go away and what kind of background I just my back would always hurt is always inflamed always I don't know what it was I just do not I remember getting it looked at my lower lower back it was it was it was nothing it was literally from eating shitty food is good just all the inflammation from all the shitty food I was eating and I didn't know that at the time I remember my mom took me in there I got beer and backs fine but it hurts so bad always I started eating more anti-inflammatories I started making shakes with spinach and almond milk and blueberries and chia seeds I started eating healthier and I'd slowly noticed like oh I feel better I started so I started getting more into eating healthier I remember just recently I had a vegan diet for six months and the people on Instagram hate me now that I don't eat the vegan diet anymore again you go off vegan diet man that's like when you become a Muslim apostate seriously I they want death to you yeah been posting pictures like I posted a picture of I got this grass-fed beef jerky from Whole Foods yesterday got Prai 3040 messaged why don't you big anymore like I don't or just meat like people though they're mad at me for not eating a vegan diet anymore but I I always say like I ate that vegan that for six months but I did I incorporated eggs into it because I just couldn't I wasn't eating enough but I never I never felt bad I didn't feel worse I just didn't feel great once I started eating good-quality meat again I felt my energy levels I'd wake up and my energy levels were way higher I just felt more aggressive I felt more like manly so vegans right now oh yeah contenders I know he lost the contender series fight he weighed 138 pounds he was a vegan at that time I walked sickly just like skinny there's more to that true than just thinking that I had a concussion a bad concussion three weeks out from that fight against Alfred in the contender series I remember waking up in the middle night puking I couldn't train em ever I even woke up with a little headache going into the fight do you remember what was from yeah I was from sparring I got hit hard boom and I remembered the mic but I knew this is a huge opportunity I like the matchup I knew I had to go out there and perform but yeah I was I weighed in at 136 and I walked into the cage at 138 like I was it was and you can even look go back I look go back and look at that video and look just unhealthy but you know we're yeah I just I was so skinny I was like 138 pounds right there yeah but I still dropped his ass two weeks later we went to hang out with her buddy Scott Holtzman in the UFC for a UFC Fresno and dr. Andy Galpin was with him for the week and I knew sugar was with me he watched what the health and that's what turned him vegan so I made sure to ask dr. Andy in front of sugar I said how much would Shawn benefit from eating like elk or grass-fed meat twice a week he's like fucking hugely hugely and then Shawn right there and made the decision I'm gonna start liking this guy's tell him if this if he's this smart and he's telling me that some good quality meats gonna benefit me I would be stupid to not take him up on that and and and do that so and I don't regret it I feel good eating median I feel way stronger it's hard when you see those documentary and also you get a lot of positive reinforcement from other vegans that are very happy that you're vegan yeah they love that you join the team and look people want to be healthy and for the most part eating vegetables is very healthy the problem is we there's a lot of nutrients that you're gonna really have to search for if you're just eating plants and it's the protein is not as bioavailable the amino acids are not as bioavailable it's very hard to get vitamin B without supplementation there's a lot of shit that you're just not gonna get and the like bang for your buck in terms of the amount of nutrients that you get in like a small grass-fed steak versus a big plate of broccoli it's just not the same and they don't want to admit it and a lot of these people dose I think those what the health guys I had them on when they did cowspiracy I think they mean well but they are fucking true believers and they they are not trying to put together a documentary that states all the facts objectively they are doing a vegan propaganda film and on it debunked a shitload of the things we had actual nutritionists analyzed what they were saying go over the studies and they debunked a shitload of what they put in that film that film is a propaganda film and it gets a lot of people thinking this is the way to go it's gonna reverse heart disease and help your body and but they get so many things wrong meat does not cause diabetes like this is nonsense like when they do these studies with people especially like studies that they do on people that show that people that eat meat more than five times a week have a higher instances of heart disease all these different things they don't measure what else they eat these people that are eating meat all the time are eating fries and shakes and soda and you're not analyzing someone who eats sauteed spinach and olive oil and a piece of grass-fed beef or bison or RIT or elk or something like that no you're getting some assholes eating jack-in-the-box yeah like yeah that stuff's terrible for you it's fucking sugar and refined carbohydrates and nonsense and trans fats well that stuff's terrible for you if there's there's no studies that show that eating clean like people have eaten for thousands of years I mean if literally if me caused cancer ninety seven percent of the planet have cancer that's the that's the numbers that eat meat on a regular basis it's like 95 plus percent fuck and then those people like that are vegans they're like oh I'm gonna try a vegan diet and then they're eating all these veggies getting these nutrients that they didn't get before and they're like I kid off that bullshit diet you stop eating jack-in-the-box star jack-in-the-box in the middle of the night sometimes I do go to you ask for comfort it's just fast food processed food you know that's what the problem is it's like people like you're saying like ramen fuck it tastes good but it's not good for you I couldn't eat yeah just like knowing what that what that what it does to you by knowing yeah you are what you eat it's how I can't I can't cheat I can't do it if I know that's not gonna benefit my body I can't eat it it's not from what you eat like a hundred percent and it's so simple you know it's such a such a simple phrase but literally your body is made out of what you eat that mouth pleasure damn an ice cream sundae with hot fudge but there's always healthy you can you can replace all of that with healthy stuff yeah I haven't had any keto ice cream but I've heard good things some people said there are some stevia-sweetened or xylitol sweetened keto ice cream doesn't fuck with your body nice that new halo Topman has that coconut so we can coconut milk and stevia that's pretty tasty yeah well there's there's stuff that you can eat that is good and of course fruit you know eating healthy fruit I mean look man a nice delicious ripe peach is about as fucking good as any bullshit fucking fake dessert you're gonna get anywhere just we don't appreciate it because we think of it as being like a healthy choice so it doesn't you don't get that I'm being a naughty boy reward yeah that you get from you know a banana split or something my to sleep up yep it fucks your blood sugar and that's a thing it's crazy that most people don't know they're like God I just eat and I'm tired and then I just get starving again they just don't know about those blood sugar fucking yeah the insulin spikes and I had a regular coke the other day like two weeks ago for the first time in years how come oh just whatever it was there said I haven't had a co confer ever let me have a coke and I was it was I'm just like it was like drinking syrup like this sugary it was like felt thick when it was when I was chugging it down it was I was like stomach no no but I did feel like shit after it was down I feel terrible but how many people drink those fucking things every day every day first 42 at 34 ounces pop it sorry yeah it's hard cuz it's who you're surrounded with - like fuck dude if you're surrounded with everyone like oh come on pussy just have a good time enjoy your life you're like fuck it right and then you're like exactly that's that's not like like it's such a common thing you are who you surround yourself with but people don't I don't know it's like I'm so lucky that when I was surrounded myself with Tim like he introduced me to eating healthy I remember when I was 19 I moved to the lab every day we have Pro practice Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Saturday every day I was going to the coffee shop and reading mind gym books meant like all these mental books and we were doing it together we were reading constantly improving each other wanting to get better wanted to help each other improve and that's it was so important for me too you are who you surround yourself with and I see people not surrounding themselves with the the best people they can be around and to trap yeah it's a terrible trap and sometimes those people that are not the best people are really fun to be around the problem keeping you back from wanting to be the very like I want to be the best bantamweight in the world like what's keeping you people back from one to be the best of them and just distractions people who are fun to be around alcohol you know even women like certain foods like distractions of what's keeping you back from one to be the best you you know so I just our brains are crazy our brains are nuts yeah I mean just well you got to think about just what you do for a living I mean just that Alone's crazy right the desire to be a professional fighter to desire to fucking kick people in the head and choke them and have them try to do it to you and this is what excites you and that this is what's driving you to go to the gym to improve constantly at I mean that alone is crazy you know and then these the people that are living their lives and drinking too much and smoking too much and eating shitty foods and you know they that's their path you know their but their path is not compatible with your path that's the big key I like how Cal Kings where I said like a like there's gonna be some point your life at Health Germain priority there's gonna be some point when you're old and you have a disease or it could be now but I was lucky enough to like when I was 20 and 21 learning these things I moved in with Robert Wallace and got to live with him for damn this motherfuckers got bookshelves of books super smart and I'm like why is he eating all that why is he go to this Trader Joe's place so I started going to Trader Joe's and I'm like Robert Falls would always say he's like how much he train your mind we trained jiu-jitsu trained wrestling we trained all this how much do you sit there and train your mind and I was like fuck so I just started reading books and started reading about eating healthy and super lucky to learn and be around that guy he was probably one the biggest influence is my life because I was raised Java's witness my whole life and he was raised a Jehovah's Witness his whole life and I carried a lot of fucking guilt for not being in the like religion slash cult and he's like dude you're not a good person because of that religion he's like you're a good person cuz you're a fuckin good person and then just started telling me to read and do your own research don't listen these people do your own fucking research learned a lot from that guy and that look got to pass it on to sugar he was a gem I really really loved that guy such a great guy to be around I mean I didn't know him enough you know really when he died it bummed me out so much was like god damn I should have spent more time with that crazy I was gonna meet him I only met him like three or four times but every time I was around him I was like it was cool cuz he taught him so much I could learn I'd seen like that's where he learned it all from mother Roberts a smart dude yeah that's great she's such a bummer you know a guy like that would want to end his own life like how is that possible that someone was so loved and respected and appreciated it really just highlights you know the the real issues that people who have mental illness and depression are going through you know it's like it's not it's not obvious to people on the outside yeah I never know what someone's you just never know how someone's feeling yeah his brother committed suicide and I think that's what made him start like maybe getting into pills or alcohol and stuff but it was weird because he would always had be the one that the answer for you to wear your problems you have the perfect answer super intelligent so it kind of freaked me out I'm like man I want to I want my life to be like that guy I want to be like him when I grow up when that happened I was like fuck man I couldn't believe it how did you get out of Jehovah's Witness my parents got divorced in eighth grade my mom moved to Canada is still a Jehovah's Witness and I lived with her for a while and I just was super trapped couldn't hang out with anyone couldn't do any sports and I was like fuck I have to make a decision go with my dad and get out of the cult and all the elders like don't do that that's a mistake that's a mistake but I made decisions they have elders to the Mormons yeah and I'm and I made the decision I'm gonna go move with my dad and move back to Montana and then my dad was super into UFC so I started wrestling in boxing when I was 14 and then on from there my one of my wife's well how do I put this vote this person I know was that heavily into Mormonism and they they had people come over the house that were elders and the kid was 20 and he's like this is elder Mike Mike the fuck it is Mike what are you talking about elder 20 dude Oh way out there and get some pussy that is so preposterous you fucker you know and they were they were going to other countries as missionaries you know getting these people and riding their bike South America and you know going up to him and saying hey yeah come join the cult I remember my dad was watching the UFC when I was I had to been 12 or 13 you know I thought it was the whoa I was like I remember telling my mom that he was watching I told on him like he's watching two guys fight I thought it was the craziest thing ever I hated it I did not like conversation like 12 13 years old and I remember literally telling on my dad that he was watching the UFC it's funny looking back on that that's hilarious yeah remember who was fighting I don't I remember he never Chuck and Tito and then your eye appear a favor those were the three guys like I remembered their names yeah yeah do you believe they're gonna fight again are they in it again Chuck and Tito are supposed fighting again yeah when this year next we knows it's for Oscar De La Hoya's burgeoning MMA promotion tell me you're not gonna watch you fucking got me man you got me I mean I probably will have to watch door didn't pick that up I don't think Bellator wants it I think Bellator is cautious you know I know Bellator was talking to Chuck but you know I mean Dana White said it best is a reason I asked him to retire ten years ago five ten years ago I mean look man there's number here it is Tito Ortiz announces he's coming out retirement for Chuck Liddell trilogy is that today oh I may 11th okay yeah it's happening man yeah wonder how their training camps are gonna go a lot of MRIs one two sessions a week well Tito is in remarkably good shape believe it or not he's had a significant number of back injuries but other than the Chuck Liddell fights he really didn't take a lot of head shot yeah you know didn't really take a lot of head trauma you know it was a tough motherfucker man he's been he's been around a long ass time and when he fought Chuck the gap in striking was just so large you know tito was always a competent striker you know he was a strong guy and a great wrestler and his ground-and-pound was some of the best I mean Tito's was one of those guys that never bothered past in the guard he was like fuck you and fuck your guard team quest I'm gonna get on top of you and smash you and there was nobody catching Tito Ortiz and triangles get the fuck out of here with that you were getting elbowed and punched in the face he was phenomenal with Dallas but his stand-up could not hang with Chuck chocolate when you think of Chuck stand-up like it was never like it was beautiful in a lot of ways to the knockouts were spectacular but it was it was it was not sneaky you know I'm saying there was no artistry to it there was no faint source isn't it like TJ Dillashaw style movement or Dominick Cruz or and it was just attack Viking mouthwash just smash people and skillfull don't get me wrong it was very I mean look he he fucked up a lot of really good guys with solid technique but it was just so overtly aggressive like his style was so aggressive that that style just caught up with him I mean he's got he was in so many wars man I mean just so many fucking crazy Wars it's weird the confidence like you see like it's so good I feel like when someone knocks people out early on their career and they're like oh shit if I fucking touch this guy he's gonna fall right sugars knock someone out with every limb on his body so it's like he knows he can touch this guy with any limb and what they do they fucking fall over and I think a lot of people late in their career they never knock someone out say don't believe that at all and I feel like you can see that big-time in fight or a wrestler knock someone out for the first time they're like oh addicted right well Hendrix for a while had some magic power in his hands it was weird but it's weird is that it went away it didn't make any sense if you see like his fight with Martin Kampmann or his fight with Fitch or a lot of the guys he fought he would just fucking one touch these guys and they would fly across the cage like he had magic in his hands lock dude Hendrix for a while me I don't know if he got injured if his shoulder got fucked up if you couldn't throw the way he used to be able to throw whatever it was you saw whatever it was whatever got him whatever got him he'd motivation time just father time whatever it was but goddamn it just went away and then he became not a dangerous striker it's so weird fucking weird and that's another thing like whether it's you sada or was whether they're using those losses there's informative or demoralizing well we all know everyone who has been around gyms knows things that have not been published we know people that have not been caught but we've seen them dip significantly when they had to go off a cycle because they're going to a place where they were going to get tested regularly we've all seen it yeah and it's these are stories that like you hesitate like should the general public understand what the real risks are because these fighters that go to with you say you go to someplace like rising and they're like hey go crazy we don't give a fuck old school pride go crazy we don't give a fuck but then when those guys come over and try to compete in the UFC and the UFC is like okay fill out this paperwork you know give us your whereabouts you got to sign in everywhere you go and then they start showing up and some like Holly Holm has been tested like 19 times they just show up knock knock here time to pee you know let's let's check your blood let's see what's going on your body I'll make sure you're not doing anything stupid all right go back to sleep I mean you if you come from this place where you're allowed to cheat basically and you're doing it all the time which we all know a lot of organizations allow that to happen and then you could try to come over to the UFC you're gonna see depression you're gonna see lethargy you're gonna see people that they're just they're there in a dour mood all the time they're always sad their body's broken down you see they shrink you saw it's you know SS skinned their arms they're not defined anymore fucking horrible but they want to fight and they want to make the money you know hey it's his thirty and thirty if I win you know me money yeah maybe I can go to Guatemala and hide out Doody ball for six weeks I did a lot of fighters - it's like what defines them yeah fucking what defines him that's all they got that's all they saw they're known for their whole life like yeah oh he's the fighter when's your next fight when your next fight and then if you don't fight for a couple months you got people like I broke my jaw my last fight constantly people asking so when he fight hey you don't find he doesn't find it's like how long ago was that in August fucking first punch the fight broke it clean still went into the second round I was trying to finish him trying to put him away because I knew if I win one more I'll get back in the UFC so that was a tough one but uh it forced me to meditate enforcement I had my job wired fucking tight shut for eight weeks and I couldn't talk because my TMJ joint would flare up so I'd have it like bad headaches so I'd had to sit in my chair and I'm like okay I have to do this so I just read started meditating and I might dude there's nothing to eat you just suck liquid through your teeth I have a three-day holiday I remember when I hurt my foot I was like we're in the ambulance going to the wrath that I go into the hospital and I remember thinking this could be worse I could have my mouth hanging off of me and it happens the ER guy there was no one in the ER and they're like you need that the inflammation go down so I had to go two days and drive to another city with it hanging off but like I said I wouldn't trade it I wouldn't take it away cuz I started meditating and I talk now Sugar's meditating and man we've gotten so much fucking benefits from that it's crazy even our joked on it yeah I do in the tank oh yeah meditating in the time on your house have one right here fucking benefit for me it's like when the world gets weird in the world my world's weirdest fuck man no I try to explain to people in like weird being me no one did to be able to just take some time and just go just look at it all through fresh eyes like that's the place for me in that tank you an hour well I like an hour but I do too if I have the time I like to our session would be yeah got it here's what it's all about so I can just do it anytime I want hell yeah like I wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning just drive over here sweet you what's your morning routine like you have a morning routine that you like or do you just kind of acid cardio that's what I like to do or fasted yoga that's my most recent thing as I'm doing either 14 to 16 hours depending upon what my day looks like some intermittent fasting and then I usually either like yoga or running in the morning today was running and then I'll do something in the afternoon either martial arts related or weightlifting related do you drink coffee every morning like when you wear when you wake up or not always but I like it I like these things just nitros who's caveman nitros i like regular coffee too but I drink water with Himalayan salt in it too there's no worse things yeah put a little lemon in there do that every night sometimes I throw a little cayenne pepper or that motherfucker in the apple cider ever even I do that stuff sometimes too I take a lot of probiotics a lot of a lot of kimchi I find like kimchi and game meat is like I've been on this kick for the past three or four months where I just eat kimchi and elk like three four times a week I mean honest do it it's hard when you eat some elk before bed and you wake up hard as a super athlete if you eat elk you're literally eating a super athlete you know like another reason not just dr. Andy but listening to you you talk about it because it's in your podcasts all the time talk about how how beneficial eating those kind of meats are and I'm just saying god I got to do it now just I feel so much better doing it well if you think about like how healthy it is a salmon like a healthy wild salmon that is a an animal that's out there hustling you know salmon making its way upriver you eat one of those things is just loaded with nutrients and essential fats and when you eat an elk man you're eating an animal that's getting away from wolves and fairs and fighting to the death with swords growing out of its head I mean literally it's a forest horse with fucking Spears growing out of its head and they're just out there hustling serious all day you know living out in Montana in the winter in the middle of the fucking winter is running from wolves and shit I mean that's their life you eat one of those things you eat it's like you get charged up I've never eaten it before and they're like holy shit I'm like yeah you feel different right you feel even their get their DNA yeah do listen Paul check Paul check he's the chicken dog i right isn't he know he's been on Aubrey's and stuff he's uh no I'm thinking of Paul vernik yeah I'm thinking of different guy yeah I've have listened to Paul check I listen to him on Aubree's pot he's amazing yeah he's a wizard he was explaining how a pasture-raised eggs verse just regular eggs that we're literally eating the DNA of that chicken and it was I don't remember what exactly said but it would blew my mind I was like he's awesome he obviously there'd be a good podcasting on him that would be sweet do not have them on for show would be so sweet yeah chickens they love to eat bugs and worms and grass and they would love to roam around and if they are allowed to do that they get a dark like an orange yolk that you just don't get from those goddamn grocery store egg chickens those grocery store chickens are prisoners getting little prisoner eggs you're eating that putting it into your body I mean it's better than nothing but it's nothing like a farm-raised free-ranging chicken egg you could get those at farmers markets and stuff like that like but you could tell the moment you crack them open yeah I mean it's just orange like the Sun you know take care of your chickens yeah yeah what's out are they pain it's not the easiest thing really you know yeah you gotta clean the shit and you gotta make sure they have enough food and for me I got a squirrel problem my wife wants kill the fucking squirrels me I'm like they're cute steal all the food they're fat fucking squirrels Oh cuz they keep figuring out a way to get into the chicken coop and get all the chicken food and they're just in there all the time but now I might have to put them to death because I found out they've been stealing eggs the squirrels have now figured out that they can get eggs and so a squirrel was trying to roll an egg out of the chicken coop through the hole that he comes in a little fucker I don't know I don't know I bet it feels good I've never never hunted you know but it feels good shooting and then eating the meat you get it does I'm nervous though cuz I feel like I'd feel so guilty shooting an animal you will I remember I shot up there little girl look at him who's got an egg oh that was that's yours no it's not pull that back Jamie this I had no idea that squirrels did this I had to find out in my own yard these they're egg stealers bro they know how do they know they're so cute they're so cute how do they know they fucking know I try to get a little motherfucker yeah the chickens good chickens don't know what to do that's funny yeah squirrels are they're not smart but they're determined I think I might have to run a fucking arrow through a few of them yeah but I don't want to kill the squirrels yeah that's the see like I don't want them eating my eggs but I also don't want to kill them so I don't know what to do I know it's like they have one line out a way to block off their holes but they keep opening new holes because what this guy did you made up protector boxers I'm not sure working just like my brother my brother says though man if you if you're hunting and you're you're a really good shot you're gonna put that thing away and it didn't even know it died it lived a great life boom it's done and yeah listen man that's the best-case scenario yeah here's the thing though they don't live forever anyway and the way they die in the wild by getting torn apart by wolves or coyotes or mountain lions is way worse than a bullet or an arrow you know I mean the life of an elk is a quick life if you like that one but the one that one's probably only like maybe five years old but the one outside the big one over body mats that one's about nine years old that's how bad as old as you're gonna if you find like a ten eleven year old elk holy shit that guy's live forever and their teeth are all worn down and well I didn't know that no idea yeah they don't live very long you know it's a hustle and there they're out there just fighting for their life and trying to get by most of the time they're just grazing but they'll look up and they'll see a wolf or something and it's like fuck it's on man I have some friends that live in Idaho and you know well I know how has a considerable wolf population and they went on this scouting trip and when they were up in the hills they kept finding they found four dead really large bull elk that were torn apart by wolves over the course of like a ten mile hike they found four of them laying there dead torn apart by wolves and they're like holy shit like this is crazy so the Wolves will eat part of it leave it there it means cold as shit where they are they don't have to worry about the meat going bad so they'll kill it tear it apart and then they'll find another one and then their instinct is to go after the next one they don't they don't like just kill one and say we got enough food we'll eat this until we're full and then when we get hungry go hunt another one know it hunters yeah they do what's called the what do they call it's not like it's they don't call it sport hunting there's a word for it when they kill like they did was it Wyoming was that one crazy story in Wyoming they killed 19 elk and didn't even eat them and they do it for fun no they don't do it for fun they can't help themselves it's like surplus surplus killing they just they know they can get away with it so they just do it and then they'll they'll cash them yeah look at this nineteen out they they were covered off and stack them holy they're not little either bro these are the ones they brought down from Canada to the Wolves they brought them down in the 90s to repopulate Yellowstone because we had eradicated wolves from most of the western states do you see that animal they just found in Montana and they don't even know what it is yeah it's a wolf hybrid I saw a wolf I've read with what the dog yeah wolf probably fucked a German Shepherd or some Tim they do the isle most of the time they kill them they'll kill dogs they eat dogs constantly the fuck that one yeah he's probably hungry or probably horny rather and not hungry yes fuck this dog and see what happens yeah yeah or a dog fucked him or fund her rather right it could have been that series yeah I don't know but you saw it you see that pictures of that thing to me it looks like a wolf dog hybrid like maybe somebody had what is that there's this crazy Russian dog that looks like a werewolf it's this weird Russian dog that's like fucking crazy hair all over the place and if a wolf fuck one of those it would probably look like this thing yeah did you find that thing good pictures of it so that picture sucks that's just the back of it and there's a picture of its head wolf dog shooting in Montana draws international attention to me it just looks like a dog fuck the wolf it's just a big-ass wolves a dog it is a big fucker it's a big animal those are 150 pound dog could be a little pickup dude yeah it could be like at the coal mine yeah all right it's hard to tell and that's crazy they look they're beautiful man I'm glad they're out there they're fascinating but they're rough on wildlife but that's that's their life you know their life is out there killing and the Elks life is out there surviving and the way I feel about hunting is you just dip your legs and your body into that world with discipline with an understanding what you're doing and if you get lucky and you get an opportunity you killing those animals and bring it out and that's like to me that is the cleanest best way to eat meat yeah I just feel like there's no better way in terms of like karma in terms of your interaction with nature the the understanding connection that you have to your food there's just so and then health-wise there's no Monsanto GMO no spraying I mean you're you're eating a pure animal yeah just let me try issue one someday well Montana's the place man go back home means shit it's one of the Montana is some of the best elk hunting in the entire country I'd rather just eat my dad and brothers I'm more of a gatherer nothing wrong with farming man grow your own fucking vegetables you know that's wrong that's the plan eventually we're gonna make a compound and have our own animals hey you guys mean I got a whole couple freezers back there when you guys go back oh shit at home how old were you when you took your first rip of weed weed I was third well not really see I smoked when I was younger but it was only like occasionally at like a party and I always felt like a loser for doing it you know like everybody else would be getting higher who to hurt and but I was probably already drunk anyway you know like when I was 14 or 15 or something like that so maybe I smoked weed a handful of times less than a dozen times until I was 30 and then Eddie Bravo got me into it when I was 30 years old we were doing jiu-jitsu together and he was telling me how marijuana is helping his jiu-jitsu and helping his music and his creativity I was like what the fuck is this guy talking about my dude marijuana just makes you stupid like don't you know did you know and he's like just trialed and when he we got high and I remember thinking like oh this is what it is like wow I did not know same day I believe that feeling like you like me by yourself it's this no it's me Eddie Oh oh sorry I can't believe this we went and got somebody II lock-in oh yeah we didn't look like crazy they talked about all kinds of crazy shit and then I remember I started smoking pot and getting on stage and got rose we're getting real creative with my comedy and then smoking pot and doing jujitsu it was like I can't believe houses owned in it gets you with training smoking pot and hittin the bag to this day is like one of my all-time favorite things I get I get I get freaked out but I just wrap up my hands put on the timer and just once that sweat starts flowing and you start and it's almost like the paranoia and the weirdness of it all you just fight it off by hitting that bag ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom you know and you you hear the bell that says 30 seconds and you're Florian and then you get that one minute off to think about life and the future and the fucking universe and volcanoes and Guatemala and Hawaii and oka the belt goes off again you got another three right three minutes and man it's one of my my Blake it's a it's a psychedelic experience it's like a cleansing experience hitting the bag when you're high I love shadowboxing when I'm high I'll take a rip out at home and just sit they have a little mirror and I'll just shadowbox don't even know how long I just can just shadow Boxford just go do you know what's weird like you feel balance when you're high you feel like like maybe like if you got an injury you feel it more you feel like we're winners are off you know what I mean and like for me I feel my transfer of power better when I'm high like like certain techniques I really get the timing of like when to turn the hip over I feel it more when I'm high like I feel the connection with all the tissue all of it working together I swear it helps you just let stay in the moment a little bit more especially at night after you train real hard and you're thinking about your mind's gonna hurt miles-per-hour take one rib I like gravy I like the lovely everyone always asked about how much I smoke when Windows milk after surgery I smoking all day the doctor said hey what did they do to your foot so I tore the Liz Frank so I I think that fractured it in toward the ligaments what is the Liz Frank um what is it why is it called Liz Frank there's one poor girl I have a fucking horrible injury these ligaments right here I don't know Frank Scott and that was in that that was the yeah I did I threw a kick and I landed and I launched off my right foot to throw a right hand and I felt it snap right there uh-huh because we we watch the replay oh there it is right here so this frank joint complex oh so that's where it tore I'm just glad there's someone smart enough on this on this earth to be able to fix my foot dude think of my mouth I was like five smart people in this world and so you're what do you like eleven weeks out yeah we've got eleven weeks out ten eleven weeks out know I'm feeling about 8590 percent you know I go to the doctor in a couple weeks well you were kicking the bag with that foot I was feeling good yeah like that was the first time I kicked the bag and that felt good that was I was excited about that but it's awesome it's uh it's great that they could fix shit man thank God for smart people I think I would be shocked right now yeah but I guess this this this injury like a ton of people get it and they just don't know and they just they just let it kind of heal and live with it but and what what it was it like like as it was healing like what is it impede what's impede what does it stop you from doing what does it slow you down with what is what does it get in the way of things walking just just walking hurt so bad I didn't do anything I remember the doctor said just stay off your foot I literally played fortnight eight I was playing like I was living a professional gamer life for a month I was gaming eight hours a day I would wake up and I'd go in game for eight hours a day high the whole time and I was smoking like cuz I personally don't like smoking all day I feel like it makes me unmowed and not it's not the weed it's me I feel unmotivated I just don't really like but when I was playing when I was gaming it was the bestest game is smoking all day but uh yeah I was where was I going with that the surgery the foot let's talk about let's talk about smoking weed I like weed as and I can knightly the celebration almost like I when I get shit done during the day I wake up do my wanted to go to the gym come home do what I do eat lunch play for and I go to the gym come home and that's when I'm like ok I earned because everyone is so easy and like I know there's I have a huge following of the people who smoke weed and it's so easy for marijuana to take over your life and and be in charge of you and I felt that when I was gaming and smoking I guys want I like wanna do oh my god I don't whatever take a rip take a rip to grip and it takes over your life and I feel like it's it it's such a powerful drum and I like the word drug such a powerful it is a drug though um Matt a lot of people masks a lot of people's feelings how they truly feel it's so easy to get high all day instead of deal with them certain emotions so I just feel like I feel like people are abusing it way too much now some people certainly on people are and that is the case with everything though it is for sure it is so this foot thing what how do they fix it what is the surgery they put some pins in to hold the ligaments together um there was two options I was gonna get a plate in my foot and then six weeks later they were gonna give me a surgery again to take it out and I was like that does not sound you keep that plate in well I landed a lot of my a lot of my kicks you know you land with your specially with your shin but I learned a lot with my foot like a slap look at Thompson yeah he throws a lot of instep kicks I mean that was the karate way for the longest time I literally member I knock someone out in Seattle with my foot and the dude was out for like ten minutes it was remember that you know I was gnarly literally my foot slapping his jaw and I was like holy shit most certainly you knock people out with your foot I mean that's Phil Davison Bellator just knocked that guy out that was his foot wasn't yeah didn't his foot land cats where do you don't see it coming yeah the shot you don't see coming yeah you're right especially when they come over the shoulder you know those those round kicks that come over the shoulder from the outside that's Steven Thompson kicked me through that that's probably my favorite knock out and he came over like literally look like came over my smile is so sweet it's almost like a question mark yeah almost like that one but you know the question mark one comes straight up the middle that's what I threw the question mark kick landed and then that's when I did it that's my butt oh yeah I wanted to bring this up too I remember you had a you I don't remember what podcast what you're talking about you were looking at my Instagram you saw the I did a kick to a guard pass I was in front of him did a 360 pass and I remember you saying he could do that in a fight if he practiced it a lot and I've been practicing that so I've been doing that for a couple years now and I did it in that Andre fight I was he was up against the cage and I 360 passed into side control and I wanted to bring that up and tell you that but it was it works spinning that people don't know what to do when you spin right I spun it he covered you cover up I'm past I'm already inside control now there's a moment they have to think and when I'm striking as well usually when I spin they back up and cover up like you know I'm gonna go to your body now I'm going your body and I'm gonna go to your head you can get away with a lot of stuff other people can't you so fucking athletic I feel like you could be a pro in a bunch of different sports like his timing in his eyes like what the doctors say you have some of the best eyes yeah I remember one of the eye doctor a few different ones they're like oh my god your eyes are incident there's some of the best that I've ever seen in my life like they were taken back I don't know I don't know if that transfers over to fighting and my distance you know how I see things coming or you found your range such at a young age to not like a wrestler like constant penetration penetration penetration started as a striker so he's got his range down so good in his eyes and his timing in his reaction time is so fucking fast so like everyone sees him and they're like oh that's that's beatable but went with him in front of you it's way fucking well your length man for your weight class for bantamweight you're so fucking long and I told you when I saw you I thought for a second that you might have been the son of Michael O'Malley there's a guy named Michael O'Malley who was my original Taekwondo instructor was a four-time national champion like literally one of the best Taekwondo fighters in the world in his part oh yeah he's very tall and he fought 147 that's like six three they cut waiting yes yeah but terribly nobody nobody knows what they're doing they cut wait and fight the same day but he was he was a beast he was my original Taekwondo instructor he was jaehun Kim's prize student he was his number one student and when I started Michael had stopped fighting he was just teaching and now he runs a school in Peabody but he basically taught me almost everything that I know and mr. Kim mr. Kim took over as well when he came back but when I first started to train there for the first year so mr. Kim was in Korea and I learned everything from mr. O'Malley fucking long limbs it is so fast to eat so fast he was so fast he would do demonstrations on people you know like demonstrations on house set things up and he would see him do things and it was just it was confusing you'd be like fuck imagine if that guy was trying to kick me are you yeah cuz he'd be fucked cuz he was so good at setting things up and footwork and movement and so when I saw you I was like holy shit this kid looks like Michael O'Malley like I thought you were his son that's funny like I really did I was like holy shit his son is fine cuz I haven't talked to Michael in a long time that I really think that you were a son not even nuts that would have been yeah I was like wow when I see this kid I gotta ask him no I hope not maybe I'm a dad who knows maybe someones on trial and journey massachusett Massachusetts yeah so when you first got together when you four when you two first got together you were 18 yeah when he first caught when he was commentating the fight I was eight down how old you know 23 23 and so you guys have been hanging out together and training together the entire time yeah we've been best friends the entire time so it's like and sugar really like looks up to me and Trust is my opinion and he listens to me and that makes me have to up my game you know I have constant after research because I know he trusts me and I know he looks up to me so I have to make sure everything's really top-notch it's it's it's nice now that I'm in a position to where I can he's he's my coach like he's my main coach I can I'm paying him to be my coach he's focusing on me my diet watching videos he sends like on Instagram you'll send me videos of like we're I'm did use my favorite sport in the geet that's probably what I've trained the most in like since since my sir just pretty much what I've been doing is just drilling in the ghee he teaches at gents soul fighters and I go there drill Monday Wednesday Friday but he's constantly sending me videos of nutrition Jiu Jitsu sleeping just any anything any knowledge he's sending me so it's he's such a huge benefit to me to become in what I want to be and is so awesome like we're doing this together so it's cool member being 19 in the apartment like this is what I wanted everything like training and to have to have him here with me even just being here it's this so awesome to travel everywhere everywhere I go he's were going place that we're traveling more training everywhere we go or training it's awesome so how satisfying is it for you to see him in a position like the andre fight where like i thought you made a big leap in between that fight and your who's you that's right which was a very good fight too but i was like damn this kids getting better I'm like you're you made a leap you were doing a lot of like weird unpredictable shit in the sukham taught fight you were moving around a lot and I was like you looked real confident and like you were just constantly moving forward how how much is it like how good does it feel to watch someone improve like that dude it feels just as good as as if it was me doing it sometimes more right like sometimes like sometimes more that's I'm like man yeah it feels fucking good but I ever after every fight I'm like dude let's treat it like we lost or as long as that fight always said that he said I go out because I'm cute I'm ten antennal right now and every every fight I've won he said let's pretend you lost and I've been improved so much in between fights because I live this lifestyle I don't I don't I don't really party too much when I do I like to party though but I don't really party too much my life's my life is MMA it's like my morning is training my afternoons training and he's constantly saying after a fight let's pretend we lost let's improve and I've been printing from that Alfred fight to that Andre fight that was less than a year feel like I improved the most I was just constantly learning it's the sports fucking awesome man it is fucking awesome for it's so awesome it's a fucking crazy sport too though right it's so nice to cuz like fuck we're getting bored it's a little bit let's go wrestle for a while let's go box for a while we can always bounce back and forth it's pretty clear fuck around with any weird stuff like Wing Chun or you know no or anything mushrooms yeah I think so too I'm Matt yeah that's what we're kind of like dealing with like with sugar like cuz we're really starting to figure out like what ego is and like know some really really shit you know Eckhart Tolle sure I've been there I've been listening to a lot of podcasts about ego and Aubrey Marcus and with Auburn Marcus and just a bunch of different people and it's scary learning about your ego and like who you really are and who you ego is and r understanding there are two different people like fighting in this whole life this whole like a like Instagram is basically your ego that's who your ego is I feel like for me um Instagram yeah I feel like social media or you know for your near like you push out what you want people to think of you like that yeah everyone does like you post what you want people like that's what people are gonna think of you as whatever you post right like and then like realizing because like I was broke last year this time I was per much broke and now I have a good amount of money and it's um I'm realizing money doesn't make you happy materialistic things don't make you happy and I know everyone says that who is it what's Jim Carrey's quote like I wish everyone could be rich wants to realize that they don't want a rich and famous and famous to realize doesn't make you happy because I have a lot of people like my little brother I was telling I'm trying to like get him I want to pay him to help run my youtube channel I'm like he could make sixty thousand others years bah bah bah he's like oh that's not a lot that's not enough I'm like like dude you could literally not have to work you know and be like help me when they youtube yeah do but I'm trying to get millionaires and it's just like that's not what makes you happy and I'm reading that out like at a young Adams like I'm under stated by money I love money and I love just this whole fight game is just all about just I feel like I'm learning so much it's hard too hard to explain my brain and I'm still trying to figure out all this everything I'm learning I'm listening to so many podcast every day reading so many books every day and I can't really explain what my brain but try try to explain what you were your original thoughts so like you feel like what you're putting out on social media is the ego and what you really are like who you really are is something different well yeah I think just humans in general we're all at the core we're all just want love and compassion and so you want that from fighting fight like what makes me truly happy is training jiu-jitsu their training in general eating healthy and being around people I love being on my dogs watering my flowers like that's what makes me happy that's what makes what kind of satisfaction do you get from fighting to show I love work I love performing everything that little kid I've always trying to perform in front of whoever was around my if we ought to get together a family I was always being AB laut if not just trying to perform and do something I loved performing like that performing in front of huge crowds like he was saying the bigger the crowd the more people watching them the better I feel like I perform ya know when you start learning about that stuff and take mushrooms it really opens your brain yeah different pathways changes how you look at yourself yeah mushrooms are one of my favorite things I've ever done I've done mushrooms price five times and it's it's we're right right after right after a mushroom trip you feel you're so much more you realize everyone's going through shit like everyone is going through something makes you want to be nicer to people they're gonna be kinder you know and then I get four or five months later you start getting into your annulled ways and you get to mushrooms again ya need a reset have you done DMT I have no I'm actually kind of scared to do damdeok's I know like that that's what's hard well might you go like like even mushrooms have like they attack your ego almost kind of you know what I mean yeah now we need that and I knew that you go to keep I don't know it's it's you need your ego right now so we said yeah we I don't know no like Connors ego is huge Connor you need to have a big ego you need to have an ego just to do anything we but is it the ego or do you need to have the desire to achieve excellence it is that always the ego can you do that without the self can you do that just as a task as a goal and be completely committed and single-minded in your approach to try to achieve excellence can you do that without the ego can you do it as a project can you do it as a task I think so I think you tend to but I don't can't you build this character that I want to build this person this persona but why do you want to build a persona because you see Connor do it no it's it's it's fun right this is it's the whole fight game is like that it's just fun right like I don't Pleasant know if we build the persona the bigger checks are gonna come right yeah like I'm not trying to not be me like everything I do is Mia like I just I don't I enjoy trying to find a happy medium like a happy medium my come on its podcast later in life and I'll explain more my brain running so much right now no this feel like it's overwhelming course man dude when I was your age I was a fucking idiot you know you're way ahead of the game it's just a part of life is you know five years from now you've been like God back then I didn't know shit yeah there's maybe five years lady but God back then I didn't know shit the more you learn the more you realize you don't know hey we get it mad at our parents and stuff like come on please listen to me eat healthy like read books I'm like our parents didn't grow up with the Internet like we're so lucky to be learned from you guys it's just impossible to change people's ways they have to want change they have to be motivated they have to it's it's so hard to change people it's like if you've ever had a friend that's been into drugs and it's been all fucked up and you can't get them to quit or an alcoholic it is almost impossible to talk someone into changing they have to have some motivation that's internal yeah and that's the same thing with eating good the best example you could set is by living your life in a healthy way yeah fuck yeah yeah that's one of the best things about the internet you get to see all these people that are doing things in a healthy way and doing things that are exciting and inspirational and then it makes you want to do stuff that's good it makes you want to take care of your body and makes you really want to concentrate on your mind meditating and just really get everything in order yeah meditations so awesome it's really helping me every morning I meditate for 10 minutes and I feel like it's helping me throughout the day understand why certain thoughts are coming up whether it's from my childhood traumas or just and just anything just certain patterns my um cultural condition thought patterns cultural conditioning just meditating 'he's helped me almost kind of slow my brain down and redirect my thoughts if i get angry or something or something covens understanding why I'm getting angry hmm and I think and I'm so excited meditating I did it for the Tyrion where if I did it for the honor fight and I would do it randomly or in camp I wouldn't do it all then now I'm doing it I want it to be a part of my life every morning I've been doing it for the last mile long do you do it for 10 minutes 10 minutes every morning and how do you do it well I I've been listening to Sam Harris um guided meditation there's an app called headspace that has a bunch of packages that whether it's stress anxiety sleep positive thinking I just I just do the guided meditations I have a little meditation room I go down in there I first thing in the morning I get up I put the lemon in the sea salt I hydrate I go into my meditation room push play sit there 10 minutes meditate then I go outside water my father morning routines my favorite thing I need a I wish everyone have it set a morning routine because it's really like it sets you up for a good day it does I just don't have you I don't remember last time I had a bad day just morning routine sets me up for a good day I love it yeah I agree I agree in routine John Danaher won't wrote some really fascinating piece on this Instagram about routine about how important it is if you're a great athlete you say you find me a great athlete I'll find you someone whose life is governed by routine and that this is the way to check progress and this is the way to constantly be moving towards your goal and I remember reading that and I said to myself this is something that I've always known but never verbalized I've never said it yeah but it's something that I've always known like yeah like everybody who's really good I remember I were at a Sports Illustrated article long time ago about who's that fucking track-and-field guy who won the olympics a bunch of times his name was something Moses I forget his name see if she could find this guy's name it was something but but he was like an elite track and field guy and I what's up Edwin Edwin Moses he was a beast and just super super disciplined and I remember he had like this routine where he had his notebook and he would lay his notebook out and write down all of his different routes and he had this like map that he would lay down he would do his stretching routines and all this stuff and I remember thinking like oh this guy this is his thing he does this all the time he just gets there he locks in and he does this and this was many many years ago I might even still been fighting when this was going on so I remember thinking about it going okay like this kind of this is like what elite performers do when they when they would they're at the Olympics you know track and field it's so fucking boring you're doing the same shit just running like you have to have a mind that's made a steel to be able to do that same stupid shit every day to try to get an extra tenth of a second here all right a thirty second there fuck all that right but I remember thinking like it was it - it was at the same time horrifying to me that someone would ever want to do the same stupid shit over and over again until they won a gold medal but the same time massively impressive that this guy had this kind of iron will there it is every time Edwin Moses placed his feet on the blocks from 1977 and 1987 he won Moses arguably the best hurdler ever won 122 races including 107 consecutive finals and set world records in the 400 meter hurdles four times within that 10 year span his journey to the untouchable to this untouchable level was marked by personal innovation and determination proving that elite coaching and state-of-the-art facilities are not required for supreme athletic success and it was I believe it was Sports Illustrated they had an article about this guy and remembers just seeing how motivated I was seeing him stretching and working out and and going over his routine and I was thinking to myself like I would think about it every time I worked out that like what would Moses do how would ya how would mow is like I got a start writing shit down I got to start really thinking about everything I do and I got to start putting it together on a daily basis like he does that's what Robert Falls his favorite formula we'd always say it's consistency over time equals results was a favorite formula I got tattooed on there and it's funny he's like once you get good at one thing you realize like fuck I could get good at anything you know what it takes his fucking consistency dude miyamoto musashi he wrote that in the book of five rings once you understand the way broadly you will see it in all things sweet yeah and that's a dude who fought people with a fucking sword Oh God that's this guy that's him yeah well I read that book when I was like 15 or 16 or something like that and he wrote it in the 1600s Matt Haley yeah maybe it was 1400s I think it was the 1400s now that I think about it oh yeah yeah that's what the sixth number six was he killed 60 people in one on one sword fights killed killed who imagine your mindset going into one of them yeah well he was a master at that well his thing was so fascinating and I always recommend a book of five rings for fighters because one of the things that it's it's so crazy about it is his thing was balance is that you should be an artist you should be a poet you should be like you should understand how to write calligraphy like that all these things are connected you have to be in complete control of your mind you have to be in complete control of your emotions you have to have complete control of artistic expression and that this was like the way to be a balanced sword fighter like his whole thing was that you can't have any bullshit in your game like as a human being you can't have any bullshit because when you're dealing with one-on-one steel fucking swords whizzing through the air by trained murderers I mean he was the best at it and one of the reasons why he was the best at it was this strict adherence to this samurai way that he was not just a warrior that to be a great warrior you also had to be great at all these other things you gotta have a balanced perspective you couldn't be a meathead right you couldn't bite down your mouthpiece and let the chips fall where they may that shit doesn't work with sword-fighting son that's bullshit like just like he said about with GSP like he's almost too smart thank you like fuck he's so he's too smart and sometimes I'm fighting just like the dumb meatheads go to a certain level but just like he said when you're real smart you can go to a whole new level yeah there's there's a benefit to being a meathead up to a certain point yeah especially if you can take a punch hi Chris Leben there's a perfect example when he met Anderson Silva Anderson was like not today son not today welcome to the next level welcome several levels you know and that was brilliant matchmaking by the way by Joe Silva when they introduced Anderson I was a giant Anderson fan before a fuck because I was watching him in Pride where he was fighting well but then I knew I knew he was better than that he was going through a lot of bullshit and that's when he was with Muay Thai dream team and I think he had learned he left shoot the box at one point in time but then he went over and fought in Cage Rage he fought in England and when he fought in England I was like holy shit when you got to see when he fought Jorge Rivera when he fought leemarie you got to see how goddamn good Anderson really was when he was in his prime so when he came into the UFC he was already in his 30s yeah you know and his first fight with Lee but I want to say it was like 32 33 something like that yeah and he lit Chris Leben on fire and I remember watching and I was saying this I'm like this is the perfect opponent for Anderson because leoben's an animal he's a fucking warrior he's gonna bite down us mouthpiece and come swinging and Anderson is gonna be fifteen steps ahead of him dissecting him and different angles and degrees and as he comes forward is just catching him Bank Bank stepping over here pop Wow and then it was over it was like real quick and that was the world's introduction to Anderson Silva fucking crazy he might have to take a whiz boys yeah please go ahead yeah dude Anderson in his prime something special he was he had achieved that state you know there's this elusive state of total flow and he had achieved that against some of the best fighters in the world you know when you see him when he was at his very best and I just feel very fortunate to have been there to watch some of those fights I think phaidor in Pride is probably it's like him and Anderson those are the two all-time greats of that era right and then Mighty Mouse who's the all-time great of this era the man but what-what was so phenomenal about Anderson was that you would just watch him hit that flow state you know he would he would size guys up to he would see him move around he would start moving around who tests you a little bit move around yeah we give you a minute or two and you be like I feel pretty good I'm doing pretty good in this fight and then all sudden you started opening up on you me like oh shit here comes here it comes just so in the now just react me like he was you know he's reacting yep wasn't thinking too much when he said he tore up with that front kick fucking god damn nasty nasty but he just caught he caught something to Vitor was doing Vitor would fight squared up you know he's always square it we were talking about the way he always fought sort of squared up because he would blitz guys and he always wanted to be able to sprawl and shoot and take you down so he had a very squared up style which made him open here and open here keep kicks yeah yeah well remember when he fought John Jones John dropped him with a front leg side kick to the body well if you remember that don't ya John John recognized that Vitor was standing square as well and John hit him with a front leg side kick right to the solar plexus and dropped him and then Vitor caught John with an armbar Oh nasty super hyper extended his arm that's where I knew John was something special I knew before but that's when in that fight I was like Jesus this guy's not giving up his arm is fucked up how gnarly dude yeah I was squealing if Vitor didn't let it go man I mean hurry let it go rather he didn't hold on to it John got out of it John yeah I hope soon who was kicking Alistair Overeem straight down the middle they were talking about his square stance and they knew that would be open knocked out Alistair with those front kicks in the traffic brown oh yeah remember great Jackson talking about that that was after Travis got back from being fuckin badly hurt in that fight remember that I mean Travis was battered in that fight his body was getting fucked up Aleister was blasting him in the body with knees Travis was almost out of it and just gutted it out I still to this day feel like he somehow another missed his his path you know I feel like Travis when he was on when he knocked out Stefan Struve when you see when he was he used to fight different man he's been around yeah switch gyms when he was with Jackson's he was moving around a lot he was light on his feet for whatever reason man he decided to switch gyms and became more boxer style flat-footed but I also think sometimes guys get to the point where they just don't want to do it anymore or if they do want to do it they don't want to do it like they used to want to do it they kind of want to do it maybe they kind of want to pay day or maybe they just want to win so they feel better again and then they'll pump themselves up again and maybe I just get this one win I'll get back on track but that that weird space of not knowing am I am i a warrior am i looking to get out am I looking to the few that weird space is the worst place it is it's the worst place fight Fighting's just so fucking tough too you don't know what's going on you they could eat something they could have thought about you can the whole night yeah girlfriend problems could have family problems you know I mean but I feel like Travis at his best there was moments in his career where else like this guy iced calmed the dark horse I was like that guy's the Dark Horse of the heavyweight division he might be the champ one day people are sleeping on him but the movement that guy had for a fucking heavy he would see him switching stances and almost like TJ style movement filming giant dude man man those deer legs when they got going though huh well that fight with arlovski that was probably when I was convinced that you know like maybe like the best times have passed him because just first of all I guess him in Arlovski sparred a lot at Jacksons and laughs key although he's had a lot of Wars and had a lot of losses and been stopped a lot of times you got to remember at one point time Arlovski was a real world-class fighter a heavyweight champion who everybody was terrified of when he knocked out Paul Buentello back in those days man he had a piston of a right hand just boom just throw it straight down the middle and he was still skillful guy so apparently in sparring he would get the best of Travis so when they got together he had like serious confidence in that fight that was a slobberknocker do you remember that fight off one round of full chaos both guys got dropped it was one of the craziest one round heavyweight fights of all time and our last he wind up stomping them it's so it's so hard to pick those heavyweight fights yeah like any fight yeah whoever lands first you never know yeah hey who the fuck knows yeah what do you guys think of this colby covington rd a fight this jack for that Jack I hope our DEA busts him up well Kobey's doing what you said you wanted yeah talking a lot of shit and getting a lot of people I feel like he's doing I don't know I don't know he's doing what he's doing it's paying people paying attention look for sure he beat Maya which is a huge accomplishment right Maya is still an absolutely world-class fighter but other than that really hasn't beaten big-name guys and he's fighting for the interim title you got to think that a lot of that is because he's been very smart with promotion hell yeah oh yeah man that's good fuck that's good anybody man I'm in that same what we just said who the fuck knows yeah like I like the matchup though because Colby first of all Kobe's not making 155 unless he cuts a fucking leg off right he's a bigger guy our da was the 155-pound champion so you have to think Kobe's gonna have a size advantage Kobe's a very good wrestler he's relentless and he managed to do something that very few people been able to do with Maya where he just overwhelmed him beat him up beat him up standing controlled where the fight took place when a clear-cut decision did it in Brazil and did it after Woodley did it and did it arguably better than Woodley did it you know he was on top Amaya it wasn't avoiding him in the way that would lead it'd but Woodley was injured in that fight he hurt his shoulder like in the first but it was an impressive performance I mean if you go back and watch what Maya was able to do with like Rick story what Maya has been able to do with Matt Brown my is a fuckin monster when he gets a hold of you it's such next-level jujitsu and Kobe was really never in trouble in that fight so you have to look at that and you go okay well obviously he has fantastic defense solid wrestling base can strike on the feet and knows how to like knows how to fight a grimy nasty fight and he's the bigger guy but then you look at our da and our da at light weight was a fucking mauler was just Merkin people right but then you look at him at welterweight knew like Jesus he might be better at welterweight look how good he looked against Neil Magny everybody struggles with Neil Magny he smashed Neil Magny took him down so leg kicked him dropped him get on top of him strangle him I mean beat the shit out of Robbie Lawler that Robbie Lawler fight was crazy yeah like he just overwhelmed one of the best strikers in the welterweight division overwhelmed from the outside with angles and technique do so yeah it's interesting man it's very very interesting it's very interesting I'm so mad Rd and Conor never fought I know I was so jacked for that Oh almost exciting I was so excited for that fight broke his fucking phone you know he's gonna be a problem for a lot of people is that gregor Gillette's be oh yeah fucking dude yeah and pretty kiyah foxing four-time all-american want one time national champ sugar tougher and shit no hole last weekend yeah I was there motherfuckers getting better better 55 yeah he's getting better he's a beast yeah he's relentless he's a beast yeah he's fucking real solid real solid and and it's got that look you know just super super focused and tense you know there's just so much talent right now MMA it's just such a great time it's going fast I was like watching a little kid at the lab train I'm like holy yeah you'll see little kids wine on bars and shit and Benson Henderson son is gonna be hooked smile imagine developing that way as a little kid just from the time your little your body's developing throwing punches and kicks and then having Benson as your dad teaching your mentality your whole life put Benson to sleep and shave his head club fuckin hairs always getting in the way hey shave his head just shave his head just put put him under just just put on wake up with a shape oh the fuck out of here with that is doing this shit gets in the way it does and constantly doing that I mean yeah look what Rose did she's like fuck it fuck it fucking mache bad she's a beast she's gorgeous yes she really and she doesn't play it up at all no which is they're hot just yeah she's super honest it's gonna be interesting who we get for sugar next cuz it's probably gonna be a five-round er well not what I was thinking because originally after that last fight okay after that last fight when we went to the hospital the a member the post-fight conference Dana White said they said John's fight foots fine because at the hospital they said there's nothing wrong with my foot and the Dana psychic said that so I was thinking like okay guess nothing's wrong my foot I guess I'm gonna fight cuz they x-rayed it with my foot up not again not flat on the surface so I said we're gonna fight July 6 I was gonna headline that card who Adesanya here's Rios on yeah he's headlining that card yeah I'm stoked to headline that card I was so excited for that so that because they wanted me to headliner but I think next fight is gonna be October 6th in Vegas the pay-per-view I'm hopefully gonna get on that card but then after that I would like to headline my own oh sweet so I'd like to fight two more times by the end of the year healings everything's going good so I think October 6 and then maybe in November December so usually how do you decide when you're ready to go full blast again with your foot you just go yeah do you go to a doctor and get it looked at again get an MRI make sure everything's back and plug on it I got an x-ray last time and they said everything looks good come back in four weeks and we'll clear you but I'm really just I'm not gonna listen to like I know how my foot feels like there's days where it's really sore and there's like dude it's good but I know just I feel like like I said about 80 85 percent okay today today it's a little it was so we hit Mitch yesterday and I lifted yesterday so it's a little bit sore but it's like it's like a sore from not using it not like a sore from OSHA injury right so I think it's good it's it's been healing awesome I think I've been doing everything right so I would say it three four more weeks I'll be ready to go 100% did you see the Marlin more honest fight I did I seen the highlight of it so pretty much little fight within 34 seconds dude see those switch kicks that month just because they're so like the person has to be coming forward the distance in MMA is so much different than kickboxing and stuff will switch cuz aren't that great but man he I kids fucking lightning he's a bad motherfucker how tall is he he's short yeah something like that he won't be able to put Jimmy Rivera what is he's a little shorter than him they're both five five six in that range I'm gonna give up I'm gonna give all these dudes trouble I'm just gonna be so long no they can't train for you that's the problem yeah you can't train for you because there's not many people can look like about going into all my fights out there so confident just cuz I feel like you can watch me on TV you can see oh he's fast he does this as that but until I'm in front of you and I'm doing it I feel like it's another another level of speed that they're not they had they're not prepared for mm-hmm and I truly believe that like and I truly every fight like going in that last fight I would I was 100 CENTCOM for I'll gonna knock him out I didn't knock him out but I've had a couple more sex in that first round and you're so skinny and goofy looking people people like fuck with sugar eyeball I'm like hey dude we're at our apartment we had our first apartment there's this big jack guy with a wife beater I'm like oh we're both professional fighters he's like that kid the professional fighter he's like I wanna be a professional fighter I'm like well you come spar sugar at the time I was working at the UFC gym and I got a key he's like all right I'll be there fucking little jackets wife beater I'm like okay perfect so sugar comes out I knew I wasn't gonna team kicks him right in the way the ring and I'm recording it and the guy goes oh so sugars punching him and stuff big kick right to the guts boom poop papel out his pack to shit himself in the ring and I wasn't I wasn't hit him in the head hard I was guy was conscious if I'm not trying to hurt this guy what did you train at all or was he nearly a fighter so I wasn't present guy like like looked hard thought he was on the board way after we were boys after yeah well you know wasn't I wasn't being a bully we was like you want something you sure yeah yeah oh yeah and it wasn't I didn't hurt him I did hit him with the hard body kicking he shoot himself I wasn't I wasn't being a bully no not at all he moved in the ring though and they smeared it all around so I smeared it all around we stepped on it they didn't know he didn't know we thought it's my dog fuck we thought it was a dog we started to tell anybody that he shit himself no and I told him I was like dude Tony hide it he's like no that wasn't me but I had it on my fall out of his shorts but it's funny like in public people always I've also really little bitch oh people are gross yeah there's a lot of people out there trying to chest puff I know it's just think now whatever keep it moving yeah take care folks about yeah yeah yeah stay out of trouble man you got a bright future thank you yeah I feel like I'm staying out of trouble no I feel like you are too it sometimes trouble gets in your way though Vegas is trouble Vegas are you aunt Elena I've been there a few times well my last time I went to a pool party and it was it was dangerously fun I was like oh shit I can't live here I wanted to I had just moving everywhere drinking dancing hmm I'm like this do what he thinks shoot a couple rips right now okay I actually got I got some sugar show oh gee this is all you got it on you the other so this is gonna be for sale next Tuesday you're sure it is yeah who's making out in California I met these guys so I met these guys in Fresno California we were there for our buddy hot sauces fight I posted on Instagram I said hey does anyone have some some weed I get these guys messaged me they they came to me had like a a beautiful little setup with some weed in it some cartridges and I was like Danny the good company there they're a big it kind of beginning to and they're super passionate about wanting to get into the industry so then they made this and the industry meaning the MMA you know I'm just like cannabis industry there they're gonna be they have some they have six I think they won six awards in the High Times this year they're amazing I got I got you some let me tell you something about High Times Awards okay cuz I was a judge at one of the cannabis cups nobody knows what the fuck they're judging everybody out of their mind that I judged they gave me you ever see one of them pill boxes the people get where this like Monday Tuesday Wednesday they're like each one is like you know no yeah each one of those had like a little label on it and each one of them was like you know this is like fucking superstar og this is death crack this is I didn't know what the fuck I was smoking by the time I was on the third one I was on another planet man I mean it's a weird like like I had I'd separated the membrane between this dimension and the next that I was like pushed through like trying act normal nobody was acting normal man it was real weird I'll never forget the conversations that I was having with some of these people this stuff's a cross between lemon head and OG 92 it's ooh it's very good but you know what in this day and age man I feel like everybody's weed is good yeah I can't remember was last time I found bad weed yeah it doesn't exist anymore seriously a little ashtray yes yes day and age who the fuck has bad weed it's like it's everywhere even you go all the way to New York New York is still illegal it's so strange yeah wait for an re lives in New York it's like you can get arrested if you're smoking on the street dude we were supposed to go to Singapore but now they're not sending their UFC I was gonna go to Singapore for the Singapore card or Singapore keep getting made fun of for saying wrong single but they said that you can get tested randomly off the street for for weed and you can go to prison why so UFC decided not to send me wait a minute who randomly tests you I don't know that my manager called me and he said hey UFC at a little meeting they said they decided not to bring they don't really want you to go down there you can get tested randomly and go to prison a few tests for weed so whoa it's not going but but but here's the reality that means that literally like 70% of the UFC fucking roster could test it for weed yeah sure all the coaches but but we're going to Canada I'm at that funny man that's the thing about the misconception about marijuana you know people think like oh donors are lazy and it's a a giant percentage of the UFC roster smokes pot on a fairly regular basis I mean even NFL ain't sports in general yeah look at me especially if you got injuries and you want to relax and CBD just CBD alone thank god damn fucking everybody shoes that I have a buddy of mine my friend Aaron and he was taking ibuprofen he was taking it all the time I go man you gotta listen to me stop taking that shit I go just get some CBD and just take it orally and then also rub it on whatever's bothering you and he did and he's like dude 11 days no pain he goes I can't believe I've been taking this fucking ibuprofen forever now it's just taking CBD oil nothing nothing negative no doesn't fuck your gut bacteria up doesn't ruin your body doesn't get you high doesn't do anything bad Rhonda goes off about ibuprofen doesn't she Ron Patrick yeah she was telling me how bad it is for you gut bacteria seriously gut bacteria I feel like one of the most important one most important things that people just don't really know about ice probiotics like I can tell if I take if I have enough probiotics for the day I can tell oh my god Elsa's way better than if I don't I love Camp Bucher you love it drinking every day kombucha is so dry that new watermelon flavored the GTS kind no I only mostly have either the really green one or the ginger aid or the original trilogy's good - I like that one - sometimes like the grape the grapes had a lot of little too much sugar in it I think Oh does it it's sweet if you look at how much sugars in there but still super super good for your body yeah probiotics there so my friend Cameron Haynes is an ultra marathon runner and he he was heavily hooked on ibuprofen he was taking 800 milligrams a day sometimes more than once a day and I did the podcast with Rhonda and dr. Rhonda Patrick was going over all the the dangers of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and ibuprofen and talking about the increased risks of strokes and all these different things and I called him up I go dude you got to get off that shit right now I know that stuff's terrible for you so here's work it's crazy he gets off of it and all of his pain goes away so the reason while he was taking it was because he was in pain I'm good and for him at least his the inflammation that it was causing him probably because he was taking too much as well you know a lot of people think like hey it says take two I'll take six I'm focused right and when you do that you're torching your fucking gut bacteria so he's creating all this internal inflammation which is in turn leading to all this pain which is in turn making want to take ibuprofen yeah yeah dude and that's are like lucky have friends help each other like mandatory drug testing in Singapore you could be dragged into custody without a warrant and be compelled to submit to drug testing by Singapore authorities as Singaporean drug counselor and ex2 teeny Tony Tan explains penalties for the first time you're caught or for drug consumption or is one year the second time is three years and the third time is five minimum with three strokes of the cane says tan consumption just means that your urine has tested positive we'd be heading to the slammer I would not pump for the flight I've never been on a long flight I was not fun for that I was pumped to go and check it out never been out of the country but here's a weird one with that like how many weeks out are we talking about like consumption you mean if you test anything yeah the article says that there's a lot of Singaporeans that try to take drug trips and they get caught when they come back because it's still in their system 50 people year down here a year in different drugs almost likes to see anything that's terrifying that's what's weird eel I mean this is human beings 2018 so you can live like we live here in California where weed is legal and if you're a grown adult just like you could buy a drink you could buy a joint which it should be it should have been a long time ago and then there's places or they just put you in a cage North Korea yeah cuz they can do they even don't know like smartphones dress stuff right they don't have internet I don't know what they have I think you have some sort of a small internet that only uses like North Korea channels and shit like yeah I don't think they get the regular internet dude the grip of a dictator it's so easy for us to bitch about random stuff being here bro so lucky yeah how about the fact that the Korean guy runs it his friends with Dennis Rodman I know I was I was talking my little brother about that the other day I was like really oh man he's friends with Robin like what the hell fuck attacks through CB text that is fucking crazy it is fucking Dennis parties with that dude hey like have you been to North Korea oh yeah I think more than once is that do they make what was that movie they make fun of North Korea dinner with Dennis Rodman that too or no oh honey it seems like a big risk no I know I was thinking that too yeah we probably shouldn't talk about that movie well aren't aren't they all having a meeting here soon Donald I think we supposed to meet in Singapore yeah people were talking about how dangerous it was to me to say before Dennis Rodman OB in Singapore doing Trump King summit say sugar we got to get in on that said they are going to Singapore see there's some people that were saying they shouldn't do it in Singapore because Singapore has such a horrible human rights record going down yeah I don't see if Singapore really does lock you up like that just for pot like that is that is some way you wanna have a meeting with it but that doesn't make any sense like that's an illogical government that's these people are running under the grill of their their living there's like they're afraid of lies right like there what are they afraid of with this marijuana I mean what do they think it's going to do what are they what are they afraid of with people taking drugs in people's mind the fact that they think today and they've made it so that they can just lock you up in a cage if you do something with your body that they don't want you to do because they've decided that this is some sort of a bizarre form of dictatorship that they can get away with seriously fuck man that is nuts that that's happening while we're living here this way chillin Trump Kim Singapore summit venue is set who would want to be the president when you're already a billionaire imagine to sit in on you know fuck my life know the crazy thing is this dude has always been this way and everybody's shocked that he's this way now that he's the president right and it's not just they're shocked it's just like it is shocking like this Philadelphia Eagles thing like not enough of them wanted to come to the White House so you cancel the meeting and so they do it they didn't kneel for the national anthem and so then if they find out that no those fucking guys none of them none of them kneeled for the national anthem they all stood yeah so he wrote he's Trump said something along the lines of I fucked it up he said something along the lines of that they didn't some of them didn't stand for the national anthem but it turns out was only one guy that kneeled and the one guy that kneeled was cut before the regular season so during the regular season everybody was standing for the national anthem so he said something wasn't even true yeah I just didn't want a small crowd of dudes he didn't want like three dudes they're like second stringers you can tell we're all high because their mouths are all dry right so um the Philly the mayor of Philadelphia or the the governor of Pennsylvania which one was it was the mayor of Philadelphia somebody went after him and he said what a fragile eagle he has he couldn't deal with not having a party well enough people having a party that people didn't want to go to it's just that that's that that kind of shit is like part of him the show man like that's the act that Trump the show man has been involved in his whole life right it's like everything he does is the best and pumping everything up and we expect differently now that he's the president and that's where it's it's also strange because this is just kind of people are really angry at it because he's doing it as the president but this is like what he's always done he's like a branding genius it's weird because we're seeing it as a president or like who this is that what you're supposed to do you're not supposed to like bend the truth as the president but like that bending of the truth in his in his eyes is always how he lived he's the Trump guy he's the fucking I know we ran The Apprentice runs the country I never followed politics ever and no idea about I bet if he in any way thought it was gonna be like this who had never signed up for it that's what I thought you think so yeah man don't you think he would bitch about it though yeah bitch about it that's part of his thing man the crazy thing is there was no one on the Republican side that was that was capable of challenging him that's the problem the problem was that they didn't have anybody and so there's all of a sudden this guy's in there and he's in there he's probably thinking he's gonna lose and then you know he likes to win it shit she's like god yeah fucking I'm just gonna be President the next thing you know he is the president you know but he's still the same guy man he's still the guy from The Apprentice that's not his fault it's who he is like to ask a guy to change that much at 70 it's crazy I think the best thing about it is it highlights how ridiculous this whole process is and the idea of having one person run 300 million people that's insane and you pick that person it's insane we don't even know what we're doing are we even picking well we don't even know what we're doing how much of what we paying how much of like what the bills are about and all these amendments how much of any of that shit do you pay attention to when Congress is in session or the Senate rules on things how much do we pay attention how much does everybody pay attention how much do you even know what someone's actual real policies are at least their stated policies when you're voting for them like 10% people you know like you here who you're supposed to vote for you'll vote for Hillary Clinton Donald Trump's a bad person you know vote for Hillary Clinton she's the most qualified for the job you're like okay yeah that sounds about right look like you are voting for Hillary Clinton aren't you she's the most qualified job okay Hillary what about Jill Stein you know Jill starts a woman too you know Jill Stein's brilliant you know Jill Stein's okay shit I'm gonna go progressively about her Stan so just on yeah and there was Elizabeth Warren might have lied about being part American Indian that was a problem it was like like who's gonna go Bernie Sanders and then all that shit him and Hillary Clinton so that the whole story so bizarre like watching it all play out on TV it's so strange it's so strange this is our form of government but you would think with this is my thought you would think with the kind of things the the organism that is a human being the kind of thing that could figure out a way to make sound go through a metal thing covered in foam goes through wires and in real time hits people in their ears if they're streaming they could have headphones on be on the train right now and they're getting this in real time that we can send video through the sky and it can hit Australia your friends can text you pictures back and forth from Africa they could be in Africa and dude I just saw a leopard and they send you a fucking photo and you're like holy shit that's flying through the sky and yet the best way we can figure out who's in control the nuclear weapons is they have a popularity contest people crazy with that thing that's not we're like we're in like this wave of like being evolved and not being evolved the same time like technologically spectacularly evolved to the point where we can bend matter and create nuclear weapons and fly robots to Mars and take pictures and send it back to us like the shit that we can do is off the charts when it comes to like technology and our ability to manipulate the world around us and create giant bill and structures and airplanes and bridges and shit but the the monkey interaction thing is still not very good so we still have war we still have places where we send people over with metal tanks and guns and shoot people and protect people from the other people to shooting people and get involved in all these fucking crazy things our physical interactions as organisms are just still in this barbaric stage we're still in this one tribe going after another tribe stage from 20,000 years ago thirty thousand years ago it's like the same programming but now this program it can fly jets filled with missiles and shoot them out of sky and sneak up on you underwater and a metal tube a submarine it shoots fucking nuclear with missiles and shit underwater I mean we're in oh the weirdest flux we're in this weird sort of unbalanced period in the evolution of the human organism because we can do so much and then put Donald in charge fucking everything we're mad about men who decide they're women who want to use the girls room we're mad about everything we're bad about religion we're bad about rights and gender and everything everything we're mad everyone's mad fuck Roseanne Barr everyone's bad everyone is so mad and while all this is all this weird personal interaction shit is happening that's distracting the fuck out of us the more it ramps up the the better AI gets artifice artificial intelligence gets just keep working on it and keep getting better and better we're gonna be in like a full-on rock fight when AI goes live it's like it's like we're we're falling into this hole and like if this was a trap if I was artificial intelligence and I knew out of like well as what we do we just go back in time and set people up and make them make us we'll just plant this idea in their heads and just like an aquatic worm makes a caterpillar or one of those grasshoppers rather jump into a pool and drown itself so they could swim out of its brain you ever see one of those things happen just like that ai is doing that with us they give a shiny Samsung Galaxy Note nah your face it knows your face they can tell your face ya face ID and fingerprints and before you know it listen we found the best way to get a signal to talk to people man you just stick it in your ass it's a little palette we're gonna put a little robot yeah in our ass a little pepper that pellet if you could just hold in your ass it's smooth do you barely know it's in there but it connects with your your ass is open it's not like the rest of your skin and y'all gonna keep it in your mouth right well the ass is the way to go because it's like open and it's not like you don't have to go through the dermis and so that just just connects with you and you can fucking see augmented reality but the little tiny robot dick it's about that big you barely feel it it's like a BB it's just gonna happen dude right dude these things are growing well now our anti-aging shit too who knows how crazy that's gonna get I think what the weirdest thing is not the anti-aging I think we're gonna run into biological limitations I think the weirdest is gene editing fuck yeah mr. Sauvage took a turn for the stoner gene editing scares the shit out of me with that unexplained on explain that new necklace necklace so gene editing how did you that shit's gonna get wild love country I only watch the first episode but I was like holy shit I see where this is going what I'm gonna follow show baby Oh show everyone as far as I can see it takes a turn but like I'm sure he still had good intentions I think trying to build the community I'm just passionate well this is again this is the thing it's the fucking human interaction part is the part that we can't get right it's real weird if you look at all the different kinds of interactions that we managed to successfully navigate any people have obviously have problems in business and there's lawsuits in business and there's people who get fired and there's all sorts of problems with people doing business but overall they get a lot of things done right like business keeps improving things keep getting better we barely improve with how we treat each other like the way human beings treat each other we barely get better at that and we to reacted things better like if we're mad at someone for doing something that's where we're like more clear with like egregious violations of our code right like racism like this Roseanne thing was a big one right everybody was like no fucking way we're not tolerating that fuck her and then ABCs like yep fuck it we're pulling the plug in the show it's like like immediate reactions yo so it's like when I would I'm I don't think it was right I think she's got a lot of problems and she's taking a shitload of pills and she's all fucked up and I know she's not racist at least she tells me that but what I do know is that racism is horrible and people just don't want to tolerate it anymore and that's what the good thing is the good things like this this overwhelming response from people that they're not tolerating racism anymore you can't do that anymore we won't tolerate it and this is fairly new man I mean with the civil rights marches that was in the 60s right I mean think about what was going on in the 50s and the forties an effect that shit that was not that long ago in terms of like how long there's been people so we're dealing with this radical change in this regard but very little change in like our kindness to each other yeah that's white dude start the American mushroom day not the American the worldwide Ari Shaffir has a holiday that he created called shroom fest no way yeah it's several days re doesn't fuck around it's so things are a real job since he was the doorman at The Comedy Store so he operates on its own schedule that's that's what it's gonna take or something like that worldwide to change you know certainly how shrimp fest is certainly out well I'm promoting that yeah but I feel like part of it is because we're scared I legitimately feel like we're scared and I think when someone like Trump is in office we're more scared because we realize how easy it is for you know I hate to use a term regular person because he's definitely not a regular person he's very successful and very famous and everybody knew who he was but regular person interns that we don't that's not how a politician acts like that this is like some crazy show man yeah and when a crazy show becomes the leader of the thing whether or not he's doing good is I'm not even arguing politically whether he's doing good or bad or the economy is up because of him I don't know but it's just how he behaves it's who he is like that that freaks people out and that makes people more on edge and so they're more angry and they're they're more looking to call people out on things and they're more looking to stomp out racism I get it imagine people think if someone like Sam Harris was a president or something he was talking about a national mushroom day or talking about bat stuff how bad people would freak out serious they would freak are they just people that disagree with Sam - you know there's a ton of very very smart people to disagree with Sam you know and it's really interesting to see those disagreements because when really high level intellects debate each other about things or disagree on things and you get to see not just their ideas play out and how their ideas work against the other person's ideas you get to see that but you also get to see like thinking and and and and communicating at a super high level right their intellectuals are trying to outsmart each other yeah so that they're debating about you know the existence of god or whatever the fuck it is we get really smart people who disagree on shit very fascinating it's like one of the more interesting things to watch it's like in a lot of ways high-level jujitsu you know in a lot of ways you're watching like okay and those guys a lot of them get energy like Harris is in a jujitsu is he yeah I think that's one of the reason why he's into it it's because he's kind of doing jujitsu and he's when he's doing these debates yeah it's not I want my little brother to do it so bad he won't won't try well it's probably hard his brothers a fucking MMA star and I know bone shoot I know he could it could be as a passion they have a passion right now Mike dude you could try jiu-jitsu and it can you know the people for smart people I think it's the mother I'm like dude you could be so good at jiu-jitsu and love it it is very smart there's a lot of super smart Eddie always calls them as nerd assassins that super smart dudes that are really good at Jiu Jitsu scary good I think like getting a black belt from someone good one of the hardest degrees out there to get in any college or anything well physically the thing about college is if you put in the work and you're smart enough it's possible I mean you can do it I mean it's possible achievement a lot of people have done it a lot of people do it every year yeah but to really get a black belt whoa like yeah you got to get better like you got it you have to get bet you gotta get strong you're gonna get choked a lot and how are you built are you built normal like a small yeah if you're small you're extra super fucked right how's your ego yeah how's your ego can you learn do you know how to tap because if you don't tap you're gonna get hurt yeah like almost every significant injury I ever got doing jiu-jitsu other than like one fucked-up knee was which was just a weird passing the guard thing my ACL popped but almost every other one was from not happening yeah just just decide you're not gonna tap I'm gonna try to get out of this I'm gonna try eating someone's got unit Darce or something like that and your shits all fucking ranked over and then for the next week oh you get that tightness in the middle of your back like why did I just tap I should have just tapped John crouch always told me he's like dude you're just so tough when you getting submissions people can't tap you out but I want you to just focus on not get in there so when you get there just tap right away just focus on not getting there it's very smart because you know what you're always going to be tough and there's a certain Amin you need to know a certain amount of high-level defense like how can you so long can you survive in a certain spot if you actually have to survive but in training you're not really surviving right you're just you should just tap sometimes yeah especially with me shit and arm shit and you know you pop something and then it's fucked for six months yeah so we're gonna be focused on a lot with Sean is a lot of legs and heel hooks knee bars that yeah the lower half of the body you guys working with that on Augusto Mendes to Kino mmhmm yeah yeah super high level it's fun they hit they have competition rolls like all the black belt like what are the six seven last six seven black belt moved ten minute rounds usually Tim goes back it was fun that leg lock games hitting mainly high level right now in jiu-jitsu and you know trickling into MMA you know with Dylan Danis like the way he looked in Bellator I think slowly in MMA it's gonna be tough because a lot of spots you're getting punched yeah and then one punch solid punch in the right spot changes their game it puts a little fear in their mind so then for sure but if those guys can get good enough to strike to become a threat like a guy like Gary tonin whoo that's scary that's a scary dude very scary man cuz he gets ahold of that leg you're in trouble sighs in EPSA head that Danaher death squad man Danaher is a real wizard man someone get him a hat with stars on it dude full moons and stars he's a wizard someone who studied philosophy like that and just as is a type of person like that it's fucking pretty cool yeah and that's shit that he wrote she'd read that thing that he wrote about routine it's really interesting he writes a lot of really cool smart shit his Instagram was filled with the cool smart shit yeah that's awesome he's got a DVD series out now a leglock series he shot it and he didn't like it also reshot it this reshot him yeah damn that's pretty cool yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be funny to see how far those leglock game will go in MMA before we've evolved more and then find the counter to that it's like well what's interesting to me is that this is essentially all out of a conversation that he had with Dean Lister you know and it's become a meme now it's really funny there's a photo of a girl lying in bed and she's like he's probably thinking about another woman and I yea why would you ignore 50% of the body and I love how John Danner said it - why would you yes why would you why would you ignore 50% of the human body and we're like it makes you uncomfortable he's super smart that's awesome you know he's like if you're a blue belt and you roll with a black belt you always feel a little weird around him yeah that's how I feel around him intellectually I've been not just physically but you know okay tell me what it is I'm not arguing you man she said John take a puff of this I don't know it probably doesn't have to hope we can do it to his own brain I'll just put myself in a perfect position you wonder if someone like Elon Musk gets high oh I would hope so holy that guy's on another level it's aren't they building those tunnels already under LA or they bill oh man they got their building that he's got a boring company they're gonna bore holes through LA and and reinforce them and you're gonna go through on sleds I think they're all like getting done right now how dude I do not want to be in one of those things and hear the rumble of the earth and sea the ocean Russian tsunami hits the tsunami hits while you're in one of those pipes but he's coming from the middle of the ocean thousands of fucking miles of the earth have been torn apart that shit's happened up gang at times seriously never to that shit has happened many times over the quit happened in Fukushima has happened a ton of times we're just we don't live long so these things they seem like they're forever ago right but it's based on our lifespan our life span is so weird because it's it's really short you know and it seems like it's not because you're in the middle of it but if you look at it objectively it says you're not no one makes it out alive and it doesn't take that to long for your body to give up so by the time you start figuring things out and get your shit together you're already old falling apart and all the while we're dealing with a planet whose time is is almost infinite right for in terms of like what we can understand so all these things that we know have happened even if we study super volcanoes and tsunamis and cataclysmic earthquakes and solar flares even when we study all those things man we don't think they're real oh yeah yeah but it's you know squat Amala somebody Guatemala yeah it's why but hey they knew they're on an island yeah try this thing with a bunch of houses because we don't think very good because we don't realize that we this might not be here in a year there might come a giant wave that hits me with those fucking houses are perched and Santa Monica perched over the water and Malibu and shit but what are you doing how are you so confident that water's not gonna move because it hasn't moved in 30 years that's a second notion in the life of an the earth 30 years is a second yeah you put your house on the edge of an alien world that moves back and forth and there's one contractor who made that decision it'll hold up well these guys just decide where you want to I want to wake up in the morning cuz I'm a winner and I want to do my coffee and I want to do my coke and I want to look out the window I see the fucking ocean money yeah super amped up adderall dudes trying to run the world staring at that water it looks great fuck yeah can I can i water everyone's looking at them like they got it figured out what oh my god loves you home teeters on collapsing off cliff so the cliff gave up and the house is still there in Texas actually better oh is it really oh is that Austin that's Fort Worth Oh down look at that one right above it yo you got to fix that whoever the contractor is yo are you sure Jamie isn't real Loveleen oh my god that mini cooper look who would trust that fucking shitty idea of a house hanging off the edge of a cliff Wow look at that thing that's beautiful it's not realistic shit okay this looks bigger than this one this one might be real oh wow he parks his car on top of that what have you heard oh my god we gotta get the fuck off the house honey we're dropping down wait wait I can't find my phone let ricky grab his iPad you're running off in the distance holding the baby under your arm and you fuckin see the house fall off the side of the cliff boom boom it's real Australians don't give a fuck they don't give a fuck oh those those are exceptional humans see I'm a big fan of the Australians might be fake might be fake really I found an article that looked like it said it was real and then I just looking for more and it says it my Google said fake after it oh well sorry you know it's funny looking like a switch in subjects but like seeing people that are married husbands that are married to their wife just going through the the classic role of get married and you got your wife and you don't talk to her and go to the boys series explained yeah that's a good one you go I explained know who's doing that one I'm not sure who's doing that one but it talks about all that stuff like how about Haga me with creative yeah how males aren't made for monogamy they're just not like what humans are for build more for a try explained yeah well that's probably based on my friend dr. Chris Ryan's book which is sex at dawn which is is that what it's based on yeah yeah yeah yeah he's a big proponent of that idea it's very it makes a lot of sense if you look at the way chimps behave we were the cousins of chimps and chimps fuck everybody everybody fucks everybody so the idea is like how did we get to a place where everybody stopped fucking everybody in somewhere along the line and evolution it's it shifted whether it's cultural evolution yeah there's a lot of theories man there's a lot of theories Terence Mckenna had some weird ideas about it his theories were all drug based he all he felt there was a mushroom thing he felt like climate change caused people to move from a mushroom culture to an alcohol culture and that the the death of the ego and the expanding consciousness and the community of feelings that you would get from communal mushroom trips all were replaced by drunken asshole ish nough sand and chaos and he really breaks it he broke it he's not alive anymore but when he was alive he broke it down pretty eloquently it's you know it's not something I'm smart enough to know if he's right or if he's wrong but it's a very compelling argument that people because we know that they used to definitely do a lot of mushrooms they know the Vikings did a lot of mushrooms we knew that we know that there's a bunch of ancient art pieces that show mushrooms and even people that were under the spell of the mushroom like a person like a really old one Jack Herer was showing all these Jack Herer was this great weed activist who wrote a book called the emperor has no clothes it's all a book about him being a Goldwater Republican and finding marijuana and then becoming like this marijuana advocate and begin a hero for marijuana and he was in the middle of writing a book and part of the book was about mushrooms and mushrooms in the history of Christianity and he had all this ancient artwork that was all had mushroom iconography like mushroom images in it and he was like the shit was everywhere he unfortunately had a stroke and then wound up dying he was a great man and in the world of marijuana he's certainly a hero risk risked his neck like way way early on and you know stood by his beliefs and caught a lot of shit for his book but also got a lot of love for how he stood for you know a guy opening up his mind and changing his mind he was a staunch Republican they started smoking pot and become like this crazy pot advocate and his next thing was about mushrooms man how awesome is that there's some images a lot of stuff out there that you can read there's a lot of good articles online where people have shown there's ancient images of Adam and Eve from a fresco in France from like a long fucking time ago see if you can see that mush Adam and Eve mushroom fresco just like you were saying Sean you're like how do we know like some of that Bible wasn't people writing stories on mushrooms oh yeah well there's a lot of people that believe it's entirely possible that that's the case there was actually a recent scholar from Jerusalem that thanks see this is the image that's Adam and Eve and look at those mushrooms and not even mushrooms ayahuasca for those Bible stories it's like whole well who knows I mean who knows when they figured out ayahuasca right and who who got ahold of it we know that they had it in South America thousands of years ago we don't we don't know how many thousands though apparently it's really hard to figure out but look at that image 13th century fresco depicting an Adam and Eve in the tree of knowledge the tree appears to be modeled after an Amanita muscaria mushroom oh this is the tree of knowledge I mean dude this is from the 1200s right so this is this is closer to the bone than the original story than we are now in terms I think this is like that on the ballot in California to legalize it god I hope they do even if they just do it for therapy seriously yeah there's a lot of these old old pictures that have mushrooms in with religious icons it's real weird man like figure that's Jesus with mushrooms at his feet there's a bunch of these is a bunch of these really old weird pigment but the thing is like what is it evidence of is it evidence that mushrooms were involved in the creation of Christianity possibly but it's also evidence that artists do drugs fucking guy is a painter back then maybe you're doing mushrooms all the time and you want to put the mushrooms and everything we don't really know yeah I mean especially if he's doing mushrooms and nobody else even knows what they are he's like listen this mother but I gotta I gotta think that everybody knew about him back then and they probably shared them with people that they cared about because if you lived in a world with just think of it this way you lived in a world with no media you have no books you have no science you have stories you have a crude language you write things down you draw things there's no TV shows there's no cars there's no nothing there's no history you have history of talking about shit you wouldn't you think if you found mushrooms if your life sucked that much ass like this is the world you're living in his barbarians everywhere and you get fucking step on a thorn and you get poison in your body and you die because no one has antibiotics you get an infection from a cut you're dead I mean this is this is how people existed back then do you think if they found mushrooms that they they wouldn't cherish them like that someone would summer honor to demonize them for real seriously if they had nothing else why would they demonize mushrooms they demonized it after they figured it out after they figured out like hey like they probably went big gaps without having it that's the theory they probably like big gaps where mushrooms weren't a part of culture anymore and then people tried to reintroduce them but culture had already gone in this weird sort of violent chimp alcohol amphetamines way damn damn fuck yeah it's not like we're making something up like this is some Alice in Wonderland book where there's some medicine that says drink me and if we drink we're gonna go on this journey that's just a book mushrooms are real yeah and they're everywhere yeah I mean there's parts of the country they just fucking growing constantly it's crazy when you talk about people that were living it back in that day and how tough it was you wonder if they had just like as much happiness as we have if they're more positive thinking I mean like it's a good question like because they didn't know any better they might have more like okay this guy that wrote this book Jesse it's this book that's in front of you living with a seal uh-huh he also wrote a book living with monks and he was he was just here and he just was talking about it was really fucking interesting shit man yeah my bet really interesting shit yeah but one of the things he was telling me was like how happy these guys are they just meditate all day they just do their job they train dogs and they meditate all day that's crazy it was like they're all really happy and he was like how many people if you think in real world are really happy and like I don't know he said sixty something percent what'd you say 67 67 percent how they got happy unhappy yeah 67 percent are unhappy I'm sure fuck dude even that I'm like halt really like there's what 33 percent people happy that's more than I expected truly they're truly happy truly happy doing what they want every day yeah there's not that's hard god yeah you're lucky or super super luck anybody out there that's listening it's doing what they want whether you're making furniture or painting pictures or singing songs but are the fuck you're doing if that's what you really want to do and you're happy yeah just even if you're not making a fortune no you listen if you're getting by doing what you'd like it's so much better than being rich doing what you hate because your time is what's so valuable when you know if you have a job and you hate it but it gives you a lot of money and you say well I'm gonna get out of it eventually the problem is that time that you need to do that job at eight hours that's a giant chunk of your day but a lot of people don't have passions - what would they be doing those eight hours a day a lot of people don't even know they cook right like my dad gets off work and goes to work was he good you know what do you want to get good at what do you money - about what do you want to do and it's easier for like this newer day and age to look on the internet and learn things on the internet see people on the internet doing back oh they're doing I'm not doing it in our parents generation they didn't have that everyone did it and they had no it was rare no you're super lucky if you find a passion that young age back then everybody was scared right so they would always tell people don't don't do that don't take any risks play it safe get that good job you know they're given benefits you know get your degree play it safe you know well if you have a degree then you'll definitely have a back-up plan you know you want to have a safety net everyone back then was their parents had been in the fucking depression man even when I grew up people were kind of telling me like yeah we're gonna fight for like what do you do for work if you do how many 50 year olds do you know that like you want to see yet man I want my life like theirs yeah like someone like you or Paul check like you it seems like at your age that's pretty rare people fall apart man and what they want the ride is it's you know everybody can you know if you watch one of those mechanical bulls euros what you watching people they start ramping it up the beginning everybody can hang on mm-hmm everybody hang on but as the life gets more and more complicated to get older and older your body starts failing you gotta stay on your exercise program or you feel yourself deteriorating like you realize like how long can I keep this up how long can I keep this going you know and also people have been doing what they don't want to do for 20 years now wait in the retire 25 years you know me my number want for sure the the most fortunate thing is the people that I'm friends with and then I love my family and people I'm close to I'm close to a bunch of really positive people that has some similar mindsets to yours about eating healthy and taking care of yourself it sad for sure also about being nice that's all that's real important being around a bunch of people that are cool to each other and then to doing what I want to do because I didn't do what I want to do and I've looked I don't want anybody to cry for me that I was on fear factor it's not like it was a bad job I would have taken it again in a heartbeat if I was in the same situation it was great you know it's it offered me money a lot of money to do a show that wasn't anything I wanted to do like it wasn't a sitcom it wasn't doing stand-up comedy was this weird thing but it was a great job like I'm not I'm not hating on it but it doesn't feel the same way even though I'm very thankful that I got that job it doesn't feel the same way as it would if I was say doing a podcast or doing stand-up or just doing whatever I want to do we're enough to what I have to I don't have to do something just because it's my job yeah instead I do it because I actually like to do it you know I'm gonna watch your to use all the time because you're in the corporate world we watch them yourself man I mean I fuck up all the time I say stupid things all the time if people like why'd you say that I'm like because I'm free-balling I'm off the time I had four hours at a time or get case yeah occasionally gonna say something stupid yeah I take a swing and a Miss yeah but ultimately it's you know I'm gonna try to police myself as best as I can but it's just so much better than having to pee somebody it gives you a chance to get better at your own shit you know whatever you're doing if you can work for yourself or figure out a way to do the thing that you really want to do it gives you a chance to get better at the thing that interests you the friends fascinating to you yeah that's pretty so I was super lucky when I was when I first moved to Arizona I didn't have to work I'd like sponsored local sponsors back in Montana was my friend the sting bar the one Machado missing alias Smith and Jones Labs construction yeah there's a small town companies that Nestle work and I could I was able to put all of my time into learning are you healthy learning how to use my brain and training like I you gotta use all my time for that I was so lucky for that and it's not it's huge for young fighters you know getting a cool business and what to put yeah like their logo on your shorts or something like that that's where we benefited from coming from a small town we racked up a lot of experience like in Phoenix there's amateur fighters that they can't get fights for the life of them we could fight every weekend if we wanted to so we got a lot of reading ringg experience and got comfortable in there you know there's a crazy Midwest circuit right like that's why Jeremy Horn has over a hundred fights and Travis Fulton was he have like 200 plus fights yeah crazy like that but a lot of those dudes you mean you could literally fight constantly all the time yep I fought three weekends in a row once a member that that's nuts but don't you get super loose when you do that you get like you used to yeah experience it's different right it feels normal oh yeah for sure I remember going into like bigger fights and people were kind of saying I was like I don't think I just don't get like before if I don't feel nervous I'm how do you feel I feel calm I feel it a day I feel like I'm just calm just ready for I'm just waiting for I feel like I'm really in the now and I'm just waiting for to get there I'm just what are you thinking about I'm I feel calm I don't know it's just super confident I know all I got in my head I'm going in there I'm gonna knock this dude out whether I do or don't I'm that's what I'm that's what everything every fight I get into I'm going in there thinking I'm gonna knock this dude out every fight and I truly feel that I believe that in myself and it all comes from how prepared you are he's always doing every single thing not like I'm gonna be lazy today everything he has to do and that's the reason he feels so fuckin prepared he can focus on her techniques and go focus on that instead of focus on all am I gonna gas or did I train hard enough or fuck all that nonsense shit you know yeah I was listening to someone talk about that the other day that I wish I could remember who was having this conversation it might have been my friend John Dudley but he was talking about how when people aren't prepared for things that it gives you like another layer of insecurity on top of the insecurity of doing something that's difficult first place so if you know that you're not like maybe you're good at it but you're just lazy and you didn't really practice and then you're gonna go and try and do something but you know these other people are practice much harder than you have that layer is even if you're a talented person that's like that that has an effect on your actions and if you've done everything you can do you dotted all your i's and crossed all your t's if you've done that you'll have a different level of confidence you might still lose right that's a crazy way to make living the chips fall where they may but at least you'll know that you gave a hundred percent now if you lose and you didn't give a hundred percent you definitely still have you always have that in the back your head as like a fallback hey I know I didn't really give a hundred percent but you could say well well I'm gonna get my shit together now but the problem is you've already gone through the experience of not giving 100% which is very precarious because it could be a confidence destroyer could fuck your head up for the rest of your life it could change who you are because it's very difficult for people to overcome the past like ideas that they have about themselves from a year ago or five years ago that is not you you you have to especially in the something as critical as like fight skills and learning learning how to become confident again that's not you that was you then you're better now embrace the fact that you're better don't dwell on bad moments where you got flattened or you fucked up or you did something stupid or you got caught in an armbar whatever the fuck it is those things they can get in your head and you can decide you're that person or you can decide no I've passed that now I'm Way better because of that I'm thankful that happened because that taught me a super valuable lesson and without that humiliation in that defeat or that misstep or you know whatever that error was I wouldn't know who I really am right now yeah it's like classic sports psychology something you can't just read it want to be like okay I get that you got a hook and just wrap it in your head grab it in your head and I think I truly think in a fist fight the number one thing is confidence and I know that confidence comes from training you know also helps to have that fucking Rumble Johnson power son [Laughter] might also be a robert johnson or you election people why don't necessarily think he relied on the too much but i really think about Rumble is rumble was better than he was enthusiastic about fighting he was a better fight look he said it he was a phenomenal knockout artist I mean Rumble put it to people you know a spooky way he would crack the when he knocked out blow over to shower mister share with that one uppercut boom you've watched that precision in the power that guy generated damn he was scary damn he was scared but what most said when he retired he said hey man he goes I'm just good at this because I'm not a fighter I'm an athlete he goes I'm just good at this I don't want to do this anymore I could do a lot of other things looks like good for you yeah you're fucking at the top of your game everyone's scared to you and you're like man I'm good at this I mean like I'm going into the weed business fuck yeah yeah I mean Rumble is he's a special person but that kind of thing that he has he's got that one touch gift I mean for sure technique for sure years of training for sure smart knows how to execute and close the distance there's a lot of excellent variables on his side but there's one thing that he possesses that most human beings are never gonna get no matter how they try I'm not gonna get that power he's got that weird power there's a few people who just have their they got that weird power behind that fat fast-twitch muscle hmm that gas is out quick or the slow twitch muscle like Nick Diaz that can push and press the whole time it's like see Rob doesn't always gas up quick though here's the thing he did in some fights but if you watch the Phil Davis fight he never gassed out for a second in that fight people forget who look fucking Phil Davis is good he's real good and Womble put it to him Phil Davis was in survival mode and I forgot about that survival mode son there was a hammer yeah man he wasn't there was no wrestling to be done in that fight there's defense back to the feet keep ducking keep ducking cuz missiles are coming your way on a fuse with like Henry hoof at that time he was helped him that with that for certain I mean look but I really believe that all those tough training camps and tough fights and you know those battles that after a while he just didn't want to do it anymore even if he's that good at it he what one comfortable stressed out all the time always get ready for a fight he didn't want to do any more he's a smart guy yeah you know I think there's you know something admirable about that about him saying even though he's on top of the heap you know just lost the title right you know decides you know what fuck it I'm done well he got beat twice alright by Cormier maybe maybe twice in a row he won one yeah he won who did he beat in between no he beat a couple people I think he beat Glover he docked out Glover in between that's right and then who else did he but he was fucking terrifying he was telling Matt but then you try to make 170 he did make 2070 many times used to fight at 170 fought on top at 170 at that high level too and there's so much on the line you get a fight 10 weeks out ok now every single day my thoughts are filled with what's gonna happen in that fight for 10 fucking weeks and it's exhausting knowing that I might make this much money or I might make double that much I can't plan ahead at all you got a goal based on what happened in the fight I'm not a big believer in that I don't like that that's one part of the way people get paid that I wish wasn't a tradition series the fight and then win bonus I just feel like everybody's trying to win and then this yeah the to see if it was one thing like if it was a rock-solid decision process where we did it all in a computer and everyone agreed and everyone voted online yeah then ok because it might cost you $50,000 if someone has a terrible idea of whether or not you want to fight it on and sometimes sometimes they're close and sometimes they're subjective and sometimes it's things that you might be looking for that might be you might think isn't good enough to score maybe you think the defense is just as important because even though he took him down he didn't do anything and the guy in the bottom was always working off of his back or you're a boxer I'm a jujitsu guy yeah yeah yeah look there's always those things but I think those could be ironed out with a large large enough sample group or a large enough group of judges like if we had three why do we need three tell me there's not thousands of people listening to this right now that would make phenomenal judges that no MMA that understands jujitsu that no kickboxing all together I mean there's got to be a fucking shit ton of them out there that would do an amazing job if you let them do it online let them watch it online let them judge it online have a little camera on them while they do it so you know they're actually watching the fight let them watch it so just no commentary just let you know what the sounds the impacts how about let's get a bunch of people watching this so what would it take to like push an idea like that it's like we're just used to Joe Lewis versus Max Schmeling the judge in the corner here is judge Li and judge Judy's over here and this job we will use this stupid old boxing system you know that system sucks a fat dick they need to have a gang of people judge invites there should be way more than three and they should be super educated in terms of like high level understanding of submission hold striking they should be able to demonstrate it what's more significant an elbow to the top of the head or a leg kick depends on who's throwing the kick depends on the elbow what's what's better a takedown or a takedown that leads you to get caught in a triangle that you eventually survive in but you almost get tapped in what get out did it not count look whatever god gets you really close to triangle and he's got you trapped in there you try to slam him he tightens it up more there's a battle you're going back and forward and back and forth back and forth and finally you get out do you get more credit because you took him down than he gets for almost strangling you that's super subjective super subjective and different people would disagree they will argue over it I've seen really high level referees and judges argue over what they think it's more important and better it's so subjective Dan that's crazy but I think we had a giant number man if we had a big number if you have a hundred people I'm getting crazy the idea is have a certified expert panel and you have these people you give them access to the fight for free you pay them a certain amount of money they get no commentary they listen to the fight play out in real time they have the options of tuning into each corner or individual corners if they want that's easy to arrange we have that right now so if we decided to do that and give that to someone who calls at home who wants to not just watch fights but is also an expert and would love the idea of making a hundred bucks or whatever the fuck they pay you have this camera prompt over their head have have online contributors a nice yeah and in maybe you know maybe have fucking ten people do it maybe have twenty people do it but it doesn't in this day and age like why would you not have more analysis better than yeah it's just not a good idea to three unskilled people that their only experience is watching fights and judging them like literally they don't have any martial arts experience that's a common theme yeah like there's it's queer high level MMA fights are often the decisions are decided by people that have zero martial arts experience which is crazy it's like me judging a violin contest it really is like I don't know a goddamn thing about I could get it totally wrong I could get it totally wrong the people I would go oh I love the part we did that like that was a mistake you fucking chance he's not supposed to make that sound that's why he should lose I thought that was cool yeah yeah that's how it is when a lot of these people just literally don't have any idea what's happening I have a friend who was a judge who told me while old fight was going on as many years ago wild fight was going on this guy's working for a Kimora and this lady who's a judge goes what is he doing what is he doing she says it to him cuz she needs to know because she's watching the fight she doesn't know if that's a hold like what is that is this is this work is this real and she's actually judging a fight and he said I was flabbergasted fuck because she literally didn't understand what was happening she didn't know a Kimora I like super common super common move she didn't know it death curry did you listen to the commentary at all in sugar spite I don't think so Oh which fight Andre or he was whining about me saying stuff Oh in between corners no it was during the fight I was just jabbering at Andre a little bit just cuz I knew that that big pressure moment he was feeling that you all made just laughing when he missed or little things and make fun of him or a little bit cuz I know he was thinking about it and I know do you know him well no but I could see the pressure of the build-up of him all week he was getting super emotional so I knew that little extra push would get him emotional teamwork and then after he tweeted he's like all I could hear is his fucking corner talking shit to me the whole time and that's all I could like that's why I'm like I know what the high level is not gonna work but I just feel it's another tactic yeah right I mean maybe well like who would it work on well just think like these guys are these guys are UFC fighters in their town everyone respects them and treats them nice then all of a sudden you're in this place where two guys are talking shit to you and you're fighting one and he's laughing at you and this really oh fuck I'm not used to this it's just another tactic but I know at the certain level it won't work but why not yeah certain level it might work a little though just another part of it yeah and I want people fucking trying to hit sugar hearts and they're stiff so he's waxing them as they come in well definitely don't talk about on the internet if you wanted to I'm sure I'm just saying give it up your strategy son believe it though I trust it I believe you believe in it you definitely a fast learner man you know you it's it's interesting how you you have a style of moving and throwing kicks that I would have assumed that you have like a long background in some sort of traditional martial art ler karate or you know Taekwondo or something because the way you thrown kicks I was like this guy like the way you but I guess that's like a lot of also your emulation of Conor right yeah I was style yeah I was I was kind of doing that before before I saw Connor just kind of throwing weird kicks I remembered being at the lab and watching videos and trying them just teaching myself then but as far as my movement that like I played basketball football soccer and baseball in my entire life since I was four until I was in high school I think I just became a super athletic from doing so many different sports and then I they added that to fighting and oh it works well well your length to men that's a big factor that's like a 6-4 guy at 170 that switches hollyrock 510 511 511 510 for 135 is so crazy yeah there's some did you walk around wait yeah 150 well put on your arms real quickly like fucking long his stretches for 35 like how hard is it for you to get down to 35 super easy super easy yeah what do you think about this recent move Dana White has just said that he's gonna eliminate the early weight cuts is that really the worst thing that's so stupid you said too many people are missing the weight and they're trying to gain the system and they're trying to cut more because they know they have more time to recover I would huge I love them the night it's easy take you fucking still know what time weigh-ins are do you think it's possible that they could ever eliminate weight cutting entirely I hope so I would do that I would love that I don't know I just yeah find out what your actual weight is and fight at that I mean if you're too muscular lose some weight if you're too fat you know some fat but find out what weight you're at and just I think that's it's an unnecessary danger that's the nice thing about Shawn he's not a huge 135 or so week we don't have to eat to get huge like George said or eat to really diet down we can eat to where he just performs the best hmm and just stay there and then maybe have to cut eight pounds eat normal the whole week drink normal the whole week and then go in there feeling a hundred percent yeah it's just it's an unnecessary aspect and I think one of the things that would be a solution is give guys more options of what weight to actually fight at when there's these big giant gaps in between weight classes it forces people in a lot of ways to cut weight because like maybe they're just they're too small for 185 but they can make 170 so fuck it I'll just make 170 because I know how big X guy is or Y guy is cuz you know some of those 85 hours man you're around him you're like holy shit this is a fucking heavy with Hale jeez his he's a big fella there's a lot of them Luke Rockhold is a big busy fella he's big look yeah he's big and strong as fuck and you know he weighs 185 so if you're in that guy's weight class like good luck fuckface yes Lee you know how about Yoel Romero yo is Mero was 185 fucking kidding me dude he's one of the most impressive physical specimens I've ever been in front of I mean phenomenal wrestler talented fighter all the above but just his physique like he just looks like a superhero he doesn't look like a real person haha have you been around him in real life flex your traps you look like you a little bit dude he was here in that shirt in that seat and he was wearing this tight shirt with like a gold cross and shit and you know it's skin tight and you looked at me like what in between fighting he's not trying to make 185 he's well over 200 pounds he's fucking jacket he's got that super Cuban DNA son serious I wonder what DC is gonna weigh going in the fight with steep a look at Romero's jab could not be a nicer guy be a nicer that's cool he was beautiful he's funny and friendly and all he's a sweet sweet guy he's laughing all the time he's so happy to not be in Cuba and when he talks to you about Cuba like he's explaining you like he can go back to Cuba he's one of the few guys that can go back to Cuba and then leave and come back to United States yeah he says it's crazy says you got to keep your mouth shut and move around and you know watch what you say and don't piss anybody off is they all want to leave and they can't leave and you could leave and come back and leave and come back fuck crazy it's weird like usually someone who's super fuckin badass they're always really nice yeah he's so nice soldier of God is that his t-shirt I love you I love you we need an account and order me that I'll take that in a large please like yeah that's a dope yeah they're coming out with funny shit you know this is yours right yeah they sold out first like a couple hours on the Reba a couple different websites dude it just got it back in stock come on Sammi block so it's beautiful that a marijuana leaf behind it at first and it was so sweet they had to get rid of the marijuana yeah yeah yeah imagine they need to let it go in this day and age let it go it was think how many people told you do not promote marijuana at okay the UFC will not ever sign you who ever ski well back then maybe but not anymore like couple years ago Sean's like first like to be open about it is that true Nick Diaz come on so I guess that's true Locke yes just open his fuck a lot of people are open about weed it's more behind the scenes with Dana doesn't give a fuck yeah the only thing that they care about is conditions and people you know failing the test which they think is stupid in the first place Danna doesn't give a fuck people smoke weed there he's right he'd rather have them smoke weed I'm sure especially now that it's legal yeah then drink but ten years ago woody what was he like five well it's all about the Commission's he's a promoter he's not a guy who interferes with people's personal pots yeah because he doesn't lie it's a immoral and my company we're gonna yeah house none of that he just his opinion is based entirely on the fact you're gonna get tested so if you're smoking pot you can't stop and you're six weeks out and you know you fucking passed that limit because there used to be pleased to be looking for a very small amount and you'd need a good solid four to six weeks to flush your system and some guys would did push it they get into three they get into three weeks and just drink a lot of fucking water and apple cider vinegar and try to clean their system out sometimes it would work and sometimes you would deal with a really sophisticated Commission and they would catch you Pat Healy Jim Miller when Pat won both bonuses that night 130 G's that's right tested positive for pot got it took his bonus away and the win and his win bone yeah and his win I mean look do you think the pot helped him win get the fuck out its crate and it was just a little amount he pushed it you know I mean and Pat is a guy that fights like a fucking savage so you know he trains like that too so it's all just fucking grinding and smashing and so he's probably sore all the time man yeah you know if you're if you fight that fucking wrestler the top game smash him up style like he does yo in that grit style he's got that put it to you just keep that pressure on you to break style those guys get sores fuck man they need some pot calm him down yeah sure we're gonna look back on it someday and it's gonna be ridiculous we're gonna look back on the fact that pot was illegal when we're kids and we're gonna be like how in the fuck is that possible some people take it to their graves though yeah they just don't get it it's it's not their fault it's here's the thing weeds the devil for some people but alcohols the devil for some people you know gambling's the devil for some people jerking off is the devil for some people there's people thinking they get caught up in all kinds of shit because people are fucked up we're weird you know but it's not the pot pots not the problem you're throwing out the baby with the bathwater this shit is good for people it helps you it's it makes you think more it opens your eyes to weird things it makes you makes you nicer to people yeah it really does know for sure yeah for sure right makes you just get my mom to take one puff what about edibles no way camp six seven eight weeks out pretty much I've only vaporized and use edibles no once I start getting three four weeks I'm only do a doubles get you this Jambo spray change your life son this spray okay be careful see liquid you pour under your tongue yes people those dabbers all those wacky people with the wax too heavy for me go fuck yourself folks yeah we're going too far the länder know those like that's like the marijuana equivalent of those people that take that crocodile drug you know those people that take that shit that rots you ever seen that song crocodile was some drug that was in fact affecting a lot of people apparently in was it Eastern Bloc states or some it was Russia I think was Russia but it rots your skin away it is the point where your bones exposed says people would shoot it into the spot where their bone was exposed like that's how crazy this drug is it's so it's so powerful and so crazy and feels so good they shoot it right into the rotten meat why with their exposed bone oh this photos man all over the internet it'll freak you out he's in Colombia Colombia that's where it is this one artist okay this is their one from Russia I feel like there was a theme about Russian kids that were shooting crocodile in this burnt-out warehouse it was like what in the fuck yeah dude it's hot pull up some photos son don't don't gross us out from a distance oh look at that that's real so that lady's shooting that stuff into her arm the meat rotted away her bone is exposed she can't help it man that stuff just starts he starts rotting their flesh away and a lot of people wind up like this man look at this lady look at her arm who got her forearm crocodile yeah look at it ADA way or forearm man there's almost nothing left of her forearm this is a really common thing that you could find online if you want to throw up look at that guy's foot rot away bread or look I don't know man I'm too scared to ask I don't even got one hand click on that hand where your cursors on click on that oh Jesus look at this look at this person squirting it into their leg Jesus Christ oh my god it's eaten that person's ass alright that's enough yeah thank you for not showing people get so fucking damaged but what is that drug that makes it like imagine an itch that's so hard to not scratch that you're willing to shoot the drug she's into the hole where the bone is people are fucked up people are fucked up and a lot of its is it's weird like they were saying in this podcast from 0 to 3 you learn more than you'll ever learn your whole life we don't even remember that like when people say that I go maybe you bro really I thought like 10 times stronger than heroin mmm three times is more toxic Jesus it's a tenth of the price oh that's the price of park oh so we're we saying that you'll earn more by the time you're three from zero to three then you'll ever learn your life taking in more information about like everything oh just being programmed from that like and we don't even remember that and that forms maybe a lot of patterns that are in brains now like oh for sure no idea oh for sure especially if kids grow around grew up around violence violence in the house violence in their community especially even if their mom was going through violence whether in the womb that's it has a giant factor in the way you connect the dots and the way you interact with people I was on a plane once headed to Australia and Michael Irvin was on the plane just by random you know it's long ass flights like 14 hours so me and him got to talk and super-good do like real nice guy I mean phenomenal football player but just like you would never know it talking to him just super super down-to-earth but he was talking about work he does with kids with kids that and trying to sort of illuminate to people what happens to someone who grows up in a terrible community where they experience a lot of violence in the neighborhood or their family experiences violence or the mother does while the boys in the womb that this programs literally their behavior patterns Bob Patton yeah and it they come out of that they come out of the gate with a faster fuse a shorter fuse a more more inclination towards violence you know different hormone rates either their body reacts to stress differently the quicker to snap the quicker to make impulsive violent judgments and beat people up and shit like a lot of the people that are in these situations like what you're dealing with is like a programming from the time they're in the womb and it's very difficult to correct and then we have to like really not think about it in terms of like here's a person who's doing a bad thing and think about it more in terms of like whoa wait a minute why is he so angry how did he get like this what what happened yeah like we just gonna let it happen over and over again and keep blaming people who get it wrong and say hey everybody figure it out because we're gonna keep locking you up or or should they look at it and go how is is happening yeah like what is causing people Hey look Mike grew up on the south side of Chicago everyone in his neighborhood was getting beat up and shot and you know if someone said something to him he can't even help but he just sucker punches you because he's on edge all the fuckin time are we supposed to treat him the same way we're gonna treat Chad who grows up in the country club underwears Izod shirts and as his parents were both on xanax and everybody's cool and the maid raised I'm gonna go get a treat no I mean they're not the same people these are not the same kind of human beings like some human beings they got a shitty deal they got a shit deal man if you got a shit deal coming into this planet we got to figure out how to stop those shit deals from taking place so often figure out a way to like make it nicer for people like the worst problems are people that come out of horrible situations in their life when they're young and then go on to do violence and terrible things when they get older yeah if you could just get to them early and look everybody calm down everybody would like let's figure out a way to get you all paths to success and get you to figure out like coaching and and and you know life coaching and education and counseling and community and your wanted and loved and everyone's together and you have a stake in this game just as much as everybody else yeah and then it have this it kid with kids when they're young you'll develop phenomenal human beings instead of people that are likely to grow up and you know engage in the kind of patterns that they saw all their life yeah I think like a big that going our school system like we're not taught how to use our brains we're not taught how to deal with certain emotions when they arise we're just taught you know math sign all that stuff I think the school system we need to implement more teaching us how to meditate how to control our thoughts for sure our emotion and just like Rhonda Patrick says like what the moms eating has so much to do with how that babies formed and how healthy its form sure like for sure small exam yeah I mean it's all there's so many factors and then you know there's things that you're just never gonna be able to control like where you're born like who who your parents are what part of the world do you live on and we were all lucky ish yet even the poorest of us to be here in America well you could be in a shit neighborhood and managed to get out and become at least a financial success yes places where that's just not possible you know literally how lucky are we that we're not living in fucking Singapore where they can just pull you over and just lock you in a cage for a year because you like to smoke plants yeah he's fucking inside shit yeah we're we're all insanely lucky I bet it's pretty crazy being a dad it's crazy I'm bet yeah holy shit it's hard to wrap your head around it until you experience it I bet dude it is uh very very rewarding but it's also very strange very humbling changes to what your whole perspective on things you like you love these little people in a way that you didn't even know you could love it's and it's you just feel different you feel different about people I look at people now men women everybody I look at them like they used to be a baby that started to happen almost immediately after I had a kid like I never used to think about it that way if I saw some dude he was fucking like 70 years old yelling at people fuck you get off my lawn or whatever you know I'd be like look at that old dick hey I'll beat your ass I just think he's an old dickhead fuck that old dickhead but now I go oh that was a baby man that was a baby that just went through life and then got to the point where it's this this old man who just you know everybody could ride that fucking mechanical bull for a second or two fucking 70 years old you know get off my lawn you just can't wait to go back inside drink yourself to death and you're watching Judge Judy you know what that's there's a lot of people like that those people that are out there just in a room where the fucking walls are yellow with cigarettes just just constantly smoking they got a greasy film on all the windows thrown at Tony yeah they're just ordering pizza and their fucking whole house smells like shit those people are alive right now and they were babies and now they're 80 now they're 80 years old coffin they got a tube in their neck maybe they got a fucking an oxygen tank they take with them they little too that goes up their nose and how were they raised who were they raised around yeah how were they raised did they get a good deal they eat yeah they get they get a good deal with a around nice people when they were young or did people smack them for no reason when they were a little baby that people dropped them on their head what happened to them you know what kind of education did they get what kind of nutrition did they get growing up how well did their brain develop you know really let's make you unjust treat everyone nice suit it could be us that's the thing you could be born in a terrible community in you know fill the bikes Russia you could have been born there you could have been born in some nightmare crime-infested part of Liberia you could have been find out could have been you you could be in Libya right now you could be a little child born in Libya right now you have no control of your environment and there is basically a failed state where they're reintroducing slavery open markets you can watch people there's slave trade auctions on YouTube you could see them in Libya yeah if you've seen it right generally terrifying so Francis and Gondo spoke out about it after he knocked out Alistair Overeem's one of the things that he wanted to talk about when he knew who's gonna be fighting for the title you see basically you know and is he he's not the best at English he's still learning it but he was like you know I just want to say fuck slavery like this this is crazy that this is happening today in 2018 they have slavery in Libya they had they worship people with cell phone camera footage of the slave auctions going on damn yeah that could be us yeah we could be born there you know we got lucky everyone got lucky and some got luckier than others but the the lack of just not just the understanding of that but the action like the fact that we always think we have to do all these different things in other countries oh we have to go over there and help these people out their trade we have to go over here and there's a steel embargo we need to talk to these people yeah yeah we're sure we definitely do but what you know we really need to do we need to fix up these fucking poor cities fix this up you got horrible poverty you got places where you have block after block with boarded up windows and you know this is exists right all the reservations oh yeah that's a different world there too it really is yeah but it's like that's never something that's discussed when people talk about the problems that this country faces there they lived roughly you know economic crisis and they use words like you know welfare inequality or you know income inequality they use these terms but at the end of the day we don't think about no it's just like people that are fucked they're fucked like there's their situation is fucked it's not good and they don't get the same break if someone who lives in a nice neighborhood in Columbus Ohio they're not getting the same break it's a different situation and until you fix that you're gonna make criminals and angry people and people that are dysfunctional and people that are you know they're lashing out because they experience violence and and know love their entire life you can always get that man and this is what I was talking about earlier that our technology is constantly and rapidly accelerating but our understanding of our interactions with each other is still fucked up it's still clunky and not well thought through and as much as we know about so many different factors when in terms of like how human beings develop we put almost no effort into fixing well what the fuck what would help they would have to go on an all-out campaign to reinvigorate horrible neighborhoods they would have to fit have to use government money to fix these houses and fix these neighborhoods and make make it safer with more police force make community centers where people can go and be safe set it up so they can do activities there that they would like you know there's there's got to be ways that you can invigorate these places and you've somehow another figure out a way to get work for a lot of these people give them counseling give them let that people know that and they've never really been to school and they're in their fucking 20s there's a place we can go we could teach you how to write and read this is real there's a lot of people that are like this and in the real world you know we can we could fix things if we put money and time into them like the way they decided like they were using Halliburton to go and rebuild places that we blew up in Iraq like that's what they do they go and read fix stuff that we fuckin they build they build shit that we fuck up you know they go over and they put power plants and do all kinds of other shit over there but they get these giant contracts to go over there and do that okay well we definitely blew things up so we should definitely fix it but shouldn't we fix the COG Oh - what are you good gang violence constantly in Chicago death rate in Chicago is crazy right or Detroit or you know fill in the blank whatever bad neighborhood is experiencing some sort of a drug conflict reservations yeah and then how about the fact collectively we all need to look at the fact that there's Mexico's right next to us and the only reason why they have such violent crimes because we like drugs and we keep those drugs illegal so bad guys sell drugs like it ever it's like you don't you know it everybody knows it this isn't I'm not a smart guy like if I know it I'm not I'm no genius if I know the solution you don't think this the people in the highest levels of government know the solution but dude you're a lot smarter than you think because think oh the people you talk up to everyday deep conversations use a lot of knowledge that people have never a force between knowledge that you just sort of remember things that people have told you which I got some of that and actually having an education in it that's the difference like if people ask me about martial arts I can understand almost everything you want to talk about with martial arts with the exception of some judo and some wrestling you know some judo moms from wrestling I would want to talk to an expert and wanna make sure that I got my positions and my my understanding of what what is the best thing to do but everything else I'm sacred in Michael Pollan said though how long on sleep how long do doctors get like how long is their courses on sleep oh yeah one course how long exactly you listen to them or do you listen to your podcast yeah but I don't listen to them when it comes to sleep I listen to a guy like Matthew Walker who's a sleep expert yeah you know I mean there are those these are real he's a real sleep expert so he's the guy that I should listen to but just because I compare it what he says don't get confused like I'm not smart I just remember shit in a way that's smart dude if you could see how my fucking brain actually functions how I write material why I need to constantly keep moving oh you're just crazy you're not smart you're just a crazy nice purse yeah no that's what it is open-minded to definitely open-minded I think I need to be and I think we all need to know I think it's one of our main problems as people and I've been absolutely guilty of this in the past is that we cling to an idea as if it's our identity I'll give it as it if it defines us instead of looking like am i right I might not be right like there's a lot of power and saying damn I'm wrong there's a lot of power in that there really is and we need to recognize that we need to recognize like there's power and saying you're sorry this powering like dude I've definitely fucked up it was I was in the wrong hundred percent I just I don't know what I did I'm sorry you know it is this power in that he's power I feel bad about it this power and saying you know I thought this was correct and it wasn't I really feel stupid sorry I argued that so hard I really thought I was right I'm fucking idiot you got to be a willing to do that if if people were less willing to do that it's like there's some people they say something and they stick with it and then they'll fucking die on that hill right like this is why it was so weird that Donald Trump was trying to say that the the Eagles never stood for the Super Bowl there was an eland and that the you know enough of them didn't want to come so I'm cancelling this party uninvited him yeah that's crazy and that's why it's crazy it's crazy because of the way we really in our heart of hearts and understand how people are capable of communicating with each other yeah that's pretty cool yeah we're capable of being way better than this we're just clumsy we're just stumbling into each other and head-butting each other and shit like a mosh pit you know yeah there's a lot of that man it's a lot of everybody including me I've done it to everybody wanting their side to be right yeah just get so stupid with it that's why it's hard to like wander out up out of your group of friends fuck yeah you got like yeah try to trust people right I don't find people who aren't like secretly hoping you fail yeah a lot of that most people are exhaust similar mindset it's constantly sharing different articles you find in that we're pretty lucky being honest about what you know you know don't pretend you know more than you know yeah you know gotta be aware or what you know like someone like you like I could listen to act BIRT nutritionist a kind of overweight doesn't look good or someone like you who's not an expert nutritionist but look at your body you have a lot of fucking knowledge that you learned yeah but definitely don't listen to me only listen to if I can pair it somebody else's shit or tell you to go listen to their shit because I get things wrong right I don't I'm not educated in the mechanisms of nutrient absorption so there's like things that if you take it with certain things not good for you nutritionist we'll know all that stuff I'm not the person knows I know some things like don't have saturated fat with refined carbohydrates and sugar it's not a good combination especially if you have certain genes I know a bunch of shit I know what you're supposed to be not supposed to eat but some nutritionists though even some like at the if CPI they'll be like well not this one but a certain nutritionist went to school for it got all their degrees and like yeah you can have mac and cheese for lunch and then we'll have like some vans waffles to get you started it's like oh well they must have got some 1990s education like how much are those our 1990s education if they don't keep up man it can be bad right like those food chains from the fucking 80s and those dr. Seuss books shit it was all like cereal and rice and grain at the bottom must get it better have a lot of that and then and then after that it was like meat and those eggs and it was a goofy ass food chain man yeah damn that's what people thought the food pyramid the bottom of it should be grains and breads which are fine as long as you don't have too much of it yeah I mean it's it's that should be a moderation thing depending on your goals or any like yeah but the thing about the nutrition world the real thing is it is so complex and so it's so involved that you really need to talk to an actual expert like if I have issues if I have questions about things my number one go-to is dr. Rhonda Patrick yeah number one she's she's a hundred percent scientific with all of her there's no shenanigans when she has an idea about something it's based on study she can cite those studies to you literally at the drop of a hat and she'd tell you what the what's what's going on like what why is this good with that and why does this help that why does this hurt that like she's the go-to person for me so she's she's a wizard you know she's so fucking smart so like I could ask someone like that but I'm absolutely not a nutrition expert I know what I've been able to do that works pretty good for me and I've got some loosely fucking duct taped together knowledge but they're the real people out there like Rhonda Patrick or Rob wolf or Kris crusher or Ben Greenfield like I'd bet in here a couple weeks ago dude he's a wizard listen that three times what do you probably a purple or brown belt nutrition then no I think I'm a blue belt no no no being honest you know fifty years old and you're crazy I take trt all those things help yeah but the real experts meant there their knowledge is constantly growing this is the thing about Rhonda that's so fantastic is she's on top of all of these peer-reviewed papers and new studies and all these things that are going on and things that are in the process of going on she's in this loop of clinical she's a clinical researcher so she's in this loop of all these wizards and she does her own podcast so she's like she's constantly up on everything that's going on so she'll send you things about new data and she's always like every time I have her in here it's three hours where I might talk like five times like I might go so why does that do that that's good question and she's not even looking at notes man like she's and we get to learn from it a young age and apply it dude like so who's to say we're not fighting healthfully at 40 if we monitor injuries and monitor our sparring and all that like but the thing is gonna be brain health or that's a little that's the real problem the real like cat Zingano was here do you guys see that or listen to me see that one yet she had a significant brain injury apparently from Amanda Nunez Amanda Nunez threw some boulders long boulders she hurts people she's a fucking killer Etta and it she was concussed so badly in that fight that it fucked up her hormone levels she became hypothyroid from that fight and continues to be so to this day she gained 25 pounds she said or 20 25 pounds someone the neighborhood somewhere between 20 and 25 pounds could not shake it off she goes I was I was eating like 400 hours a day my body would not let go of this weight and she found out she was hyperthyroid and she had all sorts of problems with her cognition with her memory with her she couldn't see when she was sparring she wasn't seeing things anymore she wasn't seeing reads you know she wasn't like if she fainted she fainted someone she couldn't see the reaction she was just charging at them full blast she's like I had no sense of what I was doing so she started getting this crazy magnetic therapy they do this yeah you saw it on her Instagram yeah and it really helped her 100% brought her back and she said they've been able to do that with soldiers and always they reignite all these air and they can target specific areas of your brain where you're having a hard time functioning correctly yeah so she got all of her balance back all over issues and you know she says she feels 100% or close to it but that that kind of shit it gives me hope right like they're thinking well that's one sort of therapy that they can do maybe they'll be more in the future and there's a lot of hope and like all this pioneering stem-cell shit and exosomes and all these different things that they're working on to try to regenerate neuro tissue oh really yeah who knows I mean we're in you know amazing amazing times but again this is just technologically and and medically it's still culturally were you happy as fuck yeah yeah technologically yeah like you guys see that they're gonna take away the bikinis and Miss America I saw that I was like come on Sun Tan it's hilarious listen they're gonna make it a contest they're not gonna judge them on their looks anymore you're gonna make it a contest they're not gonna judge them on their looks nope nope they're not judging them on their appearance anymore oh do a different thing they should just do a different thing yeah but I guess they want the name Miss America but then how does Miss America Miss America go to Miss Universe is that how it works you don't know you know he's got all the money wasn't that what the one where Steve Harvey said the wrong person yeah was that Miss America or Miss Universe University damn dude that would gone that would suck toad suck it's just a crazy thing man to have a beauty contest imagine if they had them for men I mean the cotton bodybuilding contests or bodybuilding contests that's a different thing but imagine if they had just a gorgeous man competition and the guy's just walk out and they would you know they ask him questions some pale around head it's all about eating pussy all day I don't even care about myself just trying to say the right thing hoping that they get picked that's a weird thing right that the super weird it's not something than anybody's clamoring for equality on I'll tell you that like no one's asking for mr. man mr. handsome all America man mr. universe America mr. America is only like a bodybuilder mr. universes bodybuilder this Dorian Yates motherfucker right you know that's Lee Haney that's mr. universe yeah mr. Olympia right mr. Olympia is the top of the heap who's the one with the dreads spiralling dreads which one of the body mr. universe oh that dude was on fear factor Kali yeah Kali muscle high green khaki high green oh right right right right right yeah there's some big-ass dudes out there there's some big fucking dudes out there what is that lose but that's ridiculous you have to look at it awaken okay look at it look at this but make it bigger Jamie dude get the fuck out of here how is that a human's ass and you hear how GSP how messed up he got for eating all that like imagine these guys insides I guess their lifespans not long right that guy must have a dick like a rhino horn for just a little peckerhead besides these fuckers that is just what okay now here's the real question here's my question I guess maybe I'm ignorant but how the fuck could you tell who's better no shit how do you tell they're both they're both ridiculous like what are you looking for even even on each side right how weird is that yeah because like at the top level when you when you watch like a mr. Olympia or something like that and you see dude stand onstage flexin do you is one of them stand out to you at all yeah they all look super jacked look at those two a weird life to live wouldn't it those legs are preposterous those are preposterous thighs this shit doesn't make any sense I mean look at your legs that's Ronnie motherfucker Coleman Ronnie Coleman in his day what would you be beer tactic if you had to fight that guy in a fist fight hang on or stay away or stay away hang on make em work get to it yeah two minutes just keep fighting for underhooks tail oh yeah that guy's got about 45 seconds you know I mean it might fuck you up and throw you through a wall that quick yeah well on the balance the problem with that is he will be able to stand up and he's gonna throw his body backwards and try to land on you how it hurt yeah you got to be careful with the whole take of guys back when he's still got some juice yes in particular right yeah Street taking someone's back well there's just I mean it can be done especially if they got some juice in them they're still they still have strength to just run out of air and have that one big explosion he's a giant dude though he might be so big that if you did get ahold of him he was just throw you just spill throw you on top of a car I mean those guys lift holy shit how much 700 squats probably just seven hundred eight thousand six hundred forty years on shit that's that's that's a sport though you kind of like get out of it what you put in like Fighting's not always you don't get out what you put in always that's me and really put in two in the left gene and the right cheek and that's the sport where you have to do it it's like one of the only sports where we just all understand you have to do how do you not do it all right yeah am i right I mean at that level for sure they're all working hard but for sure they're taking steroids oh yeah 495 495 Jesus Christ Jesus Christ kiyah green holy that's a powerful human being and that ain't shit he's doing reps he's doing it for reps any man who that's a strong fucking harsh an event and that kind of strength is that kind of strength scary but it's nothing compared to that like strongman type shit do you see that Magnusson guy that uh magnus carlsen dude the dude who's on the game of thrones what's his name I got a mountain Gregor the mountain guy Connor is fucking around yeah yeah that was funny that guy just won would you say Jamie I have said his character's name I can't say this Oh what's his real name Oh how do you say that okay how do you say that name Hoffa for Julius bjornsen Yorn son six foot nine half Thor yeah he's six foot nine dude that guy's so ridiculously huge look at the size of this fucker I bet he has to hire dudes to just to cock-block for him no just around him all the time going no no more no more mr. bjornsen must rest mr. bjornsen has no more common sizes motherfucker let me sighs this motherfucker had nine dead lifts a thousand pounds on TV a thousand pounds bro that's a half a car the big boy what the fuck yeah giant human giant human that one dude got into MMA and is still fighting yeah what the fuck is his name he fought one of the Gracie's who'd he fought Igor Gracie put you now ski who Janowski that's he fighting for what Russian promotion this is the holiest promotion or rest promotion he fought you an m1 maybe he's he's slimming down like quite a bit it's very interesting he's still fighting to him yeah I mean if you look at yeah look at how he used to be up on top see Jamie those two and the shorts keep going right there yeah that's what he used to look like versus what he looks like now so he used to be super duper duper jacked but he still fucking stupid strong just obeyed strong I mean but he had to lean up man because he was he just couldn't fight like that he fought Tim Kennedy bro I mean I'm sorry fuck tim sylvia that's right he fought tim sylvia god why did I have that skate me I was thinking maniac and I couldn't come up with last name but Tim Sylvia beat the shit out of him how I bet well he fought Tim Sylvia too young I mean he he just thought because he was big and strong he would be able to see if you can find the pudzianowski Tim Sylvia fight Jimmy Tim is a fucking world-class UFC heavyweight there's no video would say what directed it to Silva not Sylvia oh damn slimming down he's like fog just go to videos does it have it yeah there it is there it is but Tim just wore his ass out and Tim was heavy in that fight too he just wore him out just kept beating him up Tim's giant man he's a big motherfucker but it's just he's just way too skillful like put you know he was crazy he tried to just beat on him with his power but good luck with all that and Tim just kept wearing on them and need them and fucking him up Tim was like super relaxed pace himself again I mean they're a pop pop not throwing with everything he's got just staying on real pro I mean whoever made this fight is a real fucking like a real sinister person crazy mismatch but I guess put Janowski wanted it man that's what a stud that guy is to him that's cool he's a stud I mean he really believed in himself he feels like he's got that kind of power he could kill anybody just smash him but it didn't work with me yeah and Tim just eventually started wearing on I'm allowed to do tiro and Randy hit Tim with that overhand right I was crazy oh yeah you threw an inside leg kick and an overhand right and Tim was he was out on his feet like Tim said he was talking about it at one point time in the future and he said that he forgot what round it was like there he was like it's only the third round right now like Tim is the last round he's like what like he forgot around yeah like he he probably was out on his feet the whole fight I mean think about that hit that shot yeah he gets caught right on the job second thing that's nuts seven seconds in look at this inside leg kick hammer and it's perfectly placed and you know Tim and him were friends and Tim was really having a hard time believing that Randy wanted to fight him cuz Randy had stayed at his house they stayed together for a while been friends he was all fun maybe he didn't stay in his house I might have made that up he keeps it good but they were friends I know they were good friends and so Tim was kind of blown away that Randy wanted to fight him but Randy didn't give a fuck Robert Falls told me he'd never saw Randy lose around in the gym ever it's an animal dude I was here for Randy's debut fought two times that night oh yeah strangled two people smashed him and he's basically a wrestler who knew a few submission holds who had done some boxing the army you know and nobody nobody do anything back then started at 30-something right yep I think he was like 34 35 for his UFC debut that's yeah yeah and then when he fought Vitor that's that's that was a really important fight in MMA a really important fight because Vitor was like 240 plus pounds then he was jug fame it was John and he had this huge knack like his next start in the middle of his forehead he was just so huge and they had written for his like strength so it's had no known weaknesses like this is how much of a monster Vitor was he was just light and everybody on fire but he kept getting bigger and bigger bigger he kept getting thicker and bigger and I think one of the reasons was Mark Coleman I think everybody back then was scared of Mark Coleman everybody was like fuck his Coleman was 265 and fucking he was always like between 255 and 260 somewhere in that range but so jacked and Mark was a fucking serious wrestler and he would take you down and he was gonna get on top of you and he was gonna deliver pain he was smashing people with head butts no gloves and this is the Mark Coleman era and this is the era where Vitor is coming up so Vitor gets to like 240 pounds and fights Randy and Randy survives the opening barrage really doesn't get hit with much and just starts to slowly chip away at feet or until he gets him up against cage beats him up and gets him down and smashes him and everybody was in shock everybody was like what how did he lose how is it possible and how did he lose like this it was a really important fight in MMA because it was a fight where you have a narrative that you think is playing out and then a lesson gets taught to everybody like no no you got to big this is all muscle that you don't need it doesn't help you you get tired you need to have better endurance this is not the way you you know you fight against a guy who can survive and we didn't know that yet because nobody knew that there was gonna be people who survived you know nobody knew this we gonna be with submission defense when people are caught in submissions they tapped you know how often did anybody get it out of anything back then like we know when he knew the progression that it was going to take we learned in that Randy fight that there's there's a certain level of winner there's guys that just they're fucking mental animals they just know how to win they know how to break people and you get to see that in Randy man sweet it's crazy like and then everyone thought all the Machida era and there's really that was me I said though this but the smarter we get the real there's no gonna be an era but then you wonder what John Jones well there's a John Jones era right now I mean this is the John Jones era no question about it if you look at the actual results in fights I don't care what they say about anything else this is what people gonna remember when you go back and look at this era of light heavyweights you think about John Jones it's just like when Mohammed Ali was in his prime people thought about Ali when sugar lay Ray Leonard was a welterweight champion people thought about sugar ray you gotta think about Jon Jones it's definitely that Jon Jones era but it's just an error of so much turmoil and you know you want to talk about a guy who had more potential than probably anybody I've ever seen fight at anybody yeah I mean John does the same kind of shit that you were telling me that you do just makes things up wise in there just sees things and goes with it like that thing that he did with Glover that overhook well yeah Gracie lock yeah I mean I don't know if he ever did that in the past before but didn't look like it looked like you probably just saw it right there so let me just yank on this yeah fuck up his shoulder at home John would do crazy shit spinning elbows and all that I mean he's just he knows how to be loose in there knows how he knows how to do things I wonder steep a John man do you're seeing that I can't believe gonna see steep ad so you can't believe it either dude son I can't believe it live raising I'm more jacked for that fight than any Bryan that's right that's the Vegas card that is a crazy fight who wins Steve a DC is very interesting because the last time that we saw steep a in like a fight with a really high-level wrestler was who who's that who was the last fight where steep a fought someone who really knew how to wrestle who's it been I'm trying to think well he's fought tough guys he fought mark hunt if our junior who's much more of a boxer obviously yeah Fabrizio didn't mean furry Segura tag coming in so who was like the toughest wrestler he fought if you go back a little bit further let's see right Nelson Roy Nelson didn't really he's I mean Roy Nelson let's be honest right Nelson could fight middleweight right yeah he's just an animal if he wanted to lose that gut how much would he lose holy smokes dude he's probably walking around about 250 right with that giant crazy belly my height which is part of his trademark right but if he decided to cut weight and just go on some crazy diet and cut out all the bullshit and drain all the fat what do you think he would weigh I think you can make 185 about that easily 185 dude easily right that's crazy oh man the thing is like steep pays a wrestler he knows what he needs to do and like yeah we're gonna find out man he is a wrestler for sure but he's not the same caliber of wrestler that Daniel Cormier is but Daniel Cormier is a legit light heavyweight who has fought successfully at heavyweight and never lost it heavyweight yeah so it makes it real interesting because Daniel look Daniel remember when he fought Josh Barnett and fucking sent up sailing through the air josh is a big fella and that fucker can grapple today he grapple he really knows how to grapple Danny that's it that's a big fucking talk oh I forgot Frances ain't God who Derrick Lewis don't blink extraordinary good big fight you think so I think so how the fuck would you anybody know who's gonna win that fight kids the Pettis go Paolo Costa in your riot hall oh what a card this is imagine holo coasters a beast imagine the lawsuit PS has got going
