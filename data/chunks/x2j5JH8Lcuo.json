Bichette 4 3 2 1 POW Luis Gomez we are live we are live connected through the interwebs and through a network of comedians Luis Gomez Gosha Gomez was Jacob asked what why do you why do you like the J cuz go Google Luis Gomez and watch how many baseball players fucking just that's a problem makin people use the J it's very pretentious for going yeah I agree no it is I understand have to but it's almost like woman it's almost ironic because I'm such a piece of garbage so I would have liked a middle initial like I'm right like you're like a luminary yeah some important some important intellectual yeah it is but yeah it just it separates me as well but I almost feel like I've made a joke at this point they're correct everyone that doesn't say the J I so if I didn't correct you oh I see I wouldn't be being true to myself I understand so Louis J Gomez thank you I feel like you know I've talked about this ad nauseam on the podcast but it thinks it's one of the most unique times for like networks of comedians that we're all connected together in a way that we wouldn't we weren't really before it was always like East Coast versus West Coast for some stupid fucking reason there was always this debate where the best comics are from and the style of comedy but that shit seems to be out the window the internet yeah the best comic side Nate bargatze lives in fucking Tennessee who's that he's a great comic City clean squeaky clean my son's Godfather just did enough look special how do you spells last name VAR GA t ze brilliant comic and a tz8 he's but he grew up in Tennessee and he was like dude I don't wanna live in New York or LA good for an hour big house for $300,000 a fucking mansion get ready for the zombies yes yeah zombies you want to live in that house like that old dude and his daughter did yeah gonna live out there and have a fucking perimeter protected yeah Kazakhstan hope he hasn't been in LA he's been a busy for 12 years now that psychopath yeah r.i.p to Stanhope's dogs no birdies dog yesterday did a big thing on social media about it very touching very touching they had to put their dog said I went through that last year with two dogs they're both couldn't walk anymore I mean I I held on as long as that cabin dice I had to carry my dog in and out of the house I had to carry him to eat I'd carry him outside he's 140 pounds right it was just I couldn't walk his old man with a lot of leg locks I feel like the dog should have some good defense I want to protect my fuckin house no just big dog that it's really old who's 13 which is super old for a mastiff oh yeah there's a huge dog really old firm he said what's called a Regency Mastiff which is he was a part Neapolitan Mastiff and part pitbull with a guy who my friend Joe who raised him and bred them he bred out all of the animal aggression so he wouldn't let any dogs breed if they were aggressive towards people or they're aggressive towards other dogs so what you get is this super chill massive dog oh wow yeah who's athletic it's like they were small for like a mastiff is like they can go like 200 plus pounds but those dogs are not very athletic they don't move very good right this one was it mixed so and it's very like 140 they're like a fucking running back I got a kid so I have I have a hard time bringing beasts into my home that can kill yeah a child very why's it so even you endless sad and I might want to use anti pitbull people but I do understand when you see you know you see irresponsible owners it's not the dog you have an asshole some fucking kid who doesn't know how to train a pit bull the proper way in animal that can literally kill somebody mm-hmm um and you you know you see them you know the mall children and they you know and it's a sad there's such a sad thing so I get terrified anytime I see my dog my kid I walk through streets of New York City with him I look at Harlem so it's you know every other block is like the hood and then it's nice and then it's the hood and work is so weird like yeah do that yeah it's you know what's it's definitely called gentrification right sort of I mean I guess this is more of racially they're talking with gentrification sort of a I think it's like a class thing because I grew up in a really shitty I grew up in the suburbs but very poor welfare section eight and kids in the city though when they grow up or they're like on the next block there's like a millionaire right or there on the subway and there's some fucking dude is gonna Wall Street and you know he's he they're just constantly around an energy of success which is a very different thing when you go to the suburbs or like rural areas it's a depressing nobody's striving to even get out really right no that's a very good point right like you get to be truly integrated in New York City which where LA is missing that L is missing out in a big way la you have retrieval and poor people you know they're separated by cars yeah they're separated by neighborhoods you can't hang out what you have to be in that social circle you have to because people always debate like always kahu's got hotter chicks in New York or LA and the answer is LA but in New York you're gonna see them in New York like he walked down the street me and Ari did he does a podcast every year called happy booby day and we did it last year collegian askance and all it is happy booby day it's today to be honest with you it's the FIR it's the the first like days of spring usually end of March beginning of April it's the first day that girls were like miniskirts out and their tits are just hanging out and we literally just walk through the streets following hot chicks comment it was the most I mean you literally I don't even know I don't even know how we have careers at all like is we did this a year ago this isn't fucking 20 years ago but yeah you but you get to see them get to interact with them in LA you're not interacting with a crazy hot model unless you know the right people you'd have to be standing somewhere where they go alright cuz like in LA if you wanted to meet you'd have to run a casting agency that's why those guys started that shake how many people went into the business just so the meat girls just get pussy like thirty percent of them that whole motley crew movie they said they're unapologetic about that they're unapologetic they're like yeah we did this Mick Mars was like if it wasn't for group he's in a real interview if it wasn't for groupies I wouldn't even become a musician yeah I mean people would criticize that like oh so gross there should be real artists that is a crazy life you do not understand no one understands I don't understand there's no fucking like we had David Lee Roth in here Coco there's no fucking way any of us will ever understand what it was like to be David Lee Roth it is not human possible yeah he is not pot and to be to come out the other end is fucking cool as that guy is like how the hell did that happen did not be I feel like I'm dying and I don't party at all really like I drink a little bit and I feel like every day I'm like is that my liver I don't even know my levers on my body I swear to god I couldn't point to my liver on my bouquet if you're standing on Orthodox dance and someone hits you with a left hook to the body that's where your liver is that's why guys drop right here yep it's right under your ribs okay so when you punch somebody in the liver you're in a lot of guys mistakenly go below the ribs yeah you'd want to go right where the floating ribs or the red bounces into the yeah if you watched like Shannon the cannon Briggs shout out to the champ oh look at David Ruffin that picture huh oh come on man nobody lives like that that guy was on top of the goddamn world he was built like a Greek god he could do the full splits who do fucking wheel kicks on stage he shit unapologetic the level of sex this guy must have had my god off the chart oh my god it to be honest with you when I saw a comedy hit him I sorted comedy wanting idolizing guys like that I grew up on a tease medal so I I sort comedy 15 years ago it was literally a different time like you didn't really have to shy away from being like yeah I want to fuck after a show that wasn't a crazy thought no well you'll still want to do it but now it's just why yeah yeah hey go to go to Shannon the cannon Briggs page his Instagram page there's something very funny that Tucker Carlson said I know people like oh my god don't even quote him he said something very felonious yet he says I'm very funny about some other news anchor that this is all the men that are gonna be left if radical feminists take over the world apologetic yeah this spectacle I forget what the way he phrased it was very funny I was like there's a lot of fucking people like that a lot of guys like that out there and it's they don't want to be that guy they're stuck that's all they can pull off well they're doing probably the smarter move because we're we're going down to where I don't think they're saying oh the pendulum will swing back and we're gonna eventually be able to celebrate rape culture again and it's never gonna happen okay we are going down a path where you know on television and their entertainment you see what's being booked you see what's being pushed out there and look it despite the fact that there's a political message and everything there's still some good shit out there sound like there's some great shit you know that's one of the reasons why I posted a Tim Dylan video yesterday yeah the other that sham the canon one there's one where he's he hits his dude like it's one of his more recent fight clips that he put up the fight starts it goes like 10 seconds and he steps towards this dude and hits him with a left hook to the body and crumple zone and I just want to show he's like a master at the liver shot a liver shot he's one of the best heavyweights of all time when it comes to liver shots he was so good at it if you would have said pointer watch this watch this this is Shannon cannon watch look watch this liver bang that's it see he goes to the body and then down to the gut he'll pop you with the jab pop you with the hook upstairs watch this look at this see this is they're just shown it boom watch the left hook pop what's this upstairs boom and then downstairs that's one of them but that's not the one we stopped - dude he just came jumping out of the gate but there's another one I think a little bit further back than that he looks like he hits so hard he hit so hard oh my god just in general like you know and you know we obviously both watch a lot and I don't really watch boxing but now that I'm a pretty big MMA fan i watch boxing in a different the way they punch it looks so devastating oh for sure so I remember one time we did a street promotion I was just running Street teams in New York City for comedy clubs like even before I started comedy and we did a thing where we got like boxing gloves and headgear and we went out and we're challenging people to come in and just box and if they could beat me in a boxing match - I've never fucking training the day in my life but if they could just simply beat me in a boxing match they got free tickets to the show that night and was just a way to generate a crowd of my street team guys were selling tickets to people trying to go to a dumb comedy show do you think it helped your act at all like I was even doing comedy at that we had punched I watched this guy see that left to the body see how it digs that watch that one more time well watch how he sets it up he jabs to the head and then when you cover upstairs oh look at that boom he hits through the left hook to the face but it's a quick left hook to set up the left hook to the body by the way he's 50 yeah I see his beard he's a fucking animal nobody wants to fight him but I think there's also a trt issue but nobody wants to fight him right now here's a hard time getting fights well that's his chin bro leave his cello don't make fun of facial hair the guy just got fucked up by the cannon let's go champ if you go to his Instagram page it's all let's go champ let's go Chet it's very inspiring that yeah like if I want to feel good I go to sharing the cannons Instagram pitch is that where you go yeah it makes me feel good it's all positive it's like let's go champ it is like you got to drink more water champ you got to eat healthy champ here it is it's the champ had him on the show once we had him call in I think this thing knows him pretty well you got to be there with him live yeah he's all personality yeah he's a battery of like santa claus let's get some serious white and that beard oh yeah I think he's still trying to fight he had some sort of a trt issue no testosterone replacement they should make a separate league where you just let the guys yeah steroids into your team who cares especially older guys yeah Vitor Belfort is now go into one FC Ghana and looks good again looking sexy we're all filled out yeah he got fucked oh yeah that dude he fought Timothy Dukan Nass Dukan I think is his last name their guy's a beast that one Fc show was legit yeah if you watched it I've watched just highlights I don't have time to watch all the UFC fights and then this time so it's hard to come to watch the other cards as well but once in a while watching Bellator I'll watch one Fc yeah we'll do that I owe my god his eyes locked up oh my god that's terrible that's a terrible injury yeah that looks like it split his eyelid did oh my god Jesus Christ it split his fucking eyelid dude oh my god people people don't realize like that side of it like I mean that's fucking well touch your face I mean you had a little bit of an mm fight you know what it's like not really yeah yeah you did lose a fight that's another comedian he beat a comedian up I'm very impressive but hey it was he had a Taekwondo held four times you take that back you know people forget how to do shit man if you all bullshit aside but they also gave out a lot of talk mondo black belts they're 100% because it's part of the business if you're not giving your belts out Howard you're not going to get people to come back dude I know a lot of people that were like my son's nine years old we just got his black belt oh and like oh what are you even saying I will beat the shit out of that kid it's right now well that's the problem we give another 9 year olds will most there's an actual tough athletic kid who mean kid who's not afraid of getting it that's a dinner between kids who like will do you know karate and kick a ball there's also the kids that are just from the hood that have been being punched in the face by their uncles and fathers since they were a baby and they are just ready to fight and they're yeah being hit to them it's like you get desensitized so if you do any sort of training or or if you have a really tough environment you actually get to sense s2 and you realize after being hit a few times that once the adrenaline kicks in it doesn't really hurt you know it hurts after the fact but so I think you have those kids that will just I mean wreck their shit just a little nine-year-old from the hood that's your tough kid kids that grow up around violence if you get in street fights all the time if you run other kids get in street fights people show you how to do things you learn things there's a lot of kids that are 10 11 years old that live in poor neighborhoods whether it's South Boston or you know South Side Chicago whatever in any dangerous neighborhood that's like filled with poverty those kids will be more apt to succeed in fights yeah they understand how to fight pull the trigger they're not could be that's really the thing you know they have to pull the trigger because people who pulled the trigger on them or it's like there's a lot of people that talk a lot of shit but they never really pull the true see those guys yes I say pull the trigger obviously I need mean punch someone I don't mean I thought you said Chicago's yes it's like especially after that Nipsey Hussle guy got killed that's crazy that's so sad yeah on video too they have the no I'm at a hip-hop fan at all but apparently was very positive like anti violence like it wasn't like you know thuggy rapper that was promoting you know drug dealing and gang violence which I don't really know if even people do that as much anymore I don't know but by all accounts this guy was loved and uh you know he just it's just beyond fucked huh just like that that that is still going on in this world it was if I'm not mistaken he got into a fight with a guy right and the guy came back with a gun don't know and shot him that's what I read I think it was like a sometimes like those lines something along those lines because the this when you hear a better hip-hop artist gunned down you're like aw is this some long-standing beef and you know you know who knows but I think it was literally a fight that these guys got and the guy came back with a gun and just fucking started unloading which is it's brutal that's literally how my father died literally well except with it was it with a knife which is a much more hardcore way to go but my dad was that side of shrimp club at four o'clock in the morning got into an argument with a kid you know like a 16 year old kid and they got to a fistfight you know the kid came back like an hour later with the kitchen knife and stabbed him that's that and it's like God it also takes a different type of person to you know to kill I'm mama I'm up a kid in the hood who's just ready to pull the trigger and punch somebody like I'm not I grew up in a where where where it's like I was taught while you wait till they throw the first punch which is a terrible strategy but the that's sort of the way that I always it was always like fistfights in the parking lot with your friends you weren't trying to really hurt each other it was you got into an argument over a video game you went out back in the parking lot and you beat each other up for two minutes and then that was that but guys that are you know willing to kill somebody over whatever just an argument to take their life completely without any you see they lose sense of the repercussions of it as well which is sort of like that's something that I think would separate most people and go like are well I don't wanna go to jail there's cameras I think a giant chunk of it is how the but like what experiences they have growing up like what happens them are they abused are they beaten are they around a lot of violence yeah what are they exposed to and then how much more likely are you to commit that yeah to push that on to the next person that's really what it is I mean that's the vast majority I mean it's not a it's not a shocker that so much violent crime comes from poor neighborhoods it's it's like it makes itself it makes itself of course it's almost like a virus I agree and I I you know I grew up my mom was extremely abusive you know and I grew up with a low around a ton of violence a ton of physical and emotional abuse verbal abuse always the threat of violence at the drop of a hat it was it was always immediately - I'll beat the shit out of you if you don't do what I say even if she wasn't being violent and I did I got the opposite to it I I you know with my son dude literally my son I've never even spanked him I've never smacked him on the hand I've never I've never even really yelled at my son um and I don't think that I got lucky and have a good kid I do have a could grab a great kid but I think it's a direct rule you know correlation to me not being aggressive with him at all right yeah and I talk the talking is huge right have little conversations with them don't just tell them what to do why yeah and the why if they don't understand why you know that's just in general in life people just in general if they understand why something there's a real purpose there and then they do what they're doing you know with that purpose in mind yeah and I think little kids they're you know they're so malleable and sometimes it's annoying for them to ask why two or three times and it's easy to lose your patience but what you realize what you're you know that's you know I'm a piece of shit I'll admit I'm the first one to admit it but the only good thing I do I think is the fact that I'm creating this good little person he's a really good sweet person that I think is gonna be you know all the shit that I didn't really have or you know all the good qualities that I think I you know I could have maybe had if I was raised the right way I'm trying to give my son and I think that's a really big responsibility and that's why you know you I feel bad when you see like real violence like that like fucking people that are like being really you like dude I know that person experienced some crazy shit on and it's not their fault in a weird way and it's definitely not you know I never lived in the worst neighborhood in the world but I lived in a shady one for quite a bit we lived in this place called Jamaica Plain outside of Boston for about a year my parents knew immediately we had to get the fuck out of there we only I think we stayed maybe a year a little over a year and we got out of there as quick as we can but there was like a lot of break-in and slaughter it was lower income it wasn't terrible it wasn't like a gang violence shoot-'em-up type shit but there was a lot of criminals yeah a lot of shady shit shit poverty does you know happen it doesn't have to be like gangs just shitty do poverty makes people do crazy shit it does and it makes I was never around kids that were that aggressive like kids were always trying to fight me and I just moved there we just moved there from Florida and I was like fuck I gotta get out of here and that's what led me to martial art how are you 13 okay you know teenage boy almost a man you're going through puberty at this point yeah it's a scary time and there was all these kids that were just they were so did already fucked they're already doing drugs they're he's just like a plain low-income white right and Puerto Rican like but mostly that mostly white and Puerto Rican it was a lot of it just a lot of cigarette smokers at 13 kids were smoking cigarettes already they were drinking all the time isolated among cigarettes for her when I was with hands that crazy I swear to God like Greg Fitzsimmons lived in a house with two parents that were chain smokers in an apartment and they never opened the windows in the winter are you crazy my mom never think there's no sense my mom smoked through her entire pregnancy with me dawg yeah I mean they don't look once again she doesn't know kind of nothing they knew they'd sort of new jewelry was out on smoking while you were pregnant I think in 82 when I was born oh yeah for 82 I'm 67 you your mama zero excuses my mom was in the 60s the 60s it was like you had to read a book 20 you know yeah my mom my mom was 20 like that is crying Majan that how old were you when you first go crazy 40 you're four that's fuck that's so perfect you know such a perfect I was thirty we fuck it's too young and I think my mom was 18 when she had my sister yeah it's just just the act of weather no wonder when you start it with if you started at 20 if we started at 40 the act of raising another human being it just changes who the fuck you are it just does yeah like everything switches and gets weird and then you're like oh I'm responsible for shaping your life and Italy's helping to shape your life and if I do a good job you'll be a good person you'll go out there and you'll make more good people and you'll meet good people which is really what everybody wants at the end of the day everybody wants camaraderie and love and friendship that's why like what's the worst shit that can happen today you get cancelled everybody wants to cancel people yeah you're out get out of here done it's over there's a weird strange it's also like I want you to not be able to make money but it's not I want you to starve or go home be homeless I don't really understand it's a specific it's not specific in terms like they don't want you to be able to make an income they want to hurt you that's what it is because they're scared of someone doing it to them this is the big part of why people pull the trigger on that stuff well think I just the people are calling for people to get cancelled for like nothing like little tiny things never again it's because they're scared of it actually happening so this is like you have this ultimate power to just like get upset at someone for virtually anything pick it pick a cause you know whatever it is it's also it's it's sort of intoxicating and it's fun and most people don't have real opinions on anything and then you have this this you know on Facebook or Twitter or whatever social media platform you have an immediate gratification of mine I just got 20 likes on a thought of mine yeah that's addictive as fuck but super addictive you know that that right there well you know I understand why people continue to come back and then nobody really cares as soon as you put your computer down or your phone down nobody gives a fuck about any of these issues at the supermarket or the bowling alley or the library if that's not what's important with what's important is the Internet is essentially the whole war is a big window and everyone has a rock just look at it throw rocks yeah and if you find a thing to throw a rock about whether it's a throw rock about politics or gender or race or social justice or you know what fill in the blank the environment you know the saving the animals everyone's throwing rocks you know and very few people are actually communicating it's a strange time well you would think that you would want in an ideal world you would want people that have differing ideas to come together sit down have an honest conversation yes and go awesome dude go live your life I'll live my life I learned a little bit just now yeah and then you go off and you go yeah that that's how you learn from different cultures that's how we you know ultimately got to a place you know I think that I I think it's a great country I in a weird way I think it's I'm proud to be an American you know I'm proud um you know I don't think all the things that people think that are awful about this country are necessarily awful um you know I think the opportunity to make money I did grow up on wealth and I grew up poor and you know I you know I'm you know for all intents and purposes I'm living my dream right now and I get to kind of do what I want to do and I look at that and I say yes because I live in a place where that opportunity's there of course look America is amazing it doesn't mean it's perfect not certainly it gives you more opportunity than anywhere that I've ever heard of and it's a fun place man I like it here yeah fucking country is fun but there's definitely some fucked up aspects of it the fact that we're a country this is the the big one is immigration to me because immigration to me when people take a hard line one way or the other I'm always like hmm man this is a weird one immigration is a weird one you don't want to diminish the quality of life for everyone in the country but you don't want to not let people in because that's what the country is based on and we see these fenced in people and where's it is it El Paso there was something that they had on the news or they showed all these people fenced in and what looks like a dog kennel and these these people that snuck across the border and they captured them something put them in this fucking outdoor fenced in cage like dude we don't even do that to violent murder yeah you have a violent murderer who's due process well not just due process you put him in a prison man right like they don't have the facilities to do what they're doing right and then people like will this shouldn't be coming across the border like I guess so but wouldn't you I'm also like wouldn't you who cares like I I understand yes there is sort of uh but anybody who is up in arms about immigrants coming into this country most of the time they're also on one side of the political spectrum on every other issue it's not like it's an independent thought it's like they and everybody that's on both sides you know and you know I just sort of I'm in a I have my own personal life philosophy where I'm not gonna solve the immigration issue and to be honest as we're talking about I'm going I don't know I I have no idea what the answer is here people are obsessed with being right people always want to have an answer I don't fucking know but I do know that I have things in my life that you know I can fix I know there are you know the things about my personality and things about me in my own you know my own issues that I need to fix so I'll sort of start there you know and I think more people need to kind of you know before they start espousing opinions look at themselves and figure out why they're coming up with these opinions that were saying yeah just sort of um is like it pulls on your humanity you see a bunch of people caged in with their children and in some fenced in area that literally looks like a dog kennel yeah this is crazy well my thing I don't care about that I just I I don't care about people coming in the country and going in these imaginary lines I you know it's just sort of like yeah I think it's I I think as a human being is hard to see that and I look away from shit like that a lot you know I don't look III don't like looking at videos like that I don't like watching sad things I don't watch any gore shit I didn't watch the the video of the dude that moved down those people in New Zealand you know yeah it is a sad thing and I really don't know the solution look at this shit it says they treated us like we are animals holding pen for migrant families and El Paso shut down shut down overnight I guess okay because people found out about it it's crazy look at that that's that's a dog kennel it means people just sitting around waiting for what I mean that if that was murderers they wouldn't do so let's say you're the guy in charge though what do you do what would you I mean me I was a good question don't go let it men but I don't know if that's the right answer I don't know if it's the answer to either but I guarantee you all of our your relatives came from another country my relatives all came from another country they I'm third-generation they knew that Europe sucked they knew that Italy sucked and so they're like look I mean no disrespect Italy but they decided I gotta get the fuck out of here and they got on a boat all of them grandparents on both sides they both came over here when they were kids is Italy suck seems awesome everything I've seen about it grateful well the food is fantastic when I talked to a guy there those trying to get an understanding cuz he wanted his kids to go to college in America anybody was basically saying was there was just not enough opportunity and in Italy and that he wanted his son to have more opportunity and so he's driving a cab actually they all speak two languages they all speak perfect English like a good percentage of it yeah they're you know it's a smart place a lot of in the art is insane when you're when you're going through Rome and you go through the Vatican and you see there billions of dollars literally billions of dollars in artwork you're like holy shit this is what a crazy culture yeah this culture all they wanted to do was create beautiful architecture create beautiful art make wine made great food have sex fuck like crazy and kind of take over the world I mean they took over the world for a long-ass time no problem Italy it sounds great Aryan people yeah but you know today there's not much opportunity if you want to drive a cab make some tomato sauce dude I was driving with this cab driver with my kids in the car and this guy slowed down and check out this chick's ass and yelled out the window at her fucking savages man they're eight people My Ancestors I'm allowed to say it I hate folk nice I used to love cat calling in a funny way though it's not guy it's wrong I will preface this by saying it's wrong but and as as an adult is a 37 year old man who has a six-year-old boy who will probably watch this one day I'll say don't do that don't do what daddy says do as I say not as I do exactly but I will say it was sort of like a funny thing we would just we just cat call checks and a funny way dude almost like a mocking guys who can't call however from the girl's perspective she's just being catcalled yeah the girls don't like it unless they really like it well depends if it could be freaks but it's never worth the risk one out of ten may might like it I had talked about this in my special but if you go Colorado fucking Puerto Rican chick or a black chick they want it they like it I'm making a generalization different culture but I'm telling you right now it's how it's a different level communit I'm telling you go watch in Harlem or you go to Brooklyn just watch a gomez defends catcalling live on the JRE my brand-new special Diego Miss Prince Lucia go

you ever had a gay guy try to fuck you yeah are you kidding right how about a big strong one that could kick your ass like a gay guy that looks like Deontay Wilder not I thought could kick my ass but I understand the point that you're making yeah if you had a gay guy that you know could kick your ass that's what it's like to be a check mm-hmm that's so it's like I get I go to a high-end gym high-end meaning gay meaning yet like you guys Equinox it's a gay guys love Equinox and I love the gym was actually my last day job I worked doing sales there and I saw the infrastructure of the company I know they're very you know it's about customer service and I really like that right are you selling it right now you're selling when I'm selling memberships guys so hurry up selling but it's great a Salesman mode I really I'm dying my cells been through and through but I go there now in the steam room I mean and I and I mean this I would say one out of eight times that I go in the steam room a man will do what it almost like a presenting type thing where he's trying to fish for me to suck his dick you know like I guess the the famous story was like sort of tapping the foot under the stall but it's not that they opened their towel and the kind of like make eye contact with you and Jesus but they do it in a way where you can't call them on their shit because you can't because then you look like a fucking big homophobic sorry so yeah probably outnumber you what the gay guys yeah yeah probably yeah but it happens it happens a lot I've gotten multiple free months there because I complain about it wow that's a good move it's like dropping hair in your own food yeah what I just saw this is reminding me of a video I just saw this is pretty I don't know if you've seen this video what is this like ringing a bell it's only like 20 seconds it says man catches guy looking in a bathroom stall he's got his video camera it's just pointing at the floor right now okay just lying on his boner he's just lying on the floor guys enjoy than that that's a guy looking to see people shit yeah look didn't suck some cock that happened to me at the gym in between the the shower stalls the guy's face was peeking through and yeah it's uh and I in a weird way because here's the thing you can't you can't just start beating somebody up for that right you can't just so you can't even threaten violence for it it's a weird thing you feel very defenseless and I understand it's the first time I truly was like oh I kind of get what women are talking about because I you feel like violated and you can't really do much I've had it happen and I could beat the guy up you know I have had it happen where it was a guy that was not physically a threat to me and it still made me super uncomfortable and I felt really weak I felt like because we feel like it's also vulnerable committing a hate crime if you beat this guy up before being gay no it wasn't it wasn't just how aggressive was a super aggressive like touching me putting his hands on my shoulders tell him he's gonna take me up to his room I'm like you better get your fucking hands off Wow I was like this is getting you love a different life than me I just feel I feel like a princess time ago I feel like just to put why I feel like the belle of the ball for one day it was um it was disconcerting but again I wasn't physically vulnerable like I could decide that I just wanted to choke this guy unconscious and I could just do that you could choke most guys unconscious but this guy was not like there was no no guessing you don't saying he was not a specimen he was a scrawny dude right it was just a an aggressive gay guy it's like you go to prison and you know yeah exactly that's my point if the roles were reversed if it was me aggressively coming on to this guy never worked out a day in his life it would be terrifying he would just have to take it he'd have to take well that's what I when I was training for that MMA fight against the comedian I trained with Bisping twice and I grapple with this being a best man is not even known for his jiu-jitsu of course he is he's got very good wrap up he know his guard his defensive guards one of the best in MMA very rarely do people pass his guard when he's on the ground he's excellent but primarily you know he's known as a striker yeah I merrily primarily duh I can't explain to you it was like I felt like a lion was just toying with me it it was and it was it was a strange thing because I'd never in my life cuz you obviously you know an MMA fighter can beat you up you know a professional mixed martial artists can beat you up but I don't think people realize how badly and how big of the gap it is because it's not it's but they don't know Joe you know people have no fucking clue until you do it I had no idea until this is last summer and I judge and he was fucking around with me for a second you know it was terrifying and I feel like less of a man I can't look at my son in the eyes it's the same way that I used to be able to I I don't fuck right you know what I'm like oh come on you'll be all right you know what it's like it's like do you know how people see someone do stand-up and they think I could fuck could do that everyone that's how we all started right but because you're just talking you guys just talking yeah that's what fighting it's like it's like you look at a guy like Bisping and you know he's like a normal guy he's obviously very athletic and he's big and everything like that but he's he's not Shaquille O'Neal he's like some 7-foot Samson specimen he's regular-sized human see like well he's moving like a regular human I could do that but you have no idea it is noisy you're beyond helpless you have no idea yeah if no idea you grabbed hold of you you're you're a dead person almost anybody in the UFC any person the average person even if you're training it doesn't matter they can take you just let them do what they want to do yeah there's the intellectual levels like I always feel like whenever I talk to people that are really smart or gonna have a Sean Carroll or a neil degrasse tyson or someone on the podcast you talk to me just like goddamn I'm fucking stupid yeah you know there's just just levels to this just levels to this understanding of life that's like but that's with everything with stand-up with artwork with with someone choking the life out of you yeah this is Damon I've been doing jujitsu since 1996 if I roll with certain people just it's a matter when I'm gonna get strangled yeah they don't even have to be bigger than me be smaller than means when am I gonna tap when's it coming I had a friend of mine went out who's like a really athletic dude who I got he thought every difference a friend of a friend but he trains out of uh he's like a trainer out of a Gracie school in Florida there's only one time he he got to roll with host Gracie and I said no I was like I was what was it like was it like was he like that much better I think this guy's a high level black belt like he's like dude he was like we talked about levels he was like he was toying with me like I had never done it before and that's how I that's how good those guys are and hoist doesn't you know at this point when he compared compared to these athletic guys in MMA today we saw with Matt Hughes you know you know he couldn't compete anymore once people sort of knew the tricks but yeah I mean that it's very humbling the whole experience was even crazier Hickson hoist is brother yeah boys will tell you he's ten times better than him yeah Hickson would do to hoist what hoist would do to other black belt what was the matter of the UH the story was they could have had hexam but he was too athletic and too you know there's a bunch of issues and I would not want to say exactly what happened for fear of upsetting either side because I think there's two different stories okay but he was essentially the champion of the family and one of the thoughts was that it would be more impressive if hoist did it because hoist was only 175 pounds and yeah with his shirt off he looked like he was fit but look like a volleyball player johnathan right whereas Hicks like Freddie Mercury Hickson was shredded Nixon was like really in the physical training he did a lot of gymnastics and yoga he was unbeatable yeah yeah but he was also like way physically stronger it would appear more that he was just dominating some like a cat yeah jump on so wasn't as good of an advertisement for it wasn't necessarily true though because it was also talked that no one can control Hicks and it didn't want Hickson to win cuz Hickson is a he's like a free spirit like in the greatest sense of the word like legitimately he might throw his phone in the ocean to disappear for a month and just fucking surf and do jiu-jitsu somewhere oh he's a freak in the best sense of the word that's awesome so I don't think they ever thought they could control Hickson that was part of the the problem with having Hicks and be the champion Hickson would probably freeze up the whole organization I want 10 million dollars I'll never fight again like they were offering him fights for years and he had some crazy number that he wanted and he was like if you give me that number I'll fight fade or if you give me that number I'll fight the best fighters now oh yeah a defender after the a right yes after the UFC started but everybody still knew see when hoist was winning everyone still knew Hickson was competing in something called Japan Valley tudo and he won that you got to see that super high level jujitsu pride one was Hickson and Hickson was the guy that everybody knew that if something happened and then hoist was out of the UFC or there was no other Gracie's in the UFC Hickson is always there to step in and we were always wondering when is he gonna step down when is gonna fight the barons never did know he fought some people fought foo naki who was a really high-level guy that was his last fight and he strangled him put him to sleep as a crazy image man of him rear naked choke Funaki and for knock his eyes roll in the back of his head he goes unconscious and Hickson just throws him off as well hands up he was a savage awesome I loved it so much I got it too when I was younger I'm too fat and old now my kid he just started sense how old you I just turned 37 yesterday Bourdain didn't start doing jujitsu till he was 58 yeah right around that shit you're right there's all what's his name Al Bundy right he started late in life he did I don't think he he was a Hicks and Gracie student I believe I believe he's hoist I think he was from Torrance so he was that was uh like that's like Henner and here on and yeah yeah you're right I could in habían I'm just coming up with excuses phony don't totally do it I mean if you trained for a martial arts fight you could train for judges it's a fun thing to learn too but that's where I got injured the most was doing jujitsu you fuck up your shoulders alright my shoulder was dislocated six weeks for the fight my hand was broken both of my ribs to this day they're just popping out like it's just a little sausage tore poking out in different directions and it hurts yeah I'm taking this little tear and then the Red Bull will heal up like sticking out a little bit yeah that was all doing it was all rolling Jiu Jitsu with guys who were just trying to kick your ass and she talked about we talked about that you got to be real careful with who you train with because someone is really good can train with you and you don't get hurt yeah you know like if I roll with John Jacques Machado like I never get hurt he you know I never win but I never get hurt you know it's uh you he's always in control like you're in and everything is like if you roll with a black belt it's actually safer yeah then rolling with like a really strong blue belt or a purple belt cuz they're just trying to kill you that you just want those they want those tap points may be able to get you especially if you're Louis J Gomez from Legion shanked course they know bragging rights a bit more fucking get yeah yeah I had a fuckin wrestlers big dick head wrestler was just like here's a Gaul show at a wrestle little dude he just grabbed me and no no I'm sorry he didn't grab me this is this is what a pussy I am this is what how tough this fucking guy was huge guy right indeed just nasty gnarled up ears course college wrestler but a big big boy like heavy mm-hmm did I tried to take he was showing me I don't like pop up and take somebody down that's what I'm trying to drill with him we were drilling dude and every time I would do it he would just not let me do it and just fucking flop me on my ass right and one time I tried to do it and when I went to go take him down he jerked me in the other direction and my shoulder literally just popped out altogether all the way out it was crazy I was like there's no way yeah it was it was nuts um you know everything hurt going into it and Bisping he Bissman was like dude he's wrapping my hands in the back and my hand was throbbing it was broken it was throbbing and I was just over and over again rewrapping the house to do it's not right you got to rewrap it a new way and he's made shut the fuck up hmm he's like you're not gonna feelin it as soon as you walk out there you not gonna feel anything Adrenaline's gonna kick in and that's that and you're doing wrestling drills that's when a lot of guys get really injured and you got to make sure you're doing them with people that understand it's a drill and understand where your levels at that's what's going on with a guy like that he's just flexing on you yeah I'm just beating on you of course because he's probably done in a million times he's done those drills probably a million times but you've done him zero times it's crazy it's crazy that he would do that and go hard with you the wrestling sucks dick on so many levels so I tried to join the wrestling team because I was a pro wrestling fan when I was a kid I got a wrestle on a wrestle first of all I saw singlet I was like that's not happening my little fucking dick and flabby ass in a singlet it's like you have to have a big dick at a nice but in order to fucking we're sitting like sorry there's another quote that's a meme right there you have to have a big dick and a nice butt too poor thing it's the truth what do you want me to say yeah it's crazy I'm in the ninth grade I'm like I'm waiting for my dick to grow in still okay I'm not doing this for another couple of years so I joined for like a day and in my high school we had a pool and it was like a heated pool for the swim team I went to a pretty nice high school actually and there was a they would make us run around the pool but like four miles before wrestling practice before before wrestling class right there was three miles total whatever it was and it was like a sauna so you were doing like a hot warm up in a hot pool and then you would start training and yeah two days later I was like fuck this dude they beat your ass from wrestling but that's what makes people so tough that's why wrestlers are like mentally some of the toughest people alive you know they're so used to that grind they can they they also take pleasure in suffering like no other sport they enjoy it like they enjoy not being prima donnas like all the best wrestlers if you you go back and you look like the history of amateur wrestling they're all known as being like hard hard men like Dan Gable Dan Gable was a ha man yeah you know that motherfucker just trained his body into the ground I think he's got two hip replacements two knee replacements is me just keep going he was an animal and he was just a just just a unstoppable wrestler in his prime you know but that was part of it was that that mental strength that those guys have and a lot of those guys don't jump into it later though it's it's also as we're talking about beating you're turning them into pieces of shit there's the other side of it as well where you have like it's it's in their family is their dad they're doing it since they were 4 since they can crawl they can they're practicing takedowns and that side of it if you're you know in those formative years if that's built into you that toughness mmm it's said it's sort of cakewalk I didn't have any I mean I I did I did just for fun baseball and I wasn't even good at it I got barely hit it really was the tea was t-ball I could barely hit the ball I was so unethical my mom there was no part of her that wanted to continue to push me to do those things so if I said I didn't want to go to - just for fun she was she was like all right fucker I'm gonna take you I was sort of you know right which I think is that you know problem but that that yeah I think it's really tough that's why guys you see guys like George st. Pierre who never did high school wrestling or college wrestling and then jumps into it after the fact and it makes sense if you know who George is it makes sense the reason why makes sense was two reasons one first of all he was very athletic and he already had this leaping inability from karate so you had this karate blitz ability yeah when you're diving in like for a punch or like a straight blast or something like that that's very similar to diving in for a takedown in terms of your ability to spring forward right so George already had that with leaping into punch or leaping into kick so we already had this ability to spring then on top of that George is super intelligent and he listens he has zero ego like I've seen him be coached before I've seen him like do Jiu Jitsu with like Danaher or like really elite high level guys and there's a lot of this videos of it online he's very coachable he listens to everything and no ego he's not trying to do it a different way he's trying to listen to you a hundred percent guys like that there it's a shorter path to understanding the technique and two proficiency yeah because they they listen some people don't all they don't listen all the way they listen a little bit but then they want to try it their way like even when they're training and sparring you'll say listen listen for this round I just want you to just try it this way just do this one thing and they'll try it for a couple of seconds and they'll give up and go back to their old style yeah like what happened like I didn't feel comfortable if that's the point like this is how you get better George is the opposite listen it's really coachable I guess they say he just understands the technique is everything it's everything yeah and if you understand if you you could learn like two or three techniques and have like a real high level proficiency if you just continue to drill him and understand the counters like it's not he's not like doing a lot of like crazy shit inside the Octagon when it comes to wrestling yeah but not like a Ben Askren type style or what he is doing it's a power double he's got awesome singles on both sides he knows how to take people down he knows how to stuff takedowns you know just those things alone that's all he needed to impose his MMA game yeah George I'm to this day one of my favorite fighters um you know but yeah he was sort of he always like stood out as the guy that like yeah I mean just didn't you know got wrestled better than everybody without you know having to do that earlier and then got you know guys like Ben Askren he's a fucking monster he's also hilarious did I think that aspirins sorry so funny he's he's such a troll I love I love a guy who just doesn't shy away from it yeah trolls his boss troll zo still continues to this day just released a game out of it it's hilarious yeah he's a funny dude what also what George st. Pierre has is extreme physical ability like he could do backflips he does a lot of fucking gymnastic stuff he's just his he has excellent command over his body yeah that was a sneak aside he would see him like doing like those like gymnastic training things where he's like doing like super crazy like you know core strength balance beam type shit and I mean at that point once you know you ever gets all really guys doing that no other guys in the sport are sort of looking to its another level of cross-training and getting your body prepared for like something that it's not really paired for exactly yourself out of your comfort zone that's that's you know one of the I just I really wish I would have when I was a kid I wish I would have done more sports I wish I would have had what did you play sports when you were kid not like a baseball player Jeff I did play baseball and then I actually quit doing everything else but martial arts because of baseball I want to see a Red Sox game and Fenway Park and when me and my buddy were coming home there was like crazy crowds of people trying to get on the T which is the train to get home so we just for while we were walking by this Taekwondo gym I walked upstairs I want to see what it was all about and as I was walking upstairs it was guy named John Lee who was a national champion at the time and one of the best black belts it's got shake him ever produced and he was murdering this heavy bag I mean murdering yeah he was hitting it with he's spinning back kicks that was making his sound like whoop and then you hear could shake with the chains would would snap cuz I mean just exempt to their full length because he was kicking this bag it was flying through the air and so I'd never seen anything and I was as close to him doing that as Jamie is to me right now because there was like a little wall and there was a heavy bag there and the way mr. Kim and mr. O'Malley Michael O'Malley who was also the the head instructor where Mr Kim was gone they set up the bags right there because they knew that if people were coming in thinking about signing up and a guy like John Lee's kicking the bag you like I want to do that how the fuck do you do that were you athletic and all could you you wrestled I wrestled I did I wrestled also while I was doing talk window for one year was too much to do to at the same time yeah I did I played baseball but I wasn't very good I just liked I never ever tried to get on base I always try to hit home runs the coach they just hit a single just a single we really need this Mike yeah yeah fuck yeah swing for the police either struck out on trying to fingerbang a chick at the pep rally ho yeah I hit one home run once and that was it I was like oh I can do that like I didn't know I could do that because as a little kid I could swing pretty hard I did you know they're light bats and the kids aren't throwing very fast and what else is 13-2 you know and but from going to that one Taekwondo gym watching that one guy you became like a mentor to me in a lot of ways and you went back to that gym specifically that was 100% I was like I never saw anything like that I had done a little bit of martial arts by then I did a little bit of karate but not much but I never saw anybody kick it back the karate school that I went to they didn't emphasize that which it's a very very important part of developing power you have to be able to kick a bag I don't think there was any bags in the Taekwondo school that I went to yeah it's it's a foolish mistake that a lot of gyms make they emphasize speed and like kicking pads over power you have to have the power or just break some ice you can say bag that because the bag resists if it's a hundred pounds you got to realize that you're not just hitting this thing you're also pushing a hundred pounds with your foot you're pushing 100 pounds to your foot so if you're standing in front of a hundred pound bag yo BAM you're not just hitting it hard you're moving a hundred pounds with your hips and your lips and your abs in your core that's that's nice and straight yes yeah you're actually getting a real you're it's a plyo there's actual physical resistance in terms of weight and that's how you get stronger it's the only way the only way you really develop like destruction power like you know that some people can you do that though because that's the whole thing where I'll because I was researching like how do you how do you hit harder you can't hit harder you can't hit as hard as some people do you think knockout power no you either have it or you don't I think you can increase someone's power and most people can knock people out most people if you taught them where to hit someone they hit someone clean they could hurt someone especially most men who actually know how to punch a little bit yeah but there's a big difference between that kind of punching power and say like a Tommy Hearns in his prime punching power or you know a Lennox Lewis straight right hand like just you all you don't have that man now you either have that you don't have that and some people just I saw guys that were like fucking 15 they had that was crazy he'd watch guys that like at a young age they would hit a pad or hit a bag and he'd be like fuck this is crazy like how do you have so much power yeah I'm you don't know why you don't know the strength you know they could and he said well actually eighty deed that story but I was saying when we do that promotion in the street of New York City where the head gear on the gloves a little Mexican kid comes up doggie Oh this gives a hundred and twenty-three pounds soaking wet little Mexican cake comes up and I'm like I'm my size yeah I'm 20th time maybe 21 or whatever but I'm just like you know by the way I had never thrown a punch in my life now that I actually watch fighting understand a little bit as a fan like I didn't have to stand I had no idea to this Mexican kid he came up he just faked a body shot and hit me with a hook and I remember it it felt like because it was no adrenaline it was a game for me it wasn't like you know it felt like my head was shook it felt like my entire I'd never been hit so it to this day I've never been hit sort of my entire life dude I took in me I literally took a knee and that's all I remember I don't even know what happened after that that kid just went off being awesome and then I remember thing is that I oversaw I want a box I want to get in a box and that'll be fun and that was the moment I was I'm not gonna box I'm too big the way that kid hurt me the way that felt no fucking way no way if I 230 pound guy were to hit me like especially if you went to the wrong gym and they had you sparring right away which a lot of gyms do they'll throw guides to the Wolves just to see if they're worth keeping around they'll try you like right out of street they'll show you a few punches have you hit the pads a little bit tell you to keep your hands up then the heavy spar I've seen it happen man sure no just just to let you know and sometimes you know that you'll be sparring with a pro so they won't hurt you they just pop you a little bit pop pop to the body pop just try and get some work in you know just looking for a easy target so I do it my girlfriend we bucks just fucking stop just touch just that you let her know let her know it could be worse this boxing is the the problem with it as a casual thing though is the punches that don't even hurt you they just rattle your head a little those all count all those count those are probably sometimes worse yeah because there's so many of them you don't even notice like if you get hit with one big shot you'll stop like your head gets rattled you get a headache you sit down oh fuck but you'll stop if you get hit a few times you treat it like it's nothing you just get popped a few times you're in the air you get hit 30 secs later you got a bloody nose your lips bleeding a little now I got something over your eye you don't think about it but you got hit in the head 30 times yeah he never got dropped so you like I'm fine I didn't take any damage but you did you just don't you don't think of that as damage and now they're understanding that that is as much of what you're seeing from CTE is that sub-concussive trauma probably more so because it's so frequent yeah well over and over again mmm you know say everything man dr. Mark Gordon said fucking jet skis he said the banging of jet skis when you're like that's terrible for your fucking head like how about Angus Young from ac/dc I'd like to do it I to bang his head and do the MRI to see like how maybe is the fibers of his brain strengthened from a hundred years of head bang maybe I used to go to like metal concerts and go to mosh pits I was like a big metal head when I was a kid and yeah we were just fucking yeah you get brain damage he's going there and so swinging your hands get plunge kid and you're right you don't think the amount of Lee just head banging yeah just banging your head over and over again your brain is just smacking into the front of your fucking face over and over and over again Angus would on stage play and head bang at the same time yeah like try rubbing the top of your head yeah now imagine patting your head and now imagine trying to play guitar and head bang time and then catch all the tunes fuck I was in a band when I was in high school so I played drums that was uh yeah we all we all wanted to be we all want to be rock stars did you wanna be a rock singer kid or nope nope nope no any no music no no no no musical talent whatsoever look at these all these groupie chicks from the 70s hilarious look at them so her enemies two stories about like even live with her mother so I gotta go how are we not hearing like crazy me two stories about shit with like rock bands in the 80s and 70s I think cuz everybody knew what they were getting into I think they knew they were getting into a lot of times now but it's just you think that at least somebody would want to come out and go like oh just so you know Guns N'Roses ran a train on me in 1987 jfy I and I was really intoxicated maybe it's a different time like those ladies had a different approach to things oh look they were there for the memory I think the reality is most people they sort of go like all right well I'm respond responsible for my actions that's where most people I don't think most people actually have a victim mentality when they look at stupid shit they've done in their youth I think most people go a gap is fucking idiot I shouldn't have done that flush it I shouldn't have done there's both things right there's some people don't have a victim mentality and then there's also some people just became victims back then and they just didn't have a way to express it like they do now yeah is it different like it was a completely different world 20 30 years ago yeah how would you even start to get the message out that you were me - in 1981 yeah I'm gonna write a letter to you what would you do if you got if someone sexually assaulted you in 1981 what would you do I mean go to the cops yeah you have to calm newspaper maybe they would you know if the the guy was a rich guy turned his lawyers on you yeah different world it's all its I mean I'm of the Steven Pinker view of progress that I think that although the world is not perfect I think it's just way better than it is way better yeah it feels worse because we have the internet and you have access to your fingertips to the most vile shit yeah you know that it's it seems like people are more racist because before you used to have to write the n-word on a bathroom stall that was the only way to say hey when they have fun reddit group yeah yeah whatever it is and there's a it you can sort of get that instant reaction you gotta go back the next day and there's another guy that drew an arrow out of that and was like yeah but what about the Jews and then it kept them going down but now you sort of have that instantly at your fingertips so it feels like oh my god the world's crumbling everyone's racist everyone sexist but everyone's got an opinion online and once you get off there you know we all coexist we all we all work together we're all doing shit you know yeah we certainly can yeah I mean the people there's a lot of this nonsense like energy on on social media we're just arguing about things all day long insulting people all day long and that shit is so bad for your head to engage in that all day yeah it feels way better to not engage feels way every time I travel anytime if you see me on Twitter talking shit back before I'm on an airplane bored and I just I did it yesterday I would even name the guy it's a blogger you didn't even watch my special this cocksucker just took shots at because he doesn't like me hmm and I was just just engaging back and forth over and over again and it's because I'm bored did you feel gross though after it was over now cuz I just deleted it all right I'm done like I said what I had to say mmm but I also I don't know like I there's part of me as well like I've gotten you know you get so much shit eventually you sorta get desensitized to it so that you don't really I mean how you're you know you're fucking famous you get critics like real critics like I mean your your specials been reviewed by real people I'm sure some people didn't like it I'm sure I'm sure you've had to have a bad fucking credit out there but at this point you're like who gives a fuck I just think overall in general it's better to be who gives a fuck because I think there's there's criticism that's valid that you understand like you you should be able to know whether you fucked up or whether something was good or not mmm-hmm you should be able to look at and go oh that wasn't my best work and be honest about that but then once you're honest about that and you do your best work like either you like it you don't the idea that everyone's gonna like it's crazy cuz people just don't like the same things everybody likes what you're doing it fucking stinks there's someone out there listening to Fleetwood Mac 24/7 okay they never heard a fucking Tupac song there's no biggie in their car they never listen to NAS it is fucking tusks all day long every day that's okay that's okay two men you know if you're really into Fleetwood Mac and someone tries playing you know some Led Zeppelin and you're not into it you get angry okay that's not your fault it's just like that's not well you're into you know if someone comes to see you in the girl this guy's just not for me but then some 25 year old guys like I love it he's not wrong no everybody has a different page ahh that guy gets it gets it ready gets you if you go to well if you go to a comedy club in general and if you vocalize that you do not enjoy the show in any way i I sort of look at you as an asshole I don't need to do that because you you can have an opinion there's nothing wrong with having an opinion but for you to say that your opinion is more important than the whole show it's crazy yes is that's what you're doing you really doing one of two things either your ego is so inflated you think you're gonna correct this person and you're gonna stop their jokes in its tracks and they're gonna realize the error of their ways and it's gonna make them a better person and you can also educate this entire crowds been laughing at this awful stuff that's a foolhardy way of looking it's not gonna happen also if you know the way comedy works you realize you just pissed off the comic cuz now he's going to fuck dude I'm working on this bad yeah I'm trying now I have a new way of wording this tonight and now I want to do it a certain way and you just want to fuck that up you asshole and maybe maybe I'm gonna get there maybe I'm gonna get to a place where you actually enjoy the joke you dickhead but you ruined it now well the thing is people see every time you're onstage they see you as this is a finished product you're presenting what they don't understand is and I'm hoping people get it more now than they ever did before but this some people still don't get it say you're the way we work stuff out is by trying it onstage and sometimes we take chances and suffer again and sometimes those chances come out terrible and it's not that we're a bad person we're trying to figure out the right combination of things and sometimes you try to do it in the moment and the best shit that everybody really likes were people who are taking risks there's very all of the greats you're talking about everyone that when people are about their top 10 lists of comedians these are people who took some chances in stake 100 percent they didn't have a cellphone to watch what they were doing in the club and the night that the joke bombed you know where you know whoever's talking about you know Richard Pryor talk about smoking crack he had nights where that joke bombed yeah and nobody's laughing and there's somebody that went you know what my dad's addicted to crack that really bothers me but nobody it just was a different time so nobody had the outlet to sort of express that I think that yeah I mean they're the Patrice O'Neal who I mean in my opinion greatest comedian ever live also a Boston guy and he you know he talked about it when I think he was defending you see the Kramer or radio guys Donna Anthony Donna the nappy-headed hos coming back and he was just talking about the held you know it's a joke yeah and jokes whether they're good or bad they all come from the same place this idea and I'm like well I wanna I wanna this is something funny and I'm gonna go turn it into something that's gonna hopefully make people laugh the end result is a very much a net positive a room of people laughing yes right and sometimes you take that chance and it bombs and it hits people the wrong way you're like oh I fucked up I I said it wrong I didn't do it right but it's wrong it's not the wrong isn't the right word what the problem is we're trying it out with the people you need the audience to help you create the business or in the process they don't think of them should understand it more well they don't understand it and so like I mean you don't have to laugh like I know it's not funny if it comes out wrong but if you if you get mad at someone for something that's not done yet or unless but there's you know there are points in time where someone can say something that's so egregiously incorrect that at the very least you want to leave the room I get that I mean I've seen it I've seen people say things on stage they'll be hard to get to leave a room for anything there's no there's not many subjects I thought it was stupid if it was insulting to my intelligence if I was frustrated listening this idiot talk on stage I would leave the room you know nothing wrong with leaving the room but there's a big difference Sheen leaving the room and yelling out hey man what you're saying is not funny this is not funny I don't care what these fucking people are laughing shit's not funny you should stop talking about like that's nonsense that's nonsense like you're not in a fucking court where someone's reading affidavits stupid this is someone trying to make funny out of life yeah it either works or it doesn't and if it doesn't that's okay I'll figure it out or I won't figure it out B the way this is just the process you yelling out something you know throwing up your flag of virtue in front of everyone it's just preposterous it's like you don't you don't get to do that at the comedy club that's right that they kick you out it's just a stupid thing it's a stupid way to handle it and then when guys are like I'm helping the show oh my god that is the ultimate stupid no just because everyone's laughing now because I'm roasting you doesn't mean you're helping the show stupid yeah it's usually I I just have the audience turn on that person they also just point out to the fact that that's that's the secret sauce you see Congress do this they'll go like look I don't even care dude you're making these people you're making them mad they're wasting their money so and then the audience was cool yeah yeah fuck this guy well some people think that they could do comedy and so that's why they do that's you said it before it's a can we make it look easy if you're a good comic you're making it look like it's off-the-cuff it you're rolling with the punches just talking you're just talking up there and then some other guy who maybe is very funny might be the funniest of his friends right which to be honest with you that's all you need to start doing comedy he should maybe go sign up for an open mic more power to him exactly but he goes oh shit this is easy he sees everyone laughing you all remember when I was in high school I would make everyone laugh that was an awesome feeling and then they'd take that shot and once in a while it works in their favor you look like a real asshole happen where somebody says Han hilarious a fuck dude you got to be laughing at it yeah but then then the problem is it encourages more people and then people get drunk and then as the night goes on like some there's always some dummy he's been holding on to this idea he's gonna heckle you about something he's got it in his head for like 10 minutes and followed blah yeah blurts it out you like what you were holding on to that for all that time yeah it's fucking it's a hard thing to do to make it to make a group people laugh the exact same time no that are expecting the laughs that is a very specifically it's also a weird thing look alien sauce doing comedy they just fucking blow up the comedy club like this is crazy this is like I don't know what it is we stop us from killing all the fish first I think it's the first thing they do dude we keep going I joke around about this all the time because it kind of it's one of the things that freaks me out more than anything about what people do on the plan my suck visualization did I've watched countless hours of commercial fishing nets pulling gigantic hauls of fish into their boats you know and you're like how many how many souls how many souls are in that fucking net I know I don't think humans have souls so fish don't even take care of their babies man like one one or two fish do some of them hold their babies in their mouths but fish they they just shit out some eggs mail comes over jizz on the eggs it's like they have such a minimal connection because they know that time is short how was it likely they're not going to survive what's the lifespan of a fish if they make it it's a good question but I'm sure it varies yeah shark shark shark a little long time let's say a grouper that's a giant ass fish how old is an old grouper I want to say thirty that always you mean look yeah they start with like ocean fish no it's good a few as groupers a gigantic ocean fish 30 days or 30 years there's such a differentiation what the answer could be years it's definitely years thirty years held it Oh Phil Roe Dumas holy shit total gues total gasps yeah that makes sense though like a deer a deer lives like if everything goes perfect a deer live like 15 years and then they get jacked by something you mean Joe Rogan no giant turtles have like Omo yeah they're almost immortal yeah they don't even know how old those fuckers are yeah they could be a thousand years old right isn't that the case really something crazy like that yeah yeah I think a giant turtle can live we should probably google that I've tried to look like before I don't think they I don't know how you know right like fucking kill it to test you know what they used to do on boats man they used to fill the hull like the bottom of the boat with turtles they take the turtles and then flip them on their back because they'll live down there for months on their back because they don't really have to eat all the time that's how they would use they'd use them for food so they would have all these turtles live Turtles and there was alive so they weren't rotting what they couldn't do jack shit because they were on their backs and so they would go down there and pick them up and take a turtle and bring it upstairs and cook it have you read turtle soup yeah go think I have I said I said that when I was saying that I'm like are you lyin I think I have I think I had it once a long time ago I can't remember I was gonna have it I was in Florida one of these like mm-hmm frog leg type yeah yeah it's like a place that's like the best wound up smell girder yeah yes like alligator meat and like I tried alligator me at tried frog legs I don't eat exotic shit I've only tried alligator meat at like one of those TGI Friday type joints you know one of those like chain type and it was like deep-fried batter fried and it was a huge chicken like a like chewy chicken but apparently when they get it fresh like if they shoot an alligator and then they take a look the back straps off of it and they cook it correctly it's delicious apparently yeah but it's one of those things that like when you get it at a restaurant unless it's like a legit restaurant like they're probably serving you some frozen not frozen alligator fuck that and whose how'd they take care of it before they froze it I mean you ever see those swamp people shows where they have boats filled with fucking alligators I don't think they're eating those man I think most of those they're just taking the skins off of them and selling it for the leather yeah that's that's what's really valuable yeah I've no no adventure in me I watch you posting videos of you hunting and killing things and then eating it it's like if you just go back to your Instagram three days in a row it's like I could watch like a an animal alive to being on your plate and it's fucking I mean more power to you dude the whole thing I'm I watch it in awe because I could never I could never kill something even an even like I don't even Utley could kill something lying to me you could kill something and you definitely could if you wanted to feed your son there's no doubt in my mind if you had a gun and there was a deer and you were hungry starving yes you don't even have to be starving you just have to have not the best prosper manifesting right now it's like 11:00 a.m. I'll fuckin what is this Jamie 46 grams of protein and alligator is that a pound 3.3 ounces holy shit three ounces of alligator 46 grams of protein all you gainers out there well of course it's a goddamn murderous dinosaur it's got no fat on it it's just muscle and run style skin they're monsters man terrifying they're you that that story about like like that's the other thing about becoming a father that people don't tell you everything makes you terrified oh yeah so you know this I'm supposed to put my kid to Disney in July and I'm like there was the story with the alligator who grabbed a little kid and dragged him into the I'm the property of Disney yep the father just watched his kid get eaten dude Florida there's too many alligators they can't keep track of them so if you have a body of water and you're not standing there 24/7 when the fucking spotlight and a rifle sneak into that water that's it that's real shit man yeah they'll sneak into the water they'll cross that grass you don't know they're there they climb in that water you don't know they're there and they'll be underwater for an hour two hours and they'll pop that little head up they see that little kid now goddamn I'm hungry that kids too close to the water and let's just grab them they don't have any qualms about down they don't know what the fuck you are they don't care what you are yeah they have a brain the size of a goddamn walnut and they've been alive in that form for who knows how many fucking millions of years and they just kill me take they can go without food for a year man really ninety-five alligators removed from Disney property in Orlando Fox toddler killed 95 that was just like in that last year this was years ago dude they're training up to 400 alligators through April like it's a project like they're building a fucking bridge bro we were there like a year ago and first of all if you haven't gone Disneyland Disneyland has the dopest fucking ride in the history of the world that world avatar worlds in lardo lands here world sorry Disney Land will have the dopest ride when they have this Millennium Falcon ride that opens up supposedly it's insane but the the avatar ride in Disney World in Orlando is off the charts yeah it's crazy man it lets you know like oh my god the future of these fucking rides it's like one of those like yeah it's like the where you see crazy shit and your movies you put on this helmet and the helmet is a virtual reality goggles and it's straps you into this chair and this chairs like it looks like a motorcycle yeah and then you look down and you were riding this dragon and that's it and you go this full HD 3d environment that they keep getting better and better yet shit I did the Transformers I brought my kid to Universal that's a right it was due transformers was awesome Harry my ride was dope yeah love the Harry Potter ocular what in the fuck is that stupid fake Don it was the last year I think they fuck they got rid of it it's the last boobs more money on the ride than they did making the movie for Jurassic Park and it wasn't that good of really yeah I read that recently come on under don't know there's wack impossible that's impossible I that fact it literally impossible that ride is so old chucky cheese technology yeah right it's a fucking animatronic they could reskin it and it would be a giant rat playing drums i know it's like remotely scary it's like what well the drop is scary that's the thing at the end of it they do a drop of my son was 5 so he was terrified the Jurassic Park River adventure 110 million dollars like god it remains the most expensive amusement park ride of all time and actually cost twice as much as Jurassic Park the movie I would have been 55 whoever made that right now has a bottle of champagne one hand a coke tray and the other some shits laughing about how they got a hundred and ten million dollars to make the shitty ass ride yeah they just living like a baller it's a yeah it's a different I mean like jay-z and Big Pimpin ten million that rides with $35 yeah if that was at a County Fair like all right yes the County Fair big ride big ride you see the dinosaur comes out looks pretty good yeah like you never stop bad fucking dinosaur oh yeah I got caught smoking weed at universities I had my girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park I didn't get caught by the police but I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors i get person in the costume but again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone and face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it now and then I just sir not here fade it off in the back yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was lost - get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny there's listening to this old dude on just for the for the fuck of it all so soon the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs cuz they'd use them on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just fucking putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the Alzheimer's the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they're just giving in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away by how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have fucking hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is it's sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we ss doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are podcasts and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're fucking dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making me feel better and getting back in line I don't know the fucking effects I smoke weed every day as well so i'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits than just smoking it smoking it does something for you it definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but as people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey fucking cell it's crazy still they're still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis Gomez that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what there's problems election any fucking Louis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they fucking they look like they're about to fuck me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst cuz it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they guard we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to fuckin get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed get drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were target that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids because it let me see what's in your pockets vastly disproportionate numbers of them being stopped and frisked first as white of course and everybody's got weed in their pocket in New York City okay just so stupid that it's still illegal there how the fuck is that clinging on and one of the biggest cities in the world how the fuck is that still almost like the same thing with the UFC it wasn't legal there it was the last date right it was the last date or maybe second alas it is because corruption yeah the amount of red tape involved the amount of people that have to be paid off to make any laws happen in any way kept the UFC out wound up going to jail one of the guys was actively campaigning to keep the UFC out he went to jail for corruption which guy was this I don't remember fuck him yeah that was dealt with that for a long time care yeah it's I knew what it was man you know I used to live in New York I know what it is there's a lot of that shit still around it's too big of a city too much too many rats in the holes you know I mean you know any rats are in the streets of New York City just all throughout the bottom of the subway and running around the sewer system is rats yeah they just like they've become a part of the ecosystem well this human rat stew is like creepy corrupt motherfuckers that have been manipulating shit and getting people to pay them off for protection and also it's a sneaky fucking City related shit that takes forever to clean out yeah it's just to get it out of the streets of New York yeah it would take fret they did a good job I mean they cleaned up Times Square they've eliminated a lot of the mob but there's still a little mob killings right that guy just got killed just got whacked that happened and it was like what there's a mob the mobs alive still alive they're out there's two whackin P no way I know I was done I thought I was done I literally thought it ended in like the 80s the Italian mob I had no idea I thought so too all like fucking reality stars now yeah right I know like mob bosses wives yeah those fucking show grown up Gotti that was one of them whatever one where list lady was I remember watching one with his girl was drinking and she she got mouthy with this guy and then the guy told her go fuck herself she's like oh yeah and she calls her ex-husband up who said mobster the ex-husband comes over and talks to the guy and like you imagine you're some poor guy in a bar and some crazy lady starts yelling shit out you go fuck you cunt and she calls this guy comes over when you look in his eyes you know he's killed about 18 fucking people you're like oh Jesus that's it yeah yeah yeah well that's the other thing it's like you know you have for a chick you've got to be ready to fight you got if you're just calling some chick a fat cunt yeah well that just just be ready just whatever's gonna happen whoo and and I feel bad cuz the guy that she is with now he's like fuck fuck now I gotta fight for this fat cunt I've seen it happen mo yeah I had we were at a UFC event in Philly years ago Forrest Griffin Anderson Silva okay and there was a guy I was with a chick who was sort of dating she was a little chubbier and we were me and my buddies were there and these fucking Philly dickheads were just ready for a fight dude that back then dude Jersey Philly that was always like seven eight fights in the crowd it was like it was crazy and these guys were just ready for a fight I remember she was like there and they were like right in front of us but she was sort of in between us and the guy just said he was like yeah fuck you and fuck your fat cunt girlfriend and literally in that moment I'm like well now I have to fight this guy because he I really like this girl really so now it's like a but it's a it's a weird thing so I just pretended I didn't hear him go that was it was kind of like scuffle then I was like that was that she's like did you hear what he said I was like no you have to fight for my honor yeah yeah girls like that are you getting your head snapped I'm gonna get a hot dog well I've had I've had girls that I've dated that would not want they would just ladies if any ladies listen to the show all three or four ladies that are listening to this show right now if just don't get your man into a fight let him decide don't start talking shit to another dude you're you're putting him in a situation that maybe he has want to be in and you're never gonna know whether or not he wants to be in that situation you're never gonna get the honest story what's going on his fucking mind right there just know we never want you to start talking shit to a dude in the middle of an altercation because it's never gonna end good no most of the time most of time does not end good especially if blows start flying man people getting knocked out some guy got hurt really bad at a Dodgers game recently he got knocked out and cracked his head off the ground that's what people need to understand people die from that shit you watch movies and people knock people out and the person's fine you know you could get a goddamn murder rap if you punch someone and they fall and most people when you punch him in the face that go unconscious you have no idea what happened they go unconscious their head bounces off the ground they die it happens all the time Kevin James when he was a kid he was a bouncer in Long Island and one of the guys at the bar I don't think he was working that night but one of the guys he knew and worked with knocked guy out the guy fell hit his head off a curb dead guy went up to one go in jail for years spent years in jail at some fucking $10 an hour job or you fighting drunks yeah just getting into some dumb fight which is thinking it's okay to just tee off on someone's face it's also probably pretty rare people falling and hitting their head and dying that's not rare at all that's really common think about what that is somebody I've seen a lot of people get knocked out so absolutely you gotta ask but I'm saying dying from hitting their head on the curve I haven't seen him die but they could easily yeah I mean I guarantee you in a major city like New York I bet somebody dies falling and hitting their head off the curb every week when you punch someone and they fall think about how far that is right think about the amount of force that's involved now think about if you were standing there and someone hit you in the back of the head with something now think about that something was the fucking world the earth it doesn't give at all concrete doesn't give it all the only thing that gives your head yes your head has to bounce and your skull fractures and you get internal bleeding your brain hemorrhages it cuts off your ability to move you might have a stroke you might have an I mean it's horrible getting knocked out and falling and hitting your head off the ground is a terrifying thing and when you hear the sound of smack of someone's head bouncing off the concrete it's it's it sounds Hollow it sounds like like a like a melon it sounds terrible like a hard melon or something yeah I yeah you see it happened where people pass out there's like videos that are out there it's like you fall over and then they just split their head off it's like the worst dude gruesome following backwards though something especially when you get hit you get fucking clipped on the chin your head snaps and your lights shut off and you just fall and bounce it's even in boxing matches man so the scariest knockouts when a guy gets K out in the head bounces off the ground yeah an MMA in the UFC same thing when guys fall back and their head bounces off the ground it's like a double knock so I watched that fight science thing back in the day they were doing on Spike TV I was like a show called I think was called fight science and they were just explaining why ground-and-pound was so much more brutal than a straight upstanding punch and they were just good they like you know they showed the 3d animation of the head and the fist coming down and then the head bouncing off the mat and then the brain bouncing off the front then bouncing to the back then the fist comes back up again and your brain is just being over and over again and you can't go anywhere you're stuck oh it's terrifying I got beat up in the 6th grade by an African kid named Babatunde look at this every day 153 people the United States died from injuries that include traumatic brain injury wait a minute okay that include traumatic brain injury so it's an injury that also has traumatic brain injury yeah it's just a headache I see what they're saying those who survive a TBI can face effects that lasts a few days or the rest of their lives that's the other thing impaired thinking of memory movement sensation vision emotional functioning personality changes or depression these issues not only affect individuals can have lasting effects on families of community um yeah man don't don't get hit in the head yeah take it for somebody that's been hit in the head avoid it yeah I whenever with my son because there's just like a lotta there's a weird thing in New York as well where there's like a lot of tough guys that it's like this alpha energy we get on the subway and there's another dude who like make eye contact with you and you're like weirdly like you're in a weird beef now because you're just looking at a dude in the eyes yeah and it's that and then it becomes the thing where you have to like look away right and then you're gonna give this internal struggle where you're going like well no I'm not gonna look away because this guy's looking at me and then and then I look at my kids right there and I'm gonna like what is even going on in my head right now I need to go to another subway car just avoid at all costs having to get into a confrontation in front of him because that's one of my biggest fears in the world is not knowing what to do there's people that live in like Montana they're listening to this right now they're like what the fuck are you talking about like you look each other in the eye and some wants to fight there are no reason this is the nature of being penned up here that many people else fucking some cool about it the cool thing we talked about before that people are like you are exposed even if you're a poor kid you're exposed to rich people they're there they're normal like it doesn't seem unattainable or uninsurable they're all around you have path is there well there are humans that are there just like you you're around them but if you live in a place where you're never around them you never get that so there's benefits to New York for sure culturally there's benefits the just the just the energy the city and so much creativity is so much going on yeah it's even beyond just the money thing it is the creativity portion we're like literally everybody everybody that's in New York is trying to do something yes they're out there all trying to make something happen yes whether they're you know if they're trying to become a banker they're trying to become the number one fuckin banker in the country they're trying to become the best at that and that that energy of success it's really that's really good and that's why I'm happy I wanted one level I'm happy I'm raising my kid in the city because of that and the other level it's like I want my kid to build a fucking treehouse he's all about the treehouse he can't go out in the house without somebody being right there show him some shit on the weekends take him places in the weekends where he could be around the woods so you could get like the best of both worlds there's definitely a there's a benefit to being in a city where you're a kid or an adult there's definitely a benefit the negative part is this depreciation of value of life people there's so many people you don't think of them as being as important they're they're a hindrance as much as they are like a nice thing to see yeah well there's so many homeless people - mm-hmm and there's a homeless woman who basically stands on my corner and just begs for change every day and my son was with me the other day and this woman she's like hey do you have any money for a sandwich and I was like no sorry I don't today I'm gonna keep on walking and then my hell with town like Sunday's like Ted that's really sad she doesn't have money for a sandwich and I'm like she has every fucking day jams every day yes okay and I'd explained to him I was like I was like well you know look I can't give her money every single day and it's like you know what I do have a dollar though I was like why don't we go back and give her a dollar and it was like no I get it now I swear God he stopped me from giving her the dollar well if the world was just one if there was only one person like that and that was the only issue just one lady just need some help you'd be uh we'll just help her yeah but when there's a million of them you know like I can't help I just can't do this I got to keep going I gotta concentrate on my own shit yeah that's like that's a microcosm of what happens in a city if that lady was in a small town she would be the the crazy beggar lady people would probably like figure out a way to help her cans something yeah some people the problem is is just like humans some humans when you give them that as an option just begging like there's guys who do it and there was a whole Sanford when I lived in San Francisco there was a news report thing about this guy was doing it for a living he was making a lot of money a lot of money yeah just begging and he was essentially saying there's nothing wrong with it it's totally legal and I just make up stories and have people donate money to me and I think of it as like an occupation so he was weird listening to him talk about it because he was telling this lady who was the reporter lady was telling her how she could do it too and you know how he was doing it but he was making like a decent living couple hundred bucks a day yeah I'm sure I remember cuz it was a kid but I remember listen like oh this motherfucker he's just faking it I don't in a weird way I I appreciate the hustle I don't look i watch my mom on well if i remember as a kid watching my mom collect a welfare check and sitting in the room smoked cigarettes did not work and i remember as a little kid being like that's not right i was like what are you doing just work do something else we could be in a better situation just from way too young having that thought right but in a weird way I I appreciate the guys hustle he's figured out a way to thrive sorta it's not nothing to be proud of you know he shouldn't be bragging about it but at the same time like it's just a different system it's a different game we if you disconnect from sort of like you know whatever were you know he's a con artist there's not never a good thing having someone who's lying to everybody all the time I appreciate the con artists I really do they're boring yeah yeah it's boring it's boring just figure it out stupids authority figure they just find in lemmings that's all they're doing they're finding lemmings they're finding people that don't know any better people that what's three-card Monte come on I'll show you well that's all the homeless lady is doing she there's now look I've been in New York City since 2001 I've sewed a-- sensitized to homeless people that i'd there's no part of me that feels bad i just will walk on sorry i can't keep on going but what happens is you get there they're looking for the person who moved there a week ago they're looking for the tourists they're looking for the person who's looking for a nice people and they're they're there so it's sort of like that's but that's not the same thing like that lady might just be crazy she's not a con artist con artists are people lying and pretending they listen my car broke down my wife and kid haven't had anything to eat in 24 hours and i'm really in a bad situation i would never do this but i just asked you if you could just give me five dollars any guy saw that yeah i man sure i'm sorry here's five dollars next person hey man I need to go take this flight to see my mom she's dying of cancer little change usually they have less old and they'll change all the time well I had a guy do that to me in New York when I first moved there and now this guy he was wearing a suit young white guy wearing a suit he's like did I miss my bus back home was here for a job interview you know I'm just trying to get money for a bus ticket back home and I was glad to hear a couple bucks whatever and then the next day and Union Square same fucking kids same suit same story because they learn it like a sales pitch so they know the beats up they know exactly what to say you see it went on the subway when they got on the subway they have an actual script you know so it's like you know I don't mean to beg you know but my wife is blah blah blah and you see them every day going down the car and it if you ever done a sales job a good sales script is pretty good you're just sort of fishing you're playing the numbers your ear instead of sort of adding a motion to it and changing the story and doing all these different things and putting too much thought into it you go I'm just gonna run the script and close one out of 20 people that walk by stupid yeah no it's not only benefit is that you grow up around people that are full of shit and you learn how to spot people that are full of shit so it benefit I mean that's just annoying I agree with you but I also can't appreciate it I can I can appreciate a good hustler I appreciate there goes out and gets a fucking job you don't just lie to people everywhere with some stupid story about how you missed your bus together pussy stop mooching money from people that's gross well what about it's gross what about a guy who sells his CD on the street that's maybe a bit different because he's offering something he has his art nobody had a CD player you do now the CD player I do don't want up top I got a refurbished laptop this guy in Columbus you're still reminded me I completely forgot about him he was known as the rapping bum but or help is on the way in 15 20 years at Ohio State didn't this guy be on the high street which is like the main strip and he had this all these rhymes he would constantly go to it it always ended with help is on the way but I don't remember a lot of them but he always said help is on the way ended like it was like his punchline like help is on the way he had t-shirts made about him I think people someone I really recorded him at one point in like 2005 or 6 but you remember when they found that homeless dude that had that crazy radio voice yeah that was in Columbus too was it yeah oh yeah he came a jog went right back to the pipe yeah yeah fuck today well you can't can't fix him like that voice was fire though it's very good voice yeah great voice radio voice you got a lot of smooth yeah and he just wound up going right back to being a homeless person well do that I mean it's not it's gonna sound very insensitive but most of the time it's not bad luck right you know it's sort of the decisions you make and I'm not saying that you can't have a bad situation and you can't you know there's bad luck in the sense that some people are born into you know affluent households some people are born into poverty but this is him you know this him let's here thank you so much god bless you he was a radio guy by the time it works yeah and then he fell on her well and don't forget tomorrow morning is your chance to win a pair of tickets to see this man live in concert I have a theory I think doing that for a living makes you fucking crazy that's what I think I think if you have that fake voice eventually you just snap you know I can't do this anymore I can't talk like this I can't have this fake voice yeah blow a fuse and that guy blew a fuse Nations have you done that a lot in your career no I've voiced over a couple things but not nothing serious it's such a weird like another hustle like you're like that's a whole world in comedy we're like guys are everyday going out and doing voiceover auditions and trying to be a voice in some commercial there so it's so disconnected from creativity mm-hmm like there's no party everyone first are common I started reading these like books on things you could do because this before podcasting was even a thing and it was like you could do stand-up you could try to get corporate gigs you could try to write jingles for commercials or write Hallmark cards that was one of the things these books this this chick who wrote all these books oh I know Judy Brown is that what it is you're so close it's not Judy Brown you're close something like that fuck yeah so she and the wrote books on how to do stand-up it was work books it was like the hell was her name she's the one who did it yeah yeah yeah she had a bunch of them but there was like no real evidence of her being good at comedy no none of them are gonna comedy something how do you just fuck there was a but here's the deal for people listening don't know what the fuck were talking about there was literally no books on how to do stand-up there was no books there was a couple books written by comics and they were almost always tongue-in-cheek like Belzer Richard Belzer wrote a book on how to do stand-up and just gave you some like joke advice for the most part Carter Judi Carter Carter yep so she wrote these books and how did you stand up and everybody bought those books everybody they wanted to try to just stand up bought those books yeah everyone you seemed a comedy greenroom still a lot just like like on a shelf somewhere yeah and they would give you like exercises so she'd be like go get a newspaper and write ten premises out of the newspaper today you know it's not look the reality is if you're not a funny person and you're still trying to pursue a path and that's not yeah shut that off maybe she's funny I'm just joking impedence of all so goddamn sensitive these days yeah you'll find that it's like what we do honestly a podcast just in the realm of talking shit this is one of the last bastions of actual shit talking yeah when we we smoked weed you sit back and chill half like half the fight companion podcast that we do we want it being completely blitzkrieg hammered by the time it's over oh yeah you're talking shit live and there's not in real time and if I put a microphone in front of you for 10 hours a week you're gonna say something stupid you gonna say a lot more stupid shit than I say yeah way more stupid shit okay sure but your point it's like what Patrice said is so pertinent it's so important that it all comes from the same place or there hits or misses like when you just try to be funny you're just trying to be funny yeah that's all you're trying to do you're not trying to hurt anybody and sometimes to be funny the funniest thing to say is the most fucked up thing or the thing that's making why I suspect rolls all the time because you know people say mean shit about me on the Internet and I'm and I I go what no it's not about me that's the funniest thing to say in that moment and they're trying to be their comedy fans they're trying to be funny so the and I yet when you step back in tow tickets are personal you kind of go like oh I get why that's funny it also fits in with what you do yeah and that's what you do so it sort of fits in there you jump it in most balls then that's the other thing you don't realize shanked yeah I mean what the fuck is anybody expecting from that name well that's why we don't get in trouble I think we call the most offensive podcast on earth yeah and we say I mean the craziest shit you could possibly sound a podcast it's nuts it's actually you're never gonna get a network gig no we Dec we got a pilot deal with truTV last year that's a mistake by their part yeah they love that cancel if they put the kibosh on that bad boy don't you worry that never made it to even filming day you don't know we don't we don't need it with with the internet today man you don't need anything nobody we're not you're right we're never gonna get a TV deal I told my agent you don't want it I told my agent stop setting down acting gigs for ABC everything's gonna happen yeah what do these can then I'm gonna get a gig and I'm gonna get fired from it and then it's going to put me in a suit which you sort of open that can of worms you're sort of labeled labeled a problem I'd rather work with people that want to work with me and sort of get what I do well not only that do you really have aspirations to be an actor no I think one of those stupid things they rope you into it's one of those stupid things is just wasting time yeah if they rope you into it because they like Mitch Hedberg had a whole joke about it but that comedy is one of the weird things that if you like do comedy they expect you to also act yeah you know I forget the bit and it's another completely different different things such a different thing I mean even I'm like like the the cellular level like how to start off mm-hmm acting is such a you go to technique classes and there's a real art I really appreciate people are good actors it is a majorly different thing but for some reason they group them together like actor and comedian when it's as different as hockey player and comedian yeah it is well not really because if you can act you could be a comic if you can do comedy I think you can act I think it's possible maybe impossible more likely if you do comedy you can act this might be my own bias more likely do you want some weed you'll have to roll it like a peasant no well some weird I feel like bring I'll bring some weed fucking man he's the best that warchest in the back that's all we dude we get high for a year my little boy I love it I don't really smoke blunts to which is fucking dope where's the one that we just had is it this one let's go out ya know get one that's as fresh as possible that might be it that last one might be it Oh hmm one second ago you're like dude we got weed for days here roaches - what's-his-face Action Bronson oh yeah Action Bronson came in here and by the time the ashtray was done I had to take picture of it like this is ridiculous this is all his weed I just like seven joints I mean blunts just kept got big ones sticks bats yeah mm-hmm yeah I'm uh I'm uh I'm a pothead I'm on my morning dude smoker I was saying I wrote I wrote last night at uh like one o'clock in the morning I took edible gave the missus the business and then afterwards I I had like I couldn't lay down I was laying down I was like midnight all these ideas were rolling through my head I'm like I know the right thing to do I got to get up and write and sometimes you write and just bullshit comes out and there's nothing there and sometimes you're right you just hit a vein man whether it's a creativity vulnerability life experiences thoughts recent things in the news everything just comes together boom and then you have these ideas and then those ideas could eventually be bits that's like those moments when you get an idea or you get the inspiration to write man as a comic is one of the most important things that capture you got a dive on those yeah so you might have your next closing bit in that moment it's such a hard that's where the difference between pros who are legitimately who really care about the craft and guys like me who don't fucking I need to do it more I mean I this the first time doing this special was the first time that I ever had to there was a purpose to doing sand of it was a fucking hobby before there was nothing I wasn't working on anything I was running a race for no reason there was nothing there was no was doing bits you're just working on it forever you're like nobody's asking for this I'm not I'm not doing late-night sets or putting out an album and all of those little habits that they're great do you ever put you definitely know Gary Gulman who's a brilliant comic Gary forever I'm sure you do unbelievable guy I didn't know him from Boston and met him out here a man might I think I met him at the laughs act he's the fucking man but he's gone his Twitter he does like a writing tip every day Oh beautiful and he's got these really cool writing tips for young comics if you're young comic you should go follow Gary Gulman because he's great but he has these just little great little tips where it's like when you're writing down your your jokes leave a space between each line so then you can go in and fill in different words later and it gets very specific like that um and I think putting in those little habits and just making it a genuine rule where you say every morning I'm going to get up and I'm going to write for one hour I'm going to commit to that whether I feel motivated or not you will eventually reap a lot of benefits and I think a lot when I started doing comedy it was like it wasn't are these really these are the some of the last most recent ones he did he said Oh Brittany wrong time it's okay to bomb taking risks is essential oh it's good for him there's also I think there's a Twitter called advice for writers that's interesting here's the number one thing though here's number one right just do it just get out there and make it happen just start moving you got to force yourself to sit in front of a notepad or whatever it is for X amount of time of day have a fucking timer set it make sure you do it and then if that timer goes off you're still working keep going if you can if you feel it keep going but make yourself do it if you just make yourself do it that's more important than anything else all that other stuff the other stuff is good it's all good to have structure and understanding but the number one thing people have a problem with is doing it it's like talking about exercise but not exercising you know saying well it's like I think the other thing is with social media you have the the tendency to say oh I'm going to just tweet this and then you don't really work the joke the same way you would if you were sitting down and trying to work a joke cause you're trying to fit it into a certain amount of characters you're trying to make it funny in a certain way when you're not gonna get them maximum and that's where I think a problem where I have well my college you know I'll just go and tweet this or I'll put it on Instagram or whatever it is but yeah I think that's another I think I'm sort of turning a corner now where I'm starting to look at that process more that's fun two men tweet jokes are great nothing wrong that a lot of people have become famous for having a really good Twitter account when they say funny shit nothing wrong with that but you got it right for yourself man like writing for yourself is everything it's everything it's the one thing that we tend to fuck off on you know so one thing the I like to reinforce it used to listen back on steps and everything I'd listen to in my car I have them I listen to them on the way if I'm working on some new shit to try oh yeah I don't forget that part hope make sure you pause there make sure you maybe if you emphasize this first I think I figured a bunch is right there yeah yeah but it's like doing an extra set so I say if you do three sets a night but you record three sets at night and you listen to two sets a night now you did five sets a night yeah it is like it cuz you're in that mindset may be even more beneficial like not beneficial in terms of like you know that groove that you get in when you just loose on stage and everything's flowing like the only way to get there I think or the only way I know how to get there I should say is I have to do a lot of stand-up if I don't do a lot of stand-up there's always this weird feeling of awkwardness that you have to overcome at the beginning yeah when you do a lot of stand-up right away you can be loose and that is essential for getting the material crossed the best way but you probably can get a lot of work done on top of that if you listen more guys don't like the listen it sounds gross listen to yourself like shut up stupid you're so annoying and fake we're watching backup especial editing it myself I was with it with an editor obviously but you start to hate it and the more time you have with it you're taking more things out you're noticing more things wrong any you'll eventually whittle it down to nothing I think I think that's probably a good sign you know my taste is is better than I am as a comedian like substantially like I I have impeccable taste in comedy like the guys who I look up to Patrese Dave Attell you know these are the best of the best in my opinion and you know that I sort of hold myself to that standard and I'll never be there in my mind and I'm probably in most people's months but I'll never fucking you know that those are the best and you start to hate it and that's a that's a very difficult painful process that I think most people most people even if you don't do stand-up go listen back anybody older listen to this think about when you still put answering machine messages we still do with your voicemail how many times you go back and oh god I sound like a fucking idiot you do yeah again and again and again and you've done it 30 times and yeah I think that's just sort of natural yeah if you care about what you do you're gonna hate it you know Alexander Gustafson said something like that one so he's one of the UFC's top light heavyweights and he was talking about being a professional fighter that as a professional athlete he was never satisfied he still is never satisfied like nothing's ever good enough and this is just the mindset that you have to be an elite athlete and I think anything you're really trying to do you're gonna pick it apart and as you're picking it apart you're gonna find stuff that you hate you guys still find stuff that you love too this like the balance of doing too many sets you know when you do too many sets and you get stale you're a flat that's not good either oh yeah well when you're just going through the same thing yeah you know where the punches come you feel like they now it's like you feel like they know that's part of it cuz you know so it's hard for you to be in the moment cuz it's like you've heard it too many times so you don't want to say it again well I I think about this like you know it must be crazy for you because every show you do there's somebody that probably fuckin followed you from the next city and are you ever conscious that or you were thinking like fuck did I know that guy he saw this bit and it just for one dude it meant for me one dude I'm like fuck do I want to do that bit now I'm like you know I don't want to do it and as I start saying and I'm scared the crowd I find his eyes and like I'm a fucking hack I'm so bad but that's the process that you have to go through and you know that's stanhope yelled at a guy to stop coming and sitting in the front row like because he did a second show and the guy was there for the second show too in the same spot it's like what the fuck you can't do that yeah yeah that it can definitely mess your head it the illusion of you being in the moment talking about these subjects is out the window if someone saw you do it the exact same way three hours and that's the magic trick if you know the sleight of hand yep doesn't matter if you know what's gonna happen you just see it every single time yeah but there's some people that love the process I've met these two ladies in Austin that travel around the world listening to stand up they went to see Ari in Iceland and I think they saw him in the UK - they're like fans of awesome process of comedy and they said that they were at the the Comedy Store like a week before when I did a set there and then they came to the shows in Austin because that's where they live but they travel around watching comedy and they wanted to talk about the process of it it's really interesting because it they'll get to see all these different sets they'll get to see sets where things don't go so great it's that sets we switch it up and thing click you'll see that at the Comedy Store all the time there's people that go there like two or three nights a week yeah they just they it's it's a rare art form where it one day will be seen by millions right you put it on whatever you're on Hulu or iTunes or whatever the fuck it is Netflix if you're on Netflix you're gonna be seen by millions of people like but a hundred and fifty can watch practice yeah and the same ones can watch you practice it's awesome by the way it's awesome like I you mentioned watching George st. Pierre train before or and being coachable I got to watch GSP training with Hanzo Gracie and John Danaher at ENSO School in New York City this is when I just started podcasting this is like nine years ago I used to do a show called hammer fisting to give people that's like watching Herschel Walker play football or get coach like be on the field with him if you were a fan of football yeah like wow yeah I'm talking about like as far as you guys are for me I'm watching them train I'm watching both of them give him like it was really cool it's a really really cool thing um wait how do we even get there I'm sorry I'm talking about him being coachable and him listening and you watched him train with never even get to the George st. Pierre how to get back to their what we were talking about before that and some arrows and columns and being able to watch it from there like the training process oh right so we have a comedy it's like that Thank You Jamie it's fucking do you've had enough I don't know what you pay but it's not enough the the that process was an amazing thing to watch now if I went to it and I paid $600 for a front row seat and I was like I'm watching a fight right now and I'm watching a George st. Pierre UFC champion fight I would be vastly disappointed with that experience I would go this isn't this isn't what I'm paying for and I think when people come to comedy clubs they think they're paying for the big fight night the big fight nights especial the big fight nights which you're the album you're recording whatever it is basically everything leading up to that but to a certain degree I think if you're headlining there's on the road doing an hour there's a certain responsibility they're paying a heavy price ticket for a real show but they should have a higher they should have at least a little bit of an understanding that they're watching the process and if they understood it they would appreciate it more you would they would be oh oh shit I get even though I heard this guy do that joke before I noticed the nuance and I noticed the difference some though some people won't want to hear the new shit but that's cool to just sit around and wait dye shoes that just fucking do the hits how cool would that be yeah he used to get these to get angry if you didn't do the hits like the African seal I think they saw quite a hot pocket yeah like he has to I think he has to I think Bert Kreischer has to tell the Machine story still right story it's half the hour doesn't he still tell that story I think sure how's that story I'm sure well people will be mad the bride has taken to taking his shirt off in the original room at the Comedy Store as well it wasn't they would save the shirt off for the main room but now he's taken to the next level so it's he takes his shirt off a media since Starbucks and sure they're way too close to him so they all get uncomfortable they're like what are you doing I wish I was comfortable being that doggie if I if I could be comfortable being fat I would be so happy because I was a fat kid growing up then I got in really good shape in my mid to late 20s got sort of even right exercise and got really into it and now every winter I get fat every summer I get back in shape and I just yo-yo back and forth and cold weather life and it's a Europe yeah you're right it is because I I don't want to sweat you don't you know no Joe you never been a fat guy and I don't want to hear this war shit oh you were fat when you're in your teens never fat okay you don't know what it's like I don't know it's walking upstairs and having your you could you could feel your ass sweating you could feel your thighs sticking together it's it's just an uncomfortable life knowing that like if you're eating something in public that there are other people there are health conscious looking at you and judging you and I know that because I've been on the other side because now when I watch fat people on the subway eating potato chips I'm like even if I'm fat I'm slow put them away what are you doing yeah why are you killing yourself with that nonsense and they probably taste delicious unbelievable in the moment right some barbecue what kind of what is that stuff when you get barbecue chips what is what is barbecue first of all it does not taste like barbecue it has a taste and that taste is barbecue potato chip taste it's not Barbican orange dust whatever the flavor is your grape flavor is doesn't taste like but if someone gives you a basic grape bubble gum be like oh this is grape like bitch this is a dealing of grape yeah and then our that is true so true yeah orange soda get bitch that is not orange like what is that this is not the taste of orange at all this is like orange yeah I uh that's I have a me I do food it's so fucking bad dude why is barbecue potato chips what the fuck is that taste because that's a weird taste right that does not taste like Barb's not that I tell you this much it does not grow on the earth whatever it is it's some long words and some scientific sounding shit that methylalanine yeah mile Fisk of pain should not be putting into your body oh there's got to be some trans fats and then bitches - oh come on Joe mm still outstate trans fats let's get in there though you could say trans trans is okay you don't don't deviate with new sounds with your face yeah and mean the exact same thing or people get furious no trans fats are okay trans fat he'll get mad at you you say it too much like do you just get off on saying translation trans fats also trainees have great senses of humor I ever hung out a lot of them whatever every trans person that I know and I I'm friends with two that I'm pretty close with and I know a handful get it well and yet they have great sense of humor gay people have great sense of humor black people Hispanic people all the people all these protected groups have great senses of humor if you little black room and do racist jokes what would be deemed as racist jokes by young liberal white people they love it dude they fucking bounce off the walls or having a blast it's all good jokes yes yes but that's just but they're not typically offended but boo you off stage but they're not going like this person needs to lose their job I'm highly offended by these jokes yeah I don't I never see that I never see a black person or Hispanic person being the one actually complaining about something it's always some fucking annoying white chick some fucking barbecued chip fan yeah what's in that stuff what is barbecue chips what is that barbecue shit barbecue flavor like paprika mesquite smoked flavor that's tracked garlic powder and the MAL dextrose all that mal dextrose that's a sugar right is that some kind of a sugar it is a weird acceptance that the barbeque chip flavor we accept that flavor it's great but it does not taste like fucking barbecue I've never I would never go with barbecue barbecue chips never I'll take them every time barbecue is the only sauce it's that thick sauce yes like hot I guess sausage sure is sea salt and vinegar if you want some potato chips I'll fuck up some sea salt and vinegar I'd say so I'm pepper that's good too it's not bad that's good to get some vinegar almonds yeah um why sea salt why am I so pretentious I want myself from the ocean I don't see salt I don't know if I could taste the fucking difference could you tell the difference by the way I'd like to know if I can yeah I bet Himalayan salt tastes a little different maybe what do you think probably right probably looks a little different you could probably do it you could probably a difference between all three of those if you did a blind taste test I would I would beg to disagree dude if you want to cook a steak especially a ribeye and you don't have kosher salt you don't know what the fuck you're doing you want that thick ass what makes a kosher salt that I don't know is actually kosher Jews use magic the Jews are praying over weed it's weed Joe the date I've killed like at least four laptops that's one of the reasons why I switched to a Windows laptop I have a Lenovo not just for the best keyboard but also because the fucking things are waterproof like how does Apple not have waterproof computers you know spill your coffee on your Apple computer that shit is dead also the other iPhone is not waterproof I've watched five friends go yeah it's waterproof and there's duncan in water and then it goes off coffee kelly did that my girlfriend did that we were in Jamaica she's like it's more of perfect and she starts taking these photos of the waves coming up to the phone so it's like half in the water and half thousands and it's oh my god that's it it's all about distant yeah water resistant if it's raining it's fine and you make sure you have the one that's water resistant like you might not have you might have an older model yeah look I have an iPhone try the ocean but the fucking laptops they'd short out I've shorted out how many Jamie how many am I killed five six easily six months at least killed for laptops one time I'm leaving skanks I was drinking red wine Louis J Gomez Louis J go thirsty just Louis J go masters blessing red wine and I knocked it over at big Jay BJ just bought a brand new pair of sneakers like a hundred and fifty dollars sneakers Jays Jays deep down inside he's trashed so he like you know he needs expensive things to make himself feel good but these were beautiful white sneakers just got them and the wine they literally the entire glass fell into the laptop I mean literally all the liquid disappeared into the laptop right um and one splash just went splat right on the front of her shoe oh right on that red wine that's it and he couldn't be mad because my $1600 laptop had just been destroyed so he couldn't bike on my hundred fifty dollar shoes Wyatt laptop's all fucking waterproof that's what I'm saying like fix that stupid did they just want to make a lot of money in repairs is that what it is maybe planned obsolescence they know people are gonna be dumb there's an Apple listen listen folks job just gotta make better keyboards your keyboards are dog shit also the volume on the the MacBook Air is garbage what do you say Jamie hey I just saw someone tweet about that today there's like a an article someone wrote Apple doesn't like from their stance they don't buy that it's a big problem the keyboard issue oh but that's a breaking keyboard the keyboards suck even if they work perfectly they suck for writing there's no there's no travel it's a very short travel and they're flat like they know it doesn't feel good for your hands you know I think you just get used to it that's what stupid it's you shouldn't have to get used to it like if you like a lenovo keyboard it's so much better today you know it is that i think their whole thing was apples to sort of butterfly keyboard a personal journey yeah the feel of it right it's what feels very smooth when you touch it we take an almond box if you I'll tell you what it is it's the way it looks they like the fact that it looks really thin and really sleek so they made these keys as shallow as possible so they just click so everything's real small and looks sleek as fuck that's what it is it's not for function if they had function there'd be like a little dip to the center of the key so your fingers would fit in it normally and there would be some travel because when you have some travel with your keys then your fingers get a better sense of what you're doing and you're more precisely Italian you need your hands moving around more you need better precision it's more precise whether or not you're touching something you get better feedback so you can type better but I show it in like words per minute when they show like people who are like really good typist how many words per minute they can do with a really good keyboard versus a flat shallow keyboard so even experienced like high level typist are way better with like something that hasn't traveled if I try to type on a regular keyboard right now it would feel like it's an alien thing because I'm so used to it now yeah Wow I guess you can get used to it but I don't even mean like a regular keyboard like just a lot like a laptop keyboard it doesn't have to be like some crazy teacher but just have enough extra travel there's like a number they think it is like 1.5 millimeters or something like that and they would like like anything between 1.5 and 2 millimeters is good you get that travel and you get a feeling of it yeah and it's a lot of feedback anything shorter than that is bad so you're saying it's actually a better writing experience your Phoebe is easier it's easier to write like your fingers find the keys better I'm not a good typer but I'm half decent don't look at the keys 1967 I've been in love doing those I did those Mavis based bacon teaches typing I did all those little courses where it's like a game that you play ok receipt it no let's call it it's really cool like like they make it like a little game like things will go across the screen and you have to type it with your finger and it shows you like a map of where your hands are relationship to the keys and it shows you like where you should move your fingers and then there's something will pop up and you're like oh that's an L there's an L yeah and you'll you'll start doing this and as you're doing this you get better and better and then they ask you to start forming sentences and after a while you get like a really good sense of where the keys are yeah I almost felt that game Guitar Hero they should have made it with like a real guitar because I feel like they can teach people guitar if they made it a game where they just started you just sort of like have to hit those beats your fingers I was getting used to it Jamie I was in typing class and this is the thing I just discovered it's called tap like these little sensors you put on your fingers and you tap little gestures and it types for you so you don't need it you don't need a keyboard anymore what in the holy fuck I don't know if it would be useful I don't know if you'd like it I mean if you could get used to it actually be better but it's gonna suck right now keep your showing a five minute looks like it's gonna be goddamn garbage right now the technology sucks this is a Tom Cruise movie look at this let's get moving this stuff around with his fingers this is insane fuck could be cool I mean you might you want tactile feedback I'm pure but like just they could add a little bit of a vibration maybe and that could be enough I don't know look it's entirely possible that these typers if you left them alone with one of those shallow keyboards eventually they could get used to it and they would put their there you know numbers of words per minute just back up to where it was before but for me it's just easier experience I don't use any of them this the new technology like Alexa or those things that bitch is listening always oh yeah oh it's crazy it's over whenever I've sort of given up like alright guys you have an online profile everything I type in is online everything we say it's being picked up stores are eventually going to have just Alexa and their own versions of whatever that is where you just say it into the air and it's all listening and it's all going into a database and you know I eventually I think what they're gonna do is they're gonna have both the technology to like go through podcasts and find the no no words of an algorithm to go back and start listening to what you're not supposed to say so I'm kicking old content off the internet that's go that's that's very close to on the way guaranteed I'm sure yeah we're in the middle of a hurricane of new technology yeah no I mean it's gonna be really really interesting to see what these I mean the guys wearing virtual reality goggles typing on his arm you know what moving things around some virtual desktop that's like straight out of a futuristic film right I I'm interested to see where it's gonna go that's Minority Report right I mean Minority Report they didn't have they just did it on the screen and we were like that is insane that is insane but that's like you know Windows 13 or something yeah it's actually not impressive anyway what you watch Minority Report now you're like okay it's a fucking touchscreen you needed all those those psychics yeah we need yeah if you have psychics that can predict crimes what in the fuck kind of weird body slavery was that dicks strapped into a tub all day like what was that is that what they want yeah how do they not see this coming that they're gonna get roped into being covered in milk and left in that pool was a weird fucking weird fucking move yeah right like they needed those people to figure out crime right isn't that how they did it that was the idea but you didn't have free will anymore like the idea that those people are like I forget with a special like like x-men type repo recog they have an ability yeah magic powers but yeah I guess the rest in the future be like well why wouldn't you go to this guy and say don't commit the crime and then the day passes he doesn't give it the crime and you ya say hey man I know you're gonna go rob this bank and it's really gonna fuck up your life and everybody else's life so don't go robbing the bank so I have to get in a shootout with the cops yeah what the fuck is barbecue potato flavor this new Amazon store I don't know if these are fully out yet but this is the way it's gonna work like this guy walks and he scans his phone one like basically like it turns to like you're walking into a subway that sort of lets the store know you're there yeah and you don't pay for anything else can walk out boom it sort of knows what yeah and charges you off for your account and this is what's gonna happen for everyone that wants a minimum wage raised this is coming guys nobody's gonna be working in these places this is weird they're gonna eliminate shoplifting this is a weird-looking everything in plastic like that freaks me out I feel like we're in a movie there's a couple grocery stores like that here already I don't know if you're saying well the airport you don't you don't even deal with people anymore you just go up and you pick it up and you scan it out yourself and well Andrew yang who's running for president on this universal basic income idea is one of the things he's doing this for is to educate people the fact that all these jobs are going whay automation is going to take over many many millions of jobs in this country we have to be prepared for all these people essentially being you know technologies remove them from the workforce they don't they're not needed anymore so then they have to figure out you know what do I do next and then universal basic income he thinks would be the bridge and what is universal is the ideas you get a certain amount of money for free to live yeah and I don't know how it works I'm not an economist I'm a moron all right I am I'm not smart yeah I don't understand the numbers I don't get if he's right or if he's wrong I'm not to God and I don't have the time I'm not gonna invest in it but it's a debate and the debate is if this is coming what do you do about it it's not whether or not it's coming it's pretty pretty likely that it's coming oh yes pretty likely that all these people are gonna be out of work Automation is gonna take over for driving it's gonna take over a lot of factors but right now there's you don't have you do not order from a human being you type it into a kiosk they send it over and to be honest with you it's a better experience it's better it's cheaper and better so at what point do you go like I'm not like look I'm that's fine you know I understand there's some kid who lost his Taco Bell job but if it's a better way it's a better experience for the customer spending money yeah I get it man the thing is it's happening so fast people aren't going to be prepared for it they're gonna think that a certain amount of jobs gonna be available and then a vast number of those are not going to be around anymore so his idea is the way you bridge the gap is you give people something that meets their needs like your need for food and shelter just give them enough so that they everything else they make they get to keep it's theirs and let them give them like a boost and the idea is that doing this would save money long term in a bunch of different ways it's all it's a lot of its theory why pay less in taxes with this question if that's the case then I'm all for it does it always that though like here's the thing we never know we don't get an audit of where our taxes go right we have no idea I have no idea what the fuck - goes right it's distributed throughout if it went and you knew that it made an impact it really did make a difference and like you knew that the people that are taking your type there's no waste and they're really trying to make the world a better place oh yeah but they just like a little bit of your money you'd be like okay you're trying to make the world a better like clearly these people are making the world a better place yeah if you knew that for sure and you felt that for sure you like I like the attitude behind this is very community oriented we're gonna fix the United States here take some that'd be great but it's not that lessons renewed over the phone and see the amount of people you have to talk to the amount of times you get hung up on the amount of times you have to call back and you realize there's all of these wasted jobs all these people that don't need to be there and it's to be honest with you everyone is sort of protecting that there's like an entire industry of people that work forty-five minutes per day and they like it that way they don't want to have any type of real passion this is what they do so yeah everyone sort of this I want you to the entertainment industry all the time like we create these shows and we do these things and you know you guys have a very popular show if this was a studio run shelf this was run by ABC Joe Rogan experience change nothing if what you know what they would do there'd be literally 20 people behind cameras right now clipboards there'd be people on walkie-talkies there'd be headsets all of these jobs that don't need to be there guaranteed have you ever gone to one of the in there's a lot of studios in LA where it's like just sort of corporate one podcast studios man there's ten people behind the camera what are you doing I did Bill Simmons HBO show a really nice guy yeah you know is that big podcast I don't know it now you know right Jamie yeah and I was we basically did a podcast just with cameras and but there was like 30 people there yeah there are all these people that are doing this and that and like every other studio job yeah and who's stepping up nobody stepped up going hey guys I'm not really needed here just so you know I'm gonna get back way Mel there's Union gigs too by the way like if you want to have lighting and you want to have cameras you have to use these guys and this is how even if you don't need them you would have to use it it's it's interesting and on one hand for the longest time I think people didn't have as many opportunities you know you you really if you wanted to do something no matter what it would be whether it's a television show or you wanted to be a host of a talk show or whatever the fuck it was there's not that many paths there's only a couple of avenues there's only a few channels there's only a few slots ever right from those shows but it's not the case anymore man yeah this is not the case there's a fucking million different channels and if you get roped into that old mentality like there's still a few are those old vampires that claim to that old system you know and they they would rather you come do it on television they'll chop it up every 15 minutes put a big fat it's crazy I don't like because I was on Sirius XM for a while doing a show and it's just like are you they fired Apollo you're out of here crazy shit we crazy shit that's what you hired no I uh it was me and Bisping and Bisping kept on just not showing up he was like done with it basically and they try to match me up with like some football player and I was like me embezzler here's gonna start a podcast and now we're doing literally 50 times as good I mean worse I mean it's not even close but it's they have all these who there's three producers in the studio we have it's just all of like the the like the spirit and the fun part and the entertaining part of it is sort of sucked out of it you're a very specific segment and its regimented and your producers have to know exactly what you're going with the next thing you're like so we're not gonna get anywhere cool or interesting if we're this regimented yeah if we're if you're not letting allowing us to sort of play you're not gonna really and this is why I think you know radio is is getting destroyed by podcasts right now every you see Sirius XM never gonna shit we got a sort of podcast network they're starting their own podcast now oh you know they did they bought Pandora did they yeah yeah I think so is that true I believe it's a partnership yeah I think I heard something like that as well HS or something like interesting yeah and it's got fives with Hulu now I just know you get a free Hulu subscription with your Spotify it's all crazy they're all so they don't know what to do now now they're like podcasting that's a thing so there's throwing so much money at all of these companies buying companies for like hundreds of millions of dollars two hundred thirty million dollars they just bought one another company 130 million it feels like one of those early day tech boom things yeah everybody's just like going crazy and spending all this money whoa whoa whoa whoa okay what are you doing placement number 20 well how could you possibly by the way the company they bought is just an idea I mean what is it really it's like we have this idea for this app and me you know me and my partner we have it we have our own podcast network called guest digital and we've been practicing what they're doing like we you know we have premium content that we have on the app in the website people have to pay for some you should all of the podcasts are free the latest 15 are free on YouTube and iTunes and then the on-demand library is a premium with AD phrase a premium so we insert the F after the fact uncensored they get it like a three or four day pre-release on the episode so there's all these benefits for becoming a Premium Member and you know a certain percentage of people subscribe to the network for the premium stuff which is great but we've been putting this into practice for years now and now we're watching these companies get whatever $239 rikon you guys are disgusting okay you guys now we can't it's over no one's gonna pay for that they're gonna be connected with you you guys get too crazy it's your raise you're a hundred percent right you don't but that's the beautiful thing it's like you don't really need that no I don't want it if somebody put two hundred thirty million dollars into my company right now we would have bosses we will be told we can't say they like are you crazy did you guys just did you guys just have a Bill Cosby a rape victim beauty pageant on Legion askance did that actually just happen what you did that was a great episode guys go check it out we I mean it gets fucking we seems ridiculous yeah but the point is that these companies it's they're showing that they're understanding there's something going on with the podcasting world they just throw out a lot of money of course I mean look if they're buying really good companies they're making really good podcast I'm happy I love podcasts I'm listening to them I hope they do well but it's just shocking and obviously I'm not a business person so maybe there's some you're very much a business person to it maybe there's some sort of a grand plan maybe there's like some sort of a podcast battle going on between like Apple and Spotify and streaming services people are doing premium shit to where they're buying out podcasts and they're only putting it on where you have to be a subscriber for Spotify or whatever else it is which is strange because it type shit yeah this podcast grow by Sheeran you have to the cherem you know you people have to be able to download it for free they fall in love with the content and then that's that they'll come buy a ticket they'll buy t-shirt whatever it is so I think it's a little bit at least a little counterintuitive I don't think it's a good idea to hide podcasts behind a paywall I wonder what they're gonna try to do see Spotify doesn't have to hide anything behind a paywall but there are some companies that are trying to do something behind a paywall and they're paying for a bunch of different podcasts and they're gonna launch it like look us like a network yeah yeah I mean I mean Kumi does that a little bit with compound media yeah we're on his network for a while we were the first show booked to his network and I think it's a mistake and I love Anthony and I told him this I I offered to go work with Anthony when he first heard the network I think that he should do what we do if Anthony put out his shows free he would be constantly discovered by new people and then it's figuring out how to get a higher percentage of people to subscribe to your premium content and you will consent can continue to grow that number and it's just it's just literally every time I do a podcast there's X amount of new listeners that are discovering it for the first time so you have sort of another opportunity if people aren't discovering your podcasts at issue but I think they did start doing some free episodes on compound yeah free ones up occasionally look he's a really brilliant guy he's a fun do - he's one of the funny and crazy one of the funniest people period I love working with Anthony so legend it's a legend I mean you know we you know I didn't even grow up on Opie and Anthony I never listen Opie and Anthony once in my entire life until after I knew Anthony and I started listening back to old shit with like Patrice and Norton's grad I'm friends with Norton dude when they were all on together those are some of the best episodes ever you know Patrice Norton and Anthony just going crazy about things no fuck great show man yeah they that Opie and Anthony taught me how to do a podcast in a lot of ways I've heard you say that seems like a hang yeah I was like oh it doesn't have to be that structured where someone's got like a list of questions and they're rattling it off like that's not fun you know like a hang is fun you know hang even when it goes bad it's funny that's the best that's what Opie and Anthony figured out which was great it's like when it's bad it's even better yeah because when somebody bombs or there's a joke doesn't go well the entire room just smashes them and you do people don't know I don't people told the joke that didn't go well in a room of people it's awful and then have the best comics in the world start trashing you live on air while millions of people are listening around the country oh my god dude it's so good it also enforced the camaraderie between comedians and in like that kind of a form we'd all get together and see like I'd meet a bunch of different comics at the show - you meet guys from others like you might be sitting in with some comic from Philly right you know you get to know people that way yeah that they did that for sure that like that that that definitely like it enforced it a little bit you know yeah I mean once again you know you're sort of having three or four people that are really smart that are good at radio good at broadcasting as well be able to react in real time you're gonna get these things you couldn't get it anywhere else you know it's it's such a yeah and those guys were some of the best at it you know the whole the whole way it went down you know at the end of it kind of sucked well really it's the this is it's not just the birth of podcasting because of that it's for a couple reasons Opie and Anthony in my opinion are like the birth of podcasting one of them was Anthony built his own studio in his basement yeah where he did karaoke holding a machine gun she's like a fucking crazy dad you know his logo was it looked like a swastika from afar no I swear to god he's like if we stop leaning in to the white supremists tough I'm trying to be friends with you do you think he's doing it for us he's a funny but he's also a 60 year old Italian guy from Long Island was it look like what is happening if you talk to most six-year-old Italian men in Long Island they're going to have some fairly controversial views on race and politics in the country and you know I think he when he left Sirius XM he leaned a little bit too much into the political side and he sort of got you know now he's pegged as like a right wing guy but I'm a fucking Puerto Rican kid who was raised he's definitely right-wing though he is right-wing but I'm just saying I don't think that I don't that's not what I look at when I broadcast with Anthony I don't talk about politics right we just talk about whatever we talk about fucking stupid shit barbecue potato chip well he'll talk to you about anything but it'll talk about politics - he's not a dumb guy no no a smart guy this is crazy it's fun you know I mean look it's not perfect no one is yeah I just also do I don't look at people that number one I don't give a fuck about it about what anybody's political views are I would never hang out with somebody or not hang out with them based off of what their political views are if that is their entire identity then it becomes an issue because then you're probably an issue to them right so many people are to so many people unnecessarily yeah so much there's so much unnecessary conflict you know I mean some of its good but some of us just not you can't be friends with people you don't agree I mean Nick DiPaolo disagree with like 75 percent of shit I love the guy I always love hanging out with him we've known him forever I never never like never do I say gods Nick again I love it when he gets mad about shit damn well you don't know what fucking Obama dick yeah it's great he's on that a cameo website you could just pay him to trash your liberal friends oh that's fine so fucking funny he'll just like it was like what are you like fucking Hillary you fucking faggot it's in his kitchen yeah it's fucking great wife beater on yeah but look Patrice you know I remember I I watch my son my son's mother was in labor for 30 hours fucking crazy long labor overnight over the next morning she's like lying down he's like in the little fucking another room or whatever I'm watching like a fan-made Patrice O'Neal documentary and he's just saying like the most heinous shit about how women aren't shit and about how fucking bitch she needs you and but and I just watched my son's mother push my son out of her for 30 hours it was fucking I mean the whole experience was so mind-blowing and in my mind I could never in a million years do what she just did I had this whole other appreciation for what a woman is it's like a it blows your mama you got kids and then Patrice is fucking up they're just big fat black guys saying horseshit because he he's fucking but it's the funniest shit on the planet yeah the absolute fun nation on the planet and you can laugh at it you don't think it matter I don't agree with half the shitty of most of the shit that he says all that fucking I looked it I'm an idiot I don't look I don't I don't go after women that are below me I like to go after women that are above me and that sort of elevate me make me want to be better I think that's it's a little check and balance system I have him for myself you know but you don't have to be so connected to whatever the message is you can literally take it for face value which is it's just really funny like undeniably funny yeah he was a monster and he also he had points really good psychological insight he knew what made people tick he knew what made people say stupid shit I knew it me people stumble he's who's a master at understanding like how to get off controversial ideas you know you know he was and but his his contribution for a lot of us was and he had an extra level of I don't give a fuck you know like you would see done roasts he you know he roasts and he was like you I don't even know why I'm up here he'll be the one even on my level yeah it was a Charlie Sheen yes yeah Charlie Sheen rose again he just went off-script through the paper and just that wasn't murdered he's a killer man and he only did that one because he I guess he agreed because he said that was the only guy that he was interested in roasting like I'm not doing it for the paycheck Charlie Sheen's a fucking G yeah well it's just that he's you know he would he just had this don't give a fuck style yeah and we all like we all I think I could be speaking for myself I appreciate I don't give a fuck style more than any other style of comedy for me my favorite shit was like first of all Joey Diaz but then that when you go back to the greats like Kinnison and Hicks and this guy's didn't give a fuck now they went out they went off and it was the most fun to watch as a person who was an audience member for me was the most fun to watch and I think you know that's that's the shit that it's yeah we grew up on that and then society changes and I'm like no dude I've been I've been working on this for so long please let me I have to change my entire like foundation of what I think is funny now because and it's almost and that's why I think guys like Lee Jinu skanks and the special you guys name it legion of skanks me and big J okay so big J would constantly cheat on his wife and it was like a regular occurrence and she knew it and everyone know it and one time we were there and we were hanging out and we're about to leave they were in our argument she's like fuck you why don't you go hang out with your legion of skanks mm me and big J we were both playing guitar hero at the time there was like a big game we both looked at each other we're like Guitar Hero name and that's what we named our band initially in Guitar Hero on was Legion of skanks and then we're not that creative so we wrote a script how long ago is probably 10 years ago 10 years ago 10 years ago the name and then that was the guitar or a band maybe even more probably more you actually way more because it was right when me and big J became friends and then we were yeah Legion of skanks is a great name it's probably one of the all-time greatest names of anything right you stop and think about like bands or television Legion of skanks that is a great thank you thank you a great name yeah well I got to give it a big jackass he recognized it immediately and then every project we ever did since then has been named Legion as ganks until the podcast worked good move yeah and it uh yeah it's you know people know what they're getting they get it dude they get em to be honest with you people people want that type of humor that's the other thing is like it's the new alternative is like dirty edge you're ballsy shit well it's what we're talking about earlier look if you like punk rock you should be able to listen to punk rock but if you like the kind of comedy that some people like aggressive like outlandish comedy you're like if that's what you like then you should be able to enjoy it or not it's up to you it's like you don't have to like it you don't have to listen you have to watch it's not that it makes you immune from criticism if people don't like it but you know it's everybody's got different tastes that's it and and to be honest with you if I wanted to sit here and deconstruct everything that could trigger me in life I'm just not a bitch I don't I don't sit here and I'm triggered every moment by the amount of shit that I've seen in my fucking life everything triggers me everything triggers me and every movie that I watched is if there's some fucked up scene I can go that reminds me of some fucked up shit but you have to appreciate those things don't you sort of want sort of everything to be represented and and you know with comedy when you look at things like rape jokes is like a big no-no topic right you can't do rape jokes anymore and I understand he remembers bit right which one well I can't say it shit especially I'm sure he is I'll tell you about it afterwards that's such a first time I met I was over there in Montreal like years ago moons at that little place yeah how many works yeah yeah yeah yeah Jimbo's joint yep great little spot man but yeah yes rape jokes will work out my clothes my specialty I'm gonna rip joke how dare you how dare you try to pass that off to America but the I can't do the bit but the bits excellent remind me and I'll tell you it off because it's one of those premises like once you say the premise it ruins it yeah so you have to it has to be a very high level but the woman in the crowd who was raped a month ago it's like I'm gonna go out I'm gonna go to a comedy club to feel better she's not wrong if she's triggered but she becomes wrong when she tries to take away the experience from other people you have to walk away and you have every right and I feel bad I've had girls come up to me after shows and be like hey just so you know that really bothers me this is why right and it's a some grape joke or whatever it is right how many rape jokes you got at least 70% of my act I do I really know I'd say no I do close my act with a 10-minute rape joke yeah you just said that but I mean how many rape jokes like overall do you have at times I say the rape or is it no like bits I mean really just that one raped it's a long bit though so it's a lot of jokes with in it and I'm being raped in the joke most of the time okay so that's you know that's that's why it's a guy being raped it knows but I you know I don't want I don't want to ruin the bit either but I think you have to I respect the fact that people can be triggered but it's a very strange thing to me because for me I'm always trying to find something really funny from this dark shit right whether it's a personal experience or whatever it is and the way we're looking at as comics is we're trying to find something really positive out of something really shitty and then you're like a movie which is just there maybe so fucked up seeing there's nothing look at it's a positive rise to the content a get to one person talking yeah I know it's a scene you're watching people act out a scene you're right there's something very personal about one person talking that's why this is mean it's not this is how some people would look at it like you should talk about things that you really care about while you're doing that mmm cuz you only have a certain amount of time to do it you know and some sometimes sometimes sometimes you you have a bit it's just not worth it you know like the way people react to it it's just like you know even though you have a point it's like even working this bit out people getting so upset it's almost not worth it no it has to be a net positive the crowd has to be laughing so there's no you know I'm okay I will defend somebody's right to tell a shitty joke you know I'm saying but at the same time I understand if as a performer you have to gauge the audience and put your finger in the air and go okay which way is the wind blowing right now the reality is you can't say things you used to say you can't say faggot on stage anymore in a crowd in New York or LA you can't say that word the crowd will tighten up and shut down you'll ruin the rest of whatever that joke is so it's obviously haven't seen Diaz recently say whatever he wants but I at a point I oh I would you know I have a joke about you know my my dog I used to say my faggot dog because he's looking another male dog's asshole on the joke and and people would shut down at that word and it's really too much with in New York in LA that's where the biggest faggots live the rest of the country is cool if you go anywhere else they don't really give a shit about words like that but in New York and LA it's become a particularly hard thing to you know there's certain words and certain things it's not even the content necessarily it's just those words that sort of set people's censors off well there's always gonna be a bunch of words like that what's really interesting is what does happen when you stop people from saying it because it's kind of counterintuitive because those words become these forbidden words take more power it's there's so much more power if you don't and I don't just I just don't think you ever get to tell people that you can't say certain words they used to be able to say all the time you know I mean the idea behind those words is still the same like if you say to someone you shouldn't say retarded anymore even though that used to be like a term that they would use for things being slower like their growth being slower their growth was retarded but now if you even use as a technical term like in the growth was retarded people get upset at you yeah don't use that anymore now that's a forbidden sound even if it doesn't mean what they think it means we're talking about a person with Down syndrome they don't like hearing the R word yeah you talked about in your special I thought was a great bit where you're like just these sounds from your face like what do we yeah what are we doing it's just you're making these different sounds with your mouth so you're yeah it's just sounds well it's a it's a byproduct of speech being a shitty way to really clearly convey intent and that's why when someone is good at speaking their mind we kind of get we get a real sense of we enjoy it someone's good at speaking their mind but if someone sucks at speaking their mind you know if they're if they're their clunky at it then it's not enjoyable you know yeah I agree and there's too many people that there's no barrier of entry and we're exposed to a lot of horseshit very quickly now whereas like I think back in the day comedians had time to grow in a club you know Bob Saget right Bob Saget was like a dirty fucking filthy comic who ended up getting on the cleanest television show ever right the dad you know Danny Tanner was you know but then you if there was cell phones out back then he would have never gotten that gig well I think he stopped doing stand-up for a long time because that too right yeah I think did stand-up while he was doing that show I might be wrong but if he did do it maybe did like a and a bridge yeah you know a pg-13 version or something yeah you know if I don't know Mads is it worth it you know is it worth it censoring I mean I think one day it seems like the more time goes on the more words they're sneaking network television you hear like shit every now and then I think I think you're allowed to say shit an asshole on a network show now you know it was like a big episode once on something you say shit in my asshole though no you can't say that you know that's just - you can call somebody a dick but you can't refer to your dick that's the idea right yeah yeah yeah you can call someone a pussy I think even - which is weird you know that ones on the way out yeah that's okay your feminizing a man and now that's offensive to women fuck you bitch now that's it I'm calling my buddy a pussy and you get to take the offense on that that's some crazy woman shit that's actually right there that's how crazy women are it's not how crazy women are it's how crazy some women are it's like like some men are fucking crazy - you're just dealing with a giant number of people but if people find a little thing where they can pick on it and go after it like that yeah I don't know there's nothing there's no it's very funny to me there's no words feminizing that could possibly offend me that could ever right you know well some people are just looking for it man right I don't actually believe they're offended though no I don't think so I think it's like you know what do you see like like a Puerto Rican kid get himself worked up and you're gonna fight or is like what what do you say what I'm saying he starts to like psychologically fucking get himself into this brawl that's what I think people do online all day they Stoke themselves up they don't really care nobody actually if they really gave a fuck they would go out and do something well I think a lot of them do care but they're just expressing it on Twitter or on you know Facebook or wherever they're doing I think a lot of them do care but I think that it's fake caring it's too easy to pretend to care now that's the problem it's back in the day enjoy the conflict they enjoy it you think so I feel shitty I feel so gross inside when I go back and forth with somebody we're talking about that before yeah you feel shitty I don't and I deal with it a lot being an entertainer so I imagine when people deal with back and forth online that it's sort of a shitty feeling they don't necessarily want that they sort of want the accolades for their opinions they do they want that but they also it's addictive this the conflict is addictive it's like you're almost like you're playing a game you know you're saying something show you them and they're say some say and back to youth chitti and then they insult you and you insult them and you post a Google article that refutes their Google article it's conflict you know and some look you can get the you can serum dip dysley is that the right word yeah serendipitously serendipitously you could stumble across some brilliant piece of something on twitter and you definitely can learn something and you definitely get some information like uber flex happens all the time you can also get sucked into some abortion debate that eats your life for next 7 days yeah and you start trying to figure out who's right or who's wrong and what what position to take abortion is one of the most human subjects in that humans are so we're so weird in so many ways we're so unusual and irregular and we don't we're inconsistent in a lot of the ways we look at things but the abortion one is a crazy one you're literally talking about stopping a human life while it's inside of a person and then you're talking about whether or not you have the decision to tell someone that they could stop a life inside of their body and everybody's like that's not what it is now stop people try to redefine it in some strange way like no no it's a woman's choice it is it is a woman's choice but what is it a woman's choice to do yeah to decide whether or not a life stays in her body and becomes a person or not and when do you get to decide when a pretty but this is not a simple clean thing it's a simple clean thing in my terms in my mind is in terms of what I'm able to tell anybody what to do yeah and I wouldn't want to but if you just look as a human if someone is having an abortion and the baby is a healthy baby that's pretty close to being born and like when is it okay I think everybody will think it's okay what there's like two cells right there's only two cells or four cells or they start dividing and but at one point in time there's a line where you if there's a side of the woman's body and also you think about this like whatever that line is everyone right let's say you're pro-choice you have a line where one second ago wasn't okay but this in this exact second it is okay right which is sort of fucking crazy in itself you know so it's like it's crazy in terms of if you talk about a late-term abortion well that's just nice yeah how late is this like what are we saying I mean and this is this is a terrifying thing for people this this idea that we can make these decisions and rationalize them and decide fourth person whether or not they should have to raise a child or whether they can stop it because it hasn't seen air yet it's such a fucking and you once you have a kid it changes you everything because I saw my kids heartbeat every Puerto Rican instinct I had to have a baby kicked in I was like we're having this fucking baby that's that because when we went to the doctor we weren't a hundred percent positive we were gonna keep my son it was it was a debate much more on her and I was that it really is Latinos we just fucking want to spread our seed cuz I really I just it she got pregnant that was that nice with a heartbeat and I was like that's a baby right there I'm watching it's just a little flickering on a screen but I was like what do you want to say that's a heartbeat yeah however you know there's a lot of there's a there's some crazy shit I organ stuff attached to it you know people don't want anybody to enforce their own religious beliefs as what abortion is you know and especially when you're dealing with something that's like just a week two weeks whatever it is when they like people think of it as just a cluster cells like why is it so bad to stop this in its tracks I mean by the way I also think of it as a cluster of cells and if I had to put myself into a category I would put myself into the pro-choice category I'm it's I think we need to decide for first of all men can't get pregnant men can get pregnant I used to have a joke about the you you'd be able to get an abortion on your phone literally yeah app I just had this bit about because it's true if men were like really how to cold pull out your phone go fuck this kid my kid this is too annoying nothing along with that yeah it's not that we should be able to tell a woman whether or not she can hurt you can't do it it's just looking at it for what it actually is no I don't think we have any right to tell a woman what you can or can't do but looking at it for what it is it mean it is not a clean it's a strange thing and it's why I say it's one of the most human things because it's it's what other animals don't have that choice yeah you can't deny my I had a cat when I was 11 and it was just we were garbage so she like fucked her son so she had a bunch of retarded cats with backwards legs and I watched my cat eat those kittens so it's yeah it's pretty human the debate it would've been a conversation with humans yeah I've seen that that animals do that I had a hamster that did that one she ate her babies and we were like what the fuck Joyce this hamster no she's that's not a pro-choice right choice to eat their babies she she carved a hole out of this baby's head and she was chewing on it we looked in I never thought of that hamster the same way against the guys are pretty rat that dirty little thing killed its baby yeah what in the hell they get some sort of a disease apparently and if they get that disease they'll often just kill their babies hamsters there's a regular dude it was rough we were a little too we were like six seven you know sister really it's an awful way to learn about death we're so happy that they had babies like oh my god it's gonna be a little thing by the way baby hamsters are the-- they look like little fingers they're just cute and pink and they're just fucking their eyes are closed and yeah it's like wet tail I think is the disease I think that's what it was called yeah I know she had yeah you know I don't remember where we got our pet store or some shit yeah I don't any of those pets I don't know guys it is looking up an article about it and it just says that like especially in first-time mother stress and fear associated with rearing the babies can be too much to handle so she just kills them all it's a lot with the animals dogs cats they kill their babies they eat them sometimes woof the most fucked up wants bears because bears they'll go into dens looking for babies the other babies oh yeah well the Predators you watch this predator shows we're like a long you know a bunch of fucking hyenas throw looking like a baby and hand elope yeah but baby bears like bears eat bears Oh bears he bears yeah cannibals the little Cubs Oh eat the shit out of Oh No sad and bear death seems pretty horrific I never even saw that movie the revenant not another the revenant where like their parents almost brutal scene there's a fake one you can see Grizzly Man they have the video of him getting eaten no no no no grizzly man disappears a gay guy that moves to Alaska to to save the Bears and one of them eats him and his girlfriend it is a crazy film yeah it's a Werner Herzog documentary it's unintentional comedy I mean it's I think the way it's edited he had to know there's a certain point in time where it's like obvious comedic timing right he added it seemed like a lot of it was tongue-in-cheek but it's about a really crazy guy Timothy Treadwell who was lived with the Bears for like hundreds and hundreds of days you know and had all this video footage of him like really close to big giant grizzly bears I know the story and it was like I actually ate them yeah I became a sort of a meme they'll do that eventually you're gonna run into a bear that's like a you know I delete the fuck out of YouTube yeah it's a great documentary I'd love to watch it I am embarrassed there's there's video of there's maybe the guy at like a Russian Zoo who jumps into the bear cage and there's just video of this bear eating this in half and it's just it looks it looks every bit like the most horrible thing in the world like that is the way that I don't want to go people talk about how would you want to go it's like I know how I don't want to go is being eaten alive by a bear because they will eat you guts first you know you'll still be alive let me tear in your guts part yeah they're so big like a grizzly a grizzly bit its we don't even understand how big that is like a 900-pound Superdog you know not imagine a 900 pound dog that wants to kill you that's bear I get very scared cuz you you know I know you run with your dog in the hills have you that'll go for cats yeah shit have you deal with any of that shit no I was run with a knife though just in case you heard the story about the guy because it was the rumor a couple years ago about how you choked out a cougar or whatever was like a mountain and that was the guy who did in Colorado you killed one time I was a baby yeah Bryan Callen and Brenda shot was shitting all over that guy they called it like Rinella was saying it was 85 pounds and I was saying I heard he was 85 pounds and then Jamie googled it and he found 35 pounds I was like girl that's not as impressive yeah and then another sandwich it still fucked him up about the cat still like he was so fond shopton yeah he's not crazy that a baby cat would think that he could kill a grown person imagine being something that cocky like you with your face running up to like a giraffe and go oh I got this fan thing I'm just gonna jump on the trafficker I could kill a giraffe you think so I don't think you could oh this bears just mauling this guy did it kill him that was Cubs former training partner Jesus Christ it doesn't always go well oh my god it's tearing them apart okay stop Jamie stop this did the guy die I must have yeah it doesn't look like it's gonna end well he left Wow oh my god bears probably never killed anything before probably just been eating meat that they gave it to he's probably what do I do with you he's bad at killings he was just doing it longer and more painfully it's like being stabbed with a butter knife they said its condition yesterday was said to be comfortable Oh head and leg injuries yeah he's got a story now go on tour yeah you think so yeah Charles yeah did weeks yeah if the a bear attack happens guys preparing to start really it's not gonna freeze in his tracks Bert Kreischer had that story there'd be a whole other fucking special it would be another 45 minutes the machine versus the bear yeah the
