they've been injured yet but they know they're have you shot with a bow and arrow I watched a lot of hunting I watched a lot of hunting videos like I used to I used to if I if I ever got too fucked up within I'd watch hunting in Florida it's very easy to get really yeah and bear is bear hunting from in my opinion you've done it I've never done it but all the videos are they like put a box out full of food then they'd sit in a tent and then the bear would come out and they'd shoot it with a bow and arrow and the bear would get hit but it would almost feel it would seem like the bear but like out what the fuck was that and then you see the look in the Bears face where they'd be like I don't feel good I'm gonna go rest for a little bit - how's the girl looks funny bombs it's like it's like he was like like he looks at you like I get it I get hit and you're like and you're and you know he's been hit by an arrow my favorite one was in in in Pearl Harbor me Pearl Harbor Hawaii me Tom Segura and Russell Peters and I go up and I do okay but maybe I was dirtier than I should have been that's totally fine because the only rules they had we're don't make fun of the Hawaiians that was it don't make fun of Hawaiians and don't bring up Pearl Harbor why cause opening joke he's like man it's a lot of fat people like I heard island life was slow I know they were talking about their metabolisms Betty says I got lost walking around luckily a Japanese guy pointed out the directions man those Japanese know this place like the back of their hand I mean he bombed so hard that when he got off he was like that early flesh like where you get in he's like he's like we're pretty good and you cook you're like you might want to go back to your nest and not you know Tom's going to lose a shit that

Pearl Harbor sitting in lawn chairs with their families what was the gig like what who is it for for the Pearl for the USO oh that's hot that's a military guy yeah corporate kid oh yeah but it's that same same energy so I and so then Tom sits next to me this is my favorite part Thompson's next to me and Russell Peters comes on stage and you can hear there's a murmuring no mind you were at war with Iraq and Russell Peters is a little brown for their taste and Tom goes I never realized he looks like the enemy and Russell Peters is by the way didn't acknowledge it did had a great set but you could hear that kind of like they brought up one of the like and Tom and I are in the back like this is bad we the next day yeah yeah you thought it was bad because he was brown it was only because we had gone to rifle training the day before and Russell had randomly chose not to go randomly and the first words at rifle training was there's one rule here if it's brown it moves you kill it and Russ and Tom was like they kinda didn't bring Russell let the fuck imagine if you're Mexican and you're in the fucking army and they tell you that shit if it's brown and it moves we'd kill it Wow that kind of said that and we brought our wives to it we've got to arrives to rifle we shot every gun they had we brought our wives and the girls were like right before we wet stepped in they go can we go to the bathroom or like go to the bathroom so we walk in and the guys like I thought there were going to be six he's like a real military guy and we're like yeah the girls went to the bathroom it was okay and then Tom goes hey do me a favor when they get in act a little like aggressive to them and misogynistic and let's just see the looks on their faces so the girls walk in is oh well typical ladies

psycho into five minutes you could take the freight elevator the basement and no one could get down there because you had the elevator and so once I got to the basement I'd take off my clothes and start working out and just like do push-ups sit-ups the fucking curls with boxes hold books out and do fucking these fucking jobs front rows and I workout and then it was there was no AC so then I'd wait and I cooled down put all my clothes back on getting freight elevator walk up and I just killed like thirty minutes we need a job like that to kill thirty minutes is a it's like fucking combat which goes for being overdone right right so I'm like this is enemy trip fueled remember ritual yeah pop in fucking three room fuels every three hours right oh my god got Tweaker running around Sheldon travel books going down to the basement pounding like I'm in fucking Bozz and they come up sweating like a motherfucker with a name tag on just and so like two weeks into it my boss Dwayne pulls me aside and he was like here's a hitman you've all spent a lot of time in the basement and I was like oh yeah cuz I go get travel books and that's where we keep them all down there and he's like yeah you know we have video cameras like I didn't know that he's like you're fucking fired and I was like wow I did wane I can explain us no I can't I can't have someone getting into their underwear basement working out to when they should be working and then coming back up and then interacting with people and I was trying to be a comic so I was trying to think alternatively and I'm on speed which is haha him so theoretically like I would do funny shit it was crazy if you didn't know me exactly some guy told me the other day we were doing a promo shoot for a steam TV and I did a joke the end of the day I was that funny he goes Burke everything you do is only funny if you've spent fucking 24 hours with you and so yes I got fired and then came oh I'll be great to have that tape if anyone had Barney oh my god that's hilarious wait I remember he asked me if I want to be a manager like a week before that and I was like no it was like what and I was like he was like you don't have a manager and I was like no he's like why are you why do you what do you want to do then I was like I want to be a comedian and I was like this isn't what I do and he looked at me dead in the face because this is what you do this is who you are you worked at Barnes & Noble don't think you're better than us you're not what fuck I'm out of here soon I didn't know I was gonna get fired but don't think you're better than us Bert Kreischer was telling what I smell might be one of the great stories know is that know he used to shit his pants and all the times are dirty all the time he hoping would you said this story began with you saying that he his shit his pants in a banana republic in Beverly Hills and it was it was like real it was like like the real coming-of-age part of my life when my dad looked at me and he was like buddy I'm about to shit my pants what do I do use the word in public have a bathroom you're the fucking worst part of it right so I look at him and I go to shit your pants dad I think you got your pants I go shit your pants a little bit and then walk far as you can and get to your hotel and he just left my daughters with me like fucking drops on the vest and so we started walking down Rodeo or whatever you know Burton one of those roads to get to his hotel right so my mom comes up she's like she's like where's your dad and I said oh he left me the sweater I got to buy it before I bought on end up buying in the sweater knee I go he had to shit his pants because what do you mean shit his pants I go shit so he should his pants and then he just he's walking on the street I go I'm sure we can catch him he's walking slow and then my wife comes up she goes where's you got and I go you should have pants you why didn't he just use the bathroom I said where's the bathroom she goes downstairs and I went a little I probably should have told him that and so you didn't okay I don't know I was in panic mode it was Black Friday and I'm bleep in line too and I got a leather jacket on sale well it's even worse I think if you shit your pants in line for the bathroom because then everybody's going up there's a big line of people you just blah BS jump in your pants then you're like close proximity there's no way to playoff shitting your pants I say that shitting your pants is a lot like getting a DUI you roll the dice so much and get away with it that when you do get caught with your hand and cookies are you're like motherfucker this never thought that was gonna happen are you kidding me why all the time why today oh that's so true so but in his 30s he was running marathons and he used to shit his pants all the time not even like I'm not even saying like I'm not gonna sound like oh uh once a month I'm talking once a week he would this is before cell phones too he was in his 30s this is thirties I was a I was a kid we were living in in like North Tampa not in like the nicer North Tampa but in the shittier redneck vs. black noir Tampa and first time I heard her the n-word was in this neighborhood but my dad used to run marathon so he'd run like five miles 10 miles and go out and on these 10-mile runs he shit his pants so he counted these orange groves shit himself right clean himself the best he could and then run home but there were some nights I remember these distinctly was before cell phones were to get dark my mom's like we got to go look for your dad and we'd be driving his route where he run all sudden like a naked happy dad but come out of the fucking orange groves like I'm here get me in the car right now of he I only come get him oh he just would yeah it would be remember thunder and lightning and he's just sitting in an orange grove naked like having a shit his pants and and we'd be like over here and he'd be like all right me just hop on the front seat go home or come like real quick yeah shit his pants off he hates my stories I hope someone if anyone is listening to snows my dad let him listen to this

a shit my pants they just squirt he's just a little squirt I don't know let's call him on the phone do it just I didn't even go lucid like I didn't try to control it or move around I just let the dream play out but I realized it was a dream and I still didn't wake up I have that's a rare thing now a Hills just for that yeah I got dreams I have dreams I've bucking crazy dreams but I am totally lucid inside my dreams or out dreams that I'm reading something and I'll go I'll be other that's so funny that I'm reading something because nothing's there in the dream I think this nothing's there in my mind's making up these words but I'm still reading them that's so interesting I had a dream one time that me and Elvis walk into his PO tell room and there were four dudes but fucking right and I just hear me were there where that might be one of the best sentences ever created I had a dream that I was with Elvis and we walked into his dressing room there was four dudes but fuckin dot-dot-dot now hear me out is weirder they're throwing up in Burger King cups walking each other and then I worry when I say this I fucking shut the door and I look to know that I go what the fuck's going on in your room I said to me well have your dream baby holy shit right I wake up I wake up I'm like wake up check my dick make sure apart and I'm like listen you don't really put me out you don't really put me out like that not that the guys were buck fuckin right that despite of me they didn't ask no it was the product placement like what the fuck did Burger King do to get it fuckin dream what if they figured it out and you just don't know that there's way to interject advertising into your dreams good welcome bad Burger King in the future right now it's like I got more Chrysler stream without the Elvis and the buck fuckin ha ha no no no but what if there's a possibility but even if someone could insert a product right into a dream right they could give you a cheeseburger in that cheeseburger with some experimental thing that would make you think about Burger King in a dream and see a burger and you do it you can do it fuck your girl never be higher if going Keiko and shit yes or in the future but that doesn't make any sense yeah the product noises it's Keiko yeah it's something to have this happen to you you're hungry we're standing on hope I guess we're stumbling
