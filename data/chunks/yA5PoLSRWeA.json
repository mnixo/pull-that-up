hello freak bitches so that's a massive sacrifice you're willing to take to do that and this the fact that it's exists inside your body for an undetermined state of time that's that's pretty wild man it's it's scary yeah honestly I feel like I was in a much scarier place personally before before I found this before I found them before I got given a second family or accepted into a second family and eating more scarier because you were depressed because yeah well depress suicidal thoughts had for like 10 years just battled it from 13 years old 23 and so um see how that that was a lot scarier to me than suicidal thoughts when you're 13 yeah for sure and I mean I was I was one that like you know the kid in the in the class that I mean I wasn't I wasn't like oh and say I was how do I say it it was extremely brutal but it was happening to I mean everyone gets bullied for the most part somebody's bullying you yeah when I was growing up that from from third grade till eighth grade for sure it was brutal seventh eighth rows usually you smaller then I was you're a gigantic dude I was smaller it takes a lot of balls to bully you yeah and I might backfire it's actually kind of why I found fighting or not why it is that kind it is because uh I was 13 years old and I had just gotten so well two things have you ever seen in Texas for high school homecomings they have mums you heard of that no it's a mom Hex's tradition that's crazy now all all the kids love them everything else but you get these like Chris's or fake flowers that they put real big up top and then they are streamers with literal bells and whistles full-size teddy bears you can have two three teddy bears and when I was in high school the girl would wear it on her shoulder and the guy would weird around his arm now in Texas they literally have to put a harness around them and hold these things up because they're so big and got there you go mom why Texas mom fuck dad that's homecoming in Texas what look at that I'm telling you it's a whole state the whole state I mean every herd of every homecoming that comes around Texans are nuts about this I mean I lived in Texas I was like four months old so it was uh they're nuts and they've gotten bigger and bigger and bigger every single year and how am I just hearing about real proud of it it's weird I mean are you just hearing about this Jamie I think those are literally like two and three hundred dollars no but yeah when I was in high school they're like 70 hundred oh my God look at all those girls look at that picture that you had down there there's a giant group of girls with all this this is ridiculous that no it's how do you how do you go to the dance like that how do you go to the game like that I don't understand yeah literally the boyfriends are walking behind them holding the stuff up form because what it's getting too heavy either neck hurts but they want to wear it's a tradition yeah everybody gets excited the bigger and minimum the bigger the mum the better more MORE you're a date like you is this a mom company that you just click done oh right there yeah every single grocery store in Texas why not yeah whenever it comes to like September October November around homecoming time high school like this is people's jobs like seasonal jobs they sit around and they take special orders they make them for you but they sound where you can make them yourself that's so strange isn't it nuts just it always baffles me when I find out about something for the very first time I don't know why I'm so convinced all right I would like to find out where the tradition came from probably but I mean people is just so ingrained in you if you're a Texan that you have to get moms and so uh is there any other case find out if other states accept I literally Oklahoma doesn't do it Louisiana doesn't New Mexico I mean 12 things non Texas need to know about homecoming moms what in the fuck mom started as a simple flower hold on scroll up a little bit mom started as a simple flower guys give them to their homecoming date oh that's hilarious girls also give guys one called a garter like a garter either you put it on your on your arm on your garter belt turned over how biz like one of those things that tie box away yeah being able to make mums can make you rich Oh God see $6,300 what $300 for fake flowers 300 bucks it ain't cheap to electrify a mom oh my god I just got home and lights up you can put LED lighting look at that scroll it scroll up a little bit you can put LED lighting in mom's I didn't know how many folks are doing this back when I was in high school but nowadays you really want to impress your date the latest in mom lighting technology will help you do just that that is hilarious you know this isn't even like a Juke website right now we're taking it serious this is a strange mm-hmm it's really weird and so when I was in middle school 7th grade I you know look at her oh she's got a Christmas tree on her tits that's ridiculous they uh so you want to save I saved it up and my allowance asked one of my crushes to go to the homecoming game with me she said yes to my surprise went to the game and spent pretty much all my allowance on the her mom and her name's Jessica and I took her to the game and I'm up in the stands with her and home her halftime comes around I'm up to the very top left and all of a sudden everyone looks back up over the right shoulders at us and this one guy is kind of my my belief through elementary and middle school for sure and his name was Justin as well and so he walks up and puts his arm out to her and she puts her arm around his and he grabs the streamer that says Justin and Jessica and the year on it or whatever and he says thanks for getting her this and I'm like what and he goes you didn't think she'd come with you did you and so he just kind of walks down all the schools looking they're all laughing having fun but and and that one hurt but what was worse with the next year because you know people liked that part of I don't know I think for me when I see bullying now I just spoke out of middle school and I told one of the teachers asked what should you tell a kid that's battling with suicidal thought or depression even maybe suicidal thoughts I'm like well if this is 304 kids in here like for sure one person is dealing with these issues right now and I would say you know the thing that probably saved me was my parents didn't own a gun probably only Texans that don't own guns and then I don't know I I mean I I guess one of the main things was well I I don't even know that I've ever said this publicly but I remember having attempted suicide once and then thing about it again and then thinking you know what would this what would this do to my mom you know and so I love my mom I'm a mama's boy dad's great too but that's just who I am she's a tough cookie she's where I got my competitiveness she was a national champion and barrel racing state champion and tennis and so she always pushed me my dad if he if he was at a wrestling tournament and it's the finals even state I would dislocate my thumb or something he'd come up you don't have to wrestle in the next match like it's the finals my mom's like he's getting out there so my mom's wouldn't push them shut up Jimmy uh-huh he's gonna he's gonna go out there and he's been arrested he's gonna win and so my dad was more of the one he protected me and she's one what and pushed me out there so I guess I'm saying that except for oh that thought was just ringing in my head and so whenever I finally verbalized that start talking to people that's what really helped you know it didn't have to be a bunch of people I didn't have to go around and be a drama queen or do it for attention or whatever but just find one person and for me at that age it was having a great mom and an parents that loved me and I think that's probably absolutely what saved me at that time and so I was telling these kids you know hey tell if even if it's just your mom so I was taking pictures with some of the kids afterwards and stuff and I walk out to leave and I'm in the hall and this mom stops me because she's with her little guy in he's crying so a mom had come to school had heard out there's an anti-bullying talk she came up and I see this little guy it reminded me a lot of me though difference was uh was he had these kind of big glasses on but he was a little chubby and had just had one of those things that you would see stereotypical like this kid's gonna get picked on all right and so probably a lot like me he's used to getting this fat pinched and nipples twisted and you know all that different stuff and so he was out there just balling with his mom mom asked him talk to him for a little bit I did and she was saying that he had never opened up with her and in the last two years but she knew he had been dealing with really bad depression and right there he told her I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for two years and so I don't know why I even brought that up except for her like it's nuts my parents have a have a photography company and they made a memorial a few years back for a little boy who's getting bullied didn't think he had an option out and he took his life at nine years old oh my god I think it was a swing set back so oh Jesus Christ and so I saw the plaque and everything made up for him and just gut-wrenching and so you know he they say that and the first story wasn't it but then this kind of one that kind of brought everything to a head was I was in middle eighth-grade this time got invited to Jennifer's birthday party really excited got invit one of the real invitations and my hands and made the plans talked to my mom a so I could go talk to some of the people who else is going that was this kind of a dorky kidding least but on the invitation I know so man it says costume contest and the winner gets a prize west heard and research all this other stuff other people were doing it to and I found out that her dad worked at dr. pepper in that their house was decorated with all this other stuff and then um and then the she loved transformers and so I thought what if I you know combine those two things what if I could make myself a cardboard transformer from head to toe he was a 24-pack around the head twelve packs around the arms legs boots I had I had a chest plate had a sword the out of cardboard a country kid text as you see those mom's we can do pretty much anything with duct tape and so duct tape cardboard just made it up and walked into the party and her grandma open the door she's gonna love this walked into Judi literally had to dr. pepper machine was like old school ones you didn't have to pay just push the button it pops out 13 year old kid you love that so we had dr. pepper can one end of the dr. pepper cardboard sword in the other walked the backyard and whenever the door opens I opened the door and greeted there with like some flashes of lights and fingers pointing people laughing and um I remember Jennifer's thing can't believe you thought you were cool enough to come to my party and I was the only one that was dressed up everybody else had gotten there early and they all been playing even the invitations were fake just so that I would come there dress-up another kid said you're worthless so in that moment I felt worthless and then the main bully said you should just kill yourself and so whenever he said that 13 years old battle with depression suicidal thoughts all the different stuff in it it took me on a downward spiral tailspin and it really sucked I didn't know how to cover it up and then I guess I'm getting back to them and Mayer out where I found that 13 years old and like at a flea market in Texas and walking down these aisles and looking for a BB gun and all of a sudden I get to this like used video shop and it's got UFC VHS I think it was 2 through 10 or 10 2 through 11 or something like that and so I just like bottom all you were on there and that is a horrible story man yeah that is a terrible story how the fuck those kids be so mean I mean like that is honestly I I don't think it's I mean that crazy compared to I mean it is it's very like methodical like very planned out yeah and a lot of people were in on it I think that probably was one of things like honestly Jennifer was that the biggest crush ever had and you know elementary middle school growing up you know and so she does want to really wanted to impress that's why I did that research you know and then I know that she was in on it these other guys planned it but she went along with it but they have to her say that to you like the I can't believe you thought you were cool enough to come to my party yeah fuck man yeah I end up leaving and this is before cellphones and I don't have cell phone tells like 16 17 and so I'm 13 run out found a Dairy Queen and went in the back and where the drive-thru is there was like I don't know dumpster and they got like the fence around it and I just was able to open it sit there and just cried basically until uh someone came out to throw away the trash and then they're like oh how many down and what do you need and all this other stuff can you call your mom if I have a phone and so I walked inside called her but she wasn't there so it took a little while to get a hold of my mom and then um yeah I mean it was just it was nuts because it's weird how you you'll believe especially in today's age with social media and all the tweets and things that people just throw away I throw around you know it's nuts how you can see somebody don't even know them they don't have one follower but somehow it can still if you let it it can still affect you instead of just shrugging it off that's a totally different thing know someone saying something on Twitter mm-hmm and someone saying something and looking you in the eyes yeah and planning out this big deception yeah but you're such a nice guy I can understand what what the fuck causes someone to be such a shithead like that well I don't know me and I think well I think I've matured a lot where I mean obviously 29:13 but uh I think I just became an easy target and cuz you just a nice guy and they just maybe that I wouldn't stand up for myself and maybe I wasn't the biggest kid but I was chubby and bigger and yeah I think it just was easy to pick on me in the locker rooms pick on me in the I don't know I think I think who the stats I was looking at was something like 87% of bullying doesn't happen in the presence of adults adults right and then uh I forget but you know even the people around like how you're saying you know if the people plan it out and everything else with you in the eyes I think that might have been what me back the most because I was like man like this is if you're sitting by this is what I try to tell some of the kiddos growing up now it's like if you think that by laughing I mean if you're there and you're not bullying but you're giggling you're laughing like you're definitely a part of it you're an encourage you're alright but then if you're even if you're silent and you're just watching it and you don't like now you're if you see it you have a choice you do something about it you cannot and so I feel like that's a passive standby kind of encouragement where and so for me it was like everyone was there people were saying it people were laughing people were watching but nobody was was standing up for me so it was a I think that's what I heard the most well see so there's two giant instances the one with the other guy named Justin so they planned that out too mm-hmm fuck man yeah both little kids yeah it was actually part of the same kids so yeah damn yeah and then uh so from that yeah that's that's definitely been the biggest battle of my life has been depression suicidal thoughts and it was all from that bullying there was nothing other than that for the depression yeah yeah I mean it went from technically I would say went from third grade to tenth grade and then whenever I started wrestling at my parents transfer me out of school everything else then but the bullying is what caused all these suicidal thoughts there's nothing else that was bumming you out about life that is so fucked up that some shitty mean kids can all of a sudden throw this monkey wrench in your life and you know I've learned and I mean of course I am you know Allah I used to looking back it shouldn't have I should have ever let it get to the point to where you know I think I should hurt myself or kill me you know what just a real quick put that together with the pygmies in Congo whenever I opened up and shared with some of them around the campfire just hanging out talking sharing life stories I shared that and I just remember the looks on several people's faces just so baffled like did he just say he wanted to hurt himself he was suicide he wanted to kill himself all they doing stuff and they - are asking me does that not happen here and they're like whoa some of them like well we've heard of that happening before yeah there's this guy that was that guy and that guy and again we heard that someone in their village had hurt themselves or killed themself or something but most of the people I think we're like no never heard why would anyone if you hurt yourself you're only hurt like it's only hurting you right that's not gonna help anything we just wanted the pain yet and yeah yeah here I just wanted the pain to end but there it's like it's nuts because they if I look at it I was a little kid I got bullied by some stupid kids and then look at if I look at what they're going through I mean it makes it it makes it it shrinks it it makes it microscopic whenever you stop just focusing on your own problems you start looking at others other problems that maybe you can be a part of helping solve that problem so so this bullying all throughout your childhood led into adulthood and the only thing that made it better was you going to the Congo and helping out these pygmies and building wells and and sort of dedicating and devoting your life to their life yeah I would say practically that has been you know to have a sense of purpose I mean I think it's a it's a lot of different things but that all kind of came together but for me yeah I mean when you're not living for yourself and living for others you just along I mean I I didn't know that for me I had a big paradigm shift or change in my life whenever you know coming out of the dictionary I felt like I mean like I don't have to walk around and hate myself and stay away from people because they're either gonna hurt me or I'm gonna want to hurt them like I I don't have to do that I can I can help people I can want to love them I can you know figure out something I did it first started and what really started helping a lot was involved with a lot of different stuff from juvenile detention center going in and meeting with some of those kids once a week to a homeless shelter to becoming a official volunteer at the Denver Children's Hospital and taking the grudge guys through did you do you stay in anyway in touch with those kids from back in the day from kids that bullied you that you ever it was actually funny after the Ultimate Fighter I got invited out by one of the guys and just because I think a couple of people know just yeah I saw one of the guys who was one the main guys and he's like hey it's just some walking around downtown Fort Worth and so that when we go out here whatever I'm like alright I'll go and well he had actually brought me into the sushi restaurant and all around the table was most of the people that were not most there's probably only eight or ten people but they were some of the main kids that were at that party and when I dressed up and everything why man if you if we'd known you were a fighter or you know you could keep their butts and we wouldn't have done that to you I'm just like it's all I thought was going the bathroom just left from I think that's the only time I've ever done anything like that but just like I can't can't be around these guys did you did you sense any feeling remorse from them or they did just want to be yeah one new one or two of them one guy for sure he's he's pretty cool now and um but then one is uh there's a knucklehead for sure and still yeah you know it's that classic thing of kids ganging up on one kid that's a weird instinct that sometimes children have didn't remember that movie carry when they she goes to the prom and this is basic moving it's based on a great Stephen King book you know I know that cover I know the the Sissy Spacek movie was really trippy John Travolta's in it hmm back in the day young and handsome but it's you know that's the themes that they push her she has these crazy telekinetic powers and they push her to this point and they do it by mocking her and bullying her they take her to the prom they pour pig's blood on her head winds up killing everybody oh wow yeah it's pretty pretty crazy but that's that thing that happens when kids gang up on a que that they feel like is vulnerable like what the fuck is that man what a horrible instinct ik is that but I mean I just I struggle to understand where that instinct comes from or why people do it it's especially little kids know I mean I guess I guess I could understand that if the kids have been abused themselves they want to lash out they're angry and hurt but oftentimes it's just they find someone who's a vulnerable it's like they find the pecking order and they find the one person they can get away with and they all funnel their insecurities and their anger and their aggression on this one person just because with no regard whatsoever with what kind of impact it's gonna have on that kid yeah I think I think one of the things that makes it so much worse now is Italy I mean I don't know I get to hear some of the stuff and they can't escape it like you know because it follows them home I'm not cyberbullying and they get the text and the all the stuff is so it's constantly so I could at least escape it from eight to three eight to three I was at school but when I came home I was I was ok and maybe that gave me a break
