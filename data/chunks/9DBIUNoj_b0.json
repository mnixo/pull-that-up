Pinchbeck is in the house ladies and gentlemen strap in the Jaro can experience we're gonna get crazy taking a long ride down some of my favorite schools of thought with this guy here Daniel Pinchbeck is a author if you've never heard of him he's got a great book called breaking open the head and another one called 2012 the return of Quetzalcoatl is that all I say it right good enough good enough close enough Quetzalcoatl and just an all-around fascinating dude thanks for coming by man I'm sorry you got stuck in traffic but it's almost appropriate because you're sort of a little bit of a doom and gloom end of civilization sort of a dude and there's a giant power outage in LA that fucked traffic upside down well yeah now that I know that I feel better about the situation yeah do you though Oh finally some apocalyptic shit's happening and while I'm here perfect in New York we just had a hurricane in an earthquake and one week yeah I moved here when the earthquake happened I moved here like only like a month after the earthquake in 94 happened and it was this feeling of humility in LA that I liked like when I first got here I was like people who seemed kind of shook up but they seemed pretty friendly you know sort of almost like you know any sort of a natural disaster does to any big group of people you know the what are you doing everybody I'm looking at your alpha brain you want some what is it it's on nootropics its vitamins for cognitive functions sure where we go brighter yes 1.5 million people in power right now I think was the last in Los Angeles in Los Angeles right now which is kind of crazy well yeah it is crazy that's a lot of fucking people we sell those I'll get you a bottle of those things man we just started putting those out on on it calm oh and in IT calm and what it is is a there's a lot of different things that people take to improve mental function we just put the highest ingredients together and started to start selling it yes it's fascinating stuff man you know the science of it is a little sketchy a lot of people call bullshit but I think it works works for Maine man even if it's just a placebo effect I'll take all the lies that you tell me if I believe them it seems like it works to me - well the dreams are no question you take them you have this fucking these crazy vivid rememberable dreams it's very unusual and supposedly it's because of choline is that how you say is that the the nutrient I believe he said it's called choline but apparently it's known to stimulate dreams gives you fucking weird creepy memorable dreams I got a weird dream about a werewolf and a gorilla having sex and I was trying to be quiet and get out of the room before they realized I was there no because you know I was out last night I was laying in bed I was looking up your books on Amazon and the one cover he has is so trippy I actually spent a good time just scrolling up and down on my browser just looking at the which one breaking up and I think sorry the one has the mushroom in the middle and then it's like it was fucking awesome I that's how stoned it was like dude you're you're here when this is what if this really was going down like right now in Los Angeles are you prepared cuz I know you're a big 2012 advocate and I've talked to you about well I'm just out of Burning Man so at least I have my flashlight and Camelbak did you just leave Burning Man yeah three days ago Wow how was it it was great now you're like my age right 45 I'm 44 are you not tired of those those crazy hippies yet uh really nutty ones you know whatever I mean I like the whole scene um it's all sorts of genius people they're actually a definitely like not just hippies but the heads of all the technology companies I had a debate with some Google exec who's a yoga practitioner and you know just I had lots of great conversations right there I mean it's although this you know the psychedelic community and I spent a lot of time with this woman who runs the women's visionary Congress and my friend John Perry Barlow who brought lyrics for the Grateful Dead and started electronic freedom and foundation it's actually an amazing you know brain trust of human oddities and eccentric fossils I believe that but it's also a lot of douchebags and you got to wade through them and when you're what you are is like this figurehead for this psychedelic movement in sort of a lot of ways so you must get a lot of crackpots when I say douche bags it's not their fault either he's honest like I didn't have one douche bag experience and all ever a lot of people did come up through and whenever it was cool who would read my books or you know seen the film and people were extremely like respectful and so kind of like like moving like people so some people told me that the books that affected them or impacted their lives or what every dead show I've ever been to or any fish show I've ever been to there's never been douchebag so I just think you would think there would be a shitload deuce packed everyone has like this positive vibe to them so everyone even if there are a douchebag they still have like this underlining yeah I'm like a happy and in love I want to give you love and positive energy seems like a whole scene and stuff like so I just have a negative idea I think so I think you're like Cartman right now I'm just okay I lived in Boulder for a while I became very terrified of Hitler each you're very East Coast I'm so hippie before I was like so down with it then you're around them for a while like God so many people are fucking crazy you know did okay everybody's crazy you know there's Republicans crazy right-wing Christians are crazy I mean you look at the Republican convention you look at these these of these speeches so there's these debates they're having it's like one nutty fucking person after another nutty person I mean it's this fucking the the guy from California the guy from Massachusetts rather MIT Romney he's he's a Mormon I mean at a certain point in time you gotta go come on man really you believe that Joseph Smith this fourteen-year-old kid found these golden tablets with the lost works of Jesus and only you could read them because you had a magic rock really right at a certain point in time I mean it how is a guy like that allowed to even run for president if there's certain things he believed mean do you think there should be a line that like look if someone completely siding oh come on man this is crazy very hard to draw that line at this point I mean people you know believing in the Bible and so on it's hard enough will happens at six thousand year people the people that really believe the earth is 6,000 years old there's a lot of them Sarah Palin she really believes that a lot of people do I didn't learn from that movie red state that that like everybody there's this big center of the world that's really crazy and like fucking they believe crazy shit like you can't even that I just watched that wild whites of West Virginia I mean those people believe probably things that you'd be amazed I don't think they're thinking about that they're just pill people pill popping people and partiers yeah I've seen that the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia nope it's a fascinating yet terrifying documentary that johnny Knoxville put together about this family in West Virginia that's completely crazy all they're do like they're just constantly committing crimes and selling pills going on rampages and get arrested and just a fascinating family that's just not living by the rules that you or I live by you know now first Burning Man was sold out this year and it's just like I think the first time that it was ever sold out and did it seem like overly crowded or did it seem like why did they even put it well they don't have a control over that it's the Bureau of Land Management I think it's actually because it counts as a city it's only allowed to go through to grow 3% per year so it was growing from 51 to 54 thousand or something like that right something like that so mmm so yeah I mean it could easily go up to 75 or hundred thousand in terms of the space there they just keep they can just keep adding avenues and expanding it and so on do you see any awesome art did you see any like wow they took it to the next level type shit this year um yeah there was so there were some beautiful stuff there was a huge model of the Trojan horse which 300 Greeks and white togas dragged through the gates then they blew it up and spectacular fashion on Friday night there's lots of fun stuff that sounds pretty fucking bad I want to go so bad like I talked about it maybe fit 20 podcasts ago like I was thinking about going and I'm mad at myself for not going my perceptions my perceptions are always is gonna be some really cool people that but just gonna wade through some knuckleheads to get to them but you're sounding like it's not that way you're sounding like it's pretty positive overall yeah I mean I'm you know I I still like it ya don't like it what if the December 21st 2012 is the big day and that's you know itched in stone and a lot of people's ideas about a lot of the shit that you write about and a lot of the shit that people think of about the coming of the next age if it rolls around and nothing happens then what right on yeah once again actually people would have to look at whatever I said and read about it I never I never particularly said that anything was gonna happen absolutely do that yes I mean you absolutely haven't you know on the other hand it seems to me that's super clear that we're in you know I go the the middle of a transformation that that you know we can see now the global economy is buckling the planetary ecology is also buckling we've written you know hit peak oil a lot of the resources are in serious depletion so yeah we're faced with it with it with an endgame for the current global civilization that we're in is that peak oil thing been clearly established yeah it's been very clearly established so everyone agrees it's not a debated thing well I mean of course there's there's there some debate and there's some disinformation there's a lot of there's a lot of money involved you know but if you look at what you know the the main geologists talked about and you know I mean it's prediction that was made back in the 70s even and that's why they're trying to get all this oil in Canada that this big protests have been happening on the White House lawn where Daryl Hannah got arrested one of the NASA's top climate scientists get arrested and they're protesting this extraction which is apparently incredibly inefficient of course but it's why we are you know in Wars and you know Libya Afghanistan and Iraq and you know why we're trying to hold down the you know our access to the remaining resources but yeah so I never ever expected anything exactly what happened on December 21st 2012 although certainly might but I think that you know what we need to do and what I tried to do and my work up to this point is really trying to take a big step back and look at our situation and factor in all sorts of stuff that you know the modern world view is not really factoring in which for me includes shamanism you know the DMT experience psychic experience in general you know the kind of psychic capacities that actually many people are aware of that happen all the time whether it's synchronicity or telepathy so we were on the phone today we talked about talk to you about it like I was picking up you or I picked up my phone and I was going through the contacts to find your number and the phone rang and it was you I love this shit that's that's as creepy as it gets what do there's a lot of minutes a day more and more that would raise how do you know when I'm calling you man there's a lot of goddamn incident was the last time I fucking called you when yeah you were supposed to be on the podcast today and we had emailed each other about it but we hadn't talked from the phone the long last time that's a weird coincidence right well I mean you can say that it's weird and creepy but then you kind of get past that point you can just kind of integrate at it's like okay that somehow there's actually something one consciousness that's kind of working through all of us and and and you know as time moves on in this period it seems like those synchronicities are speeding up and are in our you know psychic capacities or somehow and intensifying you know but but I will say that my one idea and working for December 21st 2012 is to utilized date because now there's so much popular focus on it to create a kind of global event which would be a kind of spectacle I'm working with composers and a team from Cirque du Soleil and they're kind of putting together a concept for a show that would kind of celebrate humans evolution you know he needs evolution to this present point and then ending with a synchronized peace Meditation kind of global focus on unity with the idea that you could you could take that the energy for that you know that's pointed towards that day and there's so much fear around in anxiety and trepidation and actually make it into like the most awesome thing possible where it's like well look where we've arrived at and look at our opportunities now to to make a shift and a jump into a new form of planetary civilization well this is the the clearest time in human history where the common person any person really has a direct influence over an incredible amount of people with viral information with videos and with anything you write that really resonates with people you can hit an amazing amount of people now so a guy like you could get in touch with a bunch of other people who could do exactly the same thing and a ripple effect can go on and it can hit millions and millions easy there's never been an opportunity to do anything like that yeah but we totally love to have you involved with our unifier earth I'm not so sure doing at Ciro's sure certisign I'm down I got your action working watch it at the moment at the moment were actually in negotiation from the Mexican government to use Chichen Itza Chichen itzá which is considered by the Mayans to be the heart of the Mayan world you know would be the shit dude Toby Keith concert at Chichen Itza that'd be the most ironic thing of all time so he gives this like this super rah-rah American country music he's like Sodom saying we'll kick your ass you know he's like one of those guys he's but he's got a he's a good singer I mean he's got good songs but they're just some of them are like real knucklehead rah rah rah songs I just think him on the fucking pyramids playing a concert might be one of the most ironic things of all time tell you about me awesome America is you could love it or leave it we gotta get talking about smoking weed with Willie Nelson oh yeah he's got good music he's got good music I just think it'd be fine um a funny yeah I'm scared of chichén itzá hello don't forget that dream yo you write that dream down right now it's only on the internet now this is what draw this dream for you pure Irish boy should never stop dreaming don't ever stop - I think as you do that things are moving in a certain direction and I wonder how much people steer it you know how much things like this do how much communication online steers it because it seems to me this is the only time where people have been able to sort of like merge in this way globally on their own and do it on a regular basis you know people are addicted to just going on Twitter addicted to communicating with people on message boards and on Facebook and they're there this is there's an inner connectivity that's never existed before so an idea that the idea of a hive mind like influenced by anyone is way different now than it's ever been in human history as far as we know right absolutely yeah an amazing time yeah for sure I mean now what idea that a lot of different people are kind of moving towards this idea that maybe humanity's on the VirB of transition on the verge of transitioning into being kind of like a super organism you know that we're kind of like coming to awareness of ourselves as a singular being in a sense you know and and then we can you know begin to act more symbiotically rather than like parasitically or aggressively there was a really fascinating article recently written on creativity and how people are always praising creativity and looking forward to getting new and creative ideas but that other people's creativity actually makes people uncomfortable it makes people uncomfortable and uneasy and the idea that someone had come up with these ideas that they didn't you know and you know you wonder if like the the really powerful push towards fundamentalism the really powerful push towards the 6,000 year old earth kind of shit you know and follow the Bible kind of shit is really the same thing as someone well I'm gonna get trying to confine creativity they're trying to confine enlightenment or same reason but I guess my feeling is basically you know we we live in a culture where there's you know basically being people are being indoctrinated not to think they're being they're being indoctrinated by the the media the mainstream culture by the education system to be ignorant to not question to not develop their independent capacity of thoughts are you okay are you saying this as in from the education system or you saying this from the media yeah from both I think okay what does the mean but the media does not make you dumb right oh yes yes doesn't mean it makes people incredibly it makes you dumb you you you can't watch the end I remember I don't watch that stuff but but if you did you think it would affect you you know if I'm in a hotel room and I watch that stuff for a couple days I feel like I'm having a lobotomy whoa really there CNN yep you can't just see it as a program all these things are from my from my perspective they're basically kind of holding the mass consciousness the planetary consciousness at a certain low level or low frequency you know where it's you know passive consumerist fear-based you know there's this violent activity very disjointed it creates a lot of frustration and anxiety there's no deeper analysis there's no attempt to create like a coherent you know understanding of what's happening in any sense I could see your point that maybe perhaps it isn't used to its utmost abilities or the capabilities that we would have for it but I don't think that it's it's not a good form of entertainment I don't I don't think it has to be either/or I feel like you could sit home and watch a fucking silly TV show and it doesn't hurt you I mean I think this idea that we're helpless to media constantly bombarding us with these images and ideals and that we we have to accept them I think that's silly and I think that honestly with the internet without you you look at the society that's growing out of the inner look at like movements like anonymous look at shit like this things that have never happened before these giant groups moving forward and and taking down websites and taking down companies that they feel have acted in justly we didn't have no one's ever been able to do something like that before any that's Stevie if you want it it's good gonna have some of the thing Thanks yeah well I mean so we have two things we number things are happening simultaneously that's another thing that's very interesting about our time is that things are getting pretty complicated now one problem with television in general is that it's designed to reduce everything into tiny little sound bites you know when Lincoln and Jefferson debated in the 1860s the debates lasted eight hours you know when we have a debate on TV each person gets like 36 seconds for this response 22 seconds we're basically used to everything being spoon-fed and dumb down to an absolute level of stupidity you know and basically the problem is that because our scenario on the planet is very complex at this point we actually need to be able to you know articulate and analyze at a much deeper level you know so yes we have two things going on we have the one directional mass media which I really am convinced is basically a kind of a lobotomy machine that anesthetize is people into an ultimate state of idiocy and consumers passivity and then we have the development of this new interactive media which is having profound effects and will continue to have profound effects and if you go look at the history of media every time there's a new form of media that's very powerful it transforms you know the society the political system the government changes everything you know you could never have had an empire until you had a written code of laws that could be distributed you know to the borders and beyond you could never have had a modern representational democracy in a nation state unless you had the printing press which distributed enough you know materials that everybody could participate in civic dialogues now what this interactive technology potentially points towards a much deeper transition in our political and social paradigm potentially towards away from centralized control hierarchy to more of a kind of distributed or direct democracy and interconnectedness as human beings in general it's never no-one's been this close to this many people just through online communication no one has ever had that kind of an influence before by such a wide variety of people and ideas you know all come yours and then look how incredibly new it as and we're just adapting we're dude we're just we're just like treading water trying to try to catch up with it with this force that our culture has has unleashed and it's good as it now or is it sausages is it awesome well if you love change it's great I mean if you're somebody who had you know Warner records you're probably scratching your head at this point I had the most fascinating conversation right I had the most fascinating conversation with a guy was trying to say that Google was bad the idea of the internet search is bad I go why he goes because you know it used to be if you wanted knowledge how to go look for it I was like wow that might be the craziest fucking thing I've ever heard you think it should be hard to find that shit it should be hard you should have to go to a library and look up the right book it should take hours no you should be able to save your phone that's very much like people to talk about the picture you shouldn't take a psychedelic because like a shortcut to the mystical experience right of course the answer to that is like you know what's wrong with a shortcut if I'm trying to get some where am I going to go like all around and like a circuitous boring route am I gonna just take the friggin shortcut that reminds me of a joke did Terence Mckenna used to say that some guy practice a city of levitation for 40 years and figured out finally how to float and he came up to the Buddha and he said master I can walk across the water and the Buddha said but the ferries only a nickel you know I mean take the fucking mushroom take a chance dude they can take a shortcut not only that the idea that you are independent from nature and you don't need some help and anyway I mean you're constantly getting help from nutrients and vitamins and protein and all these different things you absorb through nature but then it comes to this that you think may or may not do something to your mind you're not you know I can get there naturally yeah yeah to get back to the Google search I mean yeah I mean I think that um you know the fact that we now have so much knowledge information you know at our disposal is an extraordinary thing you know but then the question is still how do we manage that what do we do with it and what type of you know sister in society can we you know pull ourselves into because at the moment what we have is not going to last very much longer I like what you said pull pull ourselves into because it's really it's going to have to be that because it's gonna you're gonna have to pull away from the system that we have now that I mean especially the financial system we've learned from when Ron Paul wanted the audits of the bailouts and people found out how many trillions of dollars had been sent into this this whole idea of bailouts and where this tax dollars went I think a lot of people became really disillusioned and disenfranchised and and had no connection to it you know I mean I mean when when when it happened did it sense to you when you were hearing about the bailouts did any of that make any sense to you I don't pay attention it's like it's it seems like a system you can't fix so it seems like III you know it almost feels like trying to go against the Machine that's currently in place is so it's so intangible it's like so gigantic the financial system is completely and utterly corrupt right unrecognizable so it's impossible to understand right well that's like I've been a bunch of the work I've been doing over the last few years I mean in the film actually interviewed you for the film we didn't end up using her interview we just couldn't somehow splice it I put it online and 2012 time for change we interviewed this guy Bernard Lee ATAR who was an economist he was one of the architects of the euro she wrote a great book called the future of money and in that book he you know and in our film also we discussed how the financial system is broken it really doesn't matter this point who you put in control because still just like a car with no brakes but that actually we're going to have to reinvent instruments for exchanging value that actually have fundamentally different different value systems connected to them so for instance he proposes a currency which he calls the Terra that has a negative interest charge so it's a new trading currency of a global trading currency that's indexed not to just a virtual abstraction like our money currently has but actually is indexed to a basket of real world goods and resources that decline in value over time because most things do you know so if you the longer you held on to at era the less it would be worth so instead of a gold standard it would be maced based on a bunch of different exactly but a bundle of resources that includes annual and wheat and you know processed foods and unprocessed goods and so on and and as a summation of all of that it would actually decline in value would have what's called a demo Raj charge so when people got a bunch of these terrors through some business deal rather than seeking to hoard them or hold on to them that wouldn't work so they would be best you know used by putting them back into circulation by sharing them or whatever so so that's Lea tarz concept and one of many concepts we were actually publishing a book through my company Evolver called sacred economics by Charles Eisenstein it's actually already up on it's out on the internet and new copies but he actually puts together a whole paradigm looking at the inevitability of the financial system breaking down and really seeing that rather than just having one monopoly of a value exchanging instrument like money that's controlled by private banking interests you could really create a whole ecology of different ways of exchanging value that would be used for different purposes do you think that the government would ever allow something like that to actually take place I mean it almost seems like trying to create a government inside of government well I mean it's happened before I mean for instance in the depression and they reissued a lot of local currencies there's also done in the 19th century obviously you know it about a town in North Carolina or South Carolina that's trying to do that right now exactly why I think that's that's that's definitely gonna be on the horizon because people are not going to be able to use this this yeah there's a small town and they had their own currency in his town and there was a debate about its legality and in fact if you look at the bankruptcy of the government and the effects of peak oil and all those other stuff going on the capacity of the federal government to to intervene into metal may actually become radically reduced to the next in the next years because it's just not going to be the money available for that kind of endless you know um effort damn my face is melting thinking about me saying yeah it was like so much information I'm thinking about right now well you know is it possible that none of this will actually happen that we'll sort of stumble into the finish line no it's not possible it's not possibly not possible so you think it's absolutely 100% that the society that we currently enjoy is going to collapse absolutely I'm dr. Chen I'm inside of it what kind of time frame you can even it uh you know could be a year could be ten or fifteen years but but the point is to recognize that you know we're in it now I mean that you know our faith in capitalism you know capitalism is a system that has an inherent instability to it and basically what it requires is constantly new markets that need to be turned into money so you can keep the dynamics and that you can wait you can keep the debt growing and you keep extending the credit but we we you know but we're I think we're going to realize soon enough is that capitalism was not a final system it was a transitional system we don't know what that transition is into yet but capitalism is like an adolescent system it's like aggressive compulsive competitive you know at a certain point you have to shift into maturity and adulthood and you have to let go of some of that adolescent compulsion you know how important is psychedelics in this equation because the best tool in my opinion to sort of calm down that those instincts those competitive super hyper aggressive instincts is psychedelics and it's be trying to have two legal things but no I have to try it I think yeah it's awesome it's funny because it makes me violent when I watch it really why it's so fun so I think that psychedelics have tremendous value I mean it's but I people always say that I'm an advocate of psychedelics and I suppose it's true to a certain extent but I also feel that it's an individual decision or not for everybody and obviously there's still illegal and frowned upon in our society right but but the fact is that one of the values of psychedelics is they kind of decondition you from your present state of consciousness and your in your kind of social ideology and belief system you know there's a kind of peeling away and I remember the first time I took mushrooms one of the first experiences I had was going to a deli and buying something with money and just finding it totally ludicrous that our culture invested so much belief in these wrinkly brown ugly pieces of paper you know that everybody was kind of so disconnected from their present experience and focused on the sports or the stock ticker or all this crap in from my opinion you know so I think that peeling away back to a kind of you know phenomenological does they say level of just presence of being that's that's a very powerful thing and we tend you know as humans we're it's very easy for us to get lost in abstractions and concepts and we take it then we believe in our concepts we think that they're real you know so the psychedelics can can break that that that investment we've made and all these things that we think are real they're just abstractions and concepts does it have to be either/or can you enjoy a good movie and still be a person who believes that we are evolving as a consciousness and that we are in an adolescent state of evolution and somehow or another we're in a transition area period we're all coming to Cuba can't you just enjoy the x-men I actually thought I loved the x-men you loved the x-men that's cool mariette cuz I'm telling what's cool movies are cool but TV's not be ever see Walking Dead it's a pretty fuckin good show man they're zombies these people trying to survive it's fuckin fun sometimes I like to sit in front of something and watch some shit that somebody created that's supposed to be entertain me I don't think it has to cut your capacity for thinking and reason and logic and original thought I don't think it has to I think it could just be fun to watch I think a lot of people are conditioned by a lot of people a week but a lot of people fucking eat cheeseburgers all day and become 700-pound well I mean you know I I'm not like in a you know I don't I don't judge other you enjoy whatever you want to enjoy I don't really care I mean I mean personally you know that what I like are kind of when I get excited now about popular narratives it's it's more because I see in them the seeds of part of this transformation that's underway now for instance if you look at like a lot of the most archetypal a huge stories that our culture keeps telling us which includes the mutant you know the x-men Harry Potter you know Lord of the Ring why literally should certain extent but um Star Wars let's say avatar the story that's repeated over and over again is there's like this hero's journey and as part of that hero's journey there has to be a learning to use our psychic faculties you know so so you know the matrix that else we're all superheroes dude yeah so if you look at a mutants they're going to this Academy they have to learn how to master these paranormal gifts you know Harry Potter you have to learn to cast your spell's star wars you have to use the Force you know I actually the more that I've thought about it and the more my own experiences are kind of echoed you know some of these things I think that these stories are so powerful because they represent a kind of yearning that people have for kind of initiative training and extrasensory perception and that is something that our society you know has rigorously denied us you know and I think if you look at like what happens to you when you're like an adolescent let's say you're 15 20 years old you know you have this you have this beginning and when you're a young teenager you have this tremendous sense of expectation you're like waiting for some transformative thing to happen to you and then it doesn't happen and so instead you accept a lot of basically crappy degraded substitutes like dulling entertainment like you know what young athletes do this and that or whatever you know rather than having gone through something that you always just know is missing but that but then the culture kind of like hides it from you and I think that that thing that that's missing from our culture is this direct initiative process how is the culture hiding it from me though you know I think the culture that the water sort of seeks its own level on a lot of these things and a lot of people just get lazy and don't look for it and this culture that's opening up right now it experiences now or being detailed and talked about that people could never understand before the the connection that people have together through the internet now it's there's there's never been anything like this before you know I don't think it's getting dumber I think there's always going to be a certain amount of dumb people yeah I think there's always gonna be certain lot of people to smoke cigarettes totally I think we I just stopped actually recently which is rigged did you really you smoke cigarettes I know it's a pathetic Wow just for you're such a smart guy I know I know I know what the fuck is that I know I apologize that's what a ruthless you didn't get it he's or not once you go into the you know I swear when putting sick fuck with you because I love you because when you're my best actually was through ayahuasca that I stopped she was through ayahuasca that I started also to be honest because there's a whole relationship between ayahuasca shamanism in the Amazon and tobacco right that's when I first started smoking load tobacco on you right they do and it's also there's something about tobacco and ayahuasca that are very synergetic together I mean it's a it's a you know tobacco is considered a very important power plant you try my dad's first why didn't you trust a gars we can get natural tobacco yeah I did that on tobacco I try again cigars are way better for you I mean they're probably not the best thing for you but they're better for you than cigarettes yeah is it let's all the chemicals and cigarettes that are natural American spirits um but I stayed at least at that level for like that shit seems like it hurts me more though like when I do natural spirits it's like the next day I'm coughing up blacks cuz it's not giving you any numbing it's like cigars there's 590 fucking ingredients and cigarettes yeah but by the way and are usually made for all government approve editor did anybody really go over all those 590 you know a lobbyist right you know who the fuck went over all those ingredients and made sure that they're all cool people are dying half a million a year in America alone directly related to cigarette smoke what you were saying a lot of people probably I think also feel like they did accomplish what they wanted in life like I think that's it seems like it seems almost negative that you say it like that because like like I talked to my dad he's like fuck yeah this is exactly what I wanted to do with my life I had loved my life I'm happy I'm married and I know dude don't you think your dad's pretty small no I think I think I mean unless I I think that's just a negative look I think a lot of people like what they do I mean you're definitely a great job though you got an easy job and I'm a timeout yeah oh I'm not talking about me at all I'm talking about like my mom right dad like everyone I grew up around with they all liked what they did well you might have been lucky and you grew up in the Midwest and you know all times I'm offering you is like you know my way of thinking about it the way I figure my god I know my personal you know experience growing up was like you know I thought there would be this amazing thing that would happen as you break down it I'll do something to have those things man you got to you know I've always said that there should be some sort of a right of right of manhood or right of you just it doesn't have to be even a manhood thing attached to like something manly or aggressive I mean as to finding your character finding your limitations doing something extraordinary yeah well I mean you know some of the thinkers that I wrote about my books talked about how cultures need to have some type of initiative ritual and if they don't have it consciously constructed it'll end up being unconsciously you know destructive it'll happen through war or through destruction of the environment or something so one one theory that I have about the you know quote unquote 2012 or this transition that we're in is that it's almost on an unconscious level you know humanity has not been able to change its behavior right so it's it's like it's on an unconscious level we're kind of willing ourselves into a state of catastrophe to bring about an initiation and and thereby a transformation of consciousness 100 percent sure of that that 94 percent that's strong man that's very strong those are strong words who knows what the fuck is going to happen that's what I say I say it could be some sort of a meteor impact or it could be some sort of a Skynet thing I do believe that something is absolutely going to happen it just seems to me that things are moving at such a furious pace that it just can't last and I think it's a natural cycle man I really do I think the reason why we're having all these natural disasters is that's a part of a natural cycle - yeah but if you talk to my grandfather grandfather about TVs make it like he was like wow this is crazy TV was invented you could see TV where you know they probably it's just us living our life and then during around a certain age or grow up to a certain point where we're like yeah it's fucking spinning out of control that is acting US 40s it's probably like Charlie Chaplin thought it was spinning out of control that is possible but it also could be that human beings even though we love to think of ourselves as being separate from all the other things in this world we are a natural thing and even though we have plastic fucking cars and glass you know lenses for our fucking cell phones even we are still a natural thing and we are subject to the natural cycles of this earth of this super organism of the universe itself and even when we see crazy weather patterns and wild crazy shit there could easily also be crazy cultural patterns and that culture even though we can create it and we do have control of it it may be very well a natural movement as natural as your evolution from baby to adulthood it could be a natural cookie wood we published some could be movies make me want to fucking choke it but that's a good one on the web make sure web magazine that I run reality sandwich and we've been publishing some excerpts which is not Mac friendly by the way I want you to know that I don't know if you know that both of these computers I tried to go to your website today and just search my name obviously first but then Joe Rogan's name and both of them kept on crashed my browser crashed my browser I've never had that problem I really not Google Chrome check it out do you use one of those old Macs with a trackball no I use in your back even when I was trackballs anyway published a few pieces by a German scientists guy dieter browsers wrote a book called revolution 2012 and he's one of a bunch of people who are arguing that a lot of what's happening has to do with changes that are taking place throughout the whole solar system have to do with the Sun changing actually the electromagnetic environment of the earth is shifting what is supposed to be the Galactic Alignment on December 21st 2012 because I've heard Neil Tyson who I very much respect who thought poet he's a scientist very famous internet scientist well internet science actions he can read he's a fucking he's a scholar very well respected I believe he's an astrophysicist or something along those lines but super super brilliant guy he poopoo there was any alignment whatsoever he said it's a constant thing that the the that alignment that same alignment happens all the time he's like you know the fact that everyone's making it out the December 21st 2012 was the first time that has happened in 25,000 years he's like that's nonsense and he's I believe he knows more than I do well you probably don't worry probably not what you yeah for sure so I mean I can just give you my little okay what do you notation I mean my understanding is that it's simply an optical alignment which which means there's no particular reason that we would know of there would be such a tremendous transformative thing where the winter solstice Sun rises within the Dark Rift at the center of the Milky Way so in a sense it's an eclipse of the center of the Milky Way by the by the Sun on the winter solstice on that particular date so that date had a lot of significance for them it was like the key you know moment in the year and they considered the Sun to be the first father and they saw the dark rift at the center of the Milky Way as the cosmic mother or they also called it apparently a black hole which is interesting is only in the last like 15 years that our astronomers discover there is a huge black hole the center of the Milky Way well they know that there's actually a supermassive black hole in the center of every single galaxy and that that supermassive black hole is one-half of one percent of a mass of every galaxy so if you have a giant galaxy it's a much bigger black hole they even have there's a the first photograph they've ever taken of a black hole eating a black hole it's fucking crazy is the
