the Joe Rogan experience I'm always trying to type faster than that commercial and I always fail so I'm trying to tweet this live in the moment and then stare it at my with my ever shittier eyes oh yeah tell me what I supposed to tweet that I'm doing this right now I just tweeted it I'll do it you could retweet it and that way it would be but i'm tweeted my eyes are fine until I was there at my fucking computer too much no they get screwed up and then you try to look at the TV and you can't see what's going on it's guaranteed it's age but it's also I don't think screens are good for you no have you ever liked taking a picture with your cell phone of a screen and then you see those lines that you can't see like whatever the fuck those are well that's it's actually just your phone's the aperture on the camera is not able to catch up with the flickering images if I'm looking through this that that doesn't fuck with my eyes I think it's the actual strain of staring at something that's lit up so close to your face that's really fucking with you more than anything isn't that correct the correct aperture is that the correct terminology you're squinting you're you're reading you're squinting your eyes you don't even realize that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the flashing thing the flashing thing like it's just your camera can't catch the shutter speeds that what it is like if you watch cars if you see videos of cars that have LCD lenses there's something happens when you film them it looks like they're flashing it's a different refresh rate usually yeah it's weird I don't like any of that shit which is why my new special I actually did it in black and white because I don't like HD TV I think it's I don't like seeing somebody's pores as they're talking to me like HD at this point it was great and then it got to a point where it was too it's was too real it's clearer than real life like I went to a game at a Dallas Cowboys football stadium and I got this giant fucking TV classic Texas right we got the biggest fucking TV you know right that means we're the best and it was so clear it looked real er than what was going on in the field and you either like pull my divider down on my my my head because I kept wanting to look at that Tony Rowland was like right in front of me the promoter hooked me up with these great seats he's fucking right there further away than he is for me looking up at this giant fucking TV it's also an instinct to look at screens I see that a lot at the UFC people are their babies do it yeah everybody does it's an instinct to stare because it's so captivating you know that and we're used to staring at screens so like if you're at a sporting event and there's a screen there you just autumn automatically start gravitating towards that screen or something I look at the screens here I usually always just look right here instead of looking right there well you should you're actually running she's supposed to do that and make sure that nothing well I don't know demons behind us we don't know about yeah I'm not a fan of technology electronics I like some of it just I feel like all the benefits of it are taken away and then some with the crashing with the refreshing with the what the fuck just happened with the oh now this is outdated and I buy a new one and then I throw this one into the fucking ocean I go back and forth I love it in a lot of ways because I'm I'm just fascinated by innovation I'm fascinated by these new things that these new people keep inventing but there's also part of me that realizes that a certain point time it's not benefiting us anymore it's not like making our lives easier it's just making things more connected to electronics it's making you more into like whatever world the electronics create yeah somewhere in the 90s we pretty much cut a flat toad knew we will find and even people say well what about medical stuff and like helping people out and everything help them live long and cure disease and everything that basically kills the rest of us to keep that other person alive and and they're still alive taking a shit that ends up in a river and just keeps polluting more and more but just like we're just we're all over the fucking place and it really needs to shrink down like the technology I don't think would be a problem if they weren't so everybody has a fucking lapped are so many people have laptops and shirts and all this shit that we just keep buying and then throwing out like you know that Pope put litter in its place you ever think about that it's like when they pick it up where do you think it goes do you think it leaves earth it just goes somewhere else we don't have to look at it and it's just fucking sitting there what's gonna happen is they're gonna fit a way to take everything that we make and turn it into either a product or turn it into fuel like whenever we make something then we have to throw it out it'll just become fuel for something else do you know how many people would have to agree just even get that ball even slightly moving there just somehow Jesus would be brought up and somehow just something them versus us Republican Democrat liberal conservative and nothing would get done and they would just sit there screaming at each other maybe or maybe they could figure out a way to actually use whatever the fuck pollution is like whatever carbon goes into the atmosphere pull that out and convert that in energy to you there's probably some fucking nerds that already know how to do something along those lines maybe not to that level but at least take the shit from down the dump you know they know how to do it there's just no money in it and it's just like they don't get checks tonight yeah yeah things show up with hookers and fucking just a fucking big freight train full of money come on boys it's a party do that and we got to get all new machines that's gonna cost us a bunch of money just do it the way we do it until we die and then you guys can do it how you want to do it by then someone else has bought into the deal so I am completely pessimistic when it comes to that shit people think that that's all bullshit that like those kind of conspiracies don't exist come on you guys are just nuts this is stupid nobody would do that if they could get rid of pollution they would but if getting rid of the pollution costs somebody money I guarantee you there'd be somebody to try to cock-block it yeah they would be if there was a guy like the classic William Randolph Hearst or E I don't you know this but the reason why marijuana became illegal wasn't because there was a problem with people smoking marijuana it was because William Randolph Hearst owned paper mills and he also owned newspapers and so he was gonna have to convert his paper mills over to hemp paper because it's way easier to grow you refill an entire forest in like a year like you jump down they throw oh yeah I mean he owned a lot of newspapers I know the reason why rosebud was you know that whole movie up the coast yeah he's fuckin he was fuckin crazy but he had so much money and so much power that he could just print fake store so he wrote these stories about blacks and Mexicans I'm sure he didn't write him but he commissioned him Black's a Mexican smoking this new drug called marijuana and having sex with all these white women like that wasn't even what they called marijuana if he actually did that I wonder how people died because of that story Oh a lot I'm sure a lot people in jail I mean just think about that that was in the 1930s and it's still stuck it was all about hemp it wasn't even about marijuana they weren't even worried about the drug the drug was commonly used amongst jazz singers always other people would smoke pot it was a normal thing the real issue was the hemp like the commodity the non psychoactive hemp they were worried about it taking over and having to spend millions of dollars to convert all as was paper plants to hemp paper yeah you just want to smoke weed right people people who don't believe in conspiracy is funny to me it's like dude you conspire you go to a bar you see two hot chicks you come up with a game plan it's a conspiracy you're conspiring to get over there and try and fuck them then just to sit there and like like all advertising there it's a conspirator fuck I'm doing here now selling my special you don't conspire yeah you think I just showed up here yeah we conspired we know it's like knocks yo that's got a zillion fucking followers he's a fan of my shit I know it's gonna come off good this will get me more like yeah I want I want this to keep going there's not randomly doing this shit you're conspiring yeah but just because I'm not whacking a president in the middle of it doesn't mean it's not a conspiracy well the shit like that Enron disaster that went down that was a conspiracy there's a bunch of conspiracies that you could see in clear form that actually did happen well the best thing they did is they made conspiracy synonymous with moronic thought and everybody says oh you're putting your tin ad on it's like this whole country came about through a conspiracy the Revolution was not a spontaneous act people sat there was like okay we're gonna rebelled against these fuckers well they're gonna hang us as traitors if we don't pull this off they came up with a game plan if you want to call it that but if if they lost they would they would have been talking about this treasonous conspiracy but all these guys that are now on our money like right yes so true that's so true yeah but now but then and if you say you're into any sort of conspiracy that automatically means you think 9/11 was an inside job and that the moon was made out of chief well 9/11 is the best one because this is the one that I always used my favorite one when people don't believe in conspiracies I say do you believe that 9/11 happened they say yes well then you believe in conspiracies because people conspired to fucking hijack planes and fly them into buildings that doesn't just about my whole thing with that they know that Americans were involved and then that may give me a fucking break okay there's nothing right on it right out of the gate you gotta be okay so who wants to fly it in and die I mean you got to have an absolute fucking nut job to do something like that so you gotta have them I mean I think we've ever even we've never had kamikazes you've never been able to get Americans listen I'll go over there try and fuck some people up but if you think I'm gonna fly some shit into something we're walking to a cafe strapped up with a bomb the fuck out of here yeah we've had guys jump on grenades to save other people but you have to run into Pizza Hut yeah we're not in a suicide bombing yeah we're into doing it from 60,000 feet with calling it freedom with an Xbox you know the funny thing about the original suicide bombers the the kamikazes they were all messed out I didn't realize that until a few years ago I didn't even know that math was like an important part of the diet back then I never saw that in the Ken Burns documentary it's apparently of just a historical fact and even there was a recent report on Hitler Hitler himself was on a litany of medication and one of them was meth they were giving a meth they would give meth to people but I'm fault him for that dude the amount of energy that that guy put out during his speech did something to level off about the screaming and yelling just sitting that still waiting for the right moment building them into that that frenzied you ever watch that Michael Jackson documentary right before he died yeah what'd he do just freeze after you did a dance move yeah that's simmer let it simmer that's Hitler's shit sitting in that fucking chair just getting him crazy just wanted me here I see the next thing what's he gonna do it's timing it's fucking timing Simon do that on stage the Michael Jackson Hitler simmer moment you have to we got to do that tonight at the comedy stuff all right okay we gotta have us you gotta do it if we had some of the technology I could be in your ear you know you had to keep a straight face after a punch line as you're looking down some fucked up hoes and I'm just gonna let it simmer and release so my dad was great but comedy comes a filled with drugs and it's nothing you know the thing about a guy like Michael Jackson he's up there doing some shit you can't do he's spinning and moonwalking and it's an acrobatic event but you see a guy like you or a guy like me on stage talking yeah I know you like I can fucking talk you know drinks like we're gonna do roll call yeah you have a couple of drinks feel I can fucking talk I know I talk I can't moonwalk I can fucking talk so you can't hold those those pauses to them it's like the green light fucking queer right right they can't help it those big juicy pauses it's just this opening they could they could say something funny to like when it happens in a movie theater most of the time it's retarded but every now and then someone will yell something out in the movie theater it's fucking hilarious right and then that guy you know he becomes a hero for that crowd he just killed there's always doing sporting events like now we like to take a moment of silence for all the victims yeah the fucking outhouse fire and everybody shuts up like just we just want you to remain quiet for 30 seconds there's always that guy 20 seconds and you hear this guy go let's wrap it up I want to see what I came here to pay for why do those fucking moments of silence like you know you could do like a 10 count at a boxing match if you know loot the Bella dies or something like that or one of those guys what was his name Lou was the the famous guy that I'd like the worst skin no no no there's this famous get funny song video yeah god damn it Wallach was famous all throughout the grant 1980s he used to Train Meldrick Taylor I don't remember anyway the point is he looked like the most unhealthy guy ever Lou Duva that's a yeah Luke Duva you nailed it pull up a picture of Lou Duva just so everybody knows the fuck we're talking about but he was you know he died I'm sure they had a 10-count for a guy like that a 10-count okay but those fucking thirty seconds of silence come on and he had to pay for that wonderful head of hair man you have to see what this dude looks like I remember page not found that's what he looked like he looked like an older Freddie Blassie classy Freddie Blassie nobody there is come on come on seriously that might be the most unhealthy looking man that's ever lived yeah but that's right towards the end man even though I don't look like that he had that Elvis hair did Fonzie hear his whole fucking life I'm so jealous anyway point being those moments that you do in like that kind of a performance and puss if Michael Jackson's doing with this fucking 30,000 people there and you know he's sorry at least 68 okay huge numbers yeah what was like the biggest place he's ever done is probably like hundreds of thousands you know you know that the original family that owned the New England Patriots they went bankrupt on the Michael Jackson victory tour when he went out with with all of his brothers the son put the thing together and I don't know if this is true so I got to preface this but a promoter in Boston told me this go forever like Michael Jackson was going to go to Foxboro Stadium where the Patriots were playing and they promoted the show and all the tickets and he had that you know what a payer play whatever the call no matter what you got to pay the guy and the town of Foxborough said no we don't want this show we don't want all these black people coming out here all right that's what it was white people got too crazy on Monday night and they stopped having Monday Night Football for like 20 years like Fox Bros like we're not having this really this is a quiet little town have your football game during the day on Sunday and then get the fuck out of here so they cancelled the show and I thought the amount of money lost on that show they were close enough that that brought him under bullet but what this promoter was claiming was this guy actually promoted the whole tour and when he was doing the finances he didn't take into consideration how big Michael Jackson's stage was and how many seats that that was gonna eat up he had this giant ass fucking stage that was eating up like tens of thousands of dollars a night times all of these fucking dates and when he tried to get him go hey Mike can you just have a smaller stage blah blah I guess he was competing with Prince and was saying like no cuz if I have a smaller stage Prince will have a bigger stage and I got to make sure my shit is bigger than his of course you said that in a falsetto I don't know if this is true but like this is the story this guy told me I blew my mind I was like oh I always thought they went broke I'm just done because of that one fucking date that he cancelled that and I just figured you know there's 60,000 people day that's what reminded me in talking about 60,000 people all paid that money and he still had to give him a cut of that and they just didn't have it that actually does make sense that the size of the stage thing that totally makes sense yeah cuz there's a comedy club that did that in New York were they for some reason they moved the stage out away from the wall now this little small club they moved it away from the wall so the waitresses could walk behind the stage behind this wall and like they took out like five or six tables and all the other comedy clubs were laughing and they figured out how much money they fucked themselves out of over the course of a year you know doing shows yeah three shows a night times six seven days like they were fucking themselves out of like three-quarters of a million dollars a year so they hadn't and they they ended up having to move the wall that was fucking hilarious everybody from day one is just like this is stupid it was already one of those rooms that was kind of shaped it's not to celebrate was shaped like the cellar where it's like you're standing sideways in a rectangle right so you kind of got to angle yourself and they took that shit and moved you further into the crowd so it was almost like like you're in the round almost yeah but only on but the people are on two sides there's a place like that in San Francisco there's a theatre that I did that's like that it's weird you won't the stage goes out into the crowd and like so people are behind you into the left and behind you into the right this is very strange you did thing with me right yeah yeah that was weird right right I don't think you ever want to be sitting behind a performance no well I'm doing a theater in the round and Phoenix just collected theater yeah just could it be weird no three times before what you do you've done this before I I just start the joke on this side and then turn and end on that side and I just really try to be conscious of sections yeah like Dane said the most brilliant thing about the the the theater-in-the-round egos it's for theaters just look at it that way it's for theaters just all stuck together and you just sort of perform them one later than this one and then that one over there and then I just think you do it like the the three-card Monte you just sort of switch it up like you don't write right as you go around but I know I know people that have seen comics I'll do his theater-in-the-round they'll be like so-and-so was here and he didn't move it like when I was comics it's just standing with the mic stand so they were in the back and just sitting there and one of them had like a slow turning stage right so eventually just didn't do 20 more jokes he's gonna be looking at us so he made the stage turn well no no they they have a stage that turns and I think that's four musical acts we have a target in amps planted so they're not moving but it's also full I think like performers who just want to stand there and out move around it's fun around like they're out of fuckin care so you did that one very slowly very slowly it's been a few times yeah the one that turns though yeah but it turns very stable yeah the same place yeah the celebrity theater that's one we're talking about yeah I forgot that it turns yeah they asked you the option do you want that stage turned on I'm gonna be serious I'm definitely gonna say yes oh I always say no like I don't need I don't need that I want it just for because it's weird yeah well if they could speed it up you could literally just be running in place doing a whole fucking joke running against it my goal is to do so many shots while I'm on stage that I can't figure out where the stool is at any given time it could be anywhere moving around I've been drunk twice on stage twice twice and 20-some years yeah it's not the best move every now and then though it's the right thing to do once I was in Ireland so that's not my fault and the other time I was coming back from a he's Red Sox game and didn't know I was gonna have a show and somebody called up hey I had a falling out can you come down and do the show and I thought I was sober one of those like yeah I'll do what I just went up there and I was like she's just like oh shit I just slowed way down and add a very very subpar fucking show is bad so you had a slow way down just to get your mouth to work right yes which killed the timing of everything so I bombed very slowly I see that with that the term punch-drunk it's like a term that people don't like but that's that's exactly what it's like that same thing where you know you're a little fucked up so you have to struggle to get your words out like you could see that in fighters it's the exact same thing it's why they call it punch-drunk it's not just they sound like the drunk but the same thing like you have to struggle to control your situation and then when those guys get drunk that's when you see guys at a really punch trunk when guys have been punched drunk get drunk because then you see they have a hard time yeah because they have a really hard time controlling the words then then it's just a it's a mangled mess I watched him the that that UFC the what do you call when they stick him in the house and all that shit Ultimate Fighter the Ultimate Fighter and it's all women and like I remember the last time I did your podcast I was against it like women in the Octagon it's like they think like why would you do that they're beautiful why would you punch each other in the face and I want to see a jab to your breasts and shit it's just I didn't want to see and now I don't even notice it anymore and it's it's unbelievably fucking entertaining you don't notice that they're girls anymore no no they're great fights and it's guys are already good at talking shit and fucking not liking each other but they're just women just take it to that extra fuckin level that shit talking and then the fact that they can beat the fuck out of you and then it's funny as a guy to be just watching it going like there is not one woman in this house that I could even get on the floor like these women would all just mop the floor with me there's a fucking hilarious YouTube video somebody tweeted it to me and I don't know it's just lost it in the ether it was this girl it just starts writing I was almost one of those six-second videos whatever the fucking kids call them and you knew this kid had a little bit of training and this girl had more training and she came at him and was like she climbed up his body like stepped on his fucking thigh and then was behind him and the video ends with him just grabbing like this is its rear naked goat you know he was out before he went the whole party just goes oh and it ends and I fucking died laughing but going like I wouldn't even have lasted as long is that kid dick cuz it seemed like he knew a little bit of defense a little bit of defense like I have a great Ronda Rousey bit of like what would be like the date her if she was actually physically abusive but I just can't do the pratfall I want to act like you know her big moves she does that fucking throw and you go over a hip right and just you fucking landing on the ground like in a relationship with they're all armbar real mature I know I doubt that doesn't mean cuz you're right broken and then she comes out you gotta knock down this stool to try to have something in between you and her I think it took like that probably has to date a fighter if I had to guess she probably has to date some guy who also knows how to do what she does I just couldn't imagine dude if I dated her I'd be on the kitchen like an apron just like maker of food and shit I just pretty give me look at me sideways fuck me up almost every female fighter does they all date fighters they just does just seems like you know a girl being in a position like that well she could just beat the fuck out of her boyfriend I don't think chicks like that that's I never looked at it that way because I always thought it was hilarious like I I I could date somebody like that I would think it was funny that they can kick the shit when my guy friends gave me shit I'd be like yeah met you kicked the shit out of me and you I think it's funny but like I never looked at it like because even though they're like like these lethal weapons now there is still there could possibly still I should say I want to speak for him that this female male relationship were that they still want the guy to be able to protect them yeah and it's just kind of like yeah dude that's funny because then they're just sort of rendering you useless because they're already making a zillion dollars so that was your um providing I can protect you do it I can kick your ass and then I can also have a kid so you're basically now like a 45 year old teenager a high chair you know what I know self-sustained unit I think it's fucking awesome what I like about watching female fights is that they're more reliant on technique because they don't have overwhelming physical strength like there's certain guys that have overwhelming physical strength and abilities let's plow through yeah they can just defect on that game yeah they can muscle things they can't they just hit really hard so sometimes they have like shitty technique they throw windmill punches but with a lot of women what you're getting is you use technique you can with my opponent given plenty of time to see it coming and let them know the kabocha are always coming from the same direction if you see the left that the next one's the right if you see the right dimensions yeah don't get tricky in your story this isn't Tarantino we're dancing here okay right but with checks there they're forced to use more tech meaning obviously there's there's a curve as far as like physical strength is like someone like Serena Williams it's obviously a very physically strong girl and there's other girls that are like not as physically strong you know she throw me over a couch and you know when you hit the window like sideways and then slide she's so land on the shoes impressive like her legs and the the strength that she has I was at I was at a party one time some agency I used to be and they also represented her and you forget your agency also represents you know athletes because they want to like fucking you know make money off of selling Doritos or whatever right and she was at the party with a basketball player so he was like you know so they were a portion couple like I felt like a dwarf dude like she was like just like it was totally gorgeous totally in proportion just like like super athlete Duke Marvel comic bodies that's like going like dude you you should be wearing a fucking cape it's just no and it's just you know you just see people like that and you just go like oh yeah that's why like you always sit the backi ahead as you're watching some quarterback that sucks gonna yeah what if I did some more situps what if I could throw against my body like fucking brett farr but not throw an interception and then you actually run into the real athletes dude I saw Joe Theismann who always looked like a little fella you know when he was out there he had the one little bar here he goes leg broken he just he always looked just so small when he was out there I saw the guy in like in a mall he's like 6 1 and like still jacked I'm like almost 510 I'm just going like this guy would fucking drop me how did he did he get his leg fix did they put bars in it and pins and shit like how did he get his legs fixed I imagine I am in contact with anybody at the hospital his career that was like my question yes it did that was the loser he watched he said I'm on time you said he watched the replay one time and that would that was it for him and and I actually when Silva broke his leg I think that reminded me of that that compound fracture like oh my god I can't even imagine the pain and then going into the shock and then the fact now he's coming back right Silva's yeah Genoa is too fine if you fucking sit there after you went through that and you just the first time you start throwing kicks with that leg again just like the level of whatever that is I don't have that anywhere in my life like if I ever fucking broke my leg like that doing stand-up that's it I would I would be I'd open a comedy club anymore he's at the end of his career he's got a few years left fighting and he has an opportunity to still make a lot of money and I think he's probably just gonna just make as much money as you can over the next few years and then get out now what what is the that that rumor that I hear that if you break a bone this is such a bob feels stronger heal stronger do sort of I mean it's less likely to break in the area where it broke it's less likely to break there gets knotted up and thick but not necessarily sure it gets just say thank you doctor Rogan and say why am I asking you these fucking questions I do know a lot about broken this is this is how I learn all of my shit asking people who don't have the job asking does ups get all those packages to everybody overnight if you ever have questions like that anyone answers ask Brian Cowen even if he doesn't know the answer he'll fucking keep going he will come up with something that's illogical just a little here insecurities of just not knowing the answer has to fucking answer the hill fucking argue about some shit he's not educated in at all I love but he also has a shitload of fuckin information is had Brian is like one of the best I've ever met at being able to pull quotes out of the air about books that he's read constantly he's right but yeah hang with him for one three minutes you realize he's out of his fucking mind everything I love him alone but he's out he's out of his fucking mind it's definitely crazy he's fuckin mind is going like a thousand rpms constantly always dude whenever I talk to him you just got to do the alley you lay against the ropes and just let all the information come at ya and then you get him with one and then you come back oh and by the way wait no we doin you got a pair of shoulders on you how we gonna do that bet you got a piece on you yeah a piece on you I went hunting with him it was five I mean I've done it three times now it was it's five days of gay jokes him selfish by not shutting up you really should be here people don't think I don't like him I love him I love I love him I just like thrashing him he knows what he does he that's part of his charm is that he likes to make fun of himself did he go up and talk to the bear and ask him what he's doing to get those back muscles he would like I gotta find out but we were for five days you think as I walked around on all fours and occasionally stood up I like a bear I'd be like a bear without all that hair five days every time it's just constantly the bryan callen show cuz you just wind him up he's just that guy he's always on he's never not fun like he's never I never called Bryan he's depressed you know I mean if he is depressed to be depressed for a couple minutes and then it'll just start talking about something you know start talking about his lean muscle mass or you know I always built for dance and I'll just go into something and then make sure you know you're laughing he just doesn't want that uncomfortable silence now he's like what's his face at the end of the Hulk Phil Bigsby yeah instead of walking away from the town those are his troubles do you know that the Hulk they check his warning I just want to keep thrashing him until people show him this clip so I get on his show again the they change the Hulk's name Lance by the way the piece of salt no that's from the the hippy warehouse you know these ideas these salt crystals lamps they're supposed to and somehow or another like generate positive ions and salt off I the air float through the air and make you feel better they change robert banner was bill Bixby's character's name on the hulk but the real the real name is Bruce Banner right but they changed it from Bruce to Robert for TV because they thought Bruce is a gaming Bruce row so you angry again don't get mad right god you know green last night was so embarrassing and you ruined your pants again how did briefs become a gaming it's like Bruce for the long the longest time was like you know Bruce I was gonna say Bruce Jenner but I guess that's a bad example now it was a good example a few years back do that guy what's going on is such a good-looking guy no no it was never anything wrong with his nose he's becoming a good-looking older lady though that's what's going on hey god bless him if it makes him happy exactly god bless them if you handsome happy I just I just thought just watching people fucking age badly no attack in their face yeah it's a weird thing that people do they get they want to change it and then they think when they change it it looks better it just looks different for the most how much of a hug do you need if you're staring at your throat in the mirror like sideways holding a mirror going I don't like my Adam's apple like I don't think I don't know man I'm gonna have Apple look I could pick out my Adam's apple and a fucking lineup I don't think I've ever looked at it I think his deal and I'm just guessing is that he's probably transitioning to being a woman if I had a guess I think I think that's a probably a pretty safe estimate at this point he's grown his hair long his nails are long he had his now do you think he'll come up with an original name or do you think he'll just just got fingernail polish on now man do you think he'll he'll okay he'll go with a new name like Brucie but yes I'm saying do you think he'll go hacky and just make his name effeminate like bill bill Erina no I bet he has a fucking full character that he becomes when he becomes one let me see my foot bring him back up bring him back those nails I mean first of all if this is fake second of us he looks like a Jennifer you think so I would say Claudia no I was gonna say he looks like a Claudia look at him he's got a cigarette who's in a row Jennifer so he's smoking cigarettes too yeah we all know gay people they're always smoking cigarettes that's what I think that looks at the light that's a pretty good picture of what he probably looks like you know he has like his lipstick on when no one's looking and he's talking I don't think that's bad he looks like you know he looks like a an older lead singer of a band yeah and they're doing the casino circuit well the two earrings too it's like he really ballin he seems to be coming a woman seems to be coming one good for him yeah I mean this is a good time to be a lady it's a good time to be a transgender woman - you know people are more accepting of it than ever before it's a good time but it's mean it should but should bother you it should not really should not it should not you know having said that I hate hit the color of his nail polish red is my favorite I feel like if you don't feel he's that you know he's that type I know that's too racy for I don't mind it he's an Olympic medalist what do you think you should have black go goth I think he needs an edge I think he's just a little too soft like it's got his hair blown out I wouldn't if I had to do a makeover okay less scarves less flowing shit and I yeah he needs an edge mint poor guy look at him he's wearing those visors this old lady tennis visors if you're not hunter s Thompson oh they don't say that Vegas on them take that fucking thing off that was the picture of absolute bliss though I think he wants to do it that's what he wants to do gutless yeah well listen he's been with those crazy bitches for so long he became one I mean that's really what it is I think it's a little more I think they tricked them Joe I think they could put you in that house and I don't think you're coming out looking like that imagine if I did imagine if it was proven that if you're an around women like that many women long enough they slowly but surely AB your masculinity away do you want to become a woman if it's proven that like we we imitate our atmosphere so much that one more around the opposite sex for too much well if you're one of those people that you uh what's that psychological word they say that you're a codependent mm-hmm and you know you gotta watch out who you hang out with there pretty soon you're doing what they're doing yeah the next thing you know you know there are people oh you want a pleated skirt you'd like some eggs probably starts with the uggs I think it starts two feet it starts two feet first head of cures and then you work your way up your body if you're easing into it yeah manicure people aren't gonna notice that one time I got a manicure really I fucking hated it did you get angry uh no I just I didn't like it you like it well I was on I was on the road with the Charlie Murphy and in donnell and it's acceptable in the amongst black guys to get you fucking nails done right it's like considered some pimp shit so like you got to do it so I'm literally sitting there next to Charlie like this with my hand in the thing and I'm levar bill Buddha's way to do it I know he was laughing too because I just kept saying this is the most effeminate fucking thing I've ever done forget about doing it with you who's just overloaded with testosterone so Charlie you need to do this so you don't windmill kick somebody I don't know I'm more in the middle I don't need to do this and I was on stage that night no I was just going like this I was self-conscious I got the I got the clear I got the clear finish and they were just like glistening yeah but then what sucks is then that starts to peel so then he does yeah this fucking scratch and then it looks gross did you try to prematurely aged it do you like maybe get some sandpaper yeah I was doing all I was yeah super homophobic I bought it fingers in the dirt like shit fisting the dirt yeah try to get the nail polish off now I found somebody with one of those gravel driveways is that fun is that really big thing in the african-american community getting your toes and nails done like this pictures of dudes like getting their toes done on the cellphone you know talking with this ya know it wasn't really his was his friends company but yeah he was a part of it ya know they they take being clean to a whole nother level and generally speaking some of them think white people are pretty filthy there's a trend MMA fighters for the longest time was getting their nails done like Chuck Liddell started out when that was thirty man Howard yeah pink and I thought it was to me that's fuckin funny cuz you can kick the shit out of somebody yeah that's it you made that Bruce Lee story what's that he used to walk around whatever the fuck he was from even going to the city and he would act all effeminate so people would fuck with them and then he beat the shit out of him and his friend would say why did you do that and he said because if I just kicked his ass he could get over it but if some effeminate guy kicked his ass that's gonna stay with him now I want that to be true I can give you the whatever the book is the Bruce Lee book is it has a red cover I can never remember the name it in a black-and-white photo and he's like this and just fucking shredded yeah he was across the hall the other Bruce Lee photos where he's like 20 pounds overweight sorry I would think that he would probably guy who would come up with a bunch of different real-life scenarios just to test his martial arts and to you know become an effeminate guy and have guys try to beat your ass it seems like a good move it's a bit of bad ass I think it's a smart move yeah because most people spend their lives right here avoiding physical confrontations it's like you know you know once once people really started gaining weight and fucking bloody noses and broke busted I saw as I tapped out I was like I I'm gonna tell some jokes if you the only way to really test it is to test it in a real-life situation there's a lot of people that look really good in the gym and then when it comes to an actual fight mm-hmm they just fall apart and panic they just can't do it I just think that you need that you gotta have a couple hundies that's like you know some drinks no you gotta you gotta have a couple of fights and he'll survive them yeah if you don't have a fight and if you ever you ever seen someone get in a fight that's never been in a fight before and go into a full panic no I think I've told the story before but it was at The Comedy Store we're sitting in the patio and there is this guy this black guy and a white guy they were fighting in front of the House of Blues and they yelling at each other and it turns physical and as it turns physical the white guy is in full-on fucking panic mode his eyes are closed and he's literally was this me flailing this way like this way like not moving his shoulders but his arms are like like he's boxing the guy's ears that's what he's doing right left right left I mean his hands are open meats just absolutely in a full panic and then a bus pulls in front of him and I don't get to see what the fuck happened the bus moves past the guys laid out flat out cold the black guy's nowhere to be found the white guy's fuckin dead stiff knocked out people are freaking out so obviously he got hit I have no idea what happened is this bad that's what they do this that's just of your face right terrible a Broadway it doesn't hurt your opponent about double time it's the good thing about it is you've been very ethical like you're not you're not harming your opponent you're involved in a physical altercation but you're not gonna do any damage that's one of the things you don't hurt your hands punch of somebody's scalp or you don't want to fuck up your manicure Snoop Dogg has his nails dead Wow he's gets French tips I guess different colors white black white black yeah okay he's Snoop Dogg you can do it remember when Tate used to do his nails they used to have colored nails that whole alpha nail polish thing those there's a lot of dummies that were doing that for a while they all got off of it Roger work I feel like that's the type of shit that like when you almost start dressing like a chick like you actually get more pussy like more women come in like that rock star thing that androgynous fucking look you start borrowing their clothes and they say no they're blowing you that's how I heard it with that well what's really funny is that in Hitler spread it like Judas Priest started a lot of the metal stuff Rob Halford you know although I am dressing yeah esterday I'm dressing and people didn't realize he was gay as fuck right yeah I had no idea Rob Halford was gay as fuck and he got all these guys to essentially dress like gay S&M guys yeah like that was what bring him the luck he's brilliant but that's so much of a bad motherfucker he is he made people instincts one of the great frontman out and then nothing to he he basically was completely 100% other than Freddie Mercury who was literally in a band called Queen and we're just so dumb like nice fine bro he's straight he sings good that's all don't be homophobic like it matters yeah the funny mark you mean that that fucking guy back that Live Aid set is one of the guy I would put that up against anybody's performance yeah ever well he was a bad mother fuck dude he turned Wembley Stadium into a fucking coffee house he had them everybody like the fucking back row mm-hmm yeah that guy was unbelievable yeah he was sensational he was a really unique talent like there was no one like him before because he was such a combination of like masculinity and femininity and experiment noticed any of that I was just like this fucking guy he can't stop watching them and it's is his singing was incredible and he was a better live as good as the album's worse one of the few guys that was actually fuckin better live I haven't seen anybody come close that guy Wow since wow that's a strong anybody Dober anybody you got anybody that could fucking hold a hundred thousand people in the palm is in after you had to follow all those other beasts you know it's true you had to go in after Robert Plant Jimmy Page that one didn't go well that was what that was one of the ones that didn't go out which is why 2007 went so well cuz they were like we can't do that again they put it together the last fucking second and then you had like they had two drummers at the same can you please whisper that my ear during my act you were the first guy to call me up you called me up and left a message about Zeppelin you called me I'd be like you're not gonna fucking believe this but devastating go on YouTube you know I'm gonna fucking believe this they stole everything they fucking did say that I was saying that they fucking this is think they're called the song remains the same and they was showing how many through there right now going going to trial yep on stairway to heaven and you call me about this many 8/2 me I still love John Bonham actually still love that music because I still have all because it is still great and I still pray and I have all those childhood memories of where I was when I when I was going on but like I'd you know it's like The Cosby think you just home it isn't true well with the Zeppelin thing to me it was still in a riff raping women with the cotton erodes the worst yeah the the the Cosby thing is very different obviously but the thing about Zeppelin that got me was that every band is influenced by every other band every band I mean they all you're going back to everybody who you're fans with and these guys that sound like guys because that was their music and I think as a lot of us is common for being influenced no one ever that suits rosemaling those my point re my point was but there's a certain line that you cross that they crossed where they were stealing riffs the opening to stairway to heaven it's like my god it's a sad thing they'll a legend it seems like selling me under the legend a legend legend every but it made me less it made me like them less I know the music is still amazing but it made me like the less that was that was devastating yeah but they're still well I have a bootleg of this and they of them at like the whiskey or something and they have a song called killing floor that sounds like the lemon song and then by the time it's out on Led Zeppelin too it's called the lemon song and then later they got sued for that by the guy who wrote killing floor so they it's not like they didn't know like that's what those things like dude you obviously knew that you were calling it killing floor is a cover and then you switch some of the lyrics and then called it the lemon song I don't know if this is to me this is just me is completely uneducated looking at this shit I just know that you know that just is a little suspect but just you know obviously I'm not a musician Sonny and I'm fucking I don't know I don't want it to be true I don't want it to be true either but that's the same thing as the Cosby stuff nobody wants I mean this I was reading this Chris Rock article it's a really interesting Chris Rock article where he's talking about people being offended by everything that's why it doesn't do colleges anymore because they're just looking to be offended at things and they're just too easy to offend but you know he was saying that he just doesn't want it to be true and I think everybody feels like that except the people that obviously were raped by him well they would want it not to be true because then they wouldn't be raped right so yes so like all of like yeah you don't want that to happen to somebody and then also this person that you you hold as a comedian you know yes we almost went to see him - we were gonna we were planning on taking a trip to Vegas I saw him earlier this year did you yep we're just seeing I saw Mountain Pasadena at a theater and I met him about a year and a half ago yeah I was fucking amazing where le it was amazing it was fucking amazing I was uh his set was amazing yeah everything yeah yeah when he went to go see the got me tell my guy you know yeah 77 years 76 every seven years old was excited about his new special and was like I tell you how I shot this thing and there's just animated so fucking excited about his new special I was just like to see a guy that far into it still that excited about stand-up like through like that gave me a charge for like weeks and you know so like I said hope it's not true yeah but I really hope it's not true for the victims more so than him but you just focusing on him though but if you're doing that then the victims are crazy lodgers alleged you know that's better to be a crazy person to be a crazy liar than to be a rape victim they were to being raped by Bill Cosby this new one's interesting because the girl said says she was 15 and he he took her to the Playboy Mansion and alleged allegedly but when you go to the Playboy Mansion they have your name on records like every person that goes there has to put their name down and all their information down so there might be actual proof that she was 15 and he took her to the Playboy Mansion we right now sound like one of those bad news programs might be we might have some information later so hang around for that but like not belittle in the point where but that's just his fuckin brutal it's crazy that this all happened out of Hannibal Buress is joke like him talking about it on stage know somebody filming the person who put it up should be getting credit cuz Hannibal didn't do that and he shouldn't be getting the grief either it was a fucking great joke it's a funny joke yeah it's a joke yeah then it became funny bit possible fact I actually felt bad for him because I don't think he wanted that I think you know I think was just telling her joke it dude if some of this shit you know that's all of that shit is taken out of court like everything like these fucking people who take your shit they do the same thing that a news like a a biased news channel or like a political ad will do like I did this rant making fun of Cubs fans versus White Sox fans and the reason why I did it was because recently Chicago had beaten a Boston team and all I wanted to do was cause infighting okay I believe a fucking word of it and ice and I went on this whole thing and then I paused and in the end I said I'm just fucking with you guys I'm just America's blah blah blah they locked that part off and now it's just a standalone piece that I'm shitting all over Cubs fans and I'm defending White Sox fans and it was funny was I took a wild guess and I actually people look dude it's just like fucking dead-on this is exactly why I didn't know that but but the point of it is is that they went up there and they they deliberately lopped off the thing where I say it's just a joke so so there's that and I got a special this Friday man you really tried to fucking be interested in that dumb story for the whole time you just all you had now is just went that's a story bill I don't know where to go with that man no I'm thinking about this culture of trying to catch people doing things like that and you know and get upset at them especially when it's clearly a joke man I had a whole bit in my act about the difference between jokes that you say on stage like being in court and giving fucking affidavit like I was I have a whole bit and my last special about lying I'm like I lie on stage all the time like if you watch any of my act and you go I don't know I don't see things the way this guy I don't either I don't see these things the way I see I'm talking about around yeah I'll say shit that I don't believe in if it's funny and that's I think part of what Chris Rock was saying is that people are getting offended yeah I think comic comics should apologize unless they actually meant it in the malicious way that the person took it like if you you know you can go onstage in a bad mood you can deliberately get in and someone can heckle you or do something and then you get mad and you deliberately try to fucking piss them off and you know you might owe somebody an apology then but you don't go on TV and fucking apologize to the country people are doing it because they're scared they don't want to lose their careers then they they also they people have demanded an apology you want that's not true you know you have a career a great career but the thing is as of yet I do not have a TV show once you get her off without it that's when better off without it fuck you you went to the animated show that I'm doing comes out dude wait you wait what you're doing great stand-up though yeah I'm just saying but the animated thing he was the perfect way to go into Ravi because you can get away with anything yeah because you can't you're not gonna offend anybody with these animated people like is what what message is this gonna send two animated children you know what I mean what about all the three fingered fucking yellow headed people out there are they gonna what are they gonna think that it just pissed off agents no got hurt no yellow headed as long as they like square heads like yeah I was thinking Simpsons now someone will lop we'll cut it off there and just like yeah what are you gonna do you you're always whenever you say anything on stage that's controversial you're always gonna open yourself up to opportunistic people they just want clickbait there's no such thing as controversy in stand-up comedy there's no such thing it is is manufactured controversy it's all complete horseshit it's one person in the crowd the amount of times that they have showed clips of comics who said something controversial you literally hear the crowd laughing on the fucking tape everybody's laughing taking it as a joke and one fucking person and then you know and then you just take it out of context which is out of the comedy club I mean I'm trying to think of a joke any of my jokes that I could do on the news that wouldn't seem like you know I'm doing this bit about Isis how they're not a threat and I'd like to see them try to invade Florida where silences are legal and see how far they fucking get now that's silly and ridiculous and funny in a comedy club you then put that on Fox News bilberry says Isis is not real and we're not over there to get the tape Alfredo well what about the soldiers leg time and we return the controversial tape will be played what about the soldiers that died we have a soldier here from Florida that actually confronted Isis when we return he listens to what bill said and then after that show Nancy Grace will pick it up on the next hour bill burr the stand-up comedian you might have seen him on such shows as Breaking Bad bad I'm gonna go out on a limb and say she's a hot-shit if you went out and drank with her do you think she would just laugh Vic that's a fucking show do you think she's just being well she was a promise my face hurts to pretend to be that mad every episode I love coming out here and smoking a little weed and fucking getting up relax my eyebrows I eat Twinkies I really I get foot massages no I think she would be fun as hell to hang out with and actually get into an argument with it's just she makes unfortunate faces on TV I think she's probably exactly like she comes off on TV I bet that's her you tell me right now you me in Nancy Grace driving to Vegas we wouldn't be laughing our fuckin asses off you and I would be laughing our asses off but it probably with her prick I I would buy the Inland Empire she would loosen up you think so yeah we shut off our cell phones you're not being recorded just fucking I was held hostage by profanity show she but she'd have a good time theyíre raped me for four hours now this is what you do like Nancy what fucking guest what's the worst guest you ever had you just wanted to reach through the screen and punch him in the face then she'd be telling a funny story then we'd be in that's it we begin you'd ask her about the Duke Lacrosse case whether she was unfairly accusing them of something they didn't do I don't watch the show but it's funny about her she looks like Ozzy Osbourne in like 1985 during that ultimate sin tour like when she wears the black eyeliner sometimes I literally a better-looking aussie of course well a more dainty as a less feminine what Bruce Jenner asked less hard road yes America in trouble the youth of today today yeah you know I saw something I don't know why this reminded me of although I think shaving down your Adam's apple was I was thinking of I actually I don't know sometimes I started talking about torture or some shit I'm on my podcast and someone was showing the devices you know the rack the rack would they would they've been healing they tie your legs and they would crank it okay and these guys did an experiment was what gave way was it your tendons or whatever you know what it was they actually discovered it was the bone Oh God home fuckin broke or pulled away they they put like it was the creepiest thing ever where they were just like this is a pig's ankle which is the closest to a human's ankle at which point you're sitting home gone okay like if they said it was a yak like I would argue I have no fuckin idea so they put this thing on there and they start they type this little hoof with part of its knee saying it was just as much like the knee you got to see this thing and they start cranking this thing and you're hearing it every time it gave way you're heard a noise they would do an x-ray and you know these fucking scientists are so this is interesting this is interesting the patella is still there and the as you see the medial Carl fucking whatever they held but what we're seeing is we're seeing a stress in the actual femur which would be a femur and they fucking kept doing it and what what gave way it was I guess I was the slowness of it that made the bone break and not the fucking tendons where if you just get hit quick or something like that the tennis you know I'm so fucking stupid I can't remember what they came conclusion with but it actually broke your fucking bones oh it's amazing what inventions people came up with just to fuck you up more like to make you more in pain while they were killing you I said the two things that I've ever seen there's very few actually maybe cats monkeys and human beings the Mosel cats so much it was breaking my bones the most sadistic like cats the way they catch a mouse and then if I could let the thing get away and then get it and give it hope and take it away you get the death penalty that's like somebody begging for their fucking life right yeah I saw this video one time this chimpanzee like you know basically in the last 1012 years they've discovered that like chimpanzees like the occasional steak and want to eat another monkey because they thought that they were vegetarians so this fucking monkey trapped this small it's chimpanzee trapped his smaller one and he's basically standing on the fucking thing up in a tree and rather than just snapping its fucking neck it's taking its finger and its thumb and just digging flesh out of its fucking back and eating it as the monkey is underneath it just screaming yeah bloody fucking murder and you just sit and I guys dude I fired a gun I would have blown that thing's fucking brains out just out of principle I've seen that right yeah I've seen that video I've seen a bunch of those videos with chimps they like to looking hate chimpanzee should they're scary animals they definitely should be respected but they like to eat the organs first they eat them while they're alive grab the apparently the organs the most delicious part to them so while they're holding on to the monkeys they're not trying to kill them first they're just trying to go right to the guts and start eating oh dude it's just getting back so you get back to the rack like how could you fuckin agony you're putting somebody through I couldn't do that I couldn't do that to somebody don't you think it was that was during the time when first of all people died like way way quicker like people didn't live very long they live to be like if you were lucky you got fifty years in holy shit that guy lived to be 50 most of the infant mortality rate was really high their constant war war was at close range so war involved like swords and arrows and you think about shots yeah the kind of fuck Catalan does fucking flaming bodies you know these two literally light bodies on fire because human fat is like a good way of lighting buildings on fire because it's so disgusting so when they would light us on fire they would like human body's on fire launcher and catapults what the roof kill them first yeah probably maybe well whatever they wanted to do a green way to attack somebody sure people we people what you were saying where they just gonna use all the fucking fuel to figure out a way to just have no waste we use the waste and it becomes fuel but that kind of life where you're you know you're subject to violence and and brutality on a regular basis but were they was that like in series well the movies they only show the wars they don't just show that when I hanging out playing like a flute you know what I think there was probably a lot of war going on pretty much all throughout human history I just feel like you could hide so much easier back there in the woods yeah just what's yeah here I'm coming yes you hear the floor fucking moving you're kind of horse back there you have to figure out a way to get away from the Wolves yeah but you weren't going down to Whole Foods you will hunt your own food you were self-sufficient right but you had to have your bow and arrow and all that stuff you like to be close to town have a fucking blacksmith nearby looking you out there in the woods by yourself probably pretty pretty hardscrabble life no absolutely but you know something anything that's gonna kill out you kill it kill you I was thinking shoot at you and kill you kill at you anything that's gonna kill you out there it's gonna be all quick like a tune if a mountain lion ever fucking ran at me I'd fucking just give him the neck get it over with them I've gotten scratched by a fucking house cat you think I want to fucking fuck with you god damn 140 pound cat and proportionate like they're there as far as like the strongest house cats or the strongest cats its house cats or with some of the strongest pound-for-pound and mountain lions like right up there with them stronger even than like some other cats that are terrifying but they fight off bears go into my YouTube video watching who's doing all the animals shit now is it animal plan is that where discovery just went all cars like they don't fucking do anything anymore discovery yeah yeah animals anymore well there's a lot of shows like TLC used to be the Learning Channel what do they do now reality that's all reality it's a history jubu that's TLC's honey boo boo you know what happened History Channel they say they just ran out of war footage they just got we got nothing and then they had to show like nothing is interesting to anybody anymore unless this footage check I hate it when they would like even like some of the civil war shit they would have to reenact it because before remember when we were kids they would just have drawings of it and they would sort of pan the camera across from it and it would put you to sleep yeah and then World War two was the shit cuz they were just showing planes getting shot down and all of that you know it's like a movie they had History Channel had like a lot of Nazi shows they had a bunch of those and then I think after a while they just realized there's more money in idiots this is more money in just reality TV it's just a certainly become a network well I mean what I think happened was a bunch of people were watching reality and weren't watching their shows on the rise of the 3rd our Reich whatever in the night of the Long Knives or whatever the fuck then just no one cared anymore and then just like all right if that's what you want they have shit on like ancient aliens like they have I mean they're how many episodes of ancient aliens have they done I totally believe in aliens but I don't think anybody has figured out a way to travel from planet to planet brilliant and actually live I think it's possible but I think nice way to invest I think eventually we could figure it out but we're gonna destroy each other first and I think everything kind of you destroy yourselves that's God's I think fucking checks and balances alright I made this thing smart enough to figure out how to get over to this other pot of people that I made but they got jealousy and envy and I want credit and I want a producer credit on your fucking rocket ship and all that shit and like they're all gonna destroy each other first like we'll destroy before we figure even know how to get to fucking Mars on Vice but what are you gonna do first of all how do you how do you have enough air to get their air like in the like oxygen like something that generates oxygen you'd have to have something that processes carbon dioxide generates oxygen the harder thing would be you could you could probably anything's gonna last so I guess the question is little plants do that right is that what plants do but that's gonna last all the way to Mars mmm six months it's got the last six months yeah you think it takes six months to get to Mars thinks else was sad I think they're saying it takes six months no it doesn't I mean think about how far the moon is the moon No this shit no it takes six months to get tomorrow that's not how long do you think it'll take fucking years no I'm pretty sure it's six months let's see how many months to get to Mars he's got a creepy tone right now pretty sure it's six months well I could be wrong - that was very self-deprecating it's possible precise six to eight months because perfectly circular but that's like a just a drone though to actually get a porno for this refer a person this is for a person they're talking about the manned space travel to Mars mission where they're actually gonna have to stay there which is really fucked up these people are gonna it's gonna take about six months to get there do you realize the fucking balls that that takes unbelievable I'm going to another fucking plan forever and what once you break the Earth's gravitational pull what is stopping you from missing Mars when that fucker comes around calculations I know that but I'm saying if those things are off yeah they never are though Jerry speed up speed up [Music] what's the next one Saturn Jupiter they're pretty good if they you're Venus Mars Jupiter Saturn yeah Neptune Uranus Uranus Pluto they're bringing it back no where'd you hear that I heard recently that they're considering bringing it back as a planet did you hear that or see that on a website this is how they should promote that they should have like the one they bring Pluto back they should have the scientists dressed in like bell-bottoms and shit with like the dafuq and Travolta think you know like they bring it back like disco assumption of God no no it's to one the fucking note to other those you know what I hate you know what I hate you know you know a joke right a room is a guy that's a hat on a hat it's a hat on a hat when you have like a joke within a joke right like it's like say say whatever the joke is you fall off the fucking chair and then you want to add another layer to it they go that's that's a a hat and it's just like so what if it's still but they don't understand like taglines if it's still funny if it's funny still it's funny but if it's not funny it's not funny how come I can't look at the other fucking hat the next time I watch it cuz I didn't even notice it if you have a hat on a hand the hats funny it's funny that's what I think yeah I think like they're acting like funny plus funny equals not funny I think how does that how does that work I think that's just a lack of it's just the the the different mentality that a comic has versus and there's definitely like a place you can go where it's not funny anymore or you've added too many jokes or you ruin the original joke but I think writers have a different perspective ya know granted they write for a living and I don't really yeah but there I just think their perspective is a scene as opposed to your perspective which is like stand-up you know looking at it stand-up wise like this is gonna yeah I just think it's fucking funny yeah they're I think as many layers as you can add to it it just keeps getting funnier and then if people don't even get it that's fucking funny like why would you even why would you fucking sit there and make that goddamn rule I mean I guess you know I'm going against all these successful shows whatever yeah I just think there's a different style of writing too don't you think there's a different style the way like you write for stand-up and the way you write or you would write for a television show it's just a different kind of writing I barely know what I'm talking about ever so I just maybe I'm just frustrated pitching jokes and then somebody going there that's a hat on a hat I like a hat on a hat well see that's why I'm telling you a guy like you your best shit is you just being you without anybody that you have to pitch it to cuz you know use a very a year from now when I show up with the six episodes of f is for funny I think you can you're gonna have yeah but you're talking about a cartoon I'm always 100% sorry doing little my fucking I love it animated whatever you call it it's a cartoon like if you look at like the most innovative dangerous comedy on TV ever it's out park because they can get away with I know those guys that they've done the best social commentary for like 17 years they don't get the credit they deserve yeah not even close they're animals they're the best they're and they're they're so innovative they're just constantly coming up with new shit every genius is the for their social commentary is because how simplistic the animation is yeah that those guys are like but they can just turn them out but like how finished and polished it is yeah as a brand new joke coming right out of the gate the first time they era where they just they just fucking nail it yeah I think it's good you know they're for whatever reason I feel like they're gonna have to do it for 30 years and then tell people that they're leaving before they're finally gonna just acknowledge you know they're gonna get that the fucking Mark Twain Award and all that stupid shit that you're supposed to get well they get acknowledgment just by everybody loving them I mean this show is the leads have pretty much total autonomy over a Comedy Central they kind of get away with whatever they want and they can they could pull off shit on their show that no one could ever pull off on another shot just don't think people get me enough credit no I'm not gonna change it argument chill I'm with you I don't think they give me enough credit either but either way they can do so much because it's a cartoon and their characters never get old didn't have to worry about the character like JJ from good times that shit wouldn't have been funny if he was 80 you know how this stuff is dynomite we shut the fuck up like what are you talking about yeah nothing uh JJ from good times we're gonna pull that one out of my well now that you brought up South Park I don't think it's gonna be that funny but I think it's gonna be amusing consuming amusing show your show yes what's it based on childhood stories oh your childhood stories yeah well basically everyone in the writers room at that point oh so I just got sick of people groaning about my childhood stories comedy I was like well what if I fucking animate them now what are you grown it animated okay yeah it's fucking annoying why are you going in the appleís bill it's no it's fucking annoying that should be sure that you sell I know I watched that story that you told last time you're in the podcast about the guy next to you on the airplane oh yeah question you work on Indianapolis what's that my friend most fun I ever had on a flight he said I'm gonna push this button and as we're taxiing down taxing over to where we're gonna take off and I was I was just uh let's see what happens and he was sitting there reaching for the fucking thing and I'm just sitting there like let's see let's see what happens okay I push the button so this um this animated show that you wrote who did you do it with did you do it all by yourself or did you know bring somebody with Mike Price from The Simpsons oh great yeah it was just a fucking force mm-hmm and he put up he put together this murderers row of a writing room and then the produced the production company is Wild West which is Vince Vaughn's company and that's how the whole thing like I was just going to make a little five-minute vignettes and put them on my website and then I don't know what happened I type I Steve burn I opened for him or something like that we were working together some shit and Vince was there saw me act wanted to see me hey come in and take it general and I had no idea no ideas no nothing and it was lit I just took a general like we like you if you ever have anything you know Bob the general meeting yeah yeah general mean yeah and I was just walking out and as I walked out it was like you know I kind of got this idea for a cartoon and they wanted to do when they wait a minute sit down and three fucking years later wow we are one year away from it coming out and it just works slowly in the the what is the heart nobody was didn't want nobody wanted the idea and everything and the whole thing was dead in the water and then Vince was the guy was like let's go over to Netflix and even that guy's an animal man he's in there and the fucking pitch meeting selling this fucking thing and and then Netflix was like ridiculously supported they're like you don't do whatever you want Netflix are wild push it further push it further yeah do you see the ad for Marco Polo Marco Polo's a new series of that Netflix is doing on Marco Polo and Genghis Khan's like this huge fucking epic series that they're doing though they have the orange is the new black there's doing stand-up comedy specials like they're becoming like a real legitimate network before they'll be on that because they're international and they are so ahead of the game that all you're gonna see is just people trying to rip off their business model is what's gonna happen you know it's the usual thing like what are these guys don't know they're not gonna fucking blah blah blah no son okay all right and then you know next you know you become the person yeah and then everybody's like oh that's the way you do it monkey see monkey do and then I just think people will try to rip off what they're gonna do but they they're at the you know they're on point yeah so they're cutting their way through the jungle so they're still gonna be out in front of everybody so I think it's gonna be very hard for I don't know maybe the fourth person who tries to rip it off there might be room for two other people to try to rip off what they're doing you don't I mean then you have like three like ABC NBC CBS of international television well what they're doing that's unique is that they're taking the money and they're making their own shit that's the big thing and they're they've been doing it for I did my comedy special with them in 2005 that was originally on Netflix and then it got sold to Showtime but they were even back then I mean that's nine fucking years ago they were taking chances in funding comedy specials and now they're doing real originals that Kevin Spacey show that house of cards you know they're doing horseman yeah killing it and your show they're doing a lot of chelsea peretti her stand-up is on netflix or a new show I think Chelsea Handler doesn't she have like a whole yeah she left her talk show as far as I know on e party to go to a talk show on Netflix left the E Network yeah go to Netflix that's like that would not she I'm Alice speak for her but I don't think that move gets made two three years ago how quickly it changes yes wait a minute but I'm on I want television she's got so much fucking money though she probably doesn't give a fuck you know I mean she she's going to make that much money on yeah yeah she's right well she's also it's not just that it's books you saw a lot of books you know she's in that stage to where she has like this giant amount of fans that could just follow her anywhere she goes yeah I don't know how that works I don't get like how do you like how do you have a TV show and write a fucking book I don't know and do stand-up yeah I mean she does she does a lot of shit she's just constantly working yeah that's I'm never gonna be that busy I couldn't handle it yeah I'm too busy right now I think there's a certain level of busy where you're just like you can coast you can't like keep it keep the fire burn at a certain temperature certain rpms but it goes up and down when it goes I think just having a TV show and trying to keep that thing on the rails and have to just prevent someone from coming in and fucking it up yeah would be would be hard enough that's a big thing preventing someone from coming in and fucking it up right cuz that's a real issue someone could definitely come and fuck it up yeah cuz they want credit yeah I got it they get you have to implement something that I said okay that's all negative shit I want to go whitewash all that no no doesn't happen to me but I just I don't want to get into it's our old fucking conversation that yeah everybody knows it that's that's what happens in every fucking business you know look at the Geek Squad that was a great thing and then Best Buy was like during a party without us and then they fucking absorbed it nobody uses it anymore squad before specify it was just a bunch of nerds who would fucking like uber they said they run around fixing your computers and they dress like nerds like with the black ties and the white fucking and then just say sure and then they bought them and I've never seen it was cool they showed up it was funny they were like embracing being nerds it's like 10 years ago they had the I have meant fucking glasses and they came over and they just fixed your shit and it kind of had like this spy vibe to it geek squad and they showed up dressed like nerds but also kind of like a little Pulp Fiction esque except without the jacket and it was was fucking cold I wasn't aware of them back then and then you know they drove around in little Beatles did we you're aware of them yeah before best my bottom yeah I wasn't use that right now my fucking laptop died what happened do you use a Mac laptop are you one of those I gets frustrated honestly I got frustrated and I slammed it shut was it a Apple laptop or a Windows laptop Apple see I would think of you might be one of those guys that goes you know what I'm fucking sick all this Apple shit everybody uses Apple I'm gonna go Windows I don't see me being like I know what I do is I just I keep computers forever and I keep iPhones forever I'm always at least two numbers behind whatever everybody else has why do you do that because when I say hello the person can hear me what does that mean it means I don't need a new fucking phone oh okay so I can already take video I don't even need the many days no this glorious screen look how beautiful look how big that stupid-ass fucking thing is oh how dare you first of all first of all how dare you second of all the camera on this thing is fucking substitude you got to see the new camera on the iPhone 6 that's what I'm saying when I point that at my dick dude you can see the helmets great goddamn picture a picture of Joey Diaz it's great it's great goddamn picture it's too clear it's fantastically clear look how good that is yeah Joey does not look like that in real life technology has gone beyond what you've seen but young Bill burr he does think like that huh he does look like that I'm just you just try to talk you out of you phone you obviously love it there you you made me feel bad about my purchase I'm happy for you bill I remember like a couple years ago you were still using MapQuest you still use MapQuest or do you know I used I use the one that's on that that thing but the the one that's on you know I mean you know what I hate I hate like the fucking recycled jokes on the internet and people like someone would be like was this film with a potato for like the nine millionth time you're gonna write that and be like can you just pick a different vegetable can you try to eat a little bit original I do not believe I've ever heard someone ask you I know you had on with a potato yeah it's fucking it's like this Reese I wait what like those fucking James said no one ever it's like he's fucking like it's like Mad Libs that's true said no one ever is yeah pretty common but effective if used properly like I reserve the right to you said no one ever if I'd fucking have to if it's right there I gotta admit I I would I would definitely you drop a few notches I would drop if she watches in your estimation I'm not from I'm looking to drop a few matches from the stratosphere that I have you I like to build myself back up I had to fail or nah once you drop a certain point you're dead to me you say I'll take that into consideration like wait what we said no one ever within two hours if I got two of those tweets from you I would well when people say really stupid shit I don't like cocky comedy including all the people who now gonna watch this and then tweet that to me and they just think it's absolutely fucking genius not realized that like 9000 people had the exact same idea that water cooler jokes you know those fucking just right yeah you know me you know let the shit that Colin Quinn makes fun of those fucking hats he's the best at because people don't even know he's joke and like you know like one of the beautiful things about knowing Colin and then knowing his tweets is that some people are eating his tweets and they might not get it at all they might think do you member the Colin Quinn show he had on NBC he had one of the greatest fucking sketches and it was like it was so much fun it was like office humor and I remember Bobby Kelley's was the funniest one it was the hi-5 guy at the office and Bobby just comes walking by it's like dude got that new jet ski and he fucking like just puts his hand up and you have to high-five and fuck even the way he high-fived was hilarious mine was somehow I went up to Greer Barnes Nutt Greer Barnes I went up to Godfrey and and and said some really white shit to him as Greer Barnes was standing and delivering a package like dude yeah he took a recommendation something like gods for God's Birds Park was hilarious some really stupid white movie and then Greer sitting there looking at God filled like he was a fucking salad or whatever I'm totally butchering this but it just totally tapped into like when you work in those fucking offices the amount of like this like six jokes and they all just keep telling them that was in not like those are the only jokes but there's like six jokes that you can just always get count on a tonic for up for a laugh what was that was on NBC right for how many episodes had Collins show last it was sort of a season right only one season like success yeah it was like we're liking it it was like what tough it was just on our on network it was what what tough crowd became cuz he also had this thing where Patrice and Norton and all them will be sitting down and just in different areas it was actually shot really cool and they would just be talking about topic so he having a live thing he had these sketches thing was a fucking great show it's a great show he's a funny dude man I when I did tough crowd I got to see him warm the crowd up you know he does stand-up before it and I was like I forgot how fucking funny Colin Quinn is he's really fucking funny really good yeah the best was when he first got on Twitter if you followed him early and and nobody knew what the fuck he was doing are you doing gang signs over there no I was doing three episodes when he first got on Twitter and and so many people didn't know what he was doing it was so fucking funny they still don't know still though that was such an underrated ban it's just a shame they never had a hit all capitals but you know when you do that you're trolling like dumb high school kids I mean I think a lot of adults were were falling for that too and when he would talk about how famous he is and how fuck somebody stepped down in something like I know he always he's always good for a fucking he's a funny fucking comic man yeah like watching him do stand-up like you really have to appreciate it I think even live he's one of those guys you really want to see alive like when you see him like even in film it's like you're missing something you're missing some half half of a canard yeah and he's amazing that show should never been canceled if they're smart they'd bring back tough crowd tough crowd was a fucking great idea it was our great show you're speaking of that how weird is it there's two shows that have come back that is the come back came back with the Kudrow yeah great show was just sort of ahead of its time but the weirdest fucking thing I ever saw was when our CEO show came back dude he came back with the same fucking haircut maybe look 10 days older and then had the same guess it was just it was like 20 years never went by it was it was like it's only one of the few times I ever wish that I did like hallucinogens it was blowing my mind it blew my fucking mind he had I think he had like Daesan or Eddie or somebody and it was just like I felt like I was like 24 again and I was just starting out as a comic when I used to watch it going about if I get to do stand-up on this how am I gonna how am I gonna ever how am I gonna cross over to this crowd and you know I don't know it was just bizarre they took over his social media accounts when they did that show like he stood Arsenio he's like because he was being too edgy no no that's what they do that's what they do now on a lot of shows they demand to take over your social media and they start tweeting for you how crazy is that that's I told me signing over power of attorney in like an exact cyberspace kind of way exactly they're like signing their name your name and he was trying to get his facebook back and his Twitter back and I was like what he was telling me he was telling me this at the Icehouse I was like yeah be fucking kidding me they made you he goes I didn't want to initially but I said you know what I'm gonna be so busy with the show if I can't let them do it now I'm trying to get it back like oh my god they just take over your account yeah but if you let him you just say no exactly no but you gotta be willing to say no and they it might be a deal breaker he's Arsenio go fuck yourself yeah but came to me yeah but they you know if they're thinking that people want to they want to be ball players you know hey you know we're willing to work with you like wanna make no shit that's a su thing they don't wanna get sued by you saying something fuckin nuts and then it maybe if you read the guys interviews our seniors interviews are always great cuz he doesn't give a shit and he just kind of says what he's saying so they're looking at my cousin yes says wild shit yeah well I mean oh I know I just he's honest which does not work when you gotta sell toothpaste and fucking cars and all that shit in between the comedy so I think that that's that's why look having never gotten a show on the air gel this is what I feel is going on behind the scenes what McGuire you know Chris McGuire was the head writer oh yeah he was the head writer over there so he you know he told me was a struggle from the beginning but it was also that they were trying to do the same show or trying to do the exact same show that they did in the 1990s which is really strange cuz I've seen he was a likable guy I mean people loved them it seems like if you found the right vehicle for him he would be a great talk-show host people he's genuinely friendly likeable guy yeah yeah I mean like I said it was it looked like the exact same fucking show and I felt like did I just like Miss that this thing was still going on and then he had all these guests from back then I think that that like I think the whole thing could uh I don't know if he I don't know I don't I just want to just saw when I would put it on when it first started maybe he just did that the first week no no he kept doing it he kept doing yeah they kind of that's what they did I mean it might have altered a little bit but that was essentially a show it's hard to do those fucking shows man I could never I can have a host a talk show no fucking way you don't get to choose your guests you know like people equate a podcast to a talk show sometimes but the thing about a podcast is you know I I like you like I want I wanted to talk to you today I texted you man like you man but you know I'm saying like I don't have to pretend it's like if you were some guy that I didn't know that was in here that was pitching something I didn't give a fuck about but the network my stories are dying and then you got to save them although those are the worst right and so we'd have to jump in well I feel I feel bad for when I see a talk show host and has a guest where they're off or they're in there stories aren't working because you see and you see him like glancing down at the card and then they got a like Letterman's the best they got because they'll just openly mock the situation it'll just openly mock you if it goes wrong like that oh just let you sit in it gonna okay yeah do you remember Bill Hicks bit on Leno oh the Dorito thing yeah well the whole thing about having Joey Lawrence on the show and asking Joey Lawrence if he has a girlfriend oh yeah yeah you know and enjoys his no well yes well she thinks so who who who pulls a gun out of his drawer and fucking blows his brains out and this his brain splatter on the wall in the form of an NBC Peacock because he's a company man to the bitter end Jesus dude that was word-for-word no I did I forgot all the part about him changing clips oh yeah he pulls out an Uzi and he stuck out an Uzi spraying bullets through his head and he'd change his clips and it's fucking hard gig Leno loves doing that show that he does now because of that he does that car show online Jays garage I watch I go in that all the time great yeah fucking car collection is insane business and it's all like he's got great taste in cars and he's got these fucking cars like those ones we got like two shifters and shit goggles on he had won a car recently that cost forget it I got obsessed with it if you want to look it up he did it was an early 70s Datsun I think 510 and they're just the coolest fucking cars if you if you put like a new engine in the suspension and everything cuz it's like it's like the classic American sedan but the miniature like Asian version of them uh-huh and let's see it can you get a picture of it before I just stammered in to a fucking complete black hole here in this thing that's the car so they just fucking badass car man oh so they did like a resto a resto mod version of an old it's an old Datsun if I got Datsun 510 or something like that dude he's got that little fucking the Hurst shifter on it man it just looks so much fucking fun to drive cuz my brother had a the smoothest shifting car ever drove here like an 81 Toyota Tercel and when you were changing gears in that fucker they it just was like butter and it was this piece of shit and it was I just couldn't understand that was that was a really bad time for American cars where they were deliberately making him to shit the bed it's sixty thousand miles so you would get this perpetual car payment at least that's the conspiracy theory of it and all of these fucking Toyota cars that do remember that when they started coming out and the speedometer only went up to 80 miles an hour yeah and every way to speed I know all the gas crisis and all that in the Mustang became the Mustang - yeah became a car like Farrah Fawcett drove on Charlie's Angels it was such a hunk of shit it went from being one of the most badass American muscle cars ever to it just a total plastic shitty shape ugly they made him ugly - within like five to seven years it became just an absolute and all of it there was so many of those held over like muscle car names that just became like a shell of themselves yeah like the Cougar and it becoming this big fat ass yeah fucking - door like sedan like was sort of a poor man's like Lincoln Continental or something but when everybody is his collection of cars it's just far it's fucking incredible and just his knowledge of them that's really cool well he's really passionate about it it just shows you when you get a guy doing something that he actually likes to do like Jay Leno loves cars it becomes an amazing show when you have him hosted tonight's show you like he doesn't give a fuck about Joey Lawrence's TV show he doesn't yes I looked at it like he's he's trying to you know make it some money yeah and he's gonna go buy some cars now when I was a younger comic I used to judge him and be Lowe's focus you know back when I thought I was you know I should be wearing a leather jacket on stage you know like I was saying anything but now that I've gotten old I'm like that fuck he's doing his show the way he wants to do his show and then he wants to go buy some cars yeah he wanted to make some money made some money did apparently the the word has always been that he doesn't even spend his Tonight Show money that he spends only a stand-up comedy money that's where it gets all everything and then The Tonight Show money all just went into the bank can you imagine the dollar collapses what Castro got all that money like I don't understand having that all in the bank when you're your account is insured up to like fucking to 300 grand yeah it's not smart and then it's also it is until it isn't well who knows what all in the bank means might have investments he might have put it in bonds and mutual and all that shit you got it converted what into cash gold stuff it in your fucking walls and then just some of it in gold and they just got to pray dude I haven't all of that fucking money and trying to not what was that book you read when you were in like fifth grade about the guy who catches the big fish and then he's bringing it into this industry is just left with the skeleton that's what it's like having a ton of fucking cash everybody's just gonna fuckin descend on you you know you're counting bills all of a sudden two plus two equals four is way much fucking more difficult they gotta charge you nine million dollars more for your fucking taxes why why because I have it it was I mean yeah that's what they do and all of a sudden everything becomes a big fucking problem so you just advocate spending at all as soon as if I advocate getting to a certain level of success getting a machete in a pit bull and sitting on your cash yeah but right laid out in the living room you just sit on a mound of it you order food have it delivered and have it delivered you never leave he'll bills off the pile or I have no my my whatever invest society going to shit my my plan is I just embrace the fact that you can only kill me once that's it I'm going I'm not gonna survive that I'm hope but what if it's like Groundhog Day keep dying like that new Tom Cruise movie the edge of tomorrow we dies over no spoiler alert well then I would just get a gun and then I would just walk around like this and I wait for the awful death to come and then I go like that oh I like how you thought this through over me a lot of really good points you know I had learned it buying it buying an old house yeah we're gonna be the guy who lays in a shallow grave and waits for people to attack your food supply then you sit up like a zombie me no I'll be more clever than that I'll probably set up a fake civilization and then be outside of that civilization in the real civilization like so people come in to raid and then fucking launch down on them easy just works what I'm saying yes just works listen I I've planned this out know if the shit hits the fan I hope I'm where the fan explodes well that's what I think yeah like if Yellowstone blows and we wind up living in some sort of a perpetual nuclear winter for the next hundred years I hope the lava lands on my fucking head I don't want to leave absolutely hardscrabble people out there in Antarctica trying to eat seals and stay alive help reinvent the wheel no I don't find out because what you're gonna do then what are you gonna do yeah that's like civilization went through a divorce right and there the guy that gets like the flophouse you're just gonna you're never gonna build it back up in your lifetime so why not leave with a flat-screen TV watching MMA shit whatever you want to fucking watch and then the I still bit about that just when that Korean that little fatty there over in Korea was talking about how he's gonna shoot a fucking warhead and I was nervous until he said LA and I was like perfect dude right at my fucking giant forehead I don't even want to know just hear that whistling sound like what is it somebody watching Bugs Bunny what is that whistling sound and then it just fucking lands right on my house and then that's it yeah you don't want to be the guy who barely survives and has kids and then dies where your kids are like standing over you and they're eight and you know they can't live on their own you're you're fucking you're dying in front of their eyes like you don't want to be that guy and you don't you also have to take any consideration that even if the human race survives eventually it won't whether it's a million or a billion years from now eventually the earth will no longer be able to sustain life because the Sun will burn out so like well that's forever I'm just talking about like some our lifetime if some bullshit happens I don't want to go back to the world where like boils and shit and warts on the end of your nose or an issue now because there's no more CBS isn't shit whatever the benadryl of crap you put on it and then everybody starts looking like a witch like they live under a fucking bridge never got a wart on their nose know what I'm saying back in the day just from getting warts yeah it's another quote that we take out of yours is gone compound W is gone dollar collapses and all of that shit everything stops being made it's done they get best bet is you fucking go down to CVS and you raid all those drugs that's what you do when you take some bread and you leave right you just start pouring them in between the bread and you fucking eat them like a Captain Crunch sandwich enough all the drugs in Breakfast Club yeah I don't think that's a good idea either none of them is a good idea nobody has a good idea the only people who are okay it would be if you joined Blackwater will they actually have like a fortress they're the ones who are really ready my favorite ones when you watch those Doomsday Preppers and they're basically reading through their playbook that's all I had that shallow grave like this guy was what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna surrender my property and let them infiltrate it and then I'll fucking come around and he's like showing like where he's gonna hide and that's gonna be on a spring like one of those Murphy beds who rises up the craftmatic to slow you want to be on one of those Murphy beds where it pops up oh you're fake and dead so they don't see you in the background it's just slowly cuz you're slowly coming up you just point well you know those beds you push them wasn't three stooges bed they go right up to see people get stuck in them and they get pinned against the wall mert they called Murphy beds right you know they used to though that was a popular thing to save space very surely oh those things would fucking people get steamed you probably break your fucking I bet somebody broke their fucking neck and one of those I bet I bet people have died the most bizarre ways yeah I don't know listen buddy it's almost a quarter before y'all get out of here yeah where you going I'm going home I'm going home bill
