know the city centre still is like a Commons the whole thing except God real quick any outside rate everywhere right let's see a picture of it which one is it you're the to the left of the Aria sign oh my God look at the size of it right dude fuck the size of it they gotta tear that whole thing down yeah but structurally it's like not safe for people oh my god wrapped in black netting prior was that say prior to demolition oh my god that's why it's wrapped in black netting you imagine if you have the hotel next to it and like don't worry dude we're not even scratch your shit guys are next to your Porsche fuck and say hey bro I'm gonna blow up my car but I'm gonna put a net over your it's just just be cool don't sweat it don't sweat it don't sweat it I'm just gonna blow it up right next to you shit they should have let you build up a solid steel enclosure blow it up and then dispose of ro can you imagine for the engineer look in this limited which says here so it was originally to have risen 49 floors as a showpiece of the city centre which opened just as Nevada was entering the depths of the recession the 4,000 room Aria Resort and Casino along with the Mandarin Hotel fewer than 400 rooms and the all suite 57 story Vdara opened within a month of each other but the Harmon stayed shuttered it was in the recession but construction issues that kept the Harmon closed its construction plan was eventually scaled down by almost half but then concerns remain that it would topple in an earthquake uh Wow I knew Macau hotels supposed to open there soon in a big air that's been under development for over like ten years in Vegas yeah I watch the documentary about it's probably talking about some of this if I think it's like the MGM crew or one of them I don't want to say who because I don't know exactly but they were developing a huge thing and it fell apart basically and she's been sitting empty for ten years this McHale company is moving in it's supposed to open up in about a year so if it's not opening sooner than that a big multi-billion dollar Asian Hotel that all these Macallan Chinese people were supposed to come in and save Vegas how crazy would it be if Vegas got taken over by Chinese they came in is guns blazing and just built some unbelievable hotels because they're renting money over there just true rent and money so is my man Donald Trump though yeah please get the fuck out of here with all that nonsense watch your P's and Q's Donald Trump can hang with the Triads they're gonna come over here with giant spaceships Zeppelin's filled with diamonds just ring them down on Las Vegas are gonna build up a building made of entirely of diamonds all filled with hookers all filled with ten sign me the fuck I can't drive everybody around at a Rolls Royce no one's gonna go to any of the casino you're gonna take it to the most ultimate level ever I'm not mad at that if cuz it Macau really is gonna say it is it really is ten times Vegas that means you're making ten times as much money as baby remember that joke Sam probably said that it was something about how girls will always be with the guys with money no matter what girl does have a recession for Hodge Darth Vader Darth Vader can come down take over and and I'm killing the joke but it was one of the best Sam triplets true triple you remember dead-on yeah I remember I can't do it they see some ugly ass dudes with hottest chicks that's true the only reason you love guys got mad paper man a paper makes up for a lot of things there's hope for every man out there if you're an unattractive woman mad paper gets you a gay guy pretending to be straight but sure ain't that a bitch that's what you get if you look like a warlock as a girl in your millionaire it's like fuck so you think I don't you think Bruce Jenner was kind of like that no no no I think if you live with crazy bitches long enough you become one no did you no way no Bruce Jenner said he's always felt like a woman even as a kid you know even like it was gay it turns out he's gay the whole time cause it's not gay he's not gay he's just felt like he's alive to know in a man's body that's a great thing the crazy thing about a lot of these people that become transgender there's this is like there's so many different possibilities when it comes to sexuality we're doing that we still like sex that's something that a lot of us have a hard time accepting because we only have our own version of sexuality and gender but some people are men they're attracted to women but they're attracted to women and wish they were woman and were in love with the woman as a lesbian like they will sacrifice their dick they'll sacrifice the ability to come they'll sacrifice their testicles will sacrifice testosterone they'll sacrifice their male gender you know and still be with women bro I got one for you have heard of Lady valour yeah the fucking Navy SEAL yeah this badass Navy SEAL who said he she she likes mushy so he's a Navy SEAL from SEAL team 1 to SEAL Team 6 and then he's just like you know what I've always wanted to be a woman my entire life I felt like a woman straight dude now you know like it trying to look like woman in a dress polkadot dress looks like me really tattoos and shit mascara on teach and other Navy SEALs how to shoot and shit is there a chance is there a chance that the Bruce Jenner thing could be a situation where he's coming out slowly because remember Elton John was he look totally gay he's flaming but he denied it he's married and he said he was bi and then now he's full getting so he came out first it came out where he's bi he didn't come out fully all the way and so maybe Bruce Jenner's like you know what I can't come out and say I'm gay and I want to be a woman let me tell people I want to be a woman first and then later morsi's saying Oh am i gay I'm asexual hmm that's what he said he said he's a section Bruce Jenner sat down with one of those fucking interviews and it's I just read some details out he's coming out saying I felt like a woman my entire life I believe well I have to lead out why would you doubt that someone would be asexual because in a lot of ways Stanhope is asexual at this point in his life he doesn't have sex anymore what he's still a man but he doesn't have sex anymore what maybe Adam doesn't get hard anymore maybe not interested his testosterone just so I can just booze diam booze and cigarettes just having a great time does he hear yeah I have a great living life yeah loves it teach their own he's not into doesn't give a fuck he's having a good time I'm serious he talks about it openly he's like he's down with the slide Wow yeah so there's different people in everybody's different I mean Stanhope is not the dummy he's that's just what his decision he doesn't care and there's some people that you know like they might be asexual Morris he might be asexual it might not be bullshit might be just this is how he is the I if everybody have you heard some of the Smiths songs thankfully thankfully no okay I've heard a few of them but they make me sad I just like Spencer awesomes only getting sad but they're you know there's there it's a table is it all about having sex with good dudes no you could just I don't think I've heard the songs you haven't heard Smith's Smith The Smiths with Morrissey the singer anonymous how old are you again 31 okay it's before your time it's like the cure Depeche Mode's no no Morrissey I thought we talked what kinda music you like just hip hop there no everything else and everything you know this guy is such a rabid vegan but he actually won't let anyone works for him he won't let anybody who works for me meet this guy yeah when people working from like the crew he won't let them eat meat like he he like if you work for him on tour you cannot eat meat fuck that's it for these guys get together well the idea that he could dictate what someone's diet is is hilarious but he controls not just their physical body when they work for him but what they put in their body when they're on tour with him he does not allow them to eat meat so the crew they get together in one hotel room they'll pick a hotel room and they order room service and just go all and have cheeseburgers and steak and shit and they have to hide it from Morrissey where'd you hear this just her from some kid that told Brendan Schaub no tell me though i Goti ago a kid who heard it from Brendan show yeah I heard it from a guy who actually worked really guy was rapidly there well he you know he really feels strongly about it like say if you you hired a bunch of people and you found out they like to eat babies you'd be like look man you can't fuck any babies if you want to work for me I don't get maybe babies is a little different but the idea is yes so he's so anti animal cruelty that he doesn't want anyone around him working in any capacity that kills animals he feels like they're murderers I mean I don't agree with them but that's where he comes from if you found out Ari eight baby dogs would you let him open for you I would try to convince him to naughty baby dog talk was ideological argument an object what is a lamb what is lamb lamb is a baby she exactly mutton is a sheep I don't fuck with lamb either lamb is door vo I don't fuck with Leah motor via both chops I love lamb chops unfortunately I don't I don't eat veal veal so if Morrison cancels gig in Iceland after Vinny refuses to go vegetarian so he so he wants everyone to go veg - yeah no hot dog because that singer was due to perform at the Harper concert hall in Reggio Vic and I just look at no Jagger he's still a rock style forgive me Jagger but listen to loosen this was this request Iceland doesn't have any fucking ground you can grow vegetables in asshole like you can't be a vegetarian Iceland unless you bring it in trucks load of food or unless you got some sort of a crazy fucking greenhouse in there now look at that face right that you think he's asexual okay so I could see asexual but I shall leave the Harper Concert Hall to their cannibalistic flesh-eating bloodlust Lawrence he said in a state I love Iceland have wanted to for a long time to return that's hilarious is this recent that's awesome what but not what February Wow really recent he's a nut bag Germany walked off the stage during his Poland show after being head clipped by a fan oh that's hilarious sounds like a real if he's still claiming asexuality I don't know why you care this guy wants a fuck or not might be saying yes other dudes there's nine of fuckers and he's like so long up on the guy being asexual I just think he's lying of it yeah I think they're he's sucking a dick what makes you say that though Marcy unfortunately I am NOT a homosexual Wow you know what this is what I think dude he's a human sexual exactly you must say human sexual he said I think I don't that he just eat celery your fucking dick don't work no more I agree I was fucking commentators we're commentating on biology I agree I can buy evidence you've shown if you have too much cabbage it'll work for the record my favorite singer of all time is crazy gay it makes no difference but right no no need to talk about games very well well the guys that have come out like Rob Halford I love Rob there's a famous guy Rob Halford is one of the most famous singers ever he's awesome he's openly gay yeah he came out he said doesn't mean I'll still listen a Judas Priest I don't know shit I guys I could give two shits Eddie makes no difference I've just you know just don't I would say if you want to know the whole section just come out if it'll just come out don't lie you know what I think man I think my lives fans the people that care about that there's less of them and less them every day and I think we just hang in there if we just hang in there as a civilization I think racism I think people that are homophobic transsexual phobic or transphobic whatever they call people give a fuck what anybody does when it doesn't hurt you or or other folks they're going to go away they're not going to be around anymore I think yeah I think this is all just a blip in our evolution on our learn how long how long you think how many hundred years at least you do at least knows no racism hundred years no homophobia 100 years all of it'll be out the window there'll be like little blips here in there that'll shock the shit out of people we'll find out that there's still people that they're terrible at raising children but I think 100 years is several generations in the future that's 2 3 4 whatever the fuck it what's a generation what's the technical generation how many how many or five years no but I'll think they consider a generation seventy-five years I think it's like a 10 or 20 year period at the college like how long it is before if you're born where you can start fucking and having kids like how long I think that's what they think of as a generation I don't think it's a full life learning wife's mexico´s 16 ah how dare you how dare you how long is it generation roughly accepted as the average but period 25 years since in their offspring that's all said twin it says right here in general we think of a generation as being 25 years from the birth of a parent to the birth of a child Danny's hookers again pregnant quick mm-hmm 25 already having kids and give yourself a chance girl no no go get a life go around see the world I'll watch that shit on 16 pregnant though do you

two guys they're standing up they got a belt around this dudes neck and the dudes on his knees he's got a black eye and they're like making gang signs in front of the penis it's pretty so amazing so it's pretty crazy man see if you look at Jamie how long did it is to let me explain is Jamie surgeon there's uh two dudes there Stan - two young african-american fellows that are throwing up gang signs and in front of them is a dude who was on his knees he's got a belt around his neck and a black eye and the dude was doing eight years I think for armed robbery or something along those lines and apparently there's beating his ass and making them their dog or whatever the fuck they want to do with them this is a picture they took in prison yeah there isn't somebody like tweeted it or sometimes SFGate out they do man they called our dog they have phones they get phones in there they get all kinds of drugs in there that's it that's the picture look at this Georgia gang launched attack on what this is Oh God dance crazies there a worst job in the world a camp in prison mom's furious teen men launched gang attack on her son a teen to prison cell then tie a leash around his neck and pose for a Facebook photo despite being behind bars Wow hunched down with swollen eye in front of two shirtless young men one of them was holding the leash very still old family members he was jumped by ten other inmates and guards couldn't check on him until six hours after the incident whoa investigating believe the incident was gang-related oh my god she wants assurance from the department that he will be able to pay his debt to society without being killed look at that killed picture look at that picture fuck that I look at that picture holy shit that's scary imagine being that guy and that's your life back that up Jamie I don't mean to laugh but could there be a worse scenario look at that man that is crazy I choose highest that's the worst there's there's embarrassing pics that you don't want on the internet but that's the course like so where's picture of all time how crazy I don't have a digging up what a good picture to deter people from committing crime actually it's a good picture to show that people learn when you put them in jail they really change they change their ways they don't continue gangbanging the guys pulling the trigger at the camera the other guys throwing up a gang sign and he's got a leash around a dude's got a fucked-up face you don't know that's a gang sign that could be Mork and Mindy could be not be like Star Trek could be Star Trek you just live long and prosper yeah science fuck god that guy on the bottom it is just like fuck fuck that's a crazy way to live that's a crazy way to live man this poor guys got to live like that for six hours until the guards come and chase on and then what happens does he do they put him in solitary yeah he's probably hoping yeah best-case scenario if he does he's gonna have to do his whole time in solitary he's like Andy Dufresne out of bed homeboys fucking he's in some shit Andy Dufresne from Shawshank Redemption fight off the lady boys while powerful strange reference yeah right super-stretch movies that's hilarious please your shitty how do you have time to Train watch all these movies and then know every goddamn fight like an encyclopedia you want fight twice or all you need to do is watch it once uh usually once once again remember you got to remember I do those shows for fight pass UFC now so I research a lot of shit okay there's a dude there's another photo of him was i all fucked up we get him on the left good times Lee on the right what a dick what did he ditch in the I choked him to sleep it says only do who knows it says a gang-related aggravated battery robbery and theft of a motor this is jump by 10 people son Hawk man that's terrifying being in jail and knowing that you're in jail with a bunch of other prisoners and that there's no one watching out for you no one protecting you that's the terrifying thing about being in jail do you fight back or do you just like you not fuck it tear this out suicide whether or not it's worth it you could die and if you don't die you know you could be unbelievably injured to the point where you're never the same person again or you could just deal with their shit for eight years and succumb and then get out never be the same person again because you always been you've been diminished by a bunch of men who beaten you down you'll have PTSD abroad you fight if there's ten guys at your fight yeah hundred percent your fight yeah you know who knows what happens in your mind if you know you're never getting out of there I agree you that's a different animal you got to think like this is my new world I have to figure out how I handle this they tied you up in your new is inevitable that they got you they got your hog time they're ready to go and it has to you want to use you want to go dry syrup or jelly or peanut butter or or your own spit or your own spit you could spit on there his hands yes what do you want dry dry was it a syrup jelly okay your own jelly all day - jelly tarry all day is it raspberry jelly whatever comes it's gonna be in your asshole prison jelly so it's gonna be those raspberry containers you know ii mean they'll flip I know but raspberry has those little seeds that lubricate you know your asshole a little bit I feel it's kind of fucked up that they take people like in jail and they make them be around other people that are also with know everyone is that their youngest most horniest crate which is what like a lot a lot of violent criminals between the age of 19 and 23 like this been studies done Brian Cal and I were talking about this on the last podcast that we did from the car that if you if you removed all the 19 to 23 year old males in our society violent crime would drop by 90% shit some crazy number who came up with that they just did Studies on the amount of people that commit violent crimes and when they committed crimes the age for Vaught for young males it's very very high but they always say within the prison system you go in with whatever you know your bachelor's of crime you come out with your masters masters yeah they always say that around other criminals who know their shit man and it's not like you're going on your learning positive shit it's becomes your culture - yes look you get out a lot of guys are habituated where they get out and their fuck they don't know how they like hang out and be right in the world mm-hmm what a shitty system and the fact that someone could do one of those and make money and then you find out there's guys like that judge in Pennsylvania that was locking young kids up through the Nile just to get the money he was getting kickbacks from the prison fuck so he was taking kids and railroading him and sending them downriver making money off of a holy fuck one kid committed suicide his mother was of the trial screaming at the guy he was dog the guy get put away forever you have to forever well how did they bust shit I don't know it's good question that is so fucked up that story bothered me so much I didn't want to read into it the idea that some having a lot though isn't that the private prisons and all that shit well that is a specific case when they're talking about juvenile offenders this guy was sound sending juveniles that were innocent to like these detention camps how much was he making I don't know enough that he did it he made hundreds of thousands of dollars over PNN he went to jail fuck yeah they're gonna they're gonna fuck him up to Jerry he's fucked the idea that a judge put people in jail for money and now he's in jail they're gonna fuck that guy up that guy might not ever he might not make it he shouldn't he shouldn't I great I mean that's karma that's justice you ruined kids lives you take them in the urine each stuff them in with kids like those guys and they do something like that to them it's good and then you have guys like mm mm with a fucking dead oh my god creating fake look at this this guy went to jail because he created a fake humorous MySpace page about our is her school's vice-principal 12/curse data another student's mother 17 did nothing at all didn't a man kids for cash is a documentary oh my goodness called kids for cash your documentary yeah we're gonna Netflix I'm sure I don't know dude oh my god he made two point two million oh as a finder's fee as a finder's fee for the construction of a for-profit facility which house he's so-called delinquents oh my god he sentenced around 3,000 children in a similar manner oh my god like I should go to prison just get pass raped every morning well he's doing 28 years which means he could probably get out less than that but most like we won't make it god no it's fucked in there mmm my god what a fucking piece of shit that guy is the idea that a human being could do that to a kid that crazy huh it's just terrifying it's just terrifying it's just terrifying that that someone would would have that in their their DNA they have that in their brain why did you accept that and then you have guys like you see that documentary the jinx on HBO is holy shit the other guy like Robert Durst who who got away with murder he chopped dudes limbs off and his head off he got bust the admitted he killed the guy but he says hey I kill I had to do that because I accidentally killed him I didn't think anybody was gonna believe me so I thought hmm I better chop off all his limbs in his head and throw him in the river um and he got off that's for the money yeah because he said it was self-defense I'm not up with him but he didn't call the cops he just decided nobody was gonna believe him so he had to chop the dude up and he got away with it god damn that's so crazy totally good and on top of that when they first arrested him did you saw right yeah when they first arrested him he posted bail and skipped town yeah so he was a fugitive down with the Philly finally catch him they catch him and shot somebody they catch him shoplift he's a millionaire he admits he murdered the guy yeah and chopped him up but he said he he did it because he didn't think people were gonna believe because his wife was missing and they think he did it maybe we're missing his wife went missin we're all sorrows Ryan went miss his wife went missing he killed his best friend his wife went missing they never found the body so for 10 years her family suspected and they knew he did it because she was always saying he's gonna kill me he's gonna kill me and I'm fucked me up he's gonna kill me and then one night she disappeared and he had an alibi oh you know she never showed up or she came I dropped her off at the train I don't know where she went we were having a lot of trouble so maybe she just left me you know people just leave you know and so they never found the body so they just let it go and he's he's an air of like a gazillionaire own skyscrapers he said hey I'm gonna go yeah you got a lot of power a lot of money and he got away with making his wife disappear they still haven't found the body they think there's another case too from the health food store in Vermont there was a girl who's working in that town a young girl disappeared that's another one they didn't know why but it came out after there's a new one they're connected to him whoa yeah that might been the first one he killed that's one of the greatest documentaries and the last ones insane when he goes the bathroom he's a way to go like talking myself like an asshole yeah because I did I kill him of course Joey got me of course he's like talking he doesn't realize the micah stands and he's going the bathroom to himself confesses cuz they busted him that that's the glass room same as most evidence though like his uh lawyers like dude if you think that's enough evidence we can go try right now I'm gonna shit all over your story is that what they're saying he's like the in but what about the letter that the killer wrote to the police department it's his writing dude that was great have you seen it do you see you never see it you never see a guy go like you know in true romance and I tell my pantomimes when people lie if you if you ask him a question to recommend I if they're lying there's like things they do they scratch their head or there's like a tick when they answer there's something girls have like 13 things they do guys have nine something like that and and that's what people like detectives that's what they look for that's why they keep asking questions and they just have a camera on your face they review the camera that's how they did see if you're lying your twitches and man when they said is this your writing goes yes that's my writing it was boom boom he was but his face goes whoa he goes like this no he started gagging like his issue rhyme he goes he knows who he's a clone god no he does this to this is the alter this is usually what they look for is like what were you that last night well I was I was you know and I was on you know yeah you know I don't know what the fuck I will you know you know what I mean you're doing all this thing he went like this he went like this in the burping and when he's in the bathrooms and why did you burp the burping you think it's so obvious how them so oh my god so crazy well he had the pressure of lying that long must be overwhelming man he must have been a smart dude because so many investigators came after me at the same story over and over but the thing that fucked them is the the way spelled Beverly Valley Hills he spelled it with an extra e so the killer killed a lady and sent a letter said the the cadavers here with a address and he spelled Beverly with an extra e well there's why I killed the chair well he it was all about his wife he made his wife disappear so for 10 years he got away with it but he had a really his best friend with some chick who was the daughter of a big mob boss so he was really connected with the mob so that was the only chick who knew she was his publicist during the ten years when people were accusing him they ended up dropping the case they could never find a body so she knew she ended up moving to fuck in LA she was a writer they still kept in touch but her that the the wife who was missing her family would always tell the investigators go interview that chick Sharon something go interview gotcha that chick knows go question and then when they were finally going to do it 10 15 years later they're gonna reopen it and go question that chick he's in New York she's dead she gets blown away and it just so happens he flew to California like that did he the father yes but he was a northern County because I was in Northern California and they track him driving down because he would they tried to go buddy you can he I was in California because but you can't put me in LA once he kills people that is great line there's like what were you doing in California California is a big State yes all but you'd be the thing is all seven you know it all stems from he I guess his dad was hit like four or five brothers and sisters and his mom commit suicide jumped off the top of the house yeah but the dad goes your mom's about to do some only wakes him up brings me to the window like look at your mom the mom commit suicide jumps off dark right in front of me said your mom's about to do some so he wants to watch he wakes he's only kid he wakes up grabs on and goes check out your mom out there and he's like what he's my honored his mom you wanna decide to see was all season long that's what he said but all his defense was always about feel sorry for me I you know felt sorry for it was all that's what just good that's what it was really shit it did create a month's but if his dad killed his mom in front of him well real what it was what it was is he got rid of his wife so the only reason he murdered that chick was cuz she was gonna start talking 10-15 years later so he had a killer what about the neighbor so he killed her the neighbor because then he kills her and then he disappears and dresses up like a chick and rents a house in Arizona takes items fakes like a mute chick in Texas so the no one talk to me is like an old lady so after he kills her he's in Texas hiding out and he had this neighbor that eventually he started talking to after a while and then he he ended up telling him who he was and then he had to kill him too cuz he knew like it was just really obvious he looks like shit do killing or they know he was guilty how does he get away with this he looks like a piece of shit yeah he looks like mr. burns bro he looks like mr. burns just from the shoe I'm killing anybody he's chopping bitches up too and then check this out that would be that would take forever so the neighbor that he told every he his wife disappeared it is great that guy beautiful a great skin and so he has to kill his neighbor in Texas because he knows everything so he Chuck he chops up his he chops off his arms his legs and his head he puts him in plastic bags he throws him in the lake the next morning he comes to see if they they floated up and they floated up so like fuck all these body parts right there so he says fucking he grabs the head cuz he shot him in the head and disappear with that they never found the head they found the body obviously they checked the fingerprints they went to the guys they went to the guy's house they started interviewing the the landlord and the neighbor go who lives here to go some mute old lady then they started then they figured out oh shit this is the dude the fucking did it he gets busted he gets arrested post bail disappears they catch him shoplifting a sandwich like a week later so then he goes to trial he was a trial but he he was wanted for the murder for that lady in California and still his wife but Texas said he's we're gonna try them here we got him open and shut he's done he was done dude he there was no way he was gonna get don't say anymore I want to watch this fucking thing though we just you know but it's not but it they literally are you but it isn't about that it's not about that you they tell you all that I done this whole story on the podcast several times though we have Rho J cos it they talked about it Tom Segura I was gonna tell the whole story okay all right not as not as with enthusiasm as a parent you know what now man your daddy Saigon I feel like you've seen it multiple times or you'll be honest I saw it once cuz they're six parts alright so first six hours six hours six hours here just going another dude HBO fucking rules that HBO go HBO go get the fuck you just go prank you know we I I'm not a big fan of old music at all Frank Sinatra was like I don't give a fuck about Frank Sinatra did you watch that documentary farm big Frank Sinatra fat house war fucking had here because of shit his story it's fuckin dough god damn he was Hugh got huge really quick like in the forties and was massive left his wife really hidden Oh married Ava Gardner like that like the Angela Angelina Jolie at the time soon as he married her his career went the shit the labels dropped him the movies had no one wanted to do movies with him why cuz you're just worst no because it was just a new time Elvis came in and it was a new time - drunk - he's fucking up he was he was he was sucking everything he was just a self-sabotaging he was little in the end the early 50s he was washed up dude he was done Ava Gardner's trying to fucking get away from time she's good she's doing movies in Europe trying to get away from and he's on plane stalking her and going after and she she loved him but she was done with them yeah and so at the he was rock bottom and he read this script from here to attorney I don't know how I got the script but he he that was a part in From Here to Eternity that he thought he could play a nail and he begged the studio please give me one more chance I could do this and they didn't want to do it so Ava Gardner you know puts the call and and says just kill my shot he forget her and he did for three grand so he did it dude and while he was making the movie everybody knew that the movie was gonna be big and then Frank Sinatra's gonna make a big comeback so with that heat Capitol Records signed him and gave him another chance so the movie comes out he wins the fucking Oscar and his new album that came out fuckin blew up so now he's a hundred times bigger than he's ever been he's a monster starts his own record company starts his own movie company man hey don't tell

of the book that shit is insane it's amazing this I'm talking about that I don't want to get followed and shit no I'm sorry no I converted died once that I converted is way crazier than Scientology shall fucking curry come on a bearded guy up in the clouds or an alien that takes you out of a volcano yeah what it's what's worse what's worse is the guy who was obviously mentally ill created this religion well obviously I think he was brilliant there he goes you know he wrote more books than anybody ever yeah you publish more books than anybody knows who else they're so bad you could write him in a day yes that's why have you ever read Battlefield Earth absolutely hell alright shadow field or say that about LRH battle area if you look at the if you watch the movie it's it's a fucking amazingly bad movie it's a movie with John Travolta and Forest Whitaker Forest Whitaker plays giant alien John Travolta tree it's it's so dense it's the worst movie ever right mmm it's up there I've heard it seems like a sketch and centering live like a parody of a really bad science fiction film this is it it's so bad John Travolta defends it how dare he and this is all based on an l ron hubbard book about you know alien invaders do they're sane Travolta wants to get out but they have too much dirt on them who says that this documentary you can't get out now son it's too late you've seen two DS and a two man they secured you to convince to confess all your shit and they record it that's what they buy now that's how they get you my truth is balls deep in it they'll legitly yeah it's also a gang yeah it's a cult hey you know what we were gang dope if I had to pick a religion to be totally 100% devoted to and be real it would be Scientology fuck off it would be people they have a lot of the things you know what the alien this is alien people no no but you know what they real estate the IRS make them they window to the IRS all the Scientologists got together because IRS was gonna bury him for billions and billions of dollars because from back taxes they weren't paying taxes they say cuz ever say hey we're religion fuck you guys we're religion just like all your other religions so the IRS said you were not a fucking religion this is not a rillette you owe five billion dollars taxes so what they decided to do is they filed each one of them all the Scientology all filed lawsuits against the IRS and went after different people individually they all so they flooded them so they're like oh shit how do we make this shit go away just make us a religion make a fuck your religion and they've done some really shit that's gnarly fucking insane but the guy that took over after he died I forget his name is garbage or something it looks like Tom Cruise whew that guy's intense I just see all the shit that they wrote about all the people that were in going clear like all the character assassinations oh really yeah see see if you see Scientology response it going all yours too I'm not sure there's two sides every story I just want to make it really clear if I had to pick a religion I would pick Scientology that's all I'm gonna say you're crazy they're fuckin badass Tom Cruise great documentary though seems like it's a good one to be in show business yes right you get to hang out with Tom Cruise and John Travolta dude from 70 show the guy with the from Jenna Elfman
