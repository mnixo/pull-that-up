they would go for a few months make quarter million bucks then fly home and get all this jewelry and diamonds and shit and one little hooker ruined the whole party but usually they caught it with a laptop just writing stories about it she wanted us write a book about her experience for this dude this is what he had a disco in his house in one of his many houses and he would have it filled with all these girls are making who knows how much money tens of thousands of dollars and he would come out and fucking gold underwear and just in slippers and just slide across the room like he was in that scene with Tom Cruise what's that movie risky business yeah like slides erina he'd slide in like that was gold underwear and just go eeny meeny miney mom just pick one out yes look I'm sure top of them and then the next day do the same thing and he'd do whatever he wants and that chick wrote the story on it one of them did Wow yeah and he's like so what I'm going back as a crisis at hand oh yeah that's really handsome that's like Katt Reagan did Jenny meenie miney moe that guy that guy's totally covered in gold look at them that guy's worth more money than you can I ever can I be one of these girls oh my god go away for fifty thousand I'm doing a gig in Dubai guys the whole month you just wanna be the court jester go over there and crack some jokes man that's fucking crazy yeah you think he wears a condom no no condom right shut up why would he do that yeah exactly he's just shooting loads of these girls but then again he's opening himself up for possible I wonder if they possible what I bet he gets them tested he puts them in catapults and shoots them in the air I am closer to being Lance Armstrong like closest on a diet to absent all carbohydrates but I'm still you know now I'm just a bigger individual I mean I ain't insurance we were talking about you know just talking to a friend of mine it was a freshman manager of my college football team so this was Harvard okay was division 2 football it was a lot of smart you know guys who couldn't make it in Division one we had kids who went to Harvard cuz they did get scholarships and Holy Cross so they went okay I'll play football for Harvard they were local 1976 my senior the biggest kid on our team Danny jiggets weigh 265 pounds 6 foot 5 from our standard whose enormous he went off to play for the Chicago Bears for five or six years I think we had one other offensive lineman who was 265 also 64 65 maybe to this year Harvard football team smart kids same socioeconomic status the entire offensive a guys I think 12 players over 300 pounds Jesus Curran these guys are enormous I mean they're six seven 300 pounds they didn't grow people that big when I was growing up I mean I could say maybe I didn't see him maybe they weren't around maybe they were six seven and they only weighed 230 because they weren't being bulked up so they were playing basketball instead of football I mean I could imagine ways at that confusing but from our perception if you look just what happened when I was a kid early 1960s I remember as far as I know there was one 300 pounder in the NFL and AFL two different leagues back then Bob Dee remembers name he played for the Boston Patriots and his head was like small compared to his body and he was a big fat guy like you know what is there now 20 30 per team and you're saying like a lot of people are saying no that science is out because they spend billions of dollars to do that the thing is is when you are playing such far right far left partisan politics yeah then you have people saying Oh Obamacare he's a socialist he's trying to take over the government he's trying to do this he's trying to do that and sort of blowing it out why because that creates the Tea Party which you know comes in and then they have power and then the Tea Party by the way has to go back their constituents and say we're going to repeal it we're going to do this we're going to do it and it just becoming goes to the atomic level you know and so that when you actually go into into you know into Congress or into the executive or into the Senate and you try to get anything done you can't because you promised that you're not going to you know do anything you're going to have any sort of you know partisan you know relation bipartisan bipartisan relations yeah it's fucked up man it's and it's stupid and it exists because we have two parties when you make two people we make one of them wear red and you make one of them wear blue they start one to fight each other so it's a stupid fear well we can be a great you're also it doesn't matter if you're in or out you're always empowered because there's only two right so right you're always going to be the sort of opposition yeah and get influenced the problem is like this is people have to realize a lot of your opinions and my opinions too are not really my opinions their opinions that I've decided are good that I've heard from other people right and a lot of our patterns of behaviors from accents to the way we approach culture the way we think about women the way we think about religion a lot of that is learned okay and we have these two deeply ingrained patterns in this country we have the Democrats and we have the Republicans and the Republicans are these no-nonsense get business done you know and the Democrats are you know we always think of all these people are all crybabies and they're all wishy-washy and they're bleeding hearts and and that this is like ingrained sort of ingrained in our system these two different patterns of behavior and they're severely problematic because you can exhibit a lot of traits on each sides and still be a very good person or a lot of ideas on each side and still be a very good because here's that the awful thing about being an adult in a relationship seeking to be an adult in a relationship I have found when I was young and I was a boy on dating girls it's boys and girls and you she's an idiot you're an idiot you do dumb things everyone cheats and whatever then you hit a certain part of your life where she's a woman and you're a man and you have adult expectations and you can't be running around being an idiot with someone who kind of wants you to be at the table because they are sincerely giving time of their adult life to this thing that you are doing together right you come in still thinking you're in ninth grade and she's coming in like this is part of what my life is is being with you I have never been able to answer that in a mature enough way to where I was been able to maintain it because like say next weekend if I had a girlfriend she might say it's Friday what are we doing I'm like Oh watching me right for four hours and so that's not the way to be you can't do that right I can't be a good person's other half because I'm always the work has always attracted me more than coming home to someone Wow like I can't stand the idea of someone living with a person I can do it on the bus because it's Dafa bulletin work you know going down the road but I never would want to like wake up and she's there and I go no or go get expression that you need good I can look you right in Jerry well it's everyday here we are together right that's not wired that way by the way did you see that that little clip that was making its way around at the inauguration on the inauguration stand of Bill Clinton checking out Melania yes they get caught that was some was a bunker and Ivanka what about either one frank god yeah oh my god yeah God Jesus Christ those Johnny look was fantastic the look was pure Bill Clinton oh well he's like a fucking it's over yeah I don't have to hold it back anymore look at all oh yeah good lord okay shaking he's licking his rolling eyes like that she turns around and looks at him yeah look at that uh oh my goodness and then it looks it gives her a quick look yeah he turn what's what he looks at her like a bitch you know who I am you know you live with a wolf look at that out you know you live in a big old gray wolf she's hi everyone I'm a bunker Trump I wonder which you've had a fucking accent what's on there oh it's her giving a massage oh this is like a porn film oh they did a fake horn about Ivanka Trump there's been that look that Alicia's its best party not gay it's over it's over I could be made again I'm tired of it all that would be the only reason I wanted I would have wanted Hillary Clinton when the only bright spot I guess I should say instead the only bright spot that her wedding would have been that he would have it back in yeah fascinating is the first I am man on a rampage he'd probably be our rampage watch it watch his mouth yeah I know no fights is lower I like mouths Ivanka no he doesn't does he look we say this Oh vodka oh yeah [Music]
