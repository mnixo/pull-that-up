hahaha hello freak bitches he is always right take my hat off him you know you know Angelo Dundee MMH or he is to come and see me in West Palm all the time and he knew that I you know my head I had like some history of boxing in my family and he brought me this great picture of all the Philly fighters and I was out there at the dinner with him one night and as I started picking his brain a little I said who's the baddest motherfucker ball so do you think of all the guys that you saw or manage which could beat anybody he goes Sonny Liston hands down Wow he said everybody was afraid of him he said you know he was a lot of prophecy but whatever I don't know what mob ties yeah but apparently heroin and you know that second Ollie fight was definitely thrown oh yeah you know you could say it's such a joke the way he's faking well he got punched like they called a phantom punch is not a fan of punch he definitely got punch but he was waiting for the first punch to land so that he could just lay down like you pull that up Jimmy we go watch this it's a Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston to in Lewiston Maine you know who I thought it was gonna be Foreman because of his size and his strength but he you know he's a Liston was the toughest yeah well you know what Foreman before Ali beat him was a different animal post Ali he was never the same guy because that air of invincibility was gone and then he had that crazy fight I believe it was with Ron Lyle they just fucking blasted each other in the head and knocked each other down like four or five times you remember to punch that he hit a George Foreman with in Jamaica picked him up not George or Joe Frazier Joe Frazier yeah yeah picked him up on a stomach punch I don't remember what what he hit him with but I remember his his legs literally came up off the ground I never saw that before yeah incredible he was a monster he was such a fucking murderous puncher I was at the Spinks Tyson fight that Michael Spinks yeah we talked about the whole time on podcast how scary he's up jumped the devil yeah yeah yeah that's really he know I think we talked about it at the Laugh Factory I think we talked about it more than once because it was such a mean you were there for like one of the most stunning moments in boxing history I was cool a lot of people thought Michael Spinks was gonna give him a hard time because Spinks had gone 12 rounds at Larry Holmes and you know and beat Larry Holmes by decision and you know and he was the light heavyweight champion he was a good boxer he just had no business he was so small too he was barely 199 you know and he's fighting Mike Tyson Tyson was Tyson was a much bigger you know in comparison to today's fighters he was probably 220 built better toejam patented 1965 Lewiston Maine watch this cuz alley still looking slick man there's still to this day no heavyweight that moves like him man no I got fucking good he moved so light on his feet for a guy who's 220 pounds or whatever the hell he was side to side all that head movement you mean you can't believe that you can't even touch him listed with lunge forward with that jab good luck now here he gets him with the punch like right as he tries to listen tries to crowd him and it happens with Ali's face to the cameras or listings back to the camera and he just comes with an overhand right as soon as he catches listen on the jaw Liston goes down like he got shot I think it's right here right here shinsen whenever it is it's when Liston's backs to you but look how beautiful Ally moves me as amazing I mean he really did float and this is the real Ally this is the ally of 1965 you know before the army Lola yeah man the army fucked him that whole thing fucked him because for three years from 1967 to 1970 he was completely out of commish at his total Prime yeah look watch will show the difference here like when when he finally catches like listen even Allah listens moving towards him he doesn't even look how he's trying to hit him what if they had like a they gave him a time where he had to get knocked out to I mean it must be probably the first rattling cuz all the gambling on it oh yeah I mean that was everything here it is boom right there I mean that this is the fucking leg there's is no fucking way my little shit the way he's going down the way he gets up buggy fake you could see him thinking I should probably fall down here and he gets up finally in Jersey Joe Walcott is a referee too I believe yeah yeah that's Joe Walcott and something happened there and now Ali's just tuning him up I know they stopped the fight that's it so I guess he had reached a 10 I forgot that he got up after that yeah here's the knockout in slow-motion what I mean he does hit him everybody calls it the phantom punch but watch this punch he definitely does hit him as listen moves forward he does boom see yeah clean hit no doubt about it he definitely tagged him but it wasn't it wasn't the kind of punch that would put a guy like listing out it probably stun him but I just it did I didn't believe that that was a real one punch knockout now watch that and I'll watch uh he came back against the white dude Jerry quarry sure if that was his that was his comeback fight Muhammad Ali versus Jerry quarry and when he fought Jerry quarry this was in after he had taken all that time off and his body just looked different man he just like Jerry quarry was like a really tough guy who by the way before he died couldn't even figure out how to walk I couldn't figure out where he was I didn't know where his underwear was yeah he was gone who's kidding who couldn't if you walked out his front door never make it back inside he was just gone you know all these talk at Dome here but if you look at Ali's body like as Ali goes back the thing about Ali was that if he wasn't training for a fight he wasn't working out so he didn't spend those three years lifting weights running hills and fucking hitting the heavy bag he wasn't doing anything I mean he's probably just just fighting to keep from getting locked up in jail you know but if you look at his body like look at it he's all smooth and there's no muscles yeah like look at him he looks like shit I mean he doesn't look anything like he used to look I mean he's he's bouncing around a little bit in the beginning but he's just not the same guy they still had some pretty big fights at the end yeah he did but he was never the same guy I'll never forget that Larry Holmes trying to get the refs to stop the fight because I didn't want to beat him up anymore that was awful his idol that was awful because that was after Ali had no money left and he was really suffering from Parkinson's already he was early yeah I was already kicked in he was already in really bad shape we know is a friend of mine we used to work as doormen together and Doc Watson's in Philly was Randall Cobb tax cop and we saw him take a beatin from Holmes yeah we were just going go down Randall go down yeah working hard that was the fight that made Howard Cosell retire from box yeah I remember that I'm done Leno mo look at that little monkey run Howard Cosell who called like some of the greatest fights of all time yeah but like if you look at Ollie here I mean he still looks good but it's just not the same ollie no just not the same guy he just his body doesn't like the same smooth I mean granted he's had three years off but he just I mean that the old Ollie go now too Lee versus Cleveland big cat Williams I've always said if you want to look at like Ali in his prime when Ali was in his prime is when he was fighting this guy Cleveland Williams and Cleveland Williams is his big fucking scary murderous puncher and Muhammad Ali box this guy's fucking face/off who was the one that he what he was doing what's my name what's my name oh um shit remember that yeah as a guy wouldn't quit called him calling Cassius Clay yeah that's my name what's my me I forget who that was god damn I'd have to look at his red but Cleveland look how muscular Williams is Williams is a fucking animal murderous puncher and he just could not catch Hawley this is Ali in his prime this is Ali like in 67 he was very there to go but the movement the side-to-side it was like there's no fucking heavyweights that ever moved like that no one I mean he literally moved faster and lighter on his feet than most welterweights and he was fighting at 200 plus pounds I mean I don't know what he weighed in his prime is probably probably about 220 or something like that you ever see that picture of him and the Beatles uh which one classic picture just him at the Beatles in Miami just a funny thing I'm trying to find out who that guy was that did that I know I mean what's my name early Cruz got a bit of a process Cleveland oh the hair yeah they all used to like that Sugar Ray Robinson had that too the conch they would call it you know who also is great Sugar Ray Leonard oh yeah dude it was on the front why just shut it off Jimmy keep that shit on son I'm trying to find this guy's name Jamie hey Dylan Jamie's good over there look at him sexy bitch Aleksey motherfucker Jimmy Ellis Jimmy Ellis that's what it was yeah Wow pretty sure pretty sure is Jimmy Ellis did you know such a scoring plate and two it probably was that's probably what happened wouldn't knock him out cuz he did Adam Adam just beat his ass I'm almost positive was Ellis I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong but if you um you watch this fight this in my opinion was like the quintessential I'll and this is I believe the last fight before he went away um they just had never seen anybody like this guy but what did he do in those three years that he wasn't in prison no I think actually I think he fought they fought two more times and then he went yeah he fought Ernie Terrell and Zara Foley um he went to uh you know he had to fucking go to court look at this god damn he was fast yeah look at this the legs PAP PAP PAP PAP and then out of there I mean he was he was barely getting hit back then man it is so fucking quick and then you see like his later fights like when he fought Joe Frazier like rumble in the jungle and you know there was this it was so much slower a foot probably had knee problems by then and you know he took a beating from cradle they took a beat from each other oh those were horrendous fights those were horrendous fights his daughter told me it may Mays a friend of mine his daughter might be I mean sure she was always at the store she's a comic right yeah I remember the first time I brought her up and I said you know why she brought me up and I said Meimei LA I said I always I was thinking like in the back I wonder if I could beat Ali's daughter in a fight ah probably not yeah well definitely not the other one Layla Layla beautiful scary too she'll beat the shit out of you yeah beautiful and she beat your ass Meimei is an example of how a woman can be pretty and look like her father Yeah right right right you know he's got a son too that comes around the comedy store or used to come around the comedy store back in the day I don't remember - yeah and may may I introduce me to him one day and I was like whoa this dude looks exactly like Muhammad Ali it was crazy mm-hmm and you know at the time he was fairly young the kid you know this is like I want to say ten years ago maybe but Cleveland Williams was like this like perfect style fighter to show like Muhammad Ali in his best like he just wasn't there man he just wasn't there but it's not nearly as quick oh man like look at this look at that that's insane he was so slick and he just redefined what it meant to be a professional boxer he introduced a whole new way of doing it and now like there's a lot of MMA fighters that use this style now I mean it's different because they throw kicks and because takedowns are incorporated into it but a lot of what they call they called neo footwork movements like Dominick Cruz is probably the best at it use the former bantamweight champion and TJ Dillashaw who's the current bantamweight champion both guys are great examples of people that use this kind of misdirection and footwork like constantly left to right right to left but those guys also incorporate switching stances like they'll fight southpaw and then Orthodox in Orthodox now they go back and forth look at this alley just right in front of this dude and you can't do shit to them um go to the knockout we see I don't know where where it is on this video it can't be much further than this when's your next fight Joe the next UFC is next weekend is a big one too where Chris Weidman versus Vitor Belfort in Vegas look at this ding-ding Oh son he stands over with his hands up oh my god yeah oh yeah he's that's real see that's the way he's breathing very different than the way Sonny Liston went down see that again back it up again - there's what I believe he got knocked down twice my I might be wrong yeah he got knocked down twice so look this is don't yeah back it up a little bit you can see that the the flurry knows three times he got knocked down three times yeah and then eventually put away but he's just you know kept trying to chase him chase him chase him but being knocked him down walking away god damn that was beautiful the way he did that oh I watched this fight I don't know how many times this is one of my favorite all-time performances of any box you
