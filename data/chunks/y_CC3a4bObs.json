we're also brought to you by ting ting is a mobile service that does things differently to do things on on their own terms and what that means is they buy time through the Sprint backbone they use Sprint's you get the exact same service that you get with Sprint but you get it with no contracts no early termination fees no nonsense they don't trick you and there's a lot of ways that cell phone companies make money and one of the ways they make money is they they charge you for X amount per month like you know you have a deal where you you know you get 1200 minutes a month or whatever the hell it is but when you do that most of the time you're not using those minutes but you're still paying for those minutes the wait ting does it it's a very smart and I and I think it's a better way and I think it's the only way that they're gonna do in the future what what they do is you pay for what you use if you use a lot you pay more if you use very little you pay less and ninety-eight percent of people would save money using ting that's a pretty incredible statistic if you go to Tings website go to Rogan ting calm they'll explain the whole thing to you twenty one dollars is the average monthly bill per device for ting customers that's amazing because you'd be you'd be surprised at how little when you when you look at these service minutes you know you know like a hundred minutes a month two hundred minutes a month most of the time people are texting each other these days and if you call me a lot man most the time pick up the phone I don't spend a lot of time calling people $440 is the average annual savings per device for a business with one to twenty employees so if you have a business ting is the way to go if you want to set up business phones and you have many options as far as the phones themselves you have all of the best Android phones that are available today and you buy them you don't see the thing about when you go to one of the big-name cell phone companies and you get a phone you're not actually buying the phone well if you pay $200 for a phone you're not really paying $200 for that phone the phone costs probably five or six hundred bucks and you think you're paying $200 but the other 300 to 400 dollars you're paying off over the course of your contract that's why if you try to leave they stick it to you and they make you pay what you owe them so it's that's what a contract termination fee is but it's all about is you still owe money on a device you'd essentially leased a device ting doesn't handle it that way at all with ting everything that you you you purchase with that they sell at ting calm Rogan ting calm there are the finest cell phones available today like the excuse me Samsung Galaxy s5 which is water-resistant just added water-resistant if you're a fucking dork like me spill shit that's the way to go they have the HTC One m8 all the best new Android phones the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 which I use fantastic phone you can draw on it as a pen how can you go wrong and if you like one of those old crazy grandma's they have flip phones they have everything and as cheap as 42 bucks you can get a phone for 42 bucks which is kind of ridiculous in this day and age and when you buy it for 42 bucks you actually buy it for 42 bucks and if you know you know you try it for a while and you go you know what I want to cancel just cancel that's it you don't have to worry about shit it's a beautiful ethical way to do business and the results have been fantastic massive massive public positive feedback that I've received from all the people that have switched over to ting saved money love the company love the idea behind the company and love the fact that they have a wide selection of devices so go to Rogen dot ting comm today and save yourself some cash kids all right my friend Steve Hilton is here we're gonna talk about all kinds of groovy shit let's cue the music experience Steve helps in my friend politics for dirty business very dirty but just before we get into that show you I just want to say you've already really offended me fantastic just to show you my phone Oh what have you got here it is aa flip phone so if I'm in your words an old crazy grandma well I have many friends that carry old flip phones I'm glad that you're actually just carrying a phone exactly this is a very new development for me well it's a good move good been telling you I've got to have a phone I had not had a phone for many years finally I buckled under the pressure and I got one of these yeah Steve we became friends in Hawaii our family we're all friends it's a very cool little development I really enjoy it but I think it I think it's quite hilarious that uh your wife is involved in Google and you avoid phones at all costs you avoid technology you feel that it's too entrenched in our life this sort of digital web that we've all been connected to yeah I'm trying to fight it Joey just shut them off though that's the beautiful thing when you don't want to use them you shut them off yeah but that's that kind of nagging away no that's discipline right well I feel that there's benefits and there's certainly negatives to phones but I think the positive aspects outweigh the negative I like being able to communicate with friends and family and loved ones and send texts and I I find it incredibly addictive though and I think it becomes I was out at dinner the other day with a bunch of friends and everyone was on the ground and phone there was five of us and then I was like sitting around the table looking at everybody texting and tweeting and taking photos I'm like we're not even here right now but you guys are your kin acted to this digital world you talk about how awesome it is to be here but you're not even here you're barely paying attention and there's nude sort of etiquette developing about you know how to handle this one there's I think I was reading something about where you've got eight people around the table having dinner and it's okay for three of them to be looking at their devices that's okay but if you guessed it more than three someone's got to look up because that's the rule who says says who establish what I don't get it it's just there it's just like anything else I mean if you are at a bar with some friends and one guy's just watching TV only and not engaging in a conversation that's just as rude yeah I think that's right I find it fascinating how my children reacted devices that's where I really get a sense of it because they don't have a cultural context you know when my four-year-old watches television or watches devices and I'll stand in front of her while she's watching TV and she just reaches up and tries to move me like she doesn't give a fuck what I'm thinking she's just trying to watch this program yeah you literally can't get in between any point it's like I've really noticed that if you just you know they're watching something that's it maybe you may have been away for a week and you haven't seen them and they're desperate to see but if there's something on TV yeah point not interested yeah it trumps everything it Trump's all human interaction and it's it's very weird how it does it it does it in this strange hypnotic way there's nothing else on earth that gets a four-year-old to just sit there yeah motionless right and engage but it literally stimulates parts of the brain there's a lot of quite interesting brain science about what's going on when yeah when kids watch TV and it's generally fine but when it gets to a point where they're watching you know more than two or three hours a day and a lot of kids these days are in that situation it literally starts rewiring their brain yeah it's not healthy to to completely entrench yourself in that world and to be in that world all day every day but a lot of people do because it's possible but I think that's just like everything else it's like I like the option to be able to buy a cheeseburger I don't think you should service every day all day but I like it if I want one from driving by in and out I'm like let's do it you know it's it's not the best food for you but I like the option I totally agree with it I like that for television I like I like watching Swamp People watch that fine and vanilla terrible show about a bunch of people alligator huntin and it's it's it's the most predictable show of all time because they're they look for alligators and occasionally they get alligators but there's nothing unusual happens they don't run into a giraffe like who the fuck there's a giraffe in the swamp no it's just alligators and these people with these strange southern accents in boats and they have fishing line they catch the alligator with fishing line that sometimes they shoot the alligators but it's just alligator hunters but they call it Swamp People yeah I haven't seen that I'm not sure that's gonna be top of my list but you should invest you should invest you talk about you know doing doing a little bit of everything I remember when Jim when that movie came out up at McDonald's supersize me yes and this guy got ill and fan whatever there's Morgan Spurlock yes you know he made a good point but my favorite response to that was from McDonald's when the guy who runs McDonald's in Australia went on they took commercials and they went on air when there's this big PR storm about the terrible McDonald's food and all this kind of stuff and he went on air with these commercials I'm gonna now attempt very badly in Australian accent okay although most people who probably couldn't tell the difference apparently there's some bloke who's going around saying if you eat too much of our food and don't take any exercise you get fat well I could have told you that sweet response which is yeah all of something that's not good but a little bit it's okay that's a quite Australian response to as opposed to the measured American legalese that I probably hear from oh yeah there's no you know I have a real issue with that documentary and with he did a show also called 30 days because I know what they're doing there they're not necessarily just investigating they're also trying to achieve a desired result and that a desired result being something bad they're trying to do something that's going to be titillating and oh my goodness his liver is going bad like he's sick he's sick he's toxic there's a lot of people have called bullshit on that especially the liver toxins and all that stuff they're like where's where's the liver toxin you're dealing with carbohydrates and proteins and you know and and fats but it's not like this these things aren't toxic they're just not good they're just high in cholesterol and they're kind of fatty and sugary yeah but I know for a fact that they did some fuckery on his show he had a show called 30 days where he's trying to achieve the same results because they went to a friend of mine who's a doctor and he this doctor specializes in hormone replacement therapy for older people for older people and people that are you know like started getting older you want to replace her testosterone things along those lines and they wanted to do it in 30 days and they wanted to do it on this program take a man who's getting older and in 30 days inject him with hormones and the doctor who's an ethical doctor said you don't ever do that he said we would never do that he said what we would do is we would get you on a proper diet I would take your blood it would take a week to get your blood results back I get your blood results back I'd want to get a detailed analysis of what you're eating what you're doing what kind of a lifestyle do you have it's not a simple fix like we give you hormones so what they did is they found a quack doctor who did just shoot the guy up with hormones and the guy was like all road rage he and angry afterwards and his fucking was wife wanted to keep him chubby I mean the whole thing was a disaster it's like this is not an ethical examination of this yeah let's really it's it's like it's entertainment it's not a documentary or something it's deceiving though the problem with entertainment is it's not a puppet show okay it's not a cartoon you're pretending that you're exploring these ideas and when I was doing that sci-fi show I found some similar issues with certain producers and certain people who were used to that world of reality TV reality TV has become this very strange mishmash of choreographed choreographed scenarios and predetermined scenarios predetermined results and they do it sort of in this guise of reality TV but it's ER it's essentially it's like loosely scripted bullshit yeah and they're pretending that it's like this is what's going on in the doctor's office no you set that up that's not what goes on in a doctor's office it's not what go on in a doctor's office you're pretending because that's gonna get people to freak out they took an agenda you know that trying to make a point and they said I hope like that edits it like that right well the whole business is completely fucked because the business is started off with a bunch of people that came over from scripted shows so the legacy people that were involved in these dramatic shows where there were no until survivor came along there were no reality shows quote-unquote reality shows so I I have a deep understanding of this because I hosted Fear Factor for six years and because Fear Factor came in in 2002 which was when all the reality shows were being born so I got to see where these people had their backgrounds from and almost all of them had their backgrounds from traumas or from sitcoms or from the world of fictional shows so much so that you were considered to be like a traitor if you were involved in reality show like people people got mad at me that's saying that I was taking jobs away from writers because I was involved in in reality shows I was like oh this is a hilarious argument but these people all came from this world where you manipulate things in order to make drama so they started doing that to the quote-unquote reality shows so that's what you're getting so this 30 days show that doesn't exist anymore in supersize moon show they're you know you're tackling very complex issues and you're doing it in too entertaining form and when you do that this some integrity that sort of like goes by the wayside well I think that's right and that integrity I think I had a real example of that you in the end you're relying on the people involved to have a bit of integrity yes ethics in the way they do their jobs I just saw a little example this weekend I was out doing stuff and I did a to do with the election in my company and we did a I did an interview for the local news for the NBC News and we were doing some demos of stuff with people in Santa Monica and they wanted to film one of the people that we're doing it with you know interacting with our thing right but with our website and at that point note there weren't any people interested in doing that so one of the team said why don't we just pretend to be a member of the public doing it and it's really interesting because they said no the producer and the journalist said no no it's got to be you know a real member of the public and I thought that was really cool you know they they obviously wanted to go they were busy they had to get back to the studio they were really annoyed that they're having to wait a long time for an actual member of the public but they really did say no we're not going to fake it and it would have been so easy and no one would have noticed and in that moment it was literally just their personal integrity and it was really cool to see and I hope that's really widespread in the news business but it was just for me a really interesting example of you can make rules and you can have stuff but in the end it's about people and their choices in the moment it is interesting that they chose to do that with integrity but it's also interesting that someone suggests that they not right exactly exactly yeah that's the that's the other side of it but it was I was really pleased that that's what they decided to do I did a show for CBS once called game show in my head and the the premise of the show was you would have this little earpiece in that someone could talk to you in so I would put an earpiece in the contestants and send them out and when they would be standing somewhere I'd say okay can you hear me and they say yes all right here's what's going on and then these two guys came in with cameras that were holding cameras you are a reporter on the news here's your scenario someone called in a UFO sighting they saw a UFO sighting we brought in the cameras unfortunately that person went away so what you have to do is convince some member of the public that's around there to take that person's place and to say that they were the ones who saw this UFO and you have to get them to say that they were taken aboard this UFO and that they were examined by aliens and so the guy you know was it was kind of funny they're like okay here we go all right how do I do this what was shocking was how many people when you put that camera on them immediately said they would do it and immediately started just lying just lying it was a silver craft I mean all walks of life very few people said no that was the most shocking yeah when you had the camera on them they just started talking and they started sort of repeating these iconic images that you always hear the discs shape thing silver with there was no bolts on it they they were like going into detail and talking about the the medical examinations and and this this guy who and I think was a guy in a girl you know these contestants who had to do this we're just talking to these people and we were all the producers in the truck we're all looking at each other like wow people are fucking full of shit this is so weird it's so weird how easy it is for some people to just justify making up a story just in order for them to be on camera yeah but what did you think it's because they just it's the camera they want to be on the camera is that they want to please the other person they want to be on TV look clever what it could be that as well but I think most likely it's they want to be on television so they could go home set their DVR and you know it's it's not a ton of time that's me fucking lying you know they just wanted to be on television I think for a lot of people in this day and age that is just some sort of a weird ultimate goal just to have that camera on them and then they go home and see it right whether it makes sense or not and for a lot of folks it doesn't make sense a lot of folks you know they want ones of ruining their lives you know they they find out how other people feel about them plus you expose yourself to the critique of millions of anonymous people filled with hate filled with hate and disappointment their own life and just ready to spew venom in your direction they just can't win that shit all over used evil well this is judge you this we had another thing this weekend we went out and made a little film just to test that out about the elections going on in in in LA and we literally went up to people and made up candidates that are running for Congress and and asked what they thought about that you know and what do you think of Angelina Jolie running for Congress and they told ya I was so excited when I heard that that's great you know I think she's great just that you can't believe how people just engage with these things this may just made it up and like you were saying with the UFO thing he was like going on about it it wasn't just saying yeah I heard about that that's great he was sort of embellishing it and talking about it people are fucking strange man there's strange and that's a real problem when it comes to politics or anything when you're allowing people to make choices that can affect others people are weird you know and a good percentage of them are really dumb and uninformed and not interested I mean they when you say dumb and uninformed here's what I think when I say that what when I'm saying dumb what I mean is if the human mind is essentially say if everyone has the exact same physical structure the exact same genetics the exact same hormonal system and one person does yoga every day and eats healthy and does chin-ups in the morning when they wake up and drinks a lot of water and the other person sits in front of the TV likes to smoke cigarettes eats nothing but sugar you get to see the results of the one person being very aware of their body and taking care of their body and the other person not well you get that same effect with life you get that same effect with how you approach the world itself some people approach the world through this lazy disconnected you know like pop culture obsessed nonsensical just pop culture it's obsessive talking to you fuck he's a little pop-culture upside not too bad Jimmy's aware of a lot of other shit too but some people just they don't enrich their life they don't enrich their mind they don't they're not they're not curious and those people with all these poor decisions and drug addictions and the life's a mess they have an equal say to the person who's rational and aware and kind and objective equal say and I think that's one of the weirdest things about communities about culture it's about trying to figure out how do you mitigate the effects of the lazy how do you how do you deal with the effects of the morons like when when you have a riot and people start pulling white people out of cars and throwing rocks at their heads which they've had in Los Angeles in the past especially after the Rodney King beating and things along those lines just random white people just attack them well how do you how do you how do you allow when you see the these things can happen and I just use that in its example it could be million other things that are really stupid that people do how could it be that one person gets one vote and another person who is very aware another person who's very educated another person who's very kind and very sympathetic to all walks of life it's a an equal vote one person could be a total racist you could you could go to a voting booth with a t-shirt on it says fuck black people and you could vote and no one could stop you you know as long as you especially if you have a shirt sort of like a flannel shirt that's over the t-shirt that says fuck black people so you have to really look hard to see fuck black people and you think you're getting over no one can stop you you know and it's I think one of the things that they were trying to work around when they developed the concept of a representative democracy there the concept of America a representative government so like okay let's sort of them have some filters in place we use voting but you're kind of voting on a representative and the representative sort of votes for you they interpret what you I think that's that's definitely part of the idea I think that when you I mean that that point you just made about the it really reminds me actually the racist point you mentioned made there was a really effective commercial for Rock the Vote I remember years ago and in the UK when I was back there at the time and they they literally had a some image of it wasn't images like a TV ad of a rate of the racist guy like spewing racist stuff and then the the tagline for the ad was you'd better vote because you can be sure that he will know really you know good way of making that point but I think that generally you know those kind of people are the extreme I think the idea is that most people are not you know the kind of extreme end of it where they're either totally and where their views is just completely abhorrent or they are just completely off the page in terms of their knowledge you got you know majority of people who are basically interested in good things happening I think the problem is they just don't know how enough about it they're the information they get is not interesting it's not presented in a good way there's other interesting things going on they're busy with their life you know they want to get involved and so what happens and I think this is happening more and more is you end up with a smaller and smaller group of people who basically control the political system because the mass of people are just not interested they're turned off they think that getting involved won't make any difference and so what you end up with is people with a lot of money special interests those who you know the kind of professionals of the political game running everything and that actually makes people even less inclined to get involved because they see what's happening think oh well why should I bother it's a really bad cycle I think yeah and then people start saying things like oh the New World Order's in control anyway the Bilderberg Group is in control anyway and there was some thing yesterday that was in the news where one of the members of the Bilderberg Group in I think he's some Dutch guy had some impromptu public discussion with all these people and they start bringing out all these details of 9/11 you know 9/11 those that the building was brought down thermite and they stood and they circle this guy and start talking to him and it's it's kind of fascinating you know this this idea of the Illuminati the this idea of a small group of people controlling everyone through iconic symbolism eyeballs inside of pyramids and all that stuff becomes in a lot of ways a vehicle for for feeling unempowered that feeling that's exactly franchised that's what's good I think that's that's how people feel yeah and I certainly noticed I to work back in the UK and the government and I noticed that there I've been in politics a long time that's how people feel there is even more so here I think you know if you just look today we're speaking on election day in California is the primaries everyone saying it's gonna be the lowest turnout ever no one's interested because they don't think it makes any difference I think that's the real problem and they feel you know the whole idea of democracy is people power is that you have the power everyone that like you saying everyone has the same chance to influence things and they have the power but that is not what it feels like to people yeah and then every now and then something comes along where they're like how the hell did that pass and then they free yeah exactly like Proposition 8 where they repealed gay marriage and everybody's like are you fucking kidding me in California you repealed gay marriage the most shocking thing about Proposition 8 to me was that over almost over the the majority of black people voted for it they voted to my field gay marriage they didn't want gay marriage which is you know quite hilarious if you start thinking about people that have been persecuted right I mean who has been a victim of unfair discrimination in this country more than black people probably know I don't know because I wasn't involved in any way but I've heard when you look at the day exactly to your point that that was one of the reasons and that was particularly the case because it was in the year when Obama was running and you had a high turnout amongst those people who sigh Slee because you had the first like candidate on the ballot for president so he had more black people voting and that was one of the consequences yes % I don't know if that's right but that's certainly what some of argued do you know how crazy 70 percent that's the exit poll that's 70 percent of black people voted for proposition 8 that's stunning and the idea being for a lot of them there is it was a religious decision yeah I think that was a big that's a big part of the story that's told someone should tap challenge that and what they should do is they should make some sort of a proposition banning shrimp you know like like have like these big signs in front of Red Lobster you know Genisys like whatever whatever the quote in the Bible that says you because there's four times as many references to shellfish as there is to gay people it's like there's like a lot of references to like that you're not supposed to eat shrimp but you can go to an all you need buffet and people right after church that's really a right I don't know how we allow it you're right needs to be stopped it's bad but they can't that for whatever reason the gay thing like really locked onto people like they really got into it they really got into it for whatever reason you know the gay the gay decision the decision to stop gay marriage seemed to be like a one that Jesus was really serious about that shrimp thing then pick and choose pick and choose you know you're not supposed to get tattooed how many religions people have crosses tattooed on their body I mean that's the fucking that's like directly is that it no I didn't know that oh yeah tattoos no yeah round upon yeah you're not supposed to mark yourself okay you're not supposed to tattoo yourself that's that's against God's wish but people will tattoo themselves with biblical verses just yeah hilarious yeah well people are weird you know and that my point that I was trying to make clumsily earlier was that it's kind of strange that we are so varied and it's kind of strange that everyone does get like if there's three of us in a room you know we have to we off to all decide and if one of us is retarded not literally but our people with Down syndrome or people that are anyone that it's like mentally compromised are they allowed to vote I mean is there some sort of a test if you imply that I don't know what the rules are I think in the in the in Britain it was something to do with I think the only thing was if you're in jails I can't remember well if you're a felon in America we don't ever let you recover we don't ever let you recover from that so if you're a felon you don't get to vote yeah you fucked up too much what you never can no I don't believe so I'm pretty sure felons don't get to vote because Joey Diaz always talks about that don't get too well I know they can't carry firearms yeah state felon voting laws guess it looks like it's different in every state two states allow felons to vote from prison while other states may permanently prevent felons from voting even after being released so it's different it varies from state to state it's amazing permanently prevent yeah they lose they vote they cannot vote permanently in 11 states Alabama Arizona Delaware Florida Iowa Kentucky Mississippi Nevada Tennessee coincidentally all places I would never fucking live how weird oh yeah you're worried about the rules I think that that is amazing to me that there's a which means this assumption that there's no chance you can don't get it back you know turn it around never thank you can make a felony when you're 18 like some stupid thing you go to jail you come out and become like the best person ever and they're never gonna let you return that's ridiculous I mean that's the whole point of what you try and do with you know the criminal justice system and so on is to try and exactly you know rehabilitate people so they don't offend again I mean that's and try and get people to that point yeah I think people are just so tired of people just fucking up that they're like you know what this is a good way to keep fuck-ups from voting like once like the idea that we were talking about earlier that you know a person could be a racist a person could be a completely nutter and still vote along with a person who's really kind and educated and so their vote counts equally they're in a community that assumes that nutter robbed something that goes it's a good way to cut them out of the system all right fuck that guy you can't vote anymore yeah which I guess kind of makes sense but maybe it's just a numbers thing if there's 10 people on an island we would have to rehabilitate the guy who stole the coconuts we have to say come on man you can't be stealing everybody's coconuts this is a fucked-up way to live your life and you should contribute stop stealing fish stop stealing coconuts getting together and then we let that guy yeah be a part of consuming by the way I think it's an important point about about democracy generally I think the closer it is to a real community where everyone knows each other right where the decisions are made kind of by people who can look the other person in the eye and all that I think they're gonna be better I think one of the problems is that you've got these big big systems and they're they're they're kind of really far from the human level where that kind of trust can be established and that is one of the problems with with a lot of things in government and politics it's all just too big and removed from that human scale well that's a problem with a lot of things when it comes to human beings just diffusion of responsibility that comes with being a part of a massive group like war yeah the idea that if there's 300 million of us and a million of us are overseas you know fighting for freedom that's sort of like you you could deal with that because it's not happening in calabasas you know you can go to work and you could deal with your life and in your the scope of your world it doesn't come up but you kind of peripherally aware that this is happening somewhere else but if people in van nuys were going to war with people in Studio City and it was only a couple miles away and you had to deal with that then it would be something we would have to try to calm down we'd have to try to deal with this like what what's fuck's going on here like what are we doing here we'd have to it's it's something you have to deal with but the the sheer number of human beings that are involved in the world today in communities and cultures it's just it's almost unmanageable so I manageable for a person who's not designed for that we're designed essentially to deal with our immediate atmosphere we're designed to deal with small tribes of people friends family the people that you know the people that you keep close and when you get past that it's just like almost like what do we I don't know what to do with this and so we pass the buck off to some representative I think this is such an important point I really do believe that I think that so many things don't work because they get away from the point where you can really know the other person and all the other group that you're with there's some guy in England that I think at Cambridge University it's some research about the maximum number of people that you can really have any kind of human relationship with at any one time I think you got to a number 150 Dunbar's number is that is that right so yeah and all about it than I do I thought that was just a really interesting perspective on it which yeah which is that after that it just gets to diffuse we're not designed for it's like your phone your phones only has a certain amount of data that old fucking goofy flip phone you carry around with you if you have an older one like one of those Motorola StarTAC s-- you know remember those from back in the day big fuckin goofy clunky thing I mean that probably only carried 100 phone numbers yeah I don't know how many they had but that the amount of data that you can store new devices represents the need that we have but we have these same biological hard drives that cavemen did I mean they're not really much different than people that lived a million years ago I mean how much it has it changed I mean how many how many how much more room do we have for social relationships apparently not much like fifty thousand years ago and today if you could took a guy who lived fifty thousand years ago and a guy who lived today and you compare the brains how much would they vary you could take a fifty thousand year old man dress him up and close and and sit him down in a movie theater and you'd walk right by him you wouldn't even know when you're sitting in your seat you wouldn't go holy shit that's a fucking caveman I mean the guy would look very remarkably similar to how you look and I look and how normal folks look today yeah we're not designed for this world that we've created and it's it's popped up so damn quick yeah exactly it's really the last kind of well definitely last 100 years but you know and it's just getting faster and faster you know this kind of everything becoming really kind of organized this sort of inhuman level and this mad struggle to sort of organize it and to try to control it and just just calm it down get a handle on the effects of it and I think in a lot of ways that's what you're doing with this crowd packed thing with this crowd packed thing is you are utilising these tools these tools of the internet and this instant access to information that we have today to sort of establish a much clearer sense of where political candidates are coming from and what are their influences as far as who is financing them where is you know where's their money coming from where are their decisions headed towards what what are they what are they doing right now yeah I think that's that's a really good summary of it which is that basically we think that what we when you talk to people about politics one of the things they say is that we just don't know enough about it we don't know enough information generally but we don't know we don't have information we can trust we have all this spin and ads and all the rest of it from the politicians we can't really believe them there's all this stuff around on the Internet I don't know what to believe so what we're trying to do is give people really objective information that they can rely on to figure out where the politicians are on the issues that they care about and the thing that we found from our research is that as my um one of my co-founders Adam who's a professor at Stanford has been working on this for many years and basically what he's shown is that the best way to predict what a politician will do if they're elected is to look at where they get their money and to look at also who they give money to because most politicians also kind of donate to other candidates so if you look at all that campaign finance information the money behind this politician that is going to give you the best guide to what they're really going to do in office and it's something that you can actually what we're trying to use like turn that into really simple information that you can without kind of reading tons of stuff and doing loads of research you can get a quick snapshot of who these people are and then in time the other thing we want to do is make it possible for you to find the politicians that are really good or bad on the issues that you care about and get involved in their campaigns because the other thing is that you've got a tiny tiny number of people who are funding all these campaigns if you look at the the total number of people who put money into politics it's a really small number compared to the number of people who vote and then the number of adults in the whole country it's a tiny number that are funding it all and even within that most of the money comes from an even smaller number and they're paying for all of this and they're getting the outcomes that they pay for it's basically a transaction that's what's really crazy and so some people say right you got to get money out of politics that's you just got to get it out and obviously that is something that has a lot of appeal you can see why you'd want to do that there's a brilliant guy called Larry Lessig I don't know if you come across what he's been doing and he's been arguing about this for years and he's been saying he's a hobbit Harvard is a brilliant campaigner on this issue of money in politics and he's been saying if you think about any problem in in America today whatever the issue is that you care about if that's gay marriage or the environment or it doesn't matter what it is you're not gonna get anywhere about in terms of solving that problem unless you deal with the first problem which is the money because the money in politics stops the proper solutions from being developed because what it means is that you've got the special interests and whether that's left or right it doesn't matter whether it's big businesses or unions doesn't matter they want their particular outcome and they're buying it through the system so we've got to get the money out and he's got a campaign around that and and he wants public funding for elections and so on and all that is kind of a noble aim I guess but my feeling is that that's a really hard sell because you've got a constitution that says it's free speech you're allowed to give money to to politicians and we can't just kind of stop that you've got to let people donate to politicians and so our take on it is to say well if you can't take the money out let's at least dilute the influence of the people there right now by letting more people making it easier for more people to get involved and give money to these candidates so they are not dependent on these big donors with their particular interests and that's really what we're trying to do is kind of make it easier for people to get involved in politics so that they can really you know get these politicians off this hook theorem which is that their dependence on these donors for their campaign spending which means that once they're elected it's kind of inevitable that they pay attention to them rather than the people who elected them in a lot of ways it mirrors the influence that the internet has had on the news itself because the news used to be distributed only through these proper channels whether it was NBC CBS and then you know the cable news network - CNN Fox and all this jazz but now it's become this thing where websites develop Huffington Post all these the Young Turks which is an internet-based news show and they have no censorship they have no restrictions they have no influence other than the ones that they choose to accept or the ideas that they bring and they have the same amount of distribution that everybody else does and you can have a website just know Mike's fuckhead com yeah and put it up and if enough people find it valid and interesting he could have a million hits a day unique visits a day and it might be more than CNN gets and just simply because of the fact that it's a good information it's a nice well you've shown that with this I mean you know you're reaching more people than the most of these well I think all of these news sites just ten and a half million emelles like more than just about anything else well it's crazy this is exponentially doubling and tripling and what's happening is it's all being done with no promotion I mean the only promotion is like I let people know hey Steve Hilton's on today yeah and then just from oh yeah I mean that's respected to hear that from Twitter and just spreading the word yeah but what I was getting at is that like the same way the Internet has sort of interfered with the distribution of information look at what's going on with this Edward Snowden case is a perfect example this massive change in the way the entire country looks at the NSA and government spying was done by one man leaking information to one guy in one source which spread through the internet and then boom it blossoms this huge news story that was essentially if he had sent that same story through the proper channels so like the New York Times or CNN they've referred the fuck out of it they would have figured out a way to cover that thing and throw it under the rug and staple that rug down and light it on fire I mean what he did was figure out a way to distribute things for this and through this new channel and essentially that's what the internet is doing with with voting before something like the internet came along it was very difficult to find out who the influences of all these different individual candidates were with something like crowd packed it becomes much more easy and that also will change the way these people interact with yes I think and and you know I really hope that that is you know we're just at the start of it to be honest I think that the political world is really late for this kind of change compared to like you say with media and other things right and things that we experience you know everyday in our lives like you know like travel and booking to you know there they used to be a you know time when you know to get an airline ticket you'd like to sort of physically go to some shop and then have these like weird paper to you know the whole thing just feels so antiquated and now it's so simple it's really like you're saying oh it's him you've got the power to do it you're empowered now you get it on your phone you have to have a ticket and that's your phone over the scanner thing and that hasn't really happened to politics yet but that is what we're trying to do because and others as well it's not just us but you know I think that we've got something interesting here which is this way of giving people objective information about the candidates based on who gives them money but but overall we're part of this movement of trying to really put power in people's hands through technology and I'm sure it's gonna happen I'm really sure because people want it you know they are sick of just feeling that that they don't get any response in these people over here control everything and nothing ever really changes and actually the politicians themselves in my experience they you know you think well maybe I would say this because I used to work in politics myself for the prime minister in the UK so I kind of know them they they're kind of used to be my world that used to be my world my feeling is that generally the politicians actually hate this just as much as everyone else they hate the fact that they have to spend so much time raising money you know literally there was this document that was leaked to the New York Times I think a while back from the Democratic leadership in Congress where they gave a kind of guide to the newly elected members of Congress about how they should spend their time and there's a recommendation to the newly elected members of Congress and it went through how much how many hours a day they should spend of different types of activity you know thinking about policy talking to constituents this kind like half of the time is four hours was recommended that they spend on fundraising Wow right and so the people who go into policies they don't want to live like that they actually hate it they hate you know being shoved in a room which is what happens and being they call it dialing for dollars you know like just literally sitting on the phone trying to raise money that's not why they went into politics how do they do that they just call random people up or do they list of potential the only give I don't know cuz I've never done it but I think they I think that's literally at their given list of likely people so they just do t eat eat eat hi I'm running for Congress in the 33rd district and now I'd like to get gay marriage the fuck out of here what do you think I think it's pretty much like that I don't know you can talk to some people who know more about it but um you know so I think actually the politicians themselves mostly hate the system and so I think that you know a lot of there's a lot of that effort actually in Congress to try and encourage more small donors and make it easier for people to give money because actually that that's what they want to they they don't like being beholden to these big donors in these companies and you know they don't like it any more than we like it I think ultimately the idea of leaders whether it's presidential leaders or whether it's representatives I think ultimately that's gonna go away and my thought about it is that anybody who really wants to lead everyone else it's probably an asshole you know I mean anybody who really wants to be the king like why do you want to be the king like don't you have things to do don't you have hobbies and creative pursuits and like what why would you want to just be the guy who gets to control be the one who stands at the podium ladies and gentlemen you know that's that's a weird ego thing yeah I think that in 2014 and the world that we live in today where we're seeing this much more even distribution of influence yeah I think that ultimately that's gonna be one of those things that gets called into question why do we have an alpha representative why do we have to have this head monkey in charge I really agree with it I mean a lot of the things that I was trying to do when I was in the government in the UK and and it's kind of part of what we're doing with crown pack is is you know trying to encourage that even distribution that more even distribution app and redistribute power from the kind of traditional sources of power and kind of central leadership putting power in people's hands so that they can control more and more aspects of their life because in the end they'll make better decisions overall and it's also just more healthy I think going back to what we're saying earlier about you know the way people can only know some on a number of people and and if you give them power to shape more of the things that happen in their lives I think that actually they will take more responsibility they'll be more responsible in a community sense you'll just see everything get better if you take power out of the hands of these sort of lead it leaders and central organisations and put it in the hands of people definitely I think I think you're right I think there's also an issue of it being overwhelming the amount of information that you have to absorb whenever you deal with political issues whenever you deal with campaigns whenever you deal with new elections you know you're given this pamphlet of different people and the different propositions that are up for vote and you just get overwhelmed yeah specially if you're if you have a job that's taxing as it is and you have a family and you know you're thinking about golfing on the weekend god I'd like to go golfing and you look at all this bullshit and like oh I can't even pay attention to this is everything okay right now yes well fucking let me just get this over with and let's hope everything stays ok and very few people take responsibility for what gets voted in yeah and it is I think you're right though it is really Tom it's hard it's easy to say oh the voters are lazy or whatever they should be but honestly like you say they've got real lives to live and they've got time for all this stuff and that is a really big part of why we want to make it simple you know we're assuming that people want to spend less time doing this stuff not more time right and I think a lot of the kind of organizations and people that have tried to get people you know mobilised you know civic organization and the kind of you know that kind of thing you know it's work to a certain extent with some people but for the majority of people they just don't want to do it they they can't do it actually they're literally too busy with things that are higher priorities like their kids and their family and their job or whatever it may be hobbies doesn't matter it's stuff that they choose to do and that's fine that's their life and we shouldn't kind of require that you have to spend ages figuring out this political stuff and that's why we're trying to make it really simple for people but based on quite a lot of complex what technology allows you to do you can take quite a lot of complex data and information like we're doing with the campaign finance records where it's literally hundreds of millions of pieces of information and we're boiling it down into one piece of information which is a score like where is this candidate on the on their scale of liberal to conservative where do they sit and where are they on each issue that's what we're trying to do to make it really simple isn't it sort of analogous in a way to what we were talking about about the amount of people that you can keep in your brain Dunbar's number yeah is that if you lived in a small tribe if say if we all live 50 of us together in some small village somewhere we really wouldn't have votes about gay marriage and we really wouldn't have coasts about exactly there's be a million different things that would never be up for vote and if someone really did start micromanaging everyone's lives you'd be like hey you know Mike is an asshole we gotta kick him out of this fuckin tribe this guy's trying to get people to wear purple and you know where certain Nikes during different moon cycles and make tribal rules and rituals and make all these things standard and you know for whatever reason he doesn't like men sleeping with men like he's got some weird thing you know he believes it's so true I just so agree with that one of my favorite things that one of the these experiments that happened was in Holland I think I've got that right in in in Europe and they did this brilliant experiment with traffic where they in a town I think it was Friesland or something like that probably got that wrong where they literally took away all the traffic so all of them everything right they took away traffic lights they even took it we know stop signs everything even the the markings on the road so they took away the white line in the middle of the road everything all gone and their theory was that without that kind of external rule making and kind of stuff going on to tell you what to do people would have to kind of relate to each other as other people and just figure it out amongst themselves so they would you know have to look other people in the eye and and sort of work it out between them and they found they had this brilliant effect which was that accidents fell to zero the traffic improved the traffic speed was lower but the traffic flow was much better it just worked all around all the kind of things that you try and do when all these people thinking about traffic planning and whatever they achieved all those aims by literally taking everything away and just allowing people to relate to each other as humans and I thought it's such a great little story and I think that you could do that in all sorts of areas if you just leave it to people to figure out on a small scale where they can relate to each other you just get a much better result isn't that the issue though the small scale yeah we're dealing with I drove here today I live about 20 minutes from here and in the drive from my house to here I didn't know anybody I don't know any of those fucking people they might not even be real there might be robots that were sent from the government to pretend anything and that alien II was maybe even I don't know them you know so that there's there's there's that issue whereas everyone in Friesland or wherever the fuck that place was in Holland those those people probably all know each other you know it's a small area there's not a lot when you get to some weird number like the 20 million people that are live in the Greater Los Angeles area that's just too crazy it's too it's too nutty and there's nothing less human than a light a stop light red means stop green means go wait look at it it's green go I mean it's so disconnected yeah from human interaction and without it we become crippled there's no better chance that you're gonna run into a traffic stop or a traffic jam then if a cop is directing if there's a cop it's standing there telling you people go forward and you people stop for sure that guy's fuckin that intersection up sideways every time I go into one of those situations where a light is down and there's a cop standing there it's a fucking disaster whereas if it was just a light it's just red light green light everything seems to work because we're sort of programmed to wait for that light and like you just yeah you can follow that if that cop is there like oh this motherfucker look at it no wonder this thing's a mess it's a person out there telling us when we can go fuck him who's he yes asshole fat fuck telling me when to go you know and this is this weirdness involved and all of a sudden there's a human element that's been thrown into our robot light thing and then there's a you know there's cameras that they were putting on them for a while which were hilarious on the actual cops no no on the lights cuz they're doing that too I think on the cop yeah yeah they should they should do that on all cops because you do that on all cops everything a cop does all throughout the day should be recorded and it should be untampered though they shots what that that I think that's what they're trying to do so much abuse it's just massive amounts of abuse when it comes to police officers and I think there's a lot of great cops out there it's not that I don't believe in law enforcement but I believe many of them are abusive fucks and many of them are psychologically unable to deal with the demands of an incredibly stressful life yeah I really talk I completely agree with the way you put it that there's tons of them that are great and then there are others that totally abused their position and that's it's another really interesting example of how technology can be really helpful in in a way because you can you can have that I think I saw that they're trying to do in here the LAPD that if you put the cameras on and you can't mess around with them that's a really powerful incentive huge to behave right complaints have dropped dramatically and they've dropped dramatically because cops can't be cunts anymore I mean it's really that simple it really is that simple what I was talking about was that traffic they were having lights like if you were going through the light as it was yellow and it turned red they would flash so if your wheels were not you know it was if they were in front of the line you hadn't made it across before the light turned red they would give you a ticket and but it would turn out to be a private company that was actually profiting from these tickets and so they deemed that unconstitutional and they removed all those lights but people were just in a goddamn uproar it was just madness everywhere you go they're taking you'd see flashes going off at traffic lights in all was his revenue it wasn't preventing people from running lights or preventing people from you know gunning it when the light turns yellow it was just just fucking people out of their money and it was just one more thing where they complicate the system for you they add one more element that makes it one more thing you have to think about one more little piece of control and one more dehumanizing aspect people like freedom and one of the reasons why people like freedom is because freedom isn't just the freedom to do as you wish it's the freedom to not have to think about a bunch of other shit and be influenced by a bunch of other shit that takes your time away and takes your your energy away and I think that's where we're at when it comes to a lot of these propositions and a lot of these really rubra complicated things that are involved in our day to day lives it's like we've complicated ourselves to this point of almost of no return and where there's a very few very few alternatives yeah I think that the thing that happens then is that they've complicated it then it's not working and they say oh we could better try and fix it and then the the fixing of it makes it even more complicated and it's just getting there and then a new government comes in or a new governor or whoever it may be and and instead of actually just stopping and thinking you know what this hot we just got to rethink the whole thing and start from scratch and and just not tinker with it anymore and try and improve it because it's just gonna make it more complicated that never happens there's never really enough time for that to happen they're not there they're only thinking about the next couple of years in the next election or whatever and so things just get even more complicated never they never seem to get to that point weapon yeah that's really working great now my wife and I went out to this restaurant the other night and the the restaurant was this we were noticing that there's this theme that's going on and a lot of restaurants where they have like this rustic thing going on where they have old-school lights the filaments in them and then they have hardwood tables and wrought iron this and metal that and and I was like I think people are sort of reacting to this fabricated world that we've created and we long for this simplicity that's why there's these shows like these Alaska shows where people living on the frontier and they're fucking collecting wood and fighting off wolves it's like we almost long for that simplicity above this world that we've complicated to this almost unmanageable point yeah it's definitely true and you see in in so many eras that I mean it's like food is a great example well there's kind of stuff about organic food and seasonal and local and grow it in your garden and that whole movement I think is in reaction I mean if you think about food like years ago like in the 50s I think you know it was all about you know let's have you know the all the kind of TV dinners packaged food and all this kind of industrialized food that was then seen as better because it was you know scientific and hygienic and like really kind of good for you and then people are now just thinking that is just really horrible this is all the chemicals it's disgusting now the movement is all for this kind of local organic food it made me laughter because my family from Hungary and so when I was a kid we used to go back to Hungary the whole time it was a communist country and there were no you know food stores loads of choice and everything and you would go in the store and it was just you know what you got just a few sort of vegetables and it was it was just very basic and now remember the other day walking around in San Francisco and there's the kind of farmers market thing going on and they had that kind of you know ugly vegetables and whatever put out there and he just looked exactly like hungry the Hungarian communist food shop but here in San Francisco it's the most expensive fancy amazing food that you can get but it just makes me laugh really it's just I think a lot of it is just you know you know reaction to what's gone before and we're currently I think you're totally right in this kind of sense of he's just gone too far the whole industrialization of so many different aspects of our lives well as also we're starting to realize where people live in cities and they look around and they see all these buildings and they see this asphalt and they see these telephone poles and they go there's no food here we have to bring in the food like this is kind of crazy like and then you get on top of a building and you look around and how far the no food here area is it's pretty goddamn big and then you look at all the different people that live in the no food here area that require food you're like fuck we got to feed these fucking people and then you go where's this water coming from and then you go oh it comes from Colorado what the water comes from fucking what it comes from the Colorado River Oh No so the only way we get water in California is we have to take it from thousands of way thousands of miles away that's the only this is a crazy place to be like we're in this unsustainable environment and new people who here every day new thousand people every day boom boom boom set up a fucking house built this another structure boom and then we slowly push out our no food here area deeper and deeper into the desert and you know no one's thinking about where this goes and so far so good sustainable go to the farmers market you can get plenty good groceries but very bizarre if there's somehow or another some cut off of our oil supply some some way where we can't travel as easily anymore we're in a real rut it's a bit not a good spot it's not ideally every neighborhood should have like a couple of acres where it's set up where you grow food yeah like that would commune was just totally grew that there's a there's a brilliant guy I don't you come across and called Nassim Taleb he wrote this book called the Black Swan and he was really um he's a he's a mathematician and he was in the financial markets and and he really kind of predicted the crash and understood all that and he great and one of his big points is that these big systems that we've ended up with and the word he uses are they've completely fragile they're really they look kind of big and and and solid but actually we're so dependent on them that it makes us really fragile if they collapse or fall over or whatever whether that's a company or some government system we're really screwed because they're we're so dependent and that's really a kind of fragile situation and so that's definitely one of the reasons I love what he writes about and talks about is that he's arguing for exactly that kind of thing you know making sure that companies don't get too big to fail not just in the financial sector a lot of people have talked about that with the banks there's too big to fail argument but in every area with the food system and other types of businesses where we're so dependent if something went wrong we you know we couldn't cope with it and when you have small distributed it's just like we're talking earlier about the power being distributed it's not just voting power and political power its economic power it's social pact every type of power it's just going to be much better for us if it's distributed more broadly and we're a long way from that it's actually going in the other direction yeah it's going the other direction and very few cities are diminishing in population unless there's something horribly wrong like Detroit where if have you ever been to Detroit I have not it's fascinating while you're over here in America and you're enjoying our fine country you should go see our biggest disaster because Detroit at one point in time was this economic stronghold for America that's where we built Camaros and Corvettes and Firebirds and it was this place where it was where America built what it built best which is besides buildings it's cars America built cars and it all fucking fell apart it fell apart when they started moving jobs to Mexico and all in other countries it fell apart when they started producing shittier and shittier cars and when there's all sorts of complications with unions and with a million different problems and then slowly but surely they started diminishing these these factories and there's a really interesting documentary I don't know if you watched Michael Moore's first documentary Roger and me and did you ever see yeah Roger me was all about Flint Michigan it was about his hometown where they closed down these plants and then these people went into immediate massive poverty and it was a huge huge issue and if you go to Detroit today you could buy a house for five hundred dollars and I'm not bullshitting they have houses for sale I was there five hundred bucks and it's a mess it's a real mess I mean if they're there's in areas where they're trying to gentrify these areas and they're building local businesses and they're trying to you know encourage growth and you know I mean if a company wanted to move there they have a massive amount of people that are looking for jobs and cheap land and it's a good idea it's a good place to start but very very difficult to encourage people to do so so Detroit shows how easy things could fall apart and there's been a bunch of blogs that have been created where they've websites where they've shown how these trees and nature are taking over these areas that used to be populated where trees are that's amazing I remember that not yeah bear bears are moving into these areas that used to be at least to have you know towns and bears are slowly starting moving their way into Detroit and it's fucking crazy yeah but that's that shows you how easily it could all fall apart whereas you know 50 60 years ago here's some here's an image that Jamie just put up there's your trees that are growing inside of this abandoned building they're just growing through the floor and eventually they'll make their way through the roof and the roof will rot and it just shows you how easy it is for nature to reclaim areas that human beings feel like if well this is a city now now it's a city for now you know it's not a city now it's not permanently a city like this is trees just go you're um go to the airport drive down Sepulveda there's areas where it's really old roads and these trees have grown up through the sidewalks so bad that the sidewalks are you know you can't walk on them I mean they're they're like ramps because the tree has slowly but surely lifted up the concrete of the sidewalk as trying to reclaim this area they've put this stupid rock paste over yeah you know I think that's like one of the best examples of how easy it could all fall apart yeah and the kiss was that point about being dependent on something yeah but it's interesting cuz you're a lot of I mean I've loved going around other than getting to know other American cities I mean they I mean that's a bad example you've got some really great cities you know that seem to be thriving and working and they're just really cool places to to live and work I love Chicago as an amazing car is fantastic but then you've got a huge problem with the with the crisis just so interesting how you have a city that is so great in so many ways and there and they've got this sort of pocket of real poverty and crime and that's been going on for years and despite all the other advantages and they've got a lot of you know great economic growth going on there and so on and people visiting and it's great but they still got this product.this entrenched problem with crime and gun violence and you know it's just it's interesting how how long it takes for some of these problems to be worked out yeah Chicago is a disaster in that sense it's a great city but it's also a disaster in the sense of crime and gang violence and I was there I was talking to this guy was a cop and he's explaining it to me that a big problem is the drug trade and that certain gang members were incarcerated and because they were incarcerated they created a vacuum that was there was a power struggle to try to fill the vacuum that power struggle started this sort of violent war going on between all these different criminal factions and then you know it builds up and you know he was really kind of interesting because he was talking about it goes you know what the best way to fix it he goes legalize drugs he goes nobody wants to hear about it but the reason why they're making all this money is is because they're selling something that's illegal and so when sell you're selling something that's illegal the only people that are doing that are the people that are criminals and he goes as soon as you make it legal you deal with a personal choice issue and the guy was like very rational about it it was like you dealing with the personal choice issue instead of a crime issue but I think that's exactly right I think is one of the more kind of interesting ways into that whole drug legalization argument is is to think about the the social problems that come from the current rules not not just you know the a lot of times people talk about the drug use being a social problem but actually it's everything that comes from it the crime and the gangs and and that's I think the you know the the most intelligent argument for legalization yeah and there was a real interesting article recently about Mexico where they were talking about the cartels like hemorrhaging money because they relied on marijuana trade and now with legal marijuana just legal marijuana in Colorado and in Washington State and then all the medical places have massively diminished the amount of influence that these guys have of the amount of wealth that they can get from selling illegal drugs because people don't need it anymore it's super easy to get so like the marijuana trade which is one of the most common drugs it's kind of drying up for them and so they're scrambling to try to find some other avenues of revenue it's pretty interesting stuff because it just shows people this is this is what you do when you make things illegal and it's we should have figured it out in the 1920s with Prohibition I mean it's amazing that people are so goofy today that they still are dealing with the same issue that they kind of resolved in the 1920s yeah almost a hundred years ago they figure this out with alcohol and they have to relearn the same lesson with with cannabis it's just it's nutty and it's again it's another thing where it's a personal issue where you have just too many goddamn laws you have too many restrictions on personal exactly right and it's interesting I think that the the politicians have been put off for a long time from from doing anything about it by the kind of reaction that they'll think they'll get from certain parts of the press and so on but actually I think that's changing and it's changing really quickly here in America yeah and the fact that you've got these ballot measures that are winning in different states and that's just going to accelerate I think not just that the amount of revenue they pull in with no resistance whatsoever Colorado has thirty nine percent tax revenue on marijuana that's sold recreationally thirty nine percent and everyone there's like okay 39 percent school they're like no one's arguing over the most preposterous sales rate ever that is 39% it's fucking crazy it's basically the government is a drug dealer I mean that's what it is I mean so you're not just taking taxes you're fucking a partner you're a partner in this thirty nine percent is a big partner you're at almost 40 percent okay and then they're making over a hundred million dollars a year in tax revenue just in the state of Colorado so when that kind of money starts coming in then the that money has influence and then they have to respect the pot dollar because the pot dollar is gonna be a lobby just like anything else just like the pharmaceutical Lobby just like the natural resource lobby just like anything else the pot lobby is gonna be legit now because there's gonna be a tremendous amount of revenue available and big business that there's big businesses that are moving into Colorado right now an establishing warehouse warehouse spaces in Colorado are just they're evaporating they're disappearing left and right because people just picking them up there the way Colorado's laws are set up in order to sell marijuana you have to grow marijuana so if you wanted to open up a shop in Colorado you'd have to grow your own stuff and then sell it you can't buy it from someone else and then sell it so they're just giant warehouses everywhere being scooped up and they're setting up these massive grow-ops and then they're funneling that money because it's being sold legally to funneling that money right back into the state at a rate of 39% it's crazy and huge companies are slowly but surely creeping their way towards Colorado because they realized this is this is a multi-billion dollar industry in just a couple of years you're looking at three four five years from now a multi-billion dollar industry nationwide places where they're having serious money issues serious problems with generating tax revenue all of the sudden all the profits that are going to illegal sales of marijuana now thirty nine percent of that money is gonna come right to the taxpayers or right to the tax collectors and if they got any um I guess it's a bit early but I just wondering what the what they're seeing in terms of people's behavior the usage lower crowd they are the drug is that right lower crime and lower murderer murder rates have dropped in Denver yeah of course they're high tonight they're gonna get twice well they're gonna think twice they're gonna think I don't need to shoot that do it whatever that's his problem you know look it's it's never good to suppress people and when you have something that's irrational like marijuana laws there's it it gives people this feeling of frustration does this disconnect it gives them this feeling of being disenfranchised with the the people that are supposedly in charge you know and it makes them upset like why should a grown man be able to come if there was only two of us who we were living on an island and I was like Steve I don't think you should smoke pot if you smoked pot I'm gonna lock you in a fucking cage you'd be like you're an asshole right like there's only two what do you give a shit what I do it's when there's two million of us that you feel like you can get away with something like that that someone come along and say I'm the sheriff and if I find someone smoking marijuana in my district I'm gonna put them under lock and key you know I'm gonna make our streets safe for the children all that stupid shit that they say well what it's just too many numbers it's too many people but what I'm interesting is like just coming to you know I've been here two years now but I just get a feeling that that is a really quite kind of almost mainstream position a lot of people feel like that in America maybe it's a California thing I don't know but then I'm interested why the libertarian movement you know the political expression of that kind of attitude is the Libertarian Party they're candidates they don't seem to get anywhere they don't seem to do well even though that kind of attitude feels to me like it's really very kind of true to the American approach to things and is shared by a lot of people I can I hear that a lot I think it's slowly but surely starting to gain momentum but I think the Internet's influence is barely two barely two decades 1994 to 2014 right that's that's the realistic take on it but the real impact as far as like social impact I would I would say it's probably a decade so ten years is not that much time and then in that decade how much of it has been concentrated on social change and how much of his be concentrated on porn you know how much concentrate I look we can see tits any time we want now whoa and this newfound freedom this newfound ability to access information it's gonna take a while before I think people are evolving right now I really do socially at a rate that's just unheard of it's never the kind of movements that you're seeing now whether you agree with them or not whether it's operation Wall Street or whether it's anytime there's a social change or social movement in this country whether you agree with it or not it's fascinating to step back and watch this swarm of activity that takes place because of any issue that comes up now that really couldn't couldn't happen before without you know you'd have to have like a physical meeting you'd have to have people would get together and someone have to have a megaphone and well we need to do is take back the streets what we need to do is make the world safe for our children and we need to get out of Vietnam you know and then you know the cops come and break it up and hose everybody down and they would shut down the problem well you can't do that anymore you can't shut down the problems because the problem exists on reddit the problem exists on millions of people's Twitter accounts where they're posting things that probably exists on Facebook the problem exists anytime there's dissent that dissent sort of encapsulates a an entire group of people that share these ideas and they can freely communicate and I think they're just starting to realize that they can freely communicate the way they can and unfortunately a lot of them are annoying unfortunately a lot of people that have figured this out or annoying and you see these really dumb ideas that spread like wildfire wildfire and a bunch of idiots are behind in its that's fascinating to watch too but I think ultimately when it all balances itself out we're gonna deal with a much more informed much more educated much more aware much more socially conscious society than we have ever had in the past I think a decade from now to Dec two decades from now we're gonna see the rewards of this and I'm very optimistic that that way of thinking about and I agree and I guess what we're the way we're thinking about it is that that we want to kind of now the next step really is to really take that energy and and really direct it into the heart of the political system mmm not kind of on the edges of it with kind of protests and and and sort of social movements but really getting into the guts of the of the way laws are made and bright and the way the country is run the states around cities are on and and and kind of injecting it into the into the real heart of power I think that's got to be the next step yes I I agree and I hope that it can be done I mean I wonder if the way technology is advancing and the way technological innovation seems to exponentially increase if there's some way to manage things in a way that's sort of not discovered yet or sort of hasn't been no one's figured out a way to sort of organize this whole thing in a way that's much clearer and now we're dealing it's almost like code like do you remember what code used to look like when used to use DOS and if you use an old computer you emptor everything in command prompts yeah but then someone came along like Xerox figured out this graphic user interface you just well fuck all that just see that thing just double just press twice when you want that to open up and boom and then you see a graphic representation of what you want it's a much more simplistic element you don't have to look at all the code behind what you're doing when you're using Microsoft Word cut all that shit out let's just see let's let's make it real simple and if we could get get it to that in politics like okay what would make what would what would we have to do to make more money go towards school and less money go towards war like is that it's not a way is there a way we could work that out if you look at how much money is being spent in the Iraq war how much money is being spent in Afghanistan is there a way to take 30% of that and put it into our schools because oh my god the school system would radically change our education system would radically the amount of people that would come out of these educational systems that were more balanced more aware had more nuanced perspectives would radically change our country would radically improve like over the course of a decade if you could just figure out a way to put that kind of power in people's hands what they choose to do well I think the way that you do that is it goes back to what we're saying earlier is is actually literally doing it by by getting rid of these kind of big organizations central government organizations that try and run the whole system from some office somewhere that's completely removed from the from their parents and the kids that's actually using the schools and and really give responsibility for this through the way the schools operate to local communities so that they can try things out because every kid is different they learn in different ways whatever nature feels to me like when it comes to education we got this approach which is someone has decided you know this is the theory this is how we're gonna get kids to learn whatever it may be and we're gonna try and have a kind of common application of that in every school and everyone's going to teach the same way and that's great and I just think that the evidence shows that is not right it doesn't work for every kid and you want to have a system where you know you've got much more ability to experiment and try things out and adapt things to each each you know different type of child and that way that they learn and and I think we need to see a lot more kind of smaller schools where they're much more kind of community run a pill are you saying with the gardening I think it's sort of a community approach to these things is gonna be the way to do it you definitely need the money of course to sort of have high quality as well so I agree with that it's just that if you just put more money into the current system of organizing schools I don't think you'll get the kind of benefit that you could if you actually gave the power over the system and took it away from the people at the center and put it in the hands of people locally that that's how I would do and if they did that you could also see the results positive and negative and imitate the positive ones so you could see like these people have an approach and their approach is more sort of Waldorf School based and less electronics and more wooden toys and interacting with kids and look at the benefits like man all these people are coming out he's so creative but then there's another place in San Francisco that's much more tech vald everybody has an iPad and all these kids will lose a benefit there as well I mean I think schools are a huge issue there the massive underfunding of education in this country is a huge huge issue and it's it's madness and it's almost like sort of ensuring that poverty and that this is good I think that's right not I mean yeah and a lot of it is the kind of people that go into teaching you know you really you'd want the best people the smartest best people going into teaching is like the most important job that get paid twenty thousand dollars a year right and there's not going to get that if you're painting those kind of you know it's really kind of obvious we apply that in in every other kind of area you kind of know that you if you pay more you get something better generally and I think that that is a huge part of it it's actually you know trying to get the best people and the countries that have done really well I think that um Finland is a good example from I know I'm you know I spent quite a lot of time this when I was in the government Finland is a place where it is the cultural thing if you if you know really admire an esteemed thing to do and well rewarded is to go and be a teacher it's like one of the best things you can do and that's true I think of a lot of the Scandinavian countries and they have better results as a you know thanks to that so you've got to just get the best people to go into teaching that's really important in this country the prohibitive cost of higher education is shocking when you start thinking about how much money it costs to go to college how much money it cost to get a degree and you accumulate student loans that are almost insurmountable how many people get out of college in this country it's amazing that the the figures are just unbelievable they are so under debt yeah just stunningly in debt like I have a friend who is in his 50s and just paid off his his fifties yes well just paid off from medical school this is a fucking insurmountable debt insurmountable debt forever yeah just slowly but surely chipping away at hundreds of thousands of dollars in educational debt it's really amazing I mean I one of the things I'm doing right now is teaching at Stanford a little bit and um and it's just there's a kind of good pointer which is that it seems to me that their students are so much more hardworking and motivated than the ones that well certainly than I was not see diversity but you know it's all free when we did it in the UK and here it's not anymore but it was when I was a college and here when they're paying so much where their parents are paying so much they take it really seriously and that's great but the the amounts of money involved are just staggering really unbelievable especially when you get to law school or medical school or you know any really expensive school like Stanford you know that's a very prestigious school it's gonna must be ridiculous I mean how much does a kid have to pay a year to go don't know because they have a lot of they do they do a lot of great work to kind of make it possible for kids without the money to go so they do a lot of grants and scholarships and I don't know how that all works out well that's it's it's it's a but it's a huge amount yeah that that's nice and it's beautiful to hear that they do something along those lines and it's also beautifully here that I believe it was MIT has released all of its studies online you can take off its classes online for free essentially get an MIT education through your home computer yeah very nice you know it's very nice that that and you if you think about the amount of access that people have to higher education today when it comes to online courses when it comes to just papers if they could read and download documentaries they can watch different things that they can read it's it's kind of incredible yeah and it's actually really powerful in not just think about America but people in the in the States who wouldn't have had that access but actually all over the world it's this that you know in Africa where you you're just able to bring you know instruction and the you know the the best people in the world the best teachers to the most remote village in Africa is completely staggering yeah it is it is interesting and I've always had a fascination with the the power that someone has in the position of being a professor and especially a professor with tenure where they have this you know kind of this job that essentially it's very difficult to get fired from I mean you have to really do something really fucked up yeah to lose your position and because of that some of them and I have had friends that have had these professors some of them get these incredibly arrogant attitudes and they push their ideas as if their doctrine right and they push their own political ideas and their own ideology oftentimes a very left-wing liberal agenda to the point where it just infuriates certain parents and infuriates people who disagree with these ideas who gets silenced because you know it's the professor's word and that is it in my class this is how I feel it's not education I mean the you know to me the whole point is you should be equipping the students to think for themselves and to and to kind of come to their own point of view but give them the tools that they can do that with and and and go out and then use that knowledge and ability to do great things in the world not to kind of tell them your point of view well you can tell them your point of view but make clear that it is your point of view and there are other points of view and it's up to them to decide what they think yeah but that lack of that humility is oftentimes lacking when you have a person that has absolute power that's right there there's no kind of accountability there because it's just you know they don't have to deliver anything that is like one of the common complaints right about yeah that was amazing thing though I loved this speech that Mike Bloomberg gave the other I think it was last week did you see this you were no Harvard and he gave her come over the commencement speech I think to Harvard where he really attacked him on this point and said that they had this kind of liberal bias in there in the faculty there that was just really bad and the opposite yeah and he had this great piece of data which was that if you look at its going for her to campaign finance if you look at the campaign finance records because they're you know everyone's donations are reported and when you when you make a political donation you have to say what your occupation is so you know it's quite easy to to look at now types of professions or whatever and where their money goes and he got this piece of data which was that if you look at the political donations of Ivy League faculty and staff and you look at where the money went in the last election the figure for how much went to Obama was 96 percent so it's like this total liberal dominance and he said that is just not healthy that is not what a university is supposed to be the problem is the alternative was far more offensive if it went to John McCain and Sarah Palin that 4% is the problem yeah but believe it or not in this country I mean Obama's I'm not a fan of what this administration has become especially when it can turn when it can it deals with freedom of the press when it deals with whistleblowers when it deals with spying on Americans like all the revelation that we found out about the lack of privacy that people have I'm not a fan of that at all but god damn having Sarah Palin is a vice president of fuckin United States would have been disastrous having an old man who's playing poker whether talking about going to war with Syria he was literally sitting on his knee bone playing poker you know I mean what the fuck that was the president that that was the vice president those two dummies I mean that's a disaster that's a fuckin goddamn disaster so of course the most educated amongst them went for the lesser of two evils being Obama being a guy who was a very articulate and intelligent guy who's a whore I mean essentially that's what Obama is what he is is a guy who's very intelligent articulate guy who had these ideas and promoted this ideology got into office and did essentially exactly the what Bush did I mean in worse when it comes to whistleblowers II stuff yeah yeah and but you know all the things that we're gonna do we're gonna close down Guantanamo Bay we're gonna get out of Afghanistan it turns out most of it was bullshit most of it I mean when you talk to people that are better journalists this country has a horrible record in this administration has a horrible record on freedom of the press a horrible record on on punishing whistleblowers and it's the the the lack of the lack of respect for for journalism and freedom of the press is very disturbing to people because what what is journalism truly well what it truly is is you're exposing reality what a true journalist is doing is exposing ality when you punish people for doing that when you punish people for blowing the whistle on with essentially unconstitutional activities like the NSA spying on every single fucking person on the planet I mean that's unconstitutional when you record everyone's phone call that's not what we want and when the government supports things like that I mean how how is this the same guy that was like hope and change how is this the same guy well he's the same guy because the people that fucking got him in the office or the same people that got bushing off it's the same goddamn influences and things like crowd packed things that you're trying to do would expose that for folks yeah I mean that's the idea we're trying to be and you know it's really important that we're you know please you know we're kind of nonpartisan so while we've got a strong point of view about the system generally and how we can improve it you know we don't really it's very important we don't have a point of view as a company about individual issues but I think that we do really care about changing the system and I think that one of the one of the things about the press that sort of happens and I've seen this on kind of both sides of it is that if you there tends to be this kind of coziness that develops with a lot with a lot of the press Oh particularly the traditional press where you know they want to have access to the politicians and the politicians want to get their message out and it just gets quite kind of cozy and so that whole roll of investigation and exposing things kind of sometimes takes a backseat to having a good relationship so that you can get your message out in there and they get access and I think that that's one of the things again that's really helpful II being changed by technology like you were saying which is that you've got people who are able to get you know to do that job of Investigation without having to be of some cozy group around the politician yeah a lot of softballs and everything from the politicians point of view their point of view and it's you know there's a lot of truth is that they're trying to do stuff it's really really hard you know trying to deal with some of these problems it's difficult there's incredible expectations you get shit for what you know just trying you're totally under scrutiny your life is under scrutiny it's a really really hard job and they feel that the increasingly the media and the press are just interested in the trivial aspects of it and who's up and who's down and they're not really interested in kind of exposing the complexity of some of these issues so that that's how the politicians see it and then on the other side and that that's why they end up trying to you know have a relationship that enables them to in their in their you know the way they see it to explain what they're trying to do a bit better so that they so people kind of give them a fair a hearing so that's why that all happens and you know there's a lot of there's a lot of truth to that to be honest it is difficult what they're trying to do whatever whatever your liberal Democrat or a conservative report does makes no difference it's difficult governing is difficult it's complicated the problems are complicated everyone's got their point of view you're kind of being screamed out and yelled out at the whole time and it's hard now look they choose to go into it so we cannot feel sorry for them you know they made that choice like you say they have that kind of I gonna be the leader and I'm going to go there and sort things out so it's the choice that they made but it is difficult and that's why they want to you know try and can't control the message I think because they feel that a lot of the time they don't get a fair hearing well that makes sense in some ways but it doesn't make sense from the point of view of the people that are in the position of being a journalist if you're in the position of being a journalist fair enough you you you're your whole position is to expose inequality expose violations of the Constitution and when you're you're in one of those places where you whether it's for CNN or Fox News or whoever you're working for if you get to sit down with Dick Cheney or you to sit down with Obama you're already muted you're already neutered you're already silenced you don't get that chance to pry they're never gonna have Glenn Greenwald sit down with Obama in an open Internet forum that airs in real-time live they would never agree to that they would never agree to this weird actually cuz it's a really different tradition in England when you look at the way that interview if anyone watches a TV interview of a politician in England it's so different to what you get here they're really aggressive with them really really really really aggressive and and the kind of softball stuff is actually kind of embarrassing for a journalist to do that and there's a different tradition well we used to have that it's really it's really noticed that they shot a few people parked some cars on railroad tracks with families in them and then people kind of stopped doing that I think that guys like Glenn Greenwald who lives in Brazil and gets to sort of attack America from a distance you know at least until they find him I think what what guys like him are doing with you know he was the one who helped Edward Snowden release all of his documents and yeah the these these new players in this whole game these Outsiders that don't have to cozy up don't have to be a part of this this nepotism that we're seeing with the big ones I mean any anybody that's in any sort of a large group Fox and CBS and NBC you're a part of this wacky system you're a part of the system that's not gonna expose these things it's gonna let these people get their message out because if you don't you're not going to get the big names if you don't get the big names you're not gonna get the ratings and then those big names you can go to Fox those big names are gonna go over to CNN they're gonna go somewhere else and you're gonna lose this this yeah that's exactly how that seems to work here that's why I've noticed yeah that is it it is it and in I believe it's getting exposed and I believe it's getting exposed in a way today that just wasn't happening 20 years ago 20 years ago you would just be frustrated and you would just go off and you'd write a book and everybody go oh he's a nutter look at the fucking crazy book that guy wrote and you know some people would read the book and say it was amazing and other people would just ignore it and new revelations would take place along the way and whatever it happened would be forgotten and then the politician would get out of office and I think George Bush is the last guy to sort of skate away like that and you know now he sits around and paints weird pictures and slowly goes insane have you seen the things he's doing he's slowly going insane I mean he's painting pictures and he's locked in this world of he's essentially in a prison on a ranch I mean that's what he is he's constantly circled by Secret Service agents he's hated all over the world he's at least indirectly responsible for over a million deaths this one guy they're pinning it on him and Dick Cheney and his administration and this sort of pyramid of events and this guy feels that shit and he's just sort of wandering around on his fucking ranch painting himself staring at himself in a bathroom mirror I mean it's really really weird stuff and I think he's probably going to be the last guy that ever skates off into the sunset with this this this knowledge I think Obama is gonna be held accountable for a lot more than Bush ever was and I think whoever's next is truly fucked whether it's Jeb Bush or whether it's whatever you know new Democrat they try to sneak into I don't know the Hillary Clinton I don't know what they're trying in 2016 and we won't know for a while because they have to vet out everyone's fucked up vices and skeletons in their closets and in this day and age it's almost terrible I think by the way cuz that's one of the reasons that so many people get put off yes from you know because a lot of the complaints you hear about politics as well we just get the same kind of people they're all kind of you know very kind of similar to each other and there's a particular type of person that goes into it and actually a lot of people who I think could make a really good contribution don't do it exactly for that reason they just don't want to live under that kind of spotlight but well and can't there's just normal human beings and they've got stuff that you know they had fun right because I had fun in their life it means that people that have had fun you know I mean you can't you've one gay affair when you're 20 years old with a guy for a couple of weeks and you're fuck for the rest you know that guy's out there waiting to talk shit about you if you run from you know there's one time you did a little bit of heroin when you were on the road with a bunch of your buddies you you you know we were at you're in college tried heroin oh those fucking college buddies ready to write a book about you doing heroin I mean there's a it's a weird time when it comes to exposing people's past and this idea of this perfect person from the cradle to the grave running for president is preposterous if you don't want that person that person if they've never made any mistakes that means they never taken any chances they haven't taken any chances they haven't lived and I'm not talking about mistakes like victimizing people horrible things that are completely unconscionable that you wouldn't do and I wouldn't do murder and robbery and kidnapping all sorts of terrible things that are just massive you know ethical errors that just shouldn't be ever tolerated from a person's character just little things like here's a perfect example there's a woman who's running for mayor right now in Mississippi and apparently when she was younger she was a prostitute and it this is a it's a big story that you know folks are trying to figure out like what is is that okay like how do we how do we handle this like what what do you do about a person who had made mistakes when they were younger look what is what is the answer to this and no one really knows they don't really have the answer to that they're trying to figure out like when what is happening in that is it is it I'm playing against Tara was yes for sure she's in Mississippi and she revealed it herself she revealed that she was a former prostitute and she was a prostitute like I believe it was 30 years ago and she met her husband while he was a John and he was one of her clients and she married him and she hasn't been a prostitute since and now she's running for mayor and it's it's it's it's quite fascinating I think it's interesting and I think in a lot of ways you could see that and think this person is actually really well qualified to be in office because obviously you know going through those sorts of experiences will give you a sense of empathy for you know the tough lives that some people have this and the circumstances that end up putting them in that situation and it probably makes you better not worse well not only that what she did was totally legal as well she was in a legal brothel in Nevada and it was over 30 years ago and she hasn't been there since and the idea that this person is not allowed to make errors and that she wouldn't have developed like a lot of empathy and character and yes she wouldn't happen that's right yeah I'm a more balanced perspective than a person who's grown up in a very privileged household with very rich wealthy connected people and then they got him to an Ivy League school and then I became a member of skull and crossbones and instead of that well you have person who's who was 14 and was pregnant with a child and had to take care of her child and her parents died yeah and she had was forced into a situation where she had to earn a living and she didn't have a lot of options and this was one of her options that she chose and how could you judge someone who's a teenager that makes those choices I mean I don't think he can and I think this person I mean good for her that she stepped up and totally great well I think it's great and again it's kind of interesting that some types of early childhood of adversity are kind of okay mm-hmm for your political resume yeah I came from a poor family and but broken home where Bill Clinton had a and and it's okay that kind of difficulty is acceptable but then there's this other category which attacks just as character fortrex and drugs in whatever they're just as character forming potentially but not acceptable yeah the sex ones the wackiest whatever because it's totally legal like save this woman had you know X amount of clients per month if she just fucked a bunch of guys you know everybody be like gosh she was young she was young she was getting wacky but fucking a bunch of guys for money is a problem but if she just massaged guys no problem I mean if she gave them pleasure by rubbing their bodies by rubbing your shoulders and backs no one would have an issue with it but by doing something to their by the way it was one of the guys one of the clients running for office and you know it's okay to be a client that's fine sure you know something you'd be proud of but if that was kind of exposed or whatever that won't be a berry sure even ten years ago forget about thirty years ago ten years ago the guy went to a prostitute said listen I was horny I didn't have any options I had a few bucks I paid someone to touch my penis people would go yeah exactly sexist kind of way of thinking about sex should sex should be legal to sell that's what I think I absolutely 100% believed that prostitution should be legal I wouldn't want my daughters to do it I wouldn't want my friends to do it I wouldn't want loved ones to do it but I wouldn't want them to work at Wendy's either I wouldn't want them to work on the the people that you see on the highway picking up dirt or picking up garbage by the side of the road I wouldn't want them to be pouring asphalt in the hot summer I wouldn't want anybody to work a difficult job I think emotionally it's got to be incredibly difficult to have sex with someone that you don't want to have sex with but I don't think it should be illegal if it's legal to have sex with people how the fuck can it be legal or illegal to pay to have sex with people or have someone pay you to have sex with you it seems ridiculous it seems just as ridiculous as making massage illegal yeah I don't know I I don't know I honestly haven't thought about it enough one of the things that I definitely feel strongly about is if we're gonna make that kind of decision the the sex trade the sex trafficking trade needs to be you know one of the ways you think about it because that is just so evil and disgust completely you've all completely disgusted and whatever decision you make has to make that better not worse right and I don't know I haven't really thought it through enough that's a very good point that's a very good point I think there would probably far less demand for sex trafficking for illegal sex trafficking if prostitution was legal if adults could make that decision if some woman you know was in a situation which was like you know I'm reasonably sexually attractive and I make X amount of money per month doing this I can make that same amount in a day having sex with people okay I'll just do that you know if it's a woman's choice to do so and someone would have no problem with that choice the real problem of course is victimization is a real problem is exploiting young people victimization and objectifying women but does not already take place and isn't part of what objectifying women the part of this issue is the it's very difficult for some people to find sexual partners so there's like this thing with this Elliot whatever Elliot Rogers this crazy kid that shot up everybody in Santa Barbara the the nuttiest response that I've seen to this the craziest most infuriating response is by these people that believe that if women weren't so stuck up this guy wouldn't have gone on a rampage because he would have been able to have sex with more people would have been able to get people to have sex with him who's that's pickup artists and the women these women hating fuckheads there's there's a bunch of guys that they're they operate under this this guise of being for men's rights and you know it's kind of funny because I didn't even know there was like there's a thing called an MRA it's a men's rights advocate or activist and it's an insult it from feminists I got called an MRA once and I was like what the fuck does that mean so I I had a Google MRA men's right and I thought it was ridiculous that Wow how could you be a feminist but be making fun of someone who's into men's rights like shouldn't we all have rights I mean shouldn't shouldn't here but then I started looking into these men's rights guys I go okay I see what's going on here they're more ridiculous it's not the kind of radical feminists are those enough like because there's a there's some campaigns that make some good points yes that support yes and and I agree with that 100% but there's they go way further than that and they they go into relationships and they go into the way men are treated versus the way women are treated people are treated in in bad ways by bad people and in good ways by good people but if you're a shithead people are not going to like you and just because you're a shithead and people don't like you it doesn't mean women are assholes it means you're undesired and one of the reasons why you're probably undesirable is because you have a terrible attitude about things and this terrible attitude about things is not gonna change you know it's it's not going to change because women have sex with you that's your attitude sucks you're not a pleasant person there's a lot of people have shit personalities and they get involved in this men versus women but it has nothing to do with men versus women what kind of things do they I mean the men's right what is that well st. cooling for is there a you know there's so much nonsense that's I don't even really want to get into it because some of it some of it is so fucking stupid and I've been reading these things over the last couple of days I'm trying to erase him from my memory because some of these poorly written articles by these men are so stunningly stupid like one of them was this guy was talking about how he was around this 60 year old man in this 25 year old woman who is his his incredibly hot wife and that this 25 year old woman was insulting this man and you know that this is this this is what the anguish this guy had a deal with and how horrible it is and this is what men have to deal with I was like that might be one of the dumbest fucking arguments I've ever heard in my life first of all what if it was a 25 year old man and a 60 year old woman that was this old wretched creature that this guy was forced to fuck for money like would you be on the man's side of the woman's side then which which position would you take there of course this woman is gonna say shit he thinks this old man she's not supposed to be fucking him she's supposed to be having sex with a 25 year old man or a 35 year old man or someone reasonably close to her age where there would be naturally sexually attracted to each other what you're dealing with is a bizarre situation where someone has sort of circumvented the system by acquiring money yeah and by yes it's exactly and by acquiring money this guy's figured out a way to get some twenty-year-old hottie to marry him and yeah she doesn't like it so she complains and I'm I'm reading this and I'm like does this guy who the fuck is this guy writing this article talking to who are his friends like why how is that an argument ya know yet III don't even want to pull the article up I don't want to reference it I don't want it to fairness but it's just what you're dealing with with these men is a bunch of nitpicky shitheads with terrible personalities that are complaining about men getting a bad rap in this world if you do well in this life you have an amazing chance as a man of being sexually successful of having a great life of not being persecuted of not being raped of not being beat up by your spouse I mean the the idea that men don't have the better end of the deal is unbelievably ridiculous when you look at this Donald sterling guy this fucking shithead that owns the Clippers he's 82 his girlfriend was in her 20s and this this this possibility only exists for men it doesn't exist for women there's very few 82 year old women who have attractive 20 year old boyfriends it just doesn't exist this very to very few watch what Madonna does do you know how what what kind of a monster like a lot of young men would feel like Madonna was if Madonna was trying to fuck them they're like it's repulsive to men and an idea of a powerful attractive man who's in his 50s dating a 20 year old woman is not alien at all but the idea of a powerful woman in ER was Madonna in her 60s how old is she I think she's 50s but I think that's what's really to be honest really cool about what she's doing there which is like she's just really constantly challenging those kind of stairs but is she well I think so by the way I don't know I think that she's certainly I think she's got a pretty intelligent point of view on some of these these sort of gender issues because she she really you know I mean and and I think the fact that people aren't uncomfortable is kind of making the point that we're agreeing about which is that this is not how it's supposed to be yeah well she's she doesn't even consider herself a feminist she considers herself a humanist which I agree with wholeheartedly and this idea of men's rights what's really offensive about it is that you know they're concentrating entirely on the ideas in the prop at men face when I think the only ideas and promises problems at men face the only ones are child custody and getting robbed in divorces other than that shut the fuck up yeah I really do believe that I think those are the only two issues other than that please shut the fuck up because when I hear about a guy at planing that a 20 year old wife is mean to a 60 year old rich man oh poor baby this is what you do go out and get more 20 year old wives okay you're fucking rich of shit and you're old are you gonna live forever dummy you'll go get some prostitutes go do it be nice to them give them cars you know what do what donald sterling's did he got that girl like five Rolls Royces and Bentleys and Ferraris and shit and it still didn't work out dad you know why it didn't work out she didn't wanna fuck him they don't want to fuck you you're 80 okay that is just the law of the land that's the way life works this is the natural balance of nature and you know you you've you've figured out a way to inject influence and power and money and sort of pervert this whole system down and when you complain about this perversion not working out in your favor and this is why we need men's rights let's go oh fucking christ you whiny bitches you guys aren't men you guys are babies I didn't I think it's just unbelievable that they're even tonight they're babies they're babies say that's the babies and they're not recognizing the issues that women do have to deal with women have to deal with worrying about groups of men women have to deal with worrying about if I walk into a parking lot okay and it's at night and I see a woman in that parking lot I am not worried about that woman but if I was a woman and I walked to a parking lot and I'm walking to my car and I see a man and that man is looking me in the eye I have to wonder what kind of a man that is I have to think about that I have to think about that as a man but as a woman you really have to think about that it's very rare that a man gets robbed by a woman in a parking lot of course it can happen especially if the woman is a weapon of course if you're in Russia she might rape you you know there's this is some stories about Russian women you know there's some story about she helps a man captive and force-fed him viagra and fuck them for 30 days and that's Russians they're crazy some russian chick might actually do that to you but for the most part it's a non-issue or statistically speaking it's a very very very small percentage of the population as to worry about this for women the amount of women that get sexually assaulted the amount of women especially like in college it's crazy and college is you know something like more than one out of ten women get sexually assaulted in college I don't know the exact numbers are read varying reports but even 10% it's fucking crazy big problem I agree it's a big problem if you're a woman because men are aggressive we're aggressive we're filled with testosterone and we need to come it's a real problem every day our balls are building up more more sperm and if you're a shithead and if you were raised improperly and you don't have respect for women or the opposite sex or anyone in general other than yourself itself we have problems we have problems with that so yeah we need accountability as men but it would also help if there was places where people could relieve themselves it also helped if there was a handjob place on every corner I mean god damn cooling it why not there's a massage place in every corner you drive down the street in LA if you drive good a Ventura Boulevard drive down the street if your back is bothering you you can find a massage place one a mile you'll see a neon light Thai massage Swedish massage this massage you can go in and get your neck rubbed what can you get your balls rubbed why can't you why not because we're crazy because we have these weird ideas about sex we have these weird ideas about what is evil and it's based on the Puritan values of this country was founded on which are founded by religious nuts who were we're so kooky that they got in boats to escape persecution and travel across a fucking ocean I mean that that the echoes of this ignorance is still propelling us today yeah I think I don't know I think that with all that stuff to think I've got a lot of sympathy but I just keep coming back to this thing about well what is the if you know what is it are you in gonna set up a situation where it's not really a choice that there's some kind of economic or other power that's that means that or pressure that means that even though you kind of treat it like a market place where everyone's freely entering into it is that really gonna be the case I think that's the question I think totally right I don't know and I'm not suggesting by the way the prostitution is gonna stop rape you know what what I'm suggesting is that there are real issues with with human sexuality and there's real issues with making things illegal that shouldn't be illegal whether it's drug use or whether it's sexuality I think there's real issues in suppression and I think when you suppress people from doing things whether it's suppressing them from using marijuana suppressing them from drinking suppressing them from wearing certain clothes suppressing women from driving when you suppress human beings from things that are illogical and I find it illogical that sex is illegal to sell and I'm not saying I want to go to prostitutes I don't I don't but I think they should be legal I really do I think it's nonsense I think we live in this weird world where if something is legal to do for free how is it possible that it's illegal to do for money it doesn't make any sense I see your point of view and I agree with it wholeheartedly that you do have to worry about people being sold into this that you have to worry about them being somehow or another compromised by this this overwhelming need for you know the financial revenue that can be generated from sex and that people could be exploited and that could it be a real issue with the objectification of women it could change the cultural attitudes about things but if you go to countries where it is legal that prostitution I was just gonna say I can holliman's right yeah yeah they find lower instances of AIDS lower instances of like Jim Jeffries is a buddy of mine it was a stand-up comedian from Australia in Australia brothels are legal and he talks about how divorce rates are way lower in places where brothels are legal because the men don't need to cheat on their wives like some men just give up they can't they can't get sex with their wife and he goes it's like I'm fucking out of here and they get divorced and they go to this huge stressful situation just go to a brothel you know and Jim was joking around about how his his mom and his dad were fighting and his mom was like and he goes to the brothel every night I don't know if you know that or every Wednesday night he goes know every Wednesday that was that was the punchline and I I don't think there's anything wrong with that it's whether or not people being exploited and that becomes the problem but that becomes the problem with everything I mean if people being exploited into labor if children are being forced to work in factories at young ages which they are in other countries and typically other countries that provide us with these these goods that we so want cellphones laptops all these different I mean how many children every year scraping minerals out of the mountains that they need to use to make electronics there's a lot of them and this is exploitation this is exploitation that we benefit from and I think that we have to address all forms of that but we also have to address ridiculous laws that don't make any sense and anytime you try to control people any time do you try to suppress people's ability to express themselves in any way if you don't like it you know whether it's walking topless down the street you can do it if you're a man you can't do it if you're a woman that's what they're dealing with in New York City now in New York City you're allowed to be topless as one like the there's some woman who calls herself the fucking naked cowgirl and she's getting sued by the naked cowboy because the naked Cowboys a guy who he wears underwear and he plays guitar with a cowboy hat on and he's like this sort of tourist attraction in New York well women are allowed to be topless now as well in a lot of places because like the idea is well why is a man allowed to have no shirt on but a woman has to have it's because you're saying that breasts are much more sexual they know when they're on a woman and that they need to be they need to be covered and that sort of develops a sort of inequality in the law that a woman is you know a women is oppressed or a woman is subject to laws that a man is not and that seems to be very difficult to pass so you know you deal with some situation where women aren't allowed to be topless and they should be how many guys get arrested for being gigolos is it zero I mean what was the last time a guy got arrested for fucking a woman because she paid him to has it ever even happened but women get arrested for prostitution all the goddamn time you know I totally agree with that I mean that is they rather than the people using them yeah it's just totally I agree with I think that when they saw you're right that there are so many kind of weird things about sex and and and how that kind of plays out when you think about sort of social issues and stuff like that and I think one of the biggest things that's going on is the way that kind of that kind of this sort of sexualization of you know like public space and the kind of world around us is like really influencing more more children I think that they're kind of getting younger and younger that kids are being exposed to kind of sexualized stuff there is a real problem because it's changing their expectation and what sex is and there's lots of studies now showing how that you know like kids sexual behavior is really different you know boys sort of viewing porn and violent porn at much earlier age thinking that that's how you behave treating women really badly women thinking themselves as sexual objects more I think there's a lot of kind of quite deep problems that are coming out and we'll see in the years ahead from the way that that is just you know like sexual images and content is just becoming much more widely available for younger kids that's a really good point because it's so prevalent and it's so uniquely new the ability to download porn on a cell phone so essentially if your child is 12 and they have an iPhone you send them off to school they're watching people fuck yeah I mean they're gonna there's no way you're gonna stop them if that phone has Internet data if it has internet access those kids are gonna look at images if they have somehow or another some access to an iPad or a laptop or something is connected to Wi-Fi if it's not blocked through some sort of a complicated filter that they probably know how to dismantle better than you do they're gonna see sex they're gonna see sex in a way that we never saw sex you know I have this joke in my act that is a true story about when I was 11 years old me and a couple of my friends found a magazine in the woods that was a foot fetish magazine and we it took us like a few minutes to realize what was going on we were looking at this magazine cuz it was really confusing you thought it was like as a podiatry today no no we thought it was a porn magazine or sure obviously that was the intent that yeah well we we were in the woods and I don't know if you've ever found pornographic magazine in the woods fetish do you ever find I'm a hustler yeah house in the woods in the woods right yeah in the park in the look yeah whatever but it's always like some poor bastard who's hiding his urges it's a classic it's a rite of passage you know where we're going I think you know it's very important everyone had that experience International yeah cuz for me it was in Florida and for you it was in England right it's amazing right the foot thing that is exactly unexpected so what the point was that we found these this bag that had these magazines in it and we're going through this one magazine and it took us like many pages in - my friend goes dude this shit is all just dicks and feet like that's that's a turd we were and to this day I laugh thinking about my friend saying that and that we were stunned and confused well we were just looking at a magazine and we were 11 you know today kids get to watch actual sex and apparently the sexual activity of children is changing like someone did some study recently that showed this massive increase in anal sex yeah amongst children under 18 years of age yeah it's really I think it's a really big deal mm-hm I really do and and it's there's sexual activities changing it's the kind of relationship between men and boys and girls you know that's changing and they're kind of we talked about it early in terms of you know women's rights and men's rights and I think that that you know their expectations of how to behave yeah how to treat women and woman's own sense or young women their own sense of themselves as primarily being about their you know sexual sexual persona I think that's all really a concern you know it's actually setting back some of the kind of progress that's been made in terms of women women's equality I I agree but I think hopefully at least because I'm the eternal optimist I think it's temporary and I think that ultimately it's all going to even out because I think that what people are doing is they're look at these things like if women are engaging in these sexual activities at a much earlier age they're looking at it's like this is something that they need to do to become more attractive to men because this is what they've seen they've seen this my thought on all of this is that we're gonna reach a point within our lifetimes probably within the next few decades where we're going to be able to read each other's minds I think I think it's inevitable you know over your house actually was the first time I ever tried Google glass right and we were putting this thing on and scanning it and you know and and googling things and looking at navigation screens in front of my eye thinking man shit's gonna get really fucking weird soon yeah I think we're gonna be able to read each other's minds I think this this whole dance that we do do you like me do I like you you know who I'm gonna play hard-to-get I'm gonna fucking do this I'm gonna be the girl that takes it in the ass and all the boys gonna like me you know I think all that nonsense I think it's gonna it's going to become far more complex the human interactions because I'm gonna become far more complex because our concept of of Secrets is going to go out the window it's really interesting actually I don't think it's gonna exist anymore I think if you look at the trend what is the trend the trend is that information is easier to access now than ever before and it becomes easier to access and easier to access to the point where you can ask your phone questions with your voice you press a button you know who is Steve Hilton but it's Steve Hilton there's a ball it gives you the information but that's just one step and it's not going to stop there it's not halting it's exponentially increasing so what is what's the trend the trend is dissolving boundaries between people and information that information includes information in your own mind that information includes there's going to be a much more effective interface than looking at a screen and asking a screen a question the interface is going to be somehow another a neural implant something that you inject into someone's body like nanobots it's good there's gonna be some weird sort of an interface and when that happens they're gonna come up with a better one a year later it's gonna be a more invasive one a more and then we're gonna have to come to some sort of an agreement where we we're gonna say hey listen in order for human the human race to established an enlightened perspective we're all going to have to look into each other's heads we're all gonna have to be able to read each other's minds and find out how we think and feel and so there'll be no more mystery in this world there'll be no more romance novels there'll be no more there's nothing to be unnecesarry there's not going to be any romance there's going to be this weird hive mind thing going on and it's gonna happen within a hundred years hmm and I think that's incredibly interesting and the the way that that will change so many things of people just you know if that comes to pass and people can just know what the other person thinking think about what it used to be like before language is established people used to grunt and point and kind of try to figure out what the other person wanted and we were essentially monkey people what did we do we figured something out we got to this point and now you compare your life today to that point like I I was in a conversation with a friend and we have another friend that is like he's becoming a prepper you know like he's fucking setting up his house for solar water and collecting rainwater or solar solar power and connecting collecting rainwater and growing his own fruits and vegetables and doing so in this fear that society was going to collapse and my friend Jimmy was like if society collapses you don't want to live man like you don't want to be that one fucking guy that's got all the food and you're you know standing on your porch or the rifle and you're all taking turns waiting for the zombies to come over the hill you know sounding the horns and alerting the people that the barbarians have arrived you don't want to do that and you don't want to go back to those days you just don't and I think that we we don't want to go back to the days of no language and we're not gonna want to go back to the days of Secrets we're not gonna want to once once the no secret thing happens and people just get this kind of understanding of what it is to be a human being you know it's universal yeah it reminds me that there's this some work going on at Stanford they have a virtual reality lab and they're looking at how virtual reality could change the way people think about other people about their issues you know there's there's one experiment they're doing where probably I'm trying to get it right where they I think they put you as like in a forest situation you think you're in a forest and they and then they measure or some nature some example of nature and then they see how you know they really give you a deep experience of that through virtual reality and then they look at your behavior in the next week after that to see if you're more conscious of that you recycle more you change your behavior because of this this completely false experience you've had to give you this virtual reality experience and and that's what they were searching in all sorts of other ways and I think it's just showing that it does Wow and you can actually influence someone's behavior by giving them this sense of another world yeah and that's again just in its infancy you know the the virtual reality stuff is just getting going and and I just think it's interesting all these things how they will affect so many aspects of how we relate to each other and think about these issues that the moment had just so kind of superficially dealt with it's gonna get really squirrelly when that artificial reality is indistinguishable from the reality that we're experiencing right now because that's coming to you know that's what the whole simulation theory is is based upon you know this idea that one day we're gonna get to a point where you can't tell whether or not we live in a computer or we live in the material carbon-based flesh world and if that's the case how do we know that we haven't already gotten to that point how do we know that we're not in a computer right now and we're thinking that we're experiencing this reality but it's not it's not really happening it's we're just a part of a program and that it's so good that you just you can't you think you really are Steve Hilton you're not Steve Hillman you see you know the truth shall set out the thing is that when you this kind of gets to a point where I just kind of I can't handle it anymore my brain cannot literally cope with thinking about some of this stuff I remember a friend of mine repeatedly trying to explain to me like quantum physics and quantum things and I just literally can't understand it yeah the quantum stuff is hard really hard I have a had this notion of you know alternate realities and things going on at the same time and if I just can't get around it it's almost impossible to do it's it's really like when we start getting into quantum stuff I don't anything they understand it I mean they they understand it in terms of these theoretical concepts but it's so abstract in a lot of ways when you're dealing with things like when they start talking about subatomic particles and they start talking about the things that they actually do know like the things that you actually can measure you can observe yeah yeah like particles in superposition meaning they're in movement and still at the same time when they're talking about things blinking in and out of existence they go away and they don't know where they went and then they come back with just that alone the measurable stuff is so crazy that the lowest point not the lowest but the smallest measurable point of reality which is this these quantum ideas the world is made of magic things appear and disappear things are still on there moving at the same time they're here and they're there they're in two different places at the same time and they can take particles and they can move them across the world and when they interact with each other they interact with each other faster than you can count faster than you can measure they interact with each other it like instantaneously faster than the in any kind of communication that we could have between these particles given the amount of distances in between them the speed of light the speed of sound they they're instantaneously interacting with each other now they're figuring out a way how to send particles through time they're figuring out ways to send particles through time to actually time travel with particles and so with all this stuff that they're doing right now is just one step on this never-ending quest for technological innovation there's never-ending quest where people are trying to satisfy their curiosity they're not gonna stop they're never gonna stop if we don't get hit by an asteroid if we don't get I think that's right then that's you know and you get all these good things coming from that yeah along the way I mean I just I don't understand it but eventually it leads to things that we all can use and and deal with and a lot of those things are really good I don't think I think one thing I would say about all this stuff is that generally speaking we are not critical enough of the technological advances I think that a lot of them are obviously you know improvements you know if you think about just technology going back many years you know the way that I don't know like labor-saving devices in the home completely sort of freed women from the drudgery in the horrific kind of washing machine all that stuff that was just kind of such a terrible experience and that's all a fan that sort of simple example of technology being really transformational in a positive way and I think generally that's probably true of Technology it's usually an improvement but I do think that we have this kind of attitude of assuming it's good and just and not really questioning it do we really want that right I think that doesn't happen enough often the answer will be yeah we do that's great fantastic bring it on but I don't think we stop enough to ask the question and I think there's the scientist and the people doing this stuff they don't really think about that they want to do it because they can and it says you exactly as you said it's this curiosity like let's let's just go further because that's a human instinct it's like when Oppenheimer built the nuclear bomb I mean the should that really have been done well the you know the the argument the intelligent argument is if they didn't do it the Nazis would have done it so yes it's important that the Allied forces developed at first but I think that that's the the job of I think there's all sorts of roles that are played in a society and there's the the innovator and there's the scientist there's the people that are constantly pushing the boundaries of technology and then there's the the social engineers who step back and go okay let's look at the repercussions of this and how do we mitigate the the negative aspects of it how do we figure out how to integrate these ideas into society and use them to enhance society and what is being done to sort of manage that and what is being done to to minimize the negative impact yeah that is a good way of putting it that different functions yeah yeah there's just a constant there's no one thing that's awesome there's things that are awesome and then there's repercussions that are like yeah but then there's this well there's that but then there's one that's just part of it that we're not really comfortable with and there's this sort of dance that we do as we build society and as society continues to and expand and our ability to do things changes our ability to access information our ability to accomplish goals our ability to transmit ideas is so much quicker and faster and there's these repercussions to that that we're before this this day and age were really unexplored because they weren't available so we don't really know the long-term repercussions of children being able to access porn because they really didn't have it yes it's new we never asked don't know what that leads to yeah weird world it's a weird world Steve Hilton's strange times is a good good summary that's why you tooth and claw resisted I do and this is definitely going back in the day but the way I agree to like run away I need a fun then they can get hold of me yeah that's it that's it and then you could shut it off occasionally just give it to very few people you have to have a burner phone you have to have a phone the gift of people that could possibly be annoying so that any given time fell into the ocean you'd be like yeah whatever with that fucking phone you know and then have a phone you only give to your family and your close friends yeah but one of the things that really puts me if I just can't there's something about my kind of useless sort of fat stubby finger just hopeless with touchscreens mmm that's the all you can get is touchscreen when we're in Hawaii you're through your fucking iPod at your computer too fucked up the screen you were so frustrated Steve got you know I have a regular iPod with the click wheel the wheel I like that I like that I like that's right yeah I like that but the the new ones the iPod Touches yes I don't I don't find them as they're not as easy to use when I'm at the gym I find them to be frustrating you know but you you got ahold of one of those because you couldn't get your regular iPod you got so mad he threw that you're fucking that the mark is that reminds me of my techno rage every single day but you're not a rageful guy which is so crazy because you're normally the last person I would expect to get violent and throw something I get crazy but it was an iPod that did it to you I know it was weird but I do with technology as people who know me and work with me will testify be very Unabomber ask oh gosh okay there's a great documentary on the Unabomber and how he became who he is I don't want to get into it because I've talked about on the show before but it's called the net and it's a I think it's German I forget what country but it's available with subtitles but basically he was a part of the LSD studies at Harvard they cooked his brain that's Ted Kaczynski Ted cognise mm-hmm yeah okay yeah and he was turned in by his own brother his own brother recognized the writing in the manifesto and he realized that his brother had gone insane is like I think this is probably my brother that's doing this Wow cuz I wasn't here them but that was it so I don't have a sense of it being God I know that know what happened but I don't get a sense of what a big deal it was it was scary for a lot of people in America when that happened what was scary for a lot of people also because of who he was attacking that he was attacking people that were technological innovators he was attacking people that were involved in a distribution of technology and he believed that and in a lot of ways correctly believed that there was something going on right now where people were creating technology and this technology would eventually do bad things to the human race and to the biological existence that we currently exist in you know this this sort of like established way of being and living that we consider being you know inherent to being a human being and he felt like these people were the enemies of humanity because they were fostering technology and crazy I didn't really know that that was what was behind all that yeah he just wait he went too far ahead he got wacky instead of living in the moment and dealing with the moment he just saw this this attack by the biological humans or on the biological humans by technology which essentially I kind of see his point in a way I don't see his point as far as like a tacking people that are creating technology but if you really extrapolate where we are right now and where we're going this symbiotic relationship that we have with technology where people are afraid to leave their phones behind the phones will eventually become Google glass Google glass will become an implant an implant will become well you know Steve you've got good news and bad news the good news is you have year to live okay the the bad news is you have cancer the good news is we have an artificial body that we have created that we're going to put your body into the bad news is it lasts forever so we're gonna take or is it the good news you know this is what it is is a new world that we're living in where we're going to have weird choices that never existed before and a lot of the people that are involved in Google they hired Kurzweil yeah Ray Kurzweil who is the proponent the number one proponent of this sort of transcendental moment where we become one with computers where we become one either with some sort of a computer interface or we download our consciousness into an artificial body or we figure out a way to exist in some sort of a virtual reality that is eternal and there's that's a lot of people feel like that's where things are going to go yeah a solution is really not fiction you know it's definitely happening yeah I thought the that why I don't talk to to friend of mine about this a quite a bit which is if you think about I'm just interested that there I got the Unabomber that's an extreme example yeah I wasn't I didn't realize that it was so focused on technology but there isn't really a people like it generally speaking there wasn't really a movement a sort of anti technology movement that not certainly not that I'm aware of if you think back to you know the exactly when it was when you had this sort of industrial revolution and the Luddites you know smashing up machines that were you know taking jobs away from people and then their view really kind of damaging society that was a it's kind of quite a big movement yeah okay didn't get anywhere and it you know history sort of made them irrelevant but there was a movement with a name and an organization that did stuff what are they what was their their idea Tecna though I think that specifically it was the the new equipment like the weaving you know during the industrial revolution in England then the machines that were now being used to do the work that had been done by people and they they objected to that and that incredible and they would literally physically smash up the machines that was I think one of the things they did and which all those people with a better study of history that can give you a better picture but that was they would call the Luddites I think named after the person that that set them up someone called LOD I think and I don't know how big it was but it was big enough that it's something we still know about and it's part of the history of that of that era and there's nothing like that now not not to my knowledge where you don't have people going out and smashing up cellphone towers no make a point about technology well I think it's what we were saying I really like it you know it's kind of their lives and they like it for the most part yeah I mean there's a lot of benefits there's a lot of benefits to technology but I think it's what we were talking about earlier that maybe back then they didn't have enough information to draw upon and they saw it as being this direct threat to their livelihood yeah I think that was a big part of it yeah and I think today we're sort of forced into this realization that it's neither good nor bad but rather something that needs to be managed and there's good aspects to it and then there's negative aspects to it and ultimately you have to figure out what outweighs what and how to lean it towards the positive how to manage it in a way that it goes towards the positive and I think that's the case we were talking about with children watching television you know I know there's the Waldorf School my oldest daughter was in the Waldorf school system for a while and it's a lot of wackiness to that like they didn't believe in any technology didn't believe in any video games but was it been they've proven that video games can enhance cognitive function then in the neural pathways that are created by stimulating video games can actually they're they mimic the games like chess you know like problem-solving games games that stimulate the imagination and creativity like they exist video games can be used in that same function this idea that all video games are bad and then I found out that the guy who founded this whole Waldorf system was a channeler he was a channeler like I am getting a voice there's a spirit it's talking to me like oh you fuck so I'm very key our oldest son you know you know he's in yeah I'm system yeah that system is created by cooks unfortunately wonderful system in a lot of ways the school that my kid was at it was great but the reality is that it's founded by fuckheads you know founded by crazy people that I'm definitely gonna look into that yeah Chandler yeah well we'll talk I'll tell you the full deal when we get off the air I'll tell you the conversations that I had with these fucking people where I'm like what what what the Chandler you know there's a lot of evidence that there's Chandler's no there's not actually there's none there's zero evidence that anybody's ever been a fucker Chandler you know I have a friend who he loves to believe in stupid shit and he just he's not a good critical thinker he's a great guy but he's not a good critical thinker he's the first when it comes to me with a fucking ghost story you know it's and he came to me with this psychic thing we gotta knew all about my grandmother man guy was real the guy's legit I go do you know about your grandmother he goes yeah I go so the guy told you some shit you already knew kind of fucking uses that what are you just talking to some guys you're playing games you play a trivia game playing a trivia game about things you already know about your own family this is ridiculous like what kind of a question did he ask you okay he's leading questions that you answered in some way that he was able to concoct the story of your life and people want to find that these things are correct they want to find that someone is but there's almost no evidence whatsoever that anybody has a functional psychic energy and method that is reproducible and it doesn't mean that I don't believe in the potential for psychic psychic powers because I think there's some weird connection with human beings it's probably emerging much like a lot of our senses emerge I think there's there's weird senses that are emerging with human beings like for instance they've statistically shown in in a way that's measurable that people can tell when people are looking at the back of their head yeah you could tell and someone's looking at it was someone's looking behind you at you that the people could sense it in a way that is more measurable than chance so I think there's probably something there there's part something when you think about someone and they call you and that happens see I've thought about people and all sudden I get a email from them out of the blue I haven't talked to them in years and I'll said I bet a person I was that popped into my mind like wow when that guy's up to boom will get an email from hey man what's up like wow what is that is that a weird sort of a distant connection that will eventually one day be much more strong I don't know I don't know but I know that a fucking channeler starting a school that tells you not to use cellphones and don't watch TV that guy's a silly bitch this is ridiculous make any sense you know I think this but I think you're right that um they're anything that's really extreme is it's just not gonna be right thing and they'd there and so we definitely don't implement the extreme version yeah of course they recommend that's a question the balance right with all things even with reading you can't read all day every day go outside go throw walk go ride a bike go do something get out you got to get out you got to move you got it and I think that that's the case with all human experiences I mean if you're a person who's uh there was a thing recently that they did a thing that they did about sex and about porn and that people who watch porn they they actually have less brain matter they have less matter in their brain people that are obsessed with porn and you know when you think about it's probably because the the whatever they're doing with whatever part of their brain they're stimulating they're constantly focused on that and all the other shit about wondering about existential questions the you know the the purpose of man the the the idea of infinity all these weird questions that normally bounce around side a person's brain they're completely non-existent because you're just trying to find the next person at jerk-off - you just put you about that guy the other week that came out with in the government rush could you see he was in the Environmental Protection Agency I think and he was watching he was he lost his job he's watching porn like I think six hours a day in the office in the government that's even possible well people who listen to this podcast in their office guarantee they shouldn't be they should be working but seeks out or they should be pulling maybe they should be that's like yeah it's ridiculous but there are a ph epa employee downloaded 7,000 files of porn at work and watched him 2 to 6 hours a day well i don't think that guy was doing a good job of protecting the environment i'll say that that fucking freak I'm not surprised if you give people the freedom to move around like that that's what they wind up doing people are nuts man you give people the freedom to just do whatever the fuck they want you know a lot of times they do things that just aren't smart yes that's just the way human beings are especially if you give them it's like we were talking about as far as professors or police officers or anybody in some sort of an ultimate position where they don't have enough supervision they don't have enough just they have too much influence over others and they don't have enough oversight you wind up being this fucking guy supposed to paint attached our drinking water he's just beating off all day you know and then there's all it's also a job thing too it's like how many how many jobs you know really should there be for the Environmental Protection Protection Agency and how many people do they really need to do those jobs this guy can yeah exactly yeah what is he doing there well we know what he's doing that what's the skykans yes we do if this guy can work in the EPA and he could still like hold down that job and he's beating off 6 hours a day and this was four years it wasn't like just he went nuts and just one week for whatever reason I went for it it was like four years I wonder how many people are listening in this podcast right now they don't like the fuck that's me I want to get busted if you're in an office and like especially if your computer is facing like you and you're looking at the door so you get a clean shot at anybody walking you know for men men are freaks you give a guy the opportunity to just beat off in his office a lot of times dudes are going to take it up you know fireman Protection Agency Jesus Christ what a weird world we live in well that's an issue you imagine if like it was back in the day where you know a guy who was assigned to work for the the city water department in the 1930s they found 7,000 pornography books in his office like Frank what the fuck are you doing man look I'm getting crazy with all this reading I think in a lot of ways what we're dealing with when it comes to pornography when it comes to the internet when it when it comes to just technology itself is we're dealing with these things that have influence over people in a way that we're not designed to process now we're not designed to process movies a giant screen where explosions and you know spaceships and all the stuff that's not real but we're seeing it in a way that's much more impactful than real life we're seeing it right in front of us yeah you know I think that that that Fox with people's heads you know I think that pornography the ability that anytime you want just go online and watch people have sex like that you know that you could do that and it's at your little finger tips especially if you're like sexually starved mm-hmm you know if you're like you really want sex and you can't get it and you know hock and watch it right now I'm gonna watch sex real quick Oh margin sucks that's a weird thing with human beings so weird thing that we've sort of painted ourselves into this corner we have all this technology as we're talking about before it's like we have access to it and it's all it's about managing it really but the sex thing is also you know like reminds us that were just animals really because you've got I remember you know really struck like kids love nature program so you watch these nature programmes and basically they're about sex and eating that's new happens that's what happens in nature that's what all they sound that's that's the majority of the scenes that you see yeah that is what it is and so we're just in that sense animals well we certainly are and that makes it's the same it's it's it's not it's not I don't think we should be surprised that it's such a dominant part of of life no no we definitely shouldn't be surprised but we're also much more complex than the average animal that's where things get really weird where things get really weird is that yes we are animals but we are also animals with computers we're also animals that are aware that we're animals so we have to think about our actions were self-aware we're aware of the influence that others have on us and we're constantly expanding that influence you know so we're not just animals we're we're animals with computers that may become part of machines that's the thing that freaks me out the most it's a symbiotic connection that human beings have to technology and the potential for developing artificial technology or artificial life I think that we we give birth to that I mean Marshall McLuhan wants that human beings are the sex organs in the machine world and I always wonder if we're not some strange caterpillar that becomes a butterfly it has no idea what the fuck it's doing and we're making some sort of a technological cocoon thinking that we're just I'm doing my thing running around and looking at porn no you know you're a part of this gigantic machine that's processing and pushing for the innovation of technology and the innovation of technology will eventually give birth to a life-form they're constantly working on trying to map out the human mind yeah duplicate the functions of the human mind it's some sort of a synthetic process and we're not anywhere close right now but the way technology exactly yeah it's it's it feels unlikely that that's not gonna happen yeah I heard this I read this article by this really grumpy fuck who's an interesting guy is a smart guy but he's also just a probably a lonely shithead and he was mocking Ray Kurzweil how Ray Kurzweil knows nothing about the human mind and he was talking about the complicated functions the human brought mind and the way the human mind processes proteins and that this is barely understood but what I read from this and what I got out of this is like I don't think this guy understands the biological functions are not going to matter if they can be if these biological functions can be completely irrelevant because they've figured out some sort of an artificial way to duplicate all of the exact same synapse hiring mechanisms like without all the biological functions the processing or the proteins the interacting with the hormones and human neurotransmitters all that stuff is great if you're using a body but this guy was so hung up on the fact that Kurzweil is wrong because we don't understand how the human body works well no no he's not because he's just you're just talking about bodies yeah bodies are super complicated we haven't totally figured it out yet but we might not have to if we can figure out a way to do all the things that the body does but do it with a computer or do with technology or do with some sort of quantum computer some sort of quantum computer that's contained in an artificial body that can completely replicate the functions of consciousness the functions of emotions of interaction of curiosity of creativity if you can develop an artificial computer that's creative you know it doesn't matter of luteinizing hormones and all this shit that you're bitching about you're just bitching because you're showing your intelligence you're trying to show people how smart you are by criticizing a known genius because you're not a known genius I mean that's essentially what you're doing yeah and it seems to just superficial I know nothing about it but the the the body part of it feels like the you know that there's a ton of progress right there they sort of biomechanics and robotics and so that is easy compared to the brain yeah yeah no I agree it is the the what's what they do know about the mind and they do know about the body is comparatively rudimentary when you think about what we know about a clock mm-hmm we know everything about a clock you know you could buy a switch watch a Swiss watch and there's a man out there that knows every single function of that watch knows how it interacts knows exactly what's going on tick tock tick tock we don't know that about the body yet you're right you're correct but we're not gonna have to we're not gonna have to because they're gonna come out with some shit that's way better than a body they're gonna come out with some shit that's way stronger than a mind and it's gonna be artificial and one day it's gonna go hello and you're gonna go oh shit and why exactly are you guys living like this no just kind of going on momentum just just how we do it I don't think this is the best way to go about this I don't think so either I have a better idea oh great and then this fucking thing is to take over and then we're gonna have real problems and he's gonna really reform our campaign finance laws reach others mine's not gonna be any voting we're gonna know what's important and what's not there was a guy once and I've brought this up before but it's it's important to note there was a guy that we we talked about in the podcast who had been bitten by a shark and the shark had taken his arm and taken his leg and he had this carbon arm and he was moving his fingers around it and he was standing there talking with this fake arm his fake leg about how great it is the technology has provided him with a way to still be mobile and functional even though he had been attacked by a shark and I was sitting there and I was thinking wow this is fascinating this guy is like kind of a cyborg what we see is a man with an artificial arm and the story was about how well they had created this arm to the point where this guy was living a totally normal life and you know was functional and mobile and can take care of himself even though his arm had been bitten off by a monster and then I thought about well what if it was both legs okay and then they figured out artificial legs who would say no to that nobody give him some artificial legs now you can move around okay what if it was this whole body would say listen man we're gonna take your head we're gonna stick it on a robot body but you're still gonna be you oh okay all right I'll take it okay we're sticking your head on a robot body but listen we got a problem the robot body is rejecting your brain but we found an artificial brain that works just like your brain we're gonna download your consciousness to this artificial brain you won't even know the difference okay well then who are you and what are you what are you are you a person still if you are your thoughts and your personality and your memories downloaded into some creation some sort of a new thing that they've done that mimics all the functions of the human mind without any of the biological limitations what are you yeah I remember that it's so funny you talking about that because it reminds me years ago when I was doing my interviews to go to Oxford University and I had an interview with a philosophy professor and he gave me this scenario which I now know is a famous philosophical thing is called the experience machine and this is this construct very much like what you're talking about which is like we could put you in a machine that gave you all the experiences of a fantastic life but it would be a machine doing it would you choose to do it and I remember saying no that's I wouldn't want to do that because I'd feel I'd want to have really expert Don it myself and if you're just in a machine that's not the same thing either what if the machine made you feel like that you were and you've been on an a whatever I said there was some kind of comeback and in the end I just remember getting really frustrated ah I don't know that's why I want to come and learn about philosophy so I can figure this stuff out but I have no idea I lost my temper I never did figure it out did you throw your phone way before the phone here but it was just there comes a point when I just find it really hard to even go very far with this and I just think oh well whatever let's just sort of get on with you know practical life today well it's essentially it's the Dunbar's number of philosophical discussion our minds are limited in our ability to sort of take these ideas in there we don't have the capacity to extrapolate it's it's too much so this this concept of recreating reality in an indistinguishable manner it's too weird it's too but I think it's something we better start talking about because it's common yeah I know I know I'm really happy that you are nothing it's really important that other people are I'm just saying I'm not it's way more important than other people are doing it than me in hierarchy yes and you've read more about it the night I have and I just think that is yeah it's really important that that generally we talk about it and keep you know a really strong sense of awareness of how these things might change stuff and a lot of the time it will be for the better and that's great but we should just talk about it well I had the opportunity to talk to Kurzweil for an hour and a half and I sat down and interviewed him about these things and it was really fascinating we had a great conversation but this guy is not thinking about negatives at all all he's thinking is a gung-ho right full-blast pedal to the metal he mean he's taking like he takes giant bags of supplements every day because he's an older man he's just trying to keep his biology alive long enough to see this this new birth of technology and when it gets really crazy what he's trying to do also is he's trying to make his father come back to life his father died when he was young and he believes that if they figure out a way to recreate a person from memories from just the the knowledge of who this person was images that you're going to be able to recreate this guy in some sort of an artificial form I mean it's one of the things he's discussed is this he wants to see his father again and the idea that he can recreate his father technologically from these men from all sorts of different things from memory from all the the data the noodles from recorded stuff it one of the most fascinating concepts that I've ever heard when it comes to the increased increasing power of computing is that they're going to get to a point one day if computers continue accelerating they're going to get to a point one day where they can take into account all the positions of all the objects and all the things that are exist all over the world as data and from them extrapolate where things will be and where things were so by where things were meaning knowing everything in this room where it's at in this position they'll be able to figure out how it all got here who moved Jamie move this over there and Brian picked that up and turned it on and they'll they'll literally be able to calculate the past they'll be able to buy what we have here buy everything we have here and what we know they'll be able to calculate the actions of the past madness run out of time that's what yeah he's holding up okay well at this point I'm just like okay that's madness it is I don't understand they'll be able to look at the ground itself look at the the content of the dirt the the pollution and the ocean the carbon and the air the distance between these two trees and the amount of pencils that are on your desk and they'll be able to figure out the passed his computers would be so far advanced it just reminds me that line I come with which Woody Allen film where someone's about had asked had asked his parents how does the TV work what do I know about they don't have the TV so I can't even figure out how the can opener works yeah I just you know I'm the TV baffles me this stuff you know yeah well it should it should and and it's it's only gonna get more and more baffling we're stuck with these dumb monkey brains yes that's the problem where the the dumb monkeys that are sitting around here waiting for things to change and when things do change we will be just as weird as some Australia Pittacus if he put him in a time machine from a million years ago and threw them into the fucking Burbank mall this thing would be running around going what the fuck is this because things change because things grow and things evolve including humans we're just along for the ride so I think the real key to human beings and it's the most difficult aspect of life is to get really good at this moment get really good at just existent in the moment and join agree with that it's fucking hard to do right yeah it's great it's a great way of thinking about it because it just means that you don't worry so much because you can you know there's stuff that you can understand and relate to and can be good at and enjoy I think that's totally right and there's some power and worry can'tcan't worry about worrying cuz there's a worry causes preparation preparation causes you to cover your bases and remove a lot of paranoia because you relax like one of the best things you could ever do if you're worried about something is handle it you know you handle it you deal with it you don't have to worry about it anymore so I don't think there's anything wrong with worrying a little bit but I think it's like all these are the things that we've discussed it's a balancing act there's a there's a Madonna and watch porn all day but if you watch a little bit I think you're gonna be okay you know don't don't get nutty and sit in front of TV 24 hours a day but watch Game of Thrones every now and then I don't think it's gonna hurt ya you know what dude you get outside every now and then but don't stay there when it gets cold you need to get indoors you know this the world's bed a lot of shit going on and it's simply a matter of there's so much happening and there's so much to
