here we go in four three two one boom and we're live cat how are you good to see here yeah thanks for having me my pleasure my pleasure looking forward to talking to you for a while I know it's uh I feel like been a long time coming I don't even know how much time we have I feel like there's a hell of a lot to catch of lunch yeah there's a lot to talk about always you're getting ready for Boise that's your you next fight mm-hmm Mayan were now July 14th and the CenturyLink arena now you took you took a good stretch off right a couple of times a couple of times I am let's see after I fought Misha I blew my knee and then the world exploded and so I had I think 18 months off between that and fighting Amanda and then after I fought Amanda I so amanda was like September 27 something like that and I fought Ronda February 28th and then after Ronda took another big stretch off fought Juliana the following year July 9th and then this was another big stretch off so yeah it's been a little bit scattered but doing what I can yeah you're you're doing some crazy therapy to write some some interesting stuff down in San Diego yeah so there's there's been a few things I've been working on like I'm not a huge fan of Western medicine you know like even I mean you can call it alternative medicine it's like original medicine I appreciate looking at things like that way more than you know big farm but I you know one thing that you know fighting has gotten me and and stuff with you know I think it's more prevalent in women although I'm thinking it's happening with men too is like our endocrine systems are not happy with these weight cuts and they're not happy with us like getting hit in the head a lot go figure so you know within all of that I've just you know had medical problems and things that like I'm constantly working on and I feel really good I'm constantly improving but one thing I was feeling a little bit stuck on was when I was like some of the endocrine problem issues but like I don't know I had I had I went to this facility in in san diego's called de why can't I uh mindset and actually the UFC sent me there because I mean we have you sada we have all of these things like after fighting Amanda I got my head pounded for a good four minutes there I had a TBI afterwards so that was like immediately lowered my estrogen lowered my DHEA my testosterone and I'm hypothyroid like I will always be helped with that right now like I had after that for it yeah yeah and you know still toughed it out still was trying to do it I could to go and fight Ronda as soon as I did afterwards and you know part of my game playing is don't get hit and which means like let's just dart out her and see what happens you know well that's what happens when you do that yeah people don't know TBI is traumatic brain injury just in case you're someone who's listening just doesn't understand what we're talking about and then in the Ronda fight if people don't know about that you just charged after and he got caught in an armbar and like what was it very quick it was 14 things but I did hit her with a knee I did throw her ass but she practiced his little ninja move caught my damn arm and it was it was over you know but I mean even even her coaches were like I mean that's you did what you're supposed to do there and she just got you you know so that would be an awesome fight to be able to revisit one day and she even said we'd do it I mean who knows her career so we're gonna fight again she uh need to yeah she doesn't need to I don't think she wants to you know yeah I think I mean who knows you'd have to ask her but there's a lot of lessons to be learned in what happened to her in terms of like all of the distractions and Hollywood came calling and there were scripts and talked about doing Roadhouse and there was always all this going on that was other than fighting yeah you know and then it was also look the sport has evolved so rapidly and the women's women's MMA has gotten so high level so quickly and if you sure you saw Amanda's last fight with Raquel Pennington I'm like holy I mean it's that was a high-level performance from her and five rounds super-high cardio just put a beating down on Raquel Pennington he's one of the toughest girls in the world for sure right I do like I mean I'm cured I'm saying the same thing as the fights going right and then I have some people in my ear next to me they're like well how long has it been since Raquel fought because she didn't look her like beefiest straight she she looked a little tired she looked a little like not her typical and then it's like she's a year and a half off herself right like right into a title fight which I have to say I'm a little bit envious of because when I beat Misha I won I was supposed to coach the Ultimate Fighter but that was also ultimately gonna end up in a title shot with Ronda and I blew my knee and my husband passed away and there was like a long moment of silence in there and then when I was able to come back they made me read my title shot you know and so it's like wait we're doing that now or just like what does it depend on like what what attractive contenders are available like what I guess out it looks good yeah I mean it was very young at that at that age or at that that time to write in bantamweight right now there's like there's no standout contender and Raquel had beaten some really good fighters and she looked like the next in line and did she blow her knee out as well she she got like I could be lying but I think she got in like some accident with a four-wheeler like rolled over and broke her leg or something I could totally be making that up though she could have just twisted it walking down the street too so I don't know now that you're saying that I do remember something like a broken leg Jamiel find out what it is but would you be surprised by that fight between miquelina Mia yeah I mean I didn't I didn't see Raquel being the one to beat her you know I do feel like Amanda's been working and doing like you know improving I mean she changed her camp the coaches that she's working with I tried out for a while at at one point too when I was trying to find my spot and they are legit they're very good and American Top Team has a lot of high-level training partners both girls and guys you know I mean she had a good a good decision made there so I see how she's improved um I think with the time off with her kill I wasn't sure how it was gonna go but also I just I just don't know I just don't see Raquel being to be being the one that beats her it's so hard to tell you know right I mean anybody on any given night at the highest level of the game someone can win someone can be off someone can be on there's no math to be done in this sport there really isn't yeah math is ridiculous I mean sometimes I hear like statistics on me or definitions on me or labels on me and I'm like wait I'm a I'm a known striker like I never would have thought I'd be known as a striker I mean I've been doing jiu-jitsu and wrestling my whole life so I mean I'll take it  yeah well you know the Misha ko yeah yes but I mean that that in itself was like I love to wrestle and what can I do once I've closed that distance well it's those those short angle strikes you know there's there's needs and there's elbows there that those are the most destructive things I could possibly do to someone when when we're that close and to do all that work to get that close but granted that's all influenced by my time what I got to learn from that discipline so you know it's all relevant but you know it's a it's always just interesting to to hear how you're now being categorized you know yeah it is weird right okay but you are you are definitely a dangerous striker I mean you're dangerous I agree I mean I like it and and I'm enjoying constantly learning and new things like the the basics were always hard for me to get because I wanted to do the big girl stuff you know right and you know found my way like right in the middle of all of that and it found a way to use how aggressive I am and how just like dominate domineering I can feel in there and all of that so it's it's like I don't know the I want the maximum amount of damage without taking damage which is obviously the goal right but like I want to put it into it dance so it's like a little I don't know what made you decide to go to San Diego so you're at Alliance now right I know you moved from Colorado to San Diego so a few things so one of them one of them was like Colorado is a complicated situation for me I mean I had gyms up there like a lot just personally happened up there and I love my team elevation like I love ice I'm still close with everybody like I go to Colorado for Christmas holidays like it's still home you know but a couple of things one with the head injury Colorado was amazing for training right it's amazing for building your your endurance and whatever but it is not good for healing like you'll never see a doctor tell someone with Alzheimer's or a TBI or heart problems or even like massive allergies or what's the arthritis arthritis like those are not that's not a good place for people to live with any kind of inflammatory or like major thing that needs to be healing because your body is already working at such a high level yeah because the altitude I mean the thin air the things like that is just like I so much time and so much money like figuring out what the hell was wrong with me that you know I ended up at the Mayo Clinic spending weeks at a time going all they're like specialized different doctors and situations like that for them to tell me like you know if you want to heal you want to give yourself the best opportunity to he'll you're probably not gonna do it up at altitude like we would prefer seeing you at sea level and so combined like I kinda I needed to almost exile myself from Colorado because I want to love it and I was starting to it was starting to get like less colorful for me you know because I felt like I had the best there was as far as coaches and the best there was as far as training partners and the situations like everything was as good as it was gonna get like it literally was as good as it was gonna get and it was like this this can't be it like I don't feel I don't feel right you don't feel like you're at your maximum no and and I was like that means I'm gonna have to take a change you know and I was scared like I have a little boy like I'm taking him away from everything we know and we just packed a u-haul and we left and we we got to San Diego and what made you decide in San Diego I went I wish I had written down like all the gyms I went to and showed up at like anonymously to because I didn't want them to like I wanted to kind of catch them with their pants down like what do you guys like right right now versus if you're prepared I don't show up and have you have people here watching me I don't want you to put on a show like I want to catch you how you are and like have you decided what you think of me too because these needs this needs to be a fit I mean fighting and coaching and training is very intimate and and it needs to be authentic and real the days I'm sitting there ugly white girl crying on the ground but I need I need you to tell me to keep stay on the erudite and you know I mean like just let me cry you know that kind of thing and um it's uh so I went to all these places and like I the best part about it is that I got to learn and train with so many fighters and so many coaches that I like I'm so excited about the relationships I made and the people I know but like all of them it was like this is awesome but it's not the place this is awesome but it's not the place I came up to LA if and I was very close to going to American Top Team they had an awesome deal set up for me to go like helping me with my kid helping me with a good percentage for training like how a living situation was going to be they're gonna accommodate me really well but when it was time to like pack my car and go like something was like that wasn't it you know and so that's the problem all the time woman's there there's a lot of cool people in Florida but there's just there's some subhumans down there yeah I I really appreciate it like the Latin culture I mean yeah it's the white people some swamp people down there so then I looked West you know I know ed stores out here he's my manager and I had a few pockets of people I knew that could maybe be a support to me my kids so came to LA if I was here I was gonna go to black house I think where's Calvin Cassell I'm trying again Kelvin Gastelum you gotta say his name wrong every time where is he my coach Kings Kings okay I was going to Kings black house and I was still trying to pick jiu-jitsu like I wanted like art of jiu-jitsu guy or or you know just someone really good yeah because I came from traditional traditional jujitsu and like I love MMA and mixing it up but I I need that so belt in jujitsu purple for like ever how come so long because I'm being a weirdo about who promotes me because my husband my husband promoted me to purple belt and like I really want what whoever takes over the lineage to be like that like I don't want it a different one from 10 different people like I want that like I want to pick and it be right and so actually now I'm super excited because I just started training at Atos and I have so much respect for Andre and his wife and yeah there's so there's so many good fighters about to come out of that gym two great jiu-jitsu fighters I I've been training there like for weeks now and I mean I've trained there before but like every day for weeks now and I've only had like one day where I walked out feeling like a rock star the rest of the days they were whooping my ass but it was good you know like I needed that and it tells me yeah and there it's just been so good and to see myself that way and to hold people that way like I was legit at jujitsu me and I was like killing it on the circuit for a long time and then MMA comes in and puts this pressure on like even those kinds of competitions even though they're not even the same animal and I'm annoyed that I let that bother me and keep me from competing in between fights because I love that because you have a big name in MMA you feel weird about competing in jiu-jitsu tournament I think I did or maybe I thought I'd pick up bad habits or I would do whatever but because maybe other people had that experience but like for me I need to see it for myself like if I go and I do a tournament and I do great then hell yeah I'm gonna have higher expectations of myself in a fight if I go and I do shitty okay well like now I get to learn like that competing is where I get to learn everything and spacing out these competitions especially the time I've had to take off in between fights like like I'm not I don't believe necessarily in ring Rus but like when they say go i I don't know what go means until a little bit later than I'm expect and it's been the pattern in these last two fights you mean when the fight starts you still feel like is this really happening I know this last fight with Caitlyn like we got in and I was like do I remember what to do here you know and I was like it I'm just a throw bombs and the whole time I was just like and I'm naughty That's not me there you know it was just like Chuck in my hands at her and hoping they'd win and if they didn't like out you know you feel like out of composure yeah until until the third round and then the third round I was awake and ready to go and I mean I felt warmed up I felt right and you know she was looking at the clock and backing up and all this and I was just like come here come here like I'm ready to fight finally like come here and you know I don't know so there's something to be fixed about that I don't think it's a secret but I don't know I think maybe something with the warmup I need to like fully like have like a respiratory exhaustion before I go in so I can simulate those first rounds being the hell out of the way even investing a nerve you know there's there's a lot to it like gosh we're bouncing around all these different things but I mean one thing with the with that treatment center that I went to is like doing different things like dealing with their psychology dealing with like the synchrony in your brain you know having your brain function and then on the same hurts at the same or different areas of your brain what so what did they do exactly what is this therapy so it's these magnets right like the the main people in there I mean it's beautiful not beautiful but beautiful to see sitting in the lobby waiting when you see people with Alzheimer's come in like there's a man that wheels his wife and every day and and you can't you can I think at the beginning of the week she gets like in an IV so she's like a little bit more up and chipper but by the end of the week you know she's a little bit more slouched and and stories like his where he's talking about you know before they started going in there she would just go to the bathroom all over and everyday this man takes care of his wife puts her makeup on her like goes and gets her hair done even though she doesn't even know you know and now she can at least tell him that she needs to go to the bathroom like just be like hey it's time you know and he can get her there and then you know sort of kind of have like meaningful moments that they haven't had in a while for there's a ton of veterans in there and active veterans to active military guys that are you know they're doing these door breaches and then they get their head rattled up too many times and they're noticing they have problems with some depression I mean and these are high-level Navy SEALs high level like like Special Forces that need need they're expensive people they've there's millions of dollars poured into these people and they're not ready to let them go yet so they're like how can we fix them give them this like performance edge but still get them like like healed enough but we need we need to throw them back in when we need them you know and so I've had to sit in on appointments with the Department of Defense and talk about my experience with it I had to I don't know there's some really famous people I don't even think I get a say cuz I'd be a dick and I'm gonna probably be in trouble but that I've sat in on and you know they've had their own issues with mental health or PTSD or their like autism different things like family members of theirs or whatever that I've sat in on and kind of been helpful in talking about because I went in there on two different antidepressants and these I was put on at the Mayo Clinic and I felt like this post the núñez fire yeah this is how crazy mm a math is right you lose to Ronda in 14 seconds you ko Amanda Nunez Amanda Nunez beats the out of Ronda and 48 seconds that's that's you might be like the perfect example I'm a math you know I mean crazy it's crazy I need you've beaten down to UFC champions well in it I mean I took it took two and a half rounds for me two for me to sub Pennington - mm-hmm you know like there's nothing like you know but who is it Pennington goes toe to toe and round around with Holly Holly knocks out Ronda - like it's just this division intense fight with Ashlee evans-smith this day that the ending what you got her in that Bulldog choke and finished her leg literally one second it was so violent I I screamed so loud at the end of that it was just chaos mm-hmm that was she's done she's had two fights that ended like that with like one second to go she finishes the fight yeah it's a tough girl so anyway MMA math is ridiculous doesn't work and you might be the best example of how it doesn't work but so you go to this the the Mayo Clinic puts you on antidepressants because you just feel like I feel like and because like of the the different endocrine problems that I had right so I can't have any of the medications that will help that so I have to be more conservative with it and one way they thought to do it is because my cortisol levels were really high they're talking about and I mean granted I have a lot of stress especially like you know life hasn't been easy he's fast like mom your husband passes away you're in the toughest probably the toughest sport on the planet trying to be the best at it yeah so you're elite you're in the top ten so you're you're in this weird position where you you never know when you're gonna fire to who you're gonna find is a constant amount and it's not like you're making millions of dollars doing it either no well in its expediting healing for me and and I also have a kid going through what I'm going through so it's not like I get to like split and cut corners and just you know it's like there's maintenance to be done at all times with that so I go there they tell me you know we could probably lower your cortisol levels if we could lower lower your stress levels so we'll try antidepressants what does that make you feel like flat as and like I didn't get my camera can I say on this word okay I know I just know if I have a quota before I'm like a bad person like doing like don't get added to a certain zero restrictions you say whatever you want okay okay so like there's no one listening so yeah they put me on they made you feel you're flat flat which like all that training camp getting ready for Juliana I'm just like I'm like okay I'll it'll take off in the fight like I'll feel good in the fight like when they say will no no UPS no downs no no pissed off like wanna kill you know nothing you know and so not scared but not happy no and I was like why am I not nervous the way that I get nervous like like like I was okay which usually like especially two weeks out I have this like flush of emotions you know where I'm like fetal position in the corner like what the and then once it's over all I want to do is kill you know but again I didn't have that either what kind of made me nervous cuz my my other friend barb panchak she she's a new 25 er we would always like call each other and laugh at how dumb we're being at that point like but that was all gone with them yeah but what  they put you on um oh is this one oh my gosh zoloft paxil keep going prozac what do they have do you know any German effexor effects or effexor Jimmy's plain stupid over there so so they put you on this stuff and did they try different ones no because a lot of time there isn't you know and and they're looking I'm like I need the site the side effects matter like these campy ones that make me gain a bunch of weight they can't make me like like they I need to still be able to sleep like I have to be able to have like enough highs and lows to be able to function and learn and and whatever and so this is like the best they they could have for me so anyway I I fight that fight with Giuliana you know I I feel like the first round I came out how I wanted you know and then halfway through the second round like it was just awful like she had my old coaches in her corner you know what's weird about that fight is I could hear you and I could like I this is where the flat came in is like I wasn't I didn't feel like I was in the fight like I could see herb Dean's feet and I could hear you talking about us and I saw like here Giuliana's coaches and it was breaking my heart that they were coaching against me because they were my Colorado gym and she went and trained with them and I know she had trained with them previously so I mean before she had taken the fight but to me it was like up to here you know and it hurt me in a way like it's I wish I could explain it better but it was like I heard them and I just wanted to go home you know I look at the clock and I'm like kidness just be over I don't want to go back to Colorado I want to move like and I literally on this side of the cage I had my past in Colorado I had these coaches I had the drama with that with that gym like how everything went and and then on this side it was like all new problems like San Diego Eric and then we're good like there was a lot of training partners there was sunny use similar to Colorado different but in the right ways you know and it's like I just wanted out a fight you were in San Diego training for that fighter no yeah I just flew out for it for for the training camp and why you flew out there you were still taking the antidepressants and did that fight convince you to stop taking them yeah so after that fight I went to what did i do I think I went to the I was at the P I I was working with Nowitzki and people unlike what to do about that I tested more dances dr. Gordon mark Gordon yeah to help me with all that too because he thought there was a more conservative way to help me with those issues as well and so I you know I was talking with him I had him talk to them they were all trying to figure out a way but so there's like there's no ways to even just naturally bring you up you think about retiring yeah and not that's the thing as the center was really the place that was is like okay I'm gonna go here I've tried everything else I'm gonna go here and if they can't fix me then then I'm I'm gonna have to be done how crazy how  hard is Amanda Nunez hit its nuts she does it like she I don't want to say she hits like a dude because that's kind of weird yeah it's a I remember being surprised I remember like having this open guard on the ground and kind of like come here you know like you and then she hit I was like oh you have those you know you could see the look on people's face when she hits him like we saw it with Rhonda like right away there's a part in that fight because I watched our fight after and like you uh she hit me and it like did something I think it's right when it had to be when I hurt my head because it like dropped my arm and it dropped my neck and I just remember like seeing like the little Twiggy Tweety birds and I was pumped because I was like that's where the cartoons get it from because somebody explained that that's exactly where they got is like and my arm like I couldn't get my arm back up and I remember listening to you and you're like Cubs not intelligently defending herself I'm like listen Joe [Laughter] yeah you know and then she screwed up because she grabbed my knee and my knee was the one that was like the catalyst to all my problems over the last couple of years and it was just like don't  touch that and after that I was just like I just angry when she grabbed me yes it was the wrong knee but I knew what she was trying to do right on top of that it was like it's just I don't know the rest of it was just like punishing her she's kind of like sassy before the fight anyways like in the awkward ways like not even like cool hypee ways like just staring at me really weird in a room where it was just like me and Tim Kennedy sitting there eating like watermelon and stuff after weigh-ins and I look over and she's just like Tim's like I'm like I can throw a plate a watermelon at her I can throw a table mmm Wow but when you stopped her we've played the recording of you screaming like maybe 10 times on this podcast because to this day that is one of the rawest moments I've ever seen inside the Octagon like when you jump like when they stop that fight and you screamed it was bone-chilling it was it's so I mean I'm sure you've heard it but that here it is right here play it Jamie listen dude that's like from your jeans that's like that's some cellular level yeah that's intense it's relief it's like I didn't like like we lived you know like we lived they didn't agree we get to eat they don't you know it's it's it's it's relief it's oh yeah yeah I mean you were like you said you lived because that was I mean look it's just a fight there is a referee you're gonna be saved but one of the things that George st. Pierre said last week when he was on the podcast he said the mentality that you go in there the way you fight you are a warrior like you you know that you're going to be rescued but you are fighting for your life and when you're fighting a killer like Amanda and you get lit up like you didn't survive that first round then go back and stop her that's where that comes from I mean that was just  intense well it's the it's the practicality to me right like yes exactly we have a referee we have cage walls we have whatever you know fans it's entertaining people but like I need to know I need to know that like would that be in nature you know that be doing whatever that'd be self-defense that'd be us fighting over a territory or food or whatever like I need to know what would happen like if we had like that's why I want these finishes we only get 15 minutes to be able to tell ourselves what would have happened in that situation you know and and when it goes to a decision I'm pissed because I don't know you know like you don't know especially these three round fights where I'm waking up like these last couple fights like late in the fight I'm pissed cuz I'm like I don't know if that would have been another 30 minutes or another two hours that were scrapping in the woods like who gets the bone you know I want to know and and so that's this is crazy and it's your practicality and it's your survival and this is the way I get to know myself damn the way you just put it not only if ever anybody put it that way you need to know yeah that's intense but I get it I get it that's where that scream comes from you got the bone so you go down to San Diego what was your short list you before by the way I'm a huge fan of Eric alliances just one of the best camps for sure and I think Eric Del Piero's like probably one of the most underrated and because he doesn't to his own horn he's like in the shadows laid-back doesn't want any attention she's not trying to get any attention like he's the last guy to like request attention you know but super super knowledgeable and one of the best guys in a corner to like his advice is always excellent like never never heard him say the wrong thing in a corner he's always like on point but what was your short list of places to go to besides Alliance I went to did you go to New Mexico yes but I feel like I'm not trying to walk in on Holly and like make sure it weird then we're gonna fight each other at some point I know and that just you know I I don't want to be that guy you know although I know I'm welcome and I know that everyone there's always been nice I've gone and trained there before and it's been good but it's just not a cool move you know I went down to Arizona with Crouch mm-hmm loved it there another great guy yeah I feel the same way about him mm-hm yeah very very very humble very good you know super knowledgeable up in LA LA was cool too but it was a lot of that driving around in the traffic and congestion and I couldn't sacrifice the like the yeah it is so many people here yeah and coming from Colorado and coming from like chill outdoorsy you can drive 20 minutes and beep somewhere no one's ever stood before to like stuck in traffic breathing air you don't want to breathe like like everyone's a little pissed off but no one really knows why yeah many people Jamie's right Jamie's been saying this for yeah we're gonna leave we're gonna leave together ain't gonna bailing yeah where would you go maybe Colorado it's so dope good food culture could be better there I wish we could combine that food culture culture what do you into I mean I mean I'm I'm in the health food I mean like ethnic food I like every I like I like trying new stuff all the time I'm not very like food Cheney you know I'm in a fire and meat yeah are you are you like meat over fire yeah so I've decided different I always go for the steak it's like it's vegetables are great I love vegetables yeah but you can get them anywhere you get them in Colorado not really I mean it's not exactly the produce capital of the world but you can get them yeah yeah it's not the best yeah just get a greenhouse grow some Tomatoes yeah so did you try Montreal did you think about five-star I did not well I thought about it but I don't I didn't get up to Canadia I I went to Thailand I went to Mexico I went to do you think about going to Thailand yeah yeah I mean when I'm there especially it's like such it's it's a Buddhist culture people are so happy I mean that you have your there just like you have everywhere else but at the same time like like the Muay Thai training is good I know the places I would go to jiu-jitsu like the fairtex in Pattaya is is coming around and pretty solid like I've been considered that for this camp just to kind of like make some changes and because I really want to have that influence in that like exposure to the authentic Muay Thai again like when I looked back at my most successful and most happy times after these three fights I've lost three in a row like that doesn't happen I'm not saying you know I'm like no I'm better than this like something's up and I know there's a lot that I need to work on I mean like my my life in general and I'm doing it and I'm happy to be doing it and I'm happy to be getting the lessons even if this is how I have to get him like it at least I know so um I tried to look back and analyze like what was I doing when I was my favorite fighter when I was feeling the best and it was like very traditional thick muy Thai and very traditional thick jujitsu so that this camp has been something that I'm going to also be outsourcing because I want to be in like that element so I'm doing my I'm doing actual muy tight with Johnny X he's a Jeremy Stephens muy Thai coach I think - and then my Jiu Jitsu with Atos and then because before it was like I would do these separate disciplines put them together and drills and sparring and then go mangle people and then like have fun with it because it's like these little goals I'd set like this little bucket list I would take into a fight with me and try to pull those things off and then and then go learn new stuff and then go try to do that that's why I was constantly evolving every fight even the fight with the mando and I like snapped her down and I had her by her head and everyone's screaming news news I'm like hold my beer I'm gonna throw her with the you know the would they call it a DDT it wasn't it was a freestyle like front headlock suplex but it's like like I want I want every fight to be different and fun like know what I have but see what else I got anything and that that I don't even get to play that right now because I'm up and I'm not doing what I want in these fights so I decided to take steps backwards and Howdy's dartle in training and training i-i-i don't know it's something something's been missing and I'm partially wondering if it's that you know so like every fight I'm looking to to make improvements and change like I'm not gonna ever sit here and say I know everything and that it's just I have no excuses Caitlin found a way to beat me you know what I mean Juliana found a way to beat me I kind of beat myself in that one too because I let my head get into me you know and that sucked and again another thing for me to have put time in and I'm happy I did but I mean that got me to move to San Diego so I mean I'm I'm happy for that message it cost me a lot of money to get that message but I'll take it you know and Kaitlyn yeah she found a way to beat me and to have been beaten by jujitsu and I feel very accomplished in jiu-jitsu that like stung differently you know it's done way differently than just someone else getting their hand raised do you feel when you're in training that you're the same as you were before when you write your best when I was at my best no but it's something I'm working on like I have I know I have like the hang-ups that I have I know there's a ton of mental stuff you know one just how life happened and constantly having it like I had this expedited adaptation to training I had to get new coaches I had to find new gyms I had to do all of this while in grief and being under like like this isn't the most forgiving crowd you know like oh and when you're having a day definitely not have the worst it's crazy it's crazy because it's such a like you're so exposed and you're so vulnerable as a fighter and the fans might be the meanest well and yes they're so mean and but I feel like I have the best fans to like I have the ones the ones are really old Oh Ryder died and like I'm so proud of him but like I didn't even start doing my own social media my my husband didn't my social media and so all of a sudden I get thrown into social media and how social media works when I'm at my most like low vulnerable and all that  I didn't know you're not supposed to I'm looking at investments right like I'm like oh here's the stock I'm gonna put money into this stock and let's just see how it turned out and I was like oh and I think the first person that ever told me not to do that was Cowan like later he's like never read the cover Brian Kenner what are you doing yeah Brian Cal doesn't rich he's like don't read the comments but I'm like well how will I know how I did he's like just know in here yeah your peers your know you'll know from your coaches and you'll know you'll know what I mean it sucks when you know like six hours later you wrote some that people are taking wrong or I mean it's like an opportunist situation they like wait for you to up and they're like oh right there right there I'm like you know I didn't mean to say that or you know that's not how I meant it or whatever but it's hard because everybody's text looks the same yeah the text that you would get from a Holly home or someone you respect versus the text that you get from some fat slob sitting there eating Cheetos farting into their hands the same person like it looks the same as texts but it's just you're gonna get like some people that just want to hurt your feelings because they suck in their life isn't here like I've never met a hater that's doing great like there's no no haters that are like man my life is awesome but you know what I like doing I like going on YouTube and I just go make comments that I just try to hurt someone's feelings I just try to cut them to the bone just a up about dead relatives what they did wrong those people are all just losers just losers you know I mean there's just no way around it that's all they are it was so funny because I mean in wrestling like I did wrestling and I did soccer volleyball swimming like I never ever heard anyone be discouraging like no one ever came to me I was like you you suck yeah a lady wouldn't get that someone who was a fan or someone even if someone's from an opposing team and like she ain't this they're just saying that because they want to beat you you know it's like but the the haters that you're dealing with online that just there's a lot look life is complicated it's hard to get right and as you're seeing with your very difficult career there's there's a lot of like decisions to be made there's you can it up you got to build back up again Trier and you're a smart person who's strong and successful for losers life is impossible it's impossible and so they go through life just angry and depressed and sad and failing at everything they do but they still have a phone or they still have a laptop and like you car and that's what you're getting that's what you're getting what you're getting to all that anger you don't even know this person why they angry at you because they're angry at life because life is them in the ass that's why they're angry they're angry at life because they got dealt a existence right they have bad genetics they have a bad family they have a bad job they live in a bad neighborhood they have bad people around them they feel bad everything's wrong and but they still get to talk they still get to talk and they still get to type things type mean things out that's that's why you can't read comments because it's not the only thing you could do is in spire with your work with what you do and you do that already you know and you're a human being you're gonna make mistakes you're going to do things right you're gonna do things wrong and you're gonna have these epic moments and you're gonna have these failures because that's just a part of like doing things that are complicated but you can't read the cards you definitely can't take them to heart noted yes noted I've got me good a couple of times I get a up your day yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's sad because those people that are doing that they're in pain there's you know the only reason why they would lash out at you like that they're good no I'm just telling the truth who's criminal truth even if it was the truth the way in which people say it and the reason why they're saying is because they want to hurt your feelings they're not being kind you know there's a lot of that going on today I mean even then even in the media the way people tell stories and write stories and write articles about people it's like they're not this is it's not just that they're trying to tell the facts and explain what's happening they're trying to cut people down and hurt people and it's this is I mean I wonder how much of it has to do with the fact that our president does that because it seems more prevalent now than ever before that seems like there's like a trend and I think a lot of like one of the things about the president whoever the president is is there's some people that are not gonna listen to anything he says but there's a certain amount of people that are going to take his actions and use it as almost like a barometer yeah an example of how they should behave and how this country behaves it's like he's the top dog and when the top dog is insulting people all the time saying shitty things and still can be successful yeah it's it lets people know there's no head head you like him and then they go out and act like assholes - yeah it's a bummer so anyway you go down to San Diego and what what are they doing for you that gets you off of the antidepressants and gets you feeling better so it's again like you get in there and I mean it's scary to go again like I said there's there's all these different people in there the man found the research on it by treating his an autistic kid and you can see the before and after videos of this kid and it's like damn okay and then I brought my son into because he has ADHD and he's off his medication now as well so I'm going in there they do it EEG first and that they can tell which parts of your brain are firing at what hurts in seeing the congruencies and like how all of that is happening or not happening and then they kind of prescribed these these different these machines like on your on your brain that make these like electric impulses but they're magnetic to kind of speed up or slow down the different parts of your brain so if the front of your brain is moving slower than the back of your brain or those or whatever so they're noticing obviously patterns with fighters hockey players football players like like people that are leading with their heads basically having like and then with the veterans are like emotional things too or I mean the Everest and yeah and then like I mean having to compartmentalize as well like some of the they see should be upsetting you know in and you know but there's there's different ways that we can train our brain to to drop things like that and then PTSD is when it's involuntary and it all comes in and and that so you know I I've been diagnosed with PTSD I had walked in there with medication because of being depressed and the anxiety and all of that like my symptoms were terrible and I know there are a combination of things but even like my startle reflex like you know I could hear someone come walking around the corner like hear their shoes but the second I'd see them it would it would stop my heart for a second and that's like on your adrenal glands you know and in all this stuff was you know an anxiety that I don't know it was it was hard to fall asleep at night you know my memory was crapping and this is all you know different stuff happening in all these other fighters that I know as well but I mean like I said I've been trying things so much so much over the past few years that I get excited about and either it works or it doesn't and the the point is is now I found this and I feel better from this but I I was so excited about all these other things like I can't just start telling everybody of the new thing that I found because I've said that and been excited about like everything else but this one this one of the things you've been excited about like the equal scope it's like it's a same thing it's kind of like a TENS machine or stent machine but like a super super low frequency and that's badass - I get it it helped on injuries like you know if I rolled my ankle or hurt my toe like you could bring the swelling down from this - to normal essentially in like an hour and a half just work you know with this like tens unit on it and I mean they originally used it for race horses and fur you know super expensive million dollar horses like the equipment they brought over was like 90 grand and like like these really specific like special metals that were put into these plates and you know they would do stuff like that but that wasn't working on my head it was working on injuries and it was working on I want to say it helped with like my like digestive system maybe or my I don't remember some some other things that was helping with - but what you know I I started doing that or I was doing that when I walked into mindset and started doing that treatment and so what do they do at Monza so you sit in this chair you know and they had they put this prescription in this machine and the machine is kind of got like a like a arm that goes on a specific part of your brain and you you know you close your eyes and it sends these these magnetic pulses into your head and I mean you don't feel anything it's almost like you can hear what it feels like but I don't know how to describe it it's it's a sense it's there's it's sensual but it's not it's not exactly hearing and it's not exactly feeling oh but you can tell something's happen yeah and I mean you you leave the place after your treatment like I go I would go twice a day it's 45 minutes away both ways so I I'm driving a lot every day to go to do this because I want to give it a fair shot do you do it every day I do every day I haven't gone these past couple weeks stuff with my kids schedule school's almost out and then wanting to try out different things different coaches as far as these new disciplines go so I haven't been there as much but yeah for the last is August I believe is when I was like really really getting into it and going twice a day 45 minutes each way twice a day twice a day yeah so you would you would spend 45 minutes one way one way go back and then go back again and then go back much just move closer to where the place is because the Alliance was down there and so I would I would drop my kid off at school I would run and then I would go there I would do my treatment I'd go back to practice down in southern San Diego then I'd get my son and then we'd go up there for the afternoon session and then I'd come back down and we'd go to his sports and then I'd have my second two it is mm-hmm that does not leave a lot of free time for cat Zingano that alone could be stressful I was seeing the results that was the crazy thing is I feel better what did the results feel like when I just walked in like like God like I couldn't sleep I had just a anxiety like I had that that startle effect going like the my memory was and these were all things that I went to the UF CPI to talk to them about because I'm like I don't know what to do like I I want to fight they offered me to fight Chris cyborg at 145 that's more the same yeah I was like well like hell yeah let's take that but like can you guys at least help me get this figured out first please you know and they're like sure so Duncan French he's at the the he's at he so he went to college and was I know he was at Notre Dame using this treatment with the doctor Kevin Murphy that runs the mindset so he was like this guy is doing a lot of things with people as far as brain health he's like go see them when you get back to San Diego it's kind of far from you but like give it a shot Kat and I called the guy I'm on the phone super frustrated like super like emotional I'm like I'm I'm at my wit's end like I've tried everything I can think of like holistic views like chemical views this like everything I mean spending money out of my pocket trying to figure this out because none of this is covered by the USC especially because you know not something I claimed in a fight I mean I fought Amanda and if you don't claim that stuff within the 30 days like you're on your own and of course my head hurt of course I'm dizzy of course the lights are bright of course I can't think right I got in a fistfight you know and I wasn't doing good in it for a while so I figured you know but then a month and a half two months out when I wasn't better it's like so even though it clearly came from that fight you still don't get covered mm-hmm what not one it's endocrinologist play that first round go what the do you think happened yeah but I mean if you play that video for them if anybody in the insurance business was denying you coverage saying that didn't happen while you were under the banner of the UFC like you're out of your mind watch that video what do you think is happening well this assassin is throwing bombs at your face I mean that's that is crazy that that's not covered yeah that makes me sick oh it's frustrating because it bye-bye it like literally you look at the papers like it costs me more to fight then then it then I'm eight you know might make sense if it was dealing with a broken hand or a torn ligament or something like that it might make sense and might it does not make any sense if you're talking about brain injuries because anybody who understands how brain injuries work know that there's there's a considerable amount of time after a fight where you still or suffering from symptoms and you might decide 30 days later 60 days later 90 days later you got to do something about it well I mean now I know now I've come out of a fight and I'm like my pinky hurts my elbow hurts my hair hurts my eyebrow hurts like we're gonna claim all of this you know cuz before I was just being tough you know yeah but what fighters do this is why it's so crazy and I didn't like I didn't get it didn't know and then but they should know if they're in the if they're in the business of insuring fighters they should have a larger window where people can claim head injuries right we talk about that's I mean that it kind of goes together with like any kind of any kind of mental anything like you and you talk about mental illness you talk about head injuries you talk about TBI it all goes into that stigma of like you can't see it so it must not be real right you know what I mean or whatever so it's like but that's the head injury business I mean basically yeah the point is to make them drop and be done that's what everybody it's not it's not the worst thing in the world the win with a body kick or an armbar but the reality is what people like is to see head injuries we're in the head injury business right you know yeah yeah so how long after you starting with this treatment do you start to see results so the first I would say the first thing I noticed was my motor skills in practice so you know I would go do you think your motor skills were impaired no I well I just feel like I had a block like I said like it was comical and I mean you can even ask them at Alliance and it was funny it was funny but not to have like we're in class you know we're learning I'm watching the coaches like they do a drill and they explain it and it they look up alright everybody ready ready 1 2 3 go and we clap and I have no I idea what we're doing you know like we walk off and I'm like like there was even a couple of times where they like they clapping they're like Katt what are we doing and I'm like three kick and they're like no 20 push-ups and I'm like man I'm not even like I'm not just a bad kid like talking because I'm right I don't hear you like I don't write I I can like not lose eye contact the whole time like sit here and I'm like focused but it's not going in but no I'm not retaining it unless though like if it has to be the last thing that they do like we can't talk about if it's the last thing I see I can go do it or I could go do it but if they're like right and then they explained some philosophy about it or do some movement or whatever like then I lose what we're doing like my mind would just go right to something else like I had a very hard time concentrating and you know it's it's crazy because when I got to this facility you know I didn't know I didn't necessarily know what I was walking into but they have you do this questionnaire and like on this questionnaire is like all of these things I'm like that's part of something like me not being able to focus that's part of something my sleep that's part of something this startle effect is part of something like me having these like completely like specific things that are all on this was like damn okay like I didn't even want to see the EEG because I was I was scared you know I was like what if you can't fix me and now I know all the that's wrong with me like that's that sucks but then you know they show you different EGS and they show you the they take it every single week and so you actually get to see it and you get to see the level that you were functioning at especially the different parts of your brain but then and the thing is that's awesome about this is you get to keep the results like unless you go do exactly what you did and go it up again like you get to keep it it's not like this maintenance package which is you know a problem for these pharmaceutical computers there's there's not a whole lot of retention on it because once people get their brains functioning as long as you're not sitting there hitting your head against the wall like you get a keep feeling better like these these veterans get to go back to to combat or whatever it is their job is like we fighters get to go back football players get to go back like I sat in with the Chargers medical staff and talked about our stuff there as well I I I don't even remember who else there was people from all over the country coming and asking about this you know and needing to sit in and and they're looking at these aegs in particular so what is it doing like how is it fixing you so one um I think it you know there's something with what goes on in your brain with with the thyroid stuff with the endocrine stuff is like getting your damage to your hip both almas right and that's like that that kind of directs all of the information that goes to your thyroid your thyroid you know then sends out everything to your body and there when there's like a disconnect there now it just it screws everything up and then top of it like now that we're cutting the same way we've always had to cut but we don't get IVs I mean I mean you cannot 100% rehydrate your brain within 45 or 48 hours like you can get your body decently hydrated I believe but your brain is just its its own thing you know and so now we don't have IVs or hydraulic system in our brain is down and now we're rattling it even more like dehydrated I mean we're just going to have you know bigger side effects to our brains being dehydrated that now the damage that comes to the HIPPA thalamus to the pituitary to the your thyroid all of that that goes on there that that there they're saying that you can you can get it firing back at a level that it was before it got hurt like as long as the cells are still alive in it they can reenergize those cells now if you have like just a dead part of your brain you know they're not bringing it back to life but they can use these magnets to kind of fluff them back up give them back their energy their their life and and put in put them back into a functional way that was something similar to you at your healthiest and and make it I mean not more or less durable just back right when you when you were saying motor skills like what was wrong because that's one of the things that they see in fighters that have taken too many shots they start having you they analyze fighters gates and one of the things that happens is your legs get closer together your your balance is off your your steps are shorter you don't have that sort of like dynamic fluid motion to your body and you're having a heart a heart of time with balance and just motor skills yeah totally so how I felt before going into there was all I had was a gas pedal I was like just will you know and just  them you know just because I I wasn't reading patterns of people anymore like if someone leans this way a little bit am i okay I know what you're thinking like if they step this way that way and even me juking them and like trying to like faint at them like I I wasn't I couldn't even see the reaction I was making them make like I knew what motions in my skilar memory to make them do but it like I wasn't getting the feedback because it just like wasn't so that was one of the first things I noticed was you know going back into practice and and watching people's angles and beating them to it and and like remembering I'm like damn I don't just have to shoot to shoot like I can wait and do it when it's at the right time or I can even like like take advantage of of the fact that you know I'm making them step back or I can flash fire in their face and and jump on them at their knee-jerk reaction you know like these things of like being able to manipulate the situation and make them adjust to me like I could see that again and I could see something were you seeing before like when I just had go all I had was go when you didn't see movement like say if someone's gonna spin and they're like loaded up their hips you didn't see that no it's just hit on first what were you seeing III didn't all I saw was get there first all I saw was like close the distance don't get hit in the head like make like get down get low and just be a linebacker you know and and hit him because I I knew I wasn't seeing that stuff and the more I tried to see it the more I would just sit there and wear it because I'm like any minute now wait a minute now I'm gonna I'm gonna catch the pattern I'm gonna catch the pattern but it wasn't it wasn't popping up so then all I was just you know if you were just like super light sparring just moving around you didn't see it no and no not really no wow yeah that's terrified I was like yeah it was really scary and like even I'd even get to like a good position in jujitsu and I'd be like I know I know stuff here I know I know stuff here but you didn't know what to do what was it what was it what was it I know I know stuff you know but like it wasn't like especially with adrenaline firing like it wasn't just happening for me and so like three four weeks into that all of a sudden like that fog was starting to go down a bit right and like part of it was and I'm also sleeping better we have to go before like during like the first week every person I went to could fix me right and you're driving 45 minutes like what the yeah in a in a car I least all those miles you know it's like damn and it's a super frustrating yes everyone can fix me everyone can fix me and then they don't and then my hearts broken again and then I go to the next one and then my heart's broken again and then and then the next one said this one I'm like I'm like I'm not even gonna tell people about this because I'm sick of hitting up people and being excited about it and telling him to come with me and then it doesn't work and then I'm that guy again right you know and so going into this and then watching it work and then seeing all the other people it was working for and their that and they were never trying to push me to promote it they were like just come in just get here you know and and if you like it then tilt the because the UFC was talking about getting one of the machines at the p.i and they're kind of gonna have me be like a guinea pig for it Ian McCall went in there too but it didn't like he he was doing his own kind of other stuff that was making it so it wasn't working for him but like I I was all in you know it's something that was making it so wasn't working I don't think he was coming in often so I think and the thing is is that it does stir  up right so like they they they mess with your the the levels because again they have to like if the backyard brain is running at four Hertz and and okay eight is technically where like you're sleeping you're at rest like you're there's part of your brains that could be under your resting hurts right well the front of your brain is running at 12 so that's like high anxiety but like low energy and and they can they can almost tell you how you've been feeling lately which was like nuts to me right and you could they can tell you know because of this and this that you have some OCD tendencies versus this person constantly feels like they have no energy and their memory isn't working and they're emotionally incapable of like being in you know being a positive force in a relationship right now cuz I don't have it so they could read a brain like that damn I need to get my it's scary though cuz I when you see that like little like in there you're like what's that but it's for me it's that's a two hour drive yeah I know that they're I don't know if they have anything up here I know that they they have a bunch all over here it is that's called I couldn't the websites not coming up at this personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation a non-invasive therapeutic approach to the treatment of PTSD and other neurocognitive disorders Kevin T Murphy MD vice chair department of radiation medicine Applied Sciences UC San Diego director pediatric radiation oncology program Rady Children's Hospital San Diego Wow so that's where you going and I mean obviously during this whole thing you have to be questioning what you do for a living oh yeah well and it's like okay so they can fix this say they fix it and then I go do it again well you know fight cyborgs right I mean you earth you were thinking about fixing it and you you were going from one girl who hits like a dude to another girl who might hit like a bigger dude cyborgs terrifying and it's like I know healthy at my healthiest hmm like no problem I believe that like I believe in myself like that like I can figure them out especially and find a way to not get hit doing it like I didn't get hit in my MMA career significant a hit not one significant significant hit until Amanda and then after that I was getting if I can lit up right and and not even that even Julianna like she kind of open hand bitch-slapped me a little bit from the sides but I and but like I can find a way to to like still control it enough to be like like very effective without taking too much damage but like that that slow of my my motor skills my mechanics it was really bothering me and that's not how you go fight someone like cyborg you don't go in there with that weight in your pocket you know it's so important that you're talking about this because this is a this is such a factor that we don't see on the outside other people you know other people than the people that are really close to you that you talk to about these things like if we were seeing you fight and you know when we see the decline of certain fighters you know you see certain fighters they they're in a couple really hard fights and then you see a decline like a real obvious decline in their skills their abilities very very rarely are they opening up about what's going on about losing memory about not being able to see patterns in people about not not having their motor skills in that things are off you know so you talking about this I think is it's so important and it's so important for young fighters to recognize like hey this is also on the table like here's a great therapy for it but this is also a possibility of you know if you do fight a killer like Amanda Nunez this is one of the things that can happen to you well and it's partially because I have man I have teammates yeah I have people that are 10 times worse than me that are just like I mean the stuff I hear the stuff I see it's it's sad and it's scary and they have kids and they're not going anywhere soon you know I mean in their passing their MRIs right you know what I mean like the past their MRIs cuz what does the MRI really see I don't know I don't know but if they went to this place and got all their brain mapped out and find out how everything is firing it might be a completely different result like we might be retiring people way earlier at least forcing them into therapy way earlier possible yeah and I mean that another thing is it's like the risk needs to be worth the reward and and you know like right now in this war it's it's juvenile and it's not getting us like this kind of like like I can't afford to take another two years off because I went and I fought cyborg while I'm sick and something bad happens to me you know and I mean like I want to be sharp and if and if that means I have to take time take the time I took off off and get healthy and do all these different therapies conservative traditional and non-traditional like all of that and so I can feel the way I feel now and the like I'm pumped and I'm excited but like that is something that I I really want to know that people know they can go do and it's not vulnerable it's not saying you're weak it's not something wrong with you like like it's your health and your longevity and your future because that if you don't treat it it doesn't get better and like you don't understand the depression you don't understand like and there's an identity that goes away with like seeming like you failed or you can't do it anymore or whatever like that that mental health aspect that comes with the physical health of your brain like that all that all needs to that all all needs to be more educated as far as these fighters go swears all of it goes like I'm happy to be the guinea pig because I'm damned I just want to see everybody okay you know well I'm happy that you're talking about it but it's it's been something that you know I've talked about quite a bit and that the the real problems behind traumatic brain injuries because I've had a bunch of experts and I've talked to a bunch of neurologists and I've talked to neuroscientists and people that are really studying this stuff and I've been real vocal about it and it's it's a tricky situation because obviously I'm a commentator but like when someone gets knocked out I'm very vocal about them taking a long time off and it's one of the things that happened after Ronda got knocked out by Holly they were talking about getting her back within like it was like four or five months later to to fight again and I was like we're gonna have a rematch with Holly I'm like you guys are crazy like you're crazy she shouldn't be doing anything she shouldn't be getting hit she shouldn't be sparring she there's she shouldn't be getting her head rattled and she definitely shouldn't be fighting Holly Holm who just kicked her into another dimension five months later or whatever it was six months later I'm like there's no way this is not it should not be happening like you don't even know what's going on yet you don't even know what kind of damage I mean think of what happened with you and Amanda you stayed conscious at least I mean Ronda got flatlined and then got hammer fisted in the head while she was flatlined it was a one of the most brutal knockouts in women's MMA ever mm-hmm and you know and you saw when she came back and fought Amanda and and got hit like right away that hesitation oh she was just if and up and the fear and then also Amanda I felt even before the Holly Holm fight I felt like Amanda was the the more dangerous fight for her because of her hands because Ronda is always in this position where she's closing the gap she's getting close to you because she wants to clinch up with you and throw you and take you to the ground an armbar you and what have you but with Amanda you're dealing with the Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt who knocks people  dead one punch like it's a terrible matchup I felt and obviously that proved to be true but what drove me crazy was how dismissive all these people behind the scenes were all these agents and Hollywood people and all these people that just have no idea what business they're in they really don't even understand this business the business it's basically the business like we said of head injuries and you're just like you're trying to sell this thing where you're you're dealing with someone who had a significant head injury and now you're pushing them back in there was someone who's really good at delivering head injuries and is this is this really all been mapped out I mean what kind of training have has changed I mean what is she still with the same coach does she done anything differently like what what do you think what what result is going to be different you know and the the downplaying of the significance of a ruthless knockout like that I just don't think can be understated I think people should take a long time off when they get knocked out like that a long time yeah well and I mean in especially some sort of like invasive treatment like from out the gates or something like that looked at you studied and I mean I mean I know they put a flashlight in your eyes and asked you if you okay send you to the doctor do whatever but I mean like and I think honestly that's what the UFC is like effort wasn't in this in in offering this information of this treatment to me was to see like hey is this something that would would benefit fighters and in a situation like that it's at the P I it's not at the P I but what they were saying is it would be at the P I still but the the trick with it is that it is something needs you need to go to I need you to go to twice a day and have that like schedule of it in that routine of it but as fighters like flying to only Vegas for it and paying our own room and board our own flight potentially having to fly our coaches and to have to you know keep us working and doing whatever while we're working I mean it's just and I don't know I mean you know it's it's a tricky business you know it's real tricky business and how old do you know 35 do you wonder how much longer you gonna do this I like I feel like I got like a good couple years left like I'm I'm still having fun you know in like the chests of it is still fun and like the training is still fun and I'm still learning and like enjoying it and I don't know like getting through everything that I'm getting through and learning everything that I'm learning is like it's so inspiring to me because I definitely don't feel done like I still have so much fight in my heart and like I really love putting my hands on people and always like advancing and improving and the day I stopped improving you know then I can look at that but right now like I don't care about Plan B I don't care about what's next because that's not what's happening so your passion for doing is still there yeah and the purpose there the passion is is huge I love the passion you know that to me is huge but the purpose like the bigger picture the the what I'm doing here what I was born to do what I was born to get through like I have to get through this like I want to get through this and I'm getting through this and I'm watching myself and that is like it's badass to me it's exciting to me it's it's it's what I'm doing here you know and I I'm I'm all in like and and I can make I can just make things for myself that I get to show myself every single day that like no one could have ever told me you know it's all stuff that I know firsthand from my experience from my world from me trying things from me risking things like all of that and and to understand myself and to know myself like it's been the biggest reward out of all of this you know yourself through the struggles and know yourself through the fights yeah all of it I mean and like even how much you get to learn just even going into a fight right like realizing so going into a fight being on antidepressants like okay I'll wake up I'll wake up but I don't know what this will do I feel flat I don't feel flat I'll be okay with these people they're FBI won't be okay with these people here like like all of that is very clear about things that like the has my attention whether I know it or not that that's something in my life that needs needs to be looked at it needs to be addressed okay there's direction like all I ever want is understanding and direction like I just want to know you know and so I get to deal with that that that leads me to come to San Diego San Diego is a new chapter in my life that I get to name you know also for my kid and myself like it's it's I I get a reveal so much to myself through trying different things and to just kind of like letting life take me down the path that I'm supposed to without me sitting here freaking out about control freaking out about things that I can do nothing about you know I just want to walk away from all of this like content and happy with how I did whether that means I never have my right hand raised again I don't think that's the case like beating these girls having the belt that is not a pipe dream I already beat them you know it's not like it's I'm incapable of that and I'm just wishing I got my fingers crossed you know it's it's not that my whole journey of my life in sports from being a kid was to meet my highest best to be my highest good and and that is what's driven me the whole time I look at these girls and I respect them because they're here doing what I'm doing we're all just out here trying to be the best at it we're all trying to participate we're all trying to you know find ourselves in it and learn what we can learn and go implement it you know and so for that I have respect for every single one of them some of them I like less than others some of them I like more than others you know but really like we're building this stage together we're doing this together you know and I'm I'm extremely proud to be part of something like this and my position in it and my purpose in it is to you know find my personal good my personal best and you know this has been an extremely long road for me nothing has been easy and I respect that like I'm grateful for that like all the things I know because of the hard times like I feel fortunate to know you know and I never learned them any other way and I get to handle them and not only do I get to handle them I get to like like relate and understand people and see things differently because I get it you know maybe not exactly word for word pinpoint / pinpoint who's gonna make me fall over right but you know it's it's all there and it all matters to me and how I get through this really really matters to me because I know it matters to other people too you know and and how they do inspires me as well do you know what you're gonna do when you stop I I just don't I mean I feel like there's us things there's this awesome resume I'm building right you know like I'm a UFC fighter I'm a national champion in wrestling like I'm I'm I'm I don't know constantly advocating in working on working on myself and trying to help get other people working on themselves to like I don't know what all that's gonna look like and the thing is I don't even want to I don't want to look I don't want to care about all that yet because that's not where I'm at and like I want to be all in here I don't want to think about what's next to plan B or or how all like all of that because my heart is here you know it's like what are you gonna do in your next marriage right now I'm I'm here I'm doing what I'm doing and I'm not looking towards what's next because right now I'm here that's great listen that's what you want to hear from someone who's fighting I mean fighting should be all in that that is the only way to approach it if you're a fighter and you're also a neurosurgeon to part-time real estate salesman good  luck you don't have a hundred percent to give everything you've got one 100% especially with something like fighting it's just such a crazy way to make a living you really have to be 100% committed to it it has to be your life mm-hmm and I I appreciate the opportunity I like I like I like everything I'm doing right now you know and I feel like all of that will be part of what's next but I like that that will manifest that'll figure itself out I mean not too they like hippie way of Oh everything will be great I'm sure like when it's time I'll look at that right but right now this is what I'm looking at also the the kind of drive and discipline and work ethic that you showed to become a top-level MMA fighter and a national champion in wrestling you could do anything with that and whatever you set your mind to I really truly believe that I mean I think the biggest problem that fighters have when they retire is finding a thing to put their energy to and then their identity because their identity is of a fighter and when that is taken away from them there's that and also the thrill I mean there's you guys are experiencing a level of excitement and intensity like when you're talking about two weeks out you're crying in the fetal position going with the am i dealing but that all builds up to these moments like that crazy primal scream after you stopped Amanda Nunez like that's a experience at very few people other than people who fight to the death are feeling there's there's something there's something that you guys are experiencing that unless you're the person in the woods fighting over that bone you really don't know you don't know and then for you to go to regular life after that it's going to be hard and it's gonna be hard for a lot of fighters it's it's very difficult for a lot of Fighters to find another thing that excites them the way fighting excites them because it's such a crazy pursuit and then on top of that you're dealing with what you're dealing with but you're dealing with it publicly you're talking about it which i think is a you're doing a great service to everybody when you're talking about your problems and your issues because there's so many fighters that you know that are experiencing this and that I know that are experiencing this and you know everybody who anybody who's done any sort of martial arts competition and been in gyms you're gonna see people that that have taken too many shots it's just part of the game and you you know it's what you're doing by talking about it so openly while you're still a top-level fighter is I think very very important for everybody thanks I'm trying man it's been a lot of trying things but I do I do feel value in this you know and I mean exactly when people are done like there's some pride in having a go get a nine-to-five or whatever you know after being a level of fighter at this level mind you should you not have the brain cells to be in life but like like I got a high functioning thing that you can be proud of you know I mean it's it could be really stressful to not live up to the capability that you know you have what you're just not like there's that wall or that fog or whatever you know so I mean I just think people maintaining themselves and doing everything they can however vulnerable it feels like I could do it like it's possible that they could read this therapy across the country and how big of these machines have I mean they look like that so they they have like mobile units but again like it would need to be on I don't know if it's on some sort of route or whatever that people would need to be able to show up to or what but they I know they have one in Indiana I know I know they're gonna have one in Colorado so and I think relative to the training center and when you say mobile units like how big these mobile units and are they as effective as the one that you're going to it's a creeper van you know yeah it's like you get in and it's the same exact chair you know and then they have their their trained nurse know where to put it on you I don't and then even the EEG I mean it's like a it's a wireless EEG so I know that every week they they make you do the EEG like same time relatively at the same time so they can keep good track of what your brain is doing and how to prescribe the levels to be at what on your head and I I think they have one in Arizona I know there's one in Texas I want to say there's 12 over the country but I can't tell you where and the mobile one I mean how big is this I mean is this something that a gym could get and how is it prohibitively expensive I want to say again I might be full of but I think they're like $100,000 for that machine but I do know that they're being insurance will cover it because that for insurance will cover for migraine PTSD and autism I think I think that insurance will cover it for that but then TRICARE is also accepting them as insurance as well Wow and so when they're doing this to you and you know you said you got it in August you started doing it and you started seeing improvements after he said four weeks yeah four weeks it was like the first time I saw improvements and then the bigger improvements were coming leader yeah does it does it keep getting better I mean is it better now than it was last month yeah I mean to the point where I can I'm I'm okay not going for 3-4 weeks you know like like I said these last few weeks have been all about me getting everything right to be in training camp right now so you feel right now like you felt before the núñez right in the way I'm training like I'm having fun with it again like I'm watching people I'm like  with them like I'll get them to step that way and then I'll step that way and there's gotta be very satisfied oh my god especially the one from yeah it was gone and and like that is the art to me is the games and the playing and and the like getting you to do this so I can do that and then and you know like that was what was fun but getting in a fight is not fun right but the chess that's what's fun the game like like making the oohs and the ahhs and the crowd happen because you know some gangster you know what I mean like that's fun that part's fun right going in and getting cut up and bloody and having headaches and like your ankle hurts for a month and boy it's not fun no one wants to do that on purpose yeah you know I want to go in and do what I can and not get touched and then have it go on a highlight reel you know and I wasn't happening for a while and even on this last one it's just like man I felt better I totally felt better and and but what I needed to change wasn't that that that was fine what I need to change is other things that I'm changing and I am and again like if that's how have to learn it cool but like it's all part of the process you know I'm not at no second in this entire thing have I stopped believing in myself no second the only thing I worried about was like it was like all right am I gonna be is my son changing my diapers here in a few years if I keep doing this you know like I don't want that that but I never stopped believing that this is what I'm meant to do right here right now and I have time and I have more fights and I have everything it takes about and beat every single one of these girls some of them again you know I dunno now when you're in camp how many days are you doing two-a-days yeah so some of them are it'll be like sometimes I'll have to add more cardio in the morning so like if there's fasted cardio if I'm heavy you know depending on how that goes as it's like a science about 45 like what do you walk around I I can get all the way up to light I've I've been all the way up to 76 but that was before I didn't know that was when I didn't I was I didn't know I was hypothyroid oh so I mean now I was eating like 600 calories a day and doing fasted cardio and two workouts and my weight wasn't changing my coaches were like what the fuck's wrong with you I'm like I don't know I guess the women in my family get kind of big so maybe it's just that Midwestern style hitting me now you know but no and then when I went and I got my panels I'm like everything was all screwed up you know and then that posted núñez fight before the new nest fight what was the heaviest you got before then I never broke a hundred like 150 552 Wow yeah that's crazy yeah yeah I walked around like 140 I didn't even have to cut cut for Misha I walked I woke up in the morning like to just didn't eat breakfast Wow yeah and then now I'm a big man majima like I look at food and I get fat it's nothing to do so annoying but I don't hate it one armored thyroid or something um we've levothyroxine mm-hmm yeah yeah I take it every morning in like 15 minutes before I can eat anything have you should look into Armour thyroid it's a thyroid that's made from pig thyroid and apparently it's it more bioavailable a lot of people have better results with it I would I would I would try I won't try I wouldn't try it now just cuz I'm in camp but maybe in between the next ones yeah I'm hypothyroid - really yeah runs in my family yeah I'm my family too I didn't have a weight problem because I was working out a lot but I was getting headaches and I went to doctor to get like at the end of the day like say around like 7 o'clock at night after dinner I would be so tired that I just like I couldn't talk I just had to lie down I couldn't hear it I couldn't know am I gonna talk boom go out and it was like god these headaches are weird like this is it didn't seem it didn't seem normal like the the late I guess was like after dinner headaches like right before bed it was just it was it was not a normal exhaustion I started getting nervous about it and then when I got to checked out it made sense my mom has it my sister has it runs in our family yeah I don't know if it's that genetic for my family but you think it's from the heaven I yeah I mean it was right away yeah it was on set and then you know then you do these MRIs and you do all of this other stuff in a sec alright well there's where your head hurts and there's what's wrong and you know so I mean it was just it's all too perfect you know who puts together your camps like who decides what you're gonna do as far as like how much work you're gonna do what kind of training you're going to do what are you gonna do sparring or they're gonna do so this training camp i I'm a horse doing different things so I have like I I talked to Eric del Fiero about it and like I said I said I wanted to outsource the jiu-jitsu and the metallian those are gonna in itself takes so much time right and then my strength and conditioning I'm doing with Chad misty is he's he's badass so my strength and conditioning coach Loren Landau do you know who he is in Colorado so he's like family to me he's been there for everything like I don't even know when he got there he but he was always there you know he told me about Chad and so I started doing strength and conditioning with him I'm gonna do that three days a week and and I know that I want to get working with the more traditional muy Thai again so I'm working with John X two days a week and I think he's gonna arrange my sparring as well and then Andre galvo I'm gonna try to work two or three days a week and then so I handed all of that information to Loren Landau and my other coach my nutritionist is Josh Ford have you seen it before he's got like a tattoo goatee on his face no he's been doing my nutrition and I've he's known me since all I did was jiu-jitsu you know so he's been around he knows my style he knows me as a crazy fighter and all of that so hoops to get here Lauren and Lauren Leo and Josh Ford there they're putting it together based off of what they've seen out of me in the past but if you're going to jiu-jitsu and you're doing a lot of jiu-jitsu training and then you're going to more time doing muy Thai training when do you get together and do MMA training that'll be the sparring days and then there will be a light sparse like that kind of drill day in the middle in there - so are you sparring Muay Thai and then sparring MMA no I'm gonna be sparring Mme so that'll be where I mix together but in like that's kind of how I like it - like I like doing disciplines separate and then and then me finding where to put them in and a lot of times that's where my freestyle wrestling just ties it all together so your Muay Thai training would basically just be technique drills mm-hmm and then jiu-jitsu are you going I did no geef or I did ghee for like the past four weeks and man it hurts your feelings but then obviously it's more practical to do it to do the noogie and now they took the ghee off of me and I'm like a thousand miles an hour I'm so happy with my slippery yeah and what about wrestling you do any wrestling training that part I I still got to figure out down in San Diego I want a freestyle wrestler I'm not he like I got a great shot I'm good at shots and whatever but I'm Way more about throws like I like they're they're so much more efficient for me I got awesome hips for them and it's just like man they're they're high-risk high-reward but it's my funky style like I just get them done right and it's so much less effort when you toss someone over their head on the ground and they don't know where they are for a minute there's so much to capitalize on there with the equilibrium just off and like those are things I like like I count on so I need to find that freestyle situation yet I have good freestyle wrestling myself but obviously like like it's good to stay on top of those like it's my strength but I need to keep my strength strong so I'm looking I'm gonna make that happen so what do you walk around that right now I'm like 155 156 so 45 is possibility yeah I mean and I've I've wanted to go there as well I mean like I said not having that fluid on our brains when we fight kind of bugs me like if I can walk down and 145 and eat breakfast like yeah I mean I won't I'm like eating clean eating right everything perfect I'm 155 yeah because I watched one of the they had a video cyborg cutting weight to make 140 remember and they went there which didn't make any sense there wasn't even a weight class for 140 yeah they were I don't know what the they were doing with her they were trying to prime her for 135 or seeing if she can make 135 yeah but she was like weeping and it looked like she was dying I'm like what the man yeah did she do the water cut in that one like the the bathtub well she was hard to watch and she gets big too like they I'm friends with the way I'll be who's her boyfriend and he like hit me up when I was supposed to fight Ronda they were hitting me up during my training camp like hey because I think they had obviously they have beef and I think they wanted it to be like kind of political but I'm just like not in to that but they were like hey how about Chris you do you have any girl training partners how about Chris come train with you to get ready for Ronda and I was like oh maybe I mean how big is she and they're like like I went 82 and 83 like what what how does that help me that's another big on me I'm like I'm thanks but yeah like I got Neil Magny right there yeah I dude over like those guys are 182 she's so big that's so crazy I mean she really should probably be fighting 165 yeah and there's a 55 you know coming hopefully yeah I mean I just don't know I mean there's only so many 45s mm-hmm she's on that 45 and I think even 45 is a brutal struggle for her and you know as you said you could only do that so many times it's taking a little bit of your life every time you do that you know you're you're chipping away at my organs and I just like I remember coming into MMA and like I used to cut to 125 like dying dying and so I was I wanted to be ranked number one at 125 that was my goal before I moved up and like I did I was ranked number one there beat everybody I could be and then it was just kind of like the last time I made 125 I just I I fought a girl named 2k Ohashi from Japan and I remember it was like last minute cause I was supposed to fight a girl something happened to her and then they replaced her with Takeo and I just remember being so happy that we were at altitude because I was like I I think I had a heat stroke at the the water cut like the bathtub cut because I was in the water for like 20 minutes and I remember at 10 minutes I was like something's wrong something's wrong something's wrong and they're like you have to stay you have to stay and so the 20 minute line I like though of like a salmon like out of the water and I passed out on my floor and that gave no shits that my managers there and I'm naked and like I don't I don't know I'm out to the point where they're doing the knuckle rub on my sternum you know to try to get me up and then rub on yours yeah you know trying to wake you up that's how they wake you your sternum yeah cuz it's like something with the nerves here like hit your adrenaline is so bad and so I'm up and I'm like you know your hands and arms are tingling and everything because you're like waking up you know and I'm like I don't want to get back in that bathtub like put the sauna suit on me I don't like put it on me I don't what you know so not that that like I mean health-wise I was not okay but it was like I'm not getting back in there so they put this on a tsunami my hands are like freaking out like doing this weird shaky like t-rex arm thing and cramping so bad and my feet were doing the same thing but it was like like they had to cover me in the blankets and put all the stuff on me to keep me hot because I was not getting back in that hot tub or the bathtub well it was terrible and after that like I remember I felt it in the fight and I was I'm so glad we're at altitude because I feel horrible like I can't do this again and then I went up to 35 Jesus Christ is the worst part of fighting it really is and it's so it's so unnecessary there's got to be I mean what one Fc is doing they've got some there they're eliminating weight cuts by doing hydration tests and testing people several times during the camp finding out what you weigh finding out what your actual weight is and Ben Askren went into the the what the way they're doing it in detail and I did a podcast with him but that seems to be the way and they made everybody move up a weight class essentially I mean and that's the thing is I like contract contracts can still exist but maybe you're just contracted as a fighter and you have to fight certain amounts of time of year or or whatever but to have people contracted to weight classes is like it's hurting the sport and it's obviously hurting fighters individually as well but like it's just unnecessary yeah but you should do is fight mean I think there should be more weight classes there should be more weight classes so there's more opportunities and you should be fighting at what you are when you're healthy it's hard enough well and I think especially because the sport is because I mean it's very blatantly clear that it's it's this is not a bracketed sport like this is an entertainment sport now it's clear like we're doing what puts butts in the seats we're doing what's best for the fans so at that point what are these divisions really matter it's about the matchup you know you can throw a belt on any fight these days like so I think if we're gonna evolve the sport to to having entertaining fights or entertainment type fights like we should just evolve the the contracts to that as well like  I mean it'll still save the entertainment like look you can get or catch weights even like what do you guys want to agree on Yeah right like who's down for what if you had an ideal weight what would it be to fight at yes probably 45 45 yeah I feel like I'm skinny enough that I'm like flying squirrel flexible stuff you know but but still hell is strong you know but when you're dealing with someone like cyborg who's coming down from 180 that's the thing that was me healthy like it don't matter like I'm in the water she's a rock you know and that that's something I remember thinking when I was going into 25s is like I'm gonna be huge against all these girls you know like they they may not be as dehydrated and up isn't me but I can hold him down right you know and and I can do what I want and eventually break them right you know and she's got that in her back pocket too yeah but like you know you get the I thought watching the Tonya Avenger fight like there was a lot of things that I I saw in that fight against Chris and I was like damn like that that right there there's there's a there's there's something I could do there that's right to me seemed like Chris's being very cautious and conservative and that she was just picking her shots and just trying to be very professional like the way she was fighting was not like this marauding rampaging destroyer like we've seen in some of her other fights she fought much more technical and just and Tonya Avenger was throwing wild barstool type she was just she her hands were down she's winging big bombs she knew she had to go for broke and you know Tonya average is tough as just to take that fight I mean the difference in size was so apparent between the two of them when you saw them inside the cage and you know Tonya's just just a really tough woman but her style was she was just trying to be unpredictable and wild you know and cyborg was just moving in like just real real professional and technical I felt like she was cautious it me was a big fight for her to you know yeah yeah that was the first was that the first belt defense what was that no that was the first belt because Hollywood you're making that for the belt right and then that didn't happen again yeah and I was like not interested yeah where did she go oh she's still fighting well she remember right after the fight I interviewed her after she won first of all that fight bothered me it bothered me a lot she hit Halle after the bell twice won hard and really rocked her and I watched out I was like man that is a big shot and like you you could say you accidentally did it once maybe but she did it twice and one time hurt or bad and even so when I watched the fight I'm like that's the times when she hurt Halle was after the bell but Halle  her up twice in that fight she hit her with that question mark kick cracked her and rocked her and then she hit her with a straight left hand and dropped her - I felt like Halle deserved the knot in that fight and I definitely think she deserved the not if you take points away which I definitely think she should have taken it she hadn't points taken away from her I just think I just didn't didn't sit with me well and then after the fight she said she needed some when I asked her about cyborg she's like yeah I'm getting surgery she's like I got something wrong with my thumb or something so I was like okay she's gonna get some surgery and then then it became a PE D issue she said that cyborg is a lifetime PE D cheater that she's a performance-enhancing drug user and that everybody knows it and she's not gonna fight her so she basically just gave up her title and went back down a 35 I think so she is fighting again I don't know if she went and got surgery on whatever was going on with her hand but she is gonna fight again but she hasn't since I don't believe mm-hmm no I don't think so you'd be see if he could find that Germaine Duran to me see what she's fighting next tweeted since November about a fight then damn November yeah it didn't happen see that's person not investing in social media not interested in this what's crazy cuz this is how tough cyborg is Germaine de random he fought a dude and ko'd him I mean there's a more time yeah I remember when I first started fighting and like getting poignant at looking at like that like here's why you want to learn wait I and I was watching her I was like that grows into some wars and she's like older too and I mean I can't say older I'm like one of the older ones now with she but she she up a dude she ko to do be straight right hand yeah I mean it's I mean and then if she fought a guy like knew it was a guy signed up to fight a guy fought on beat him and they're like cyborg yeah I'm not doing that scared she's a cyborg and I get it I get it cyborg walking around 182 pounds I get it yeah I mean it's it's a really open division 145 right now and Megan Anderson is about to fight is that at 45 35 I believe that's at 45 making ever since big girl he's big big girl yeah so legit 45 er she's she's strong she's in her prime she's really tough she's good at everything you know she's a legit girl and fighting Holly in her first fight in the UFC also it shows how much they think are but I mean how many fighters do they have at 45 he's like  3 I mean who the is there you got Holly who fought cyborg and lost and then you know what else you got you got Megan Anderson who was over in Invicta and most people other than the hardcore fans don't know about her you know and she was trying to get her name out there so what we got here is that the whole division before that's the whole division Jesus Christ oh Janos on there - well Yana fought cyborg she got nuked I yeah that was uh she did her best right she when did she fight cyborg same night I thought uh you see - two - mmm the air she looked good until cyborg got ahold of her it's just like one of those things where when cyborg starts landing on girls you see the look in their face what am i doing in here I mean I was most impressed with cyborg on her kickboxing loss when she when she fought during a barge did you ever see that fight his father in Muay Thai Jurina bar is a beast I mean her from your office a room in the face yeah bars knocked her down with a front kick to the face and she dropped her and and time still cyborg was still chasing after her for every round I was like that girls I mean she's she's big and she's strong and she's but mentally she's tough too like she's I mean to just to fight that girl like during a bars had she had I think almost three years without a fight where she couldn't get a fight because nobody wanted to find her because she's just a bad ass Muay Thai fighter real long and tall and just classic Dutch style muy Thai you know and um cyborg stepped up fodder and lion fight I mean when she was like the most feared MMA fighter in the world and said it I'll take a Muay Thai fight and with like zero muy Thai professional fights you fought like one of the best girls ever it's really pretty admirable yeah how bad a she is in that regard that's cool but you know when you have a division that's that small it's like what what do they do you know I mean what are you gonna grow the girls make them get bigger girls this isn't the pride days where they can just fill them all put you know whatever the Gabby Garcia is on you know and toss them out there they have to be legit you know I don't know yeah I mean it's it's a it's a weird situation because I I mean I don't I don't follow enough to know what is out there Invicta or do you pay attention to any other organizations outside the USA no no I mean honestly I don't watch the UFC that much either because I like I don't have cable like don't know I have Netflix and a DVD player like school yeah we go crazy on 80s and 90s movies Wow yeah well look with Netflix you kind of don't I mean you could watch good all day long you don't really I mean so many people have severed their cable now they just don't want to do it anymore  a commercial I mean and how much is cable it's like 100 bucks a month or something like that that's Netflix ten yeah I thought like that like get the out of here and it's not like you've run out of to watch like you could watch Netflix all day for the rest of your life and never run out of to watch you know it's a weird time for those cable companies it's like the only thing that really keeps people buying cable I think or DirecTV one of the big things is live sports yeah like live sports is like one of those things we kind of have to have Direct TV or cable or something that's generational too I mean there's a lot of people that just always had it yep you know yeah yeah yeah my generation these young kids I don't give a about it yeah young kids don't watch CBS like see what the is that and if you the weird thing is if you watch regular TV now it seems like you're watching a time machine like you're watching some some from like a bygone era like laugh tracks and then cut to commercials like what is this hangers - mm-hmm so what do you do when you're not training other than watch DVDs not really much like I'm trying to get out in San Diego and like like live you know and play by the I'll get to the beach when I can try to soak up the Sun and whatever really like I have a struggle because I realized I came here to to work like I came here I changed in my life to come out here and be all-in and be as successful at this as possible so my day is about training about doing the like rehabilitation type things that I need to do and then making sure my kids knees are met and you know wash rinse repeat with that like I recently went to like I've been to a couple escape rooms that's fun yeah they're super fun unless you're not getting out sit there let's take your picture at the end I'm all pissed I'm still here I didn't get out we didn't get out either we got out of one room but it led us into the second room and we're like yeah it's hard I feel like there's there's hard it was hard for me being an athlete so I'm like there's harder we can do like I can work harder at this there's no working harder at it right it's a smarter yeah and it's also like a weird put piece together you know yeah and then let's see there's like there's like a horse rescue that I go down and I like put time in down there and just kind of like be with the animals and feed them and like you can try to rehabilitate them some of them are scary man like but it's cool because they're actually like something really to be scared of like half the we're afraid of is just in our head anyway but there's this like gigantic animal that doesn't know if it wants to kick you or love you and it's like you know trying to befriend it so you can help it and teach it stuff like that that's taking someone my time it's been cool that is weird with horses right like you could break them you can blast through them and I'll let you ride them like yeah like wild horses people go out and catch wild horses and ride them around like what other animal can you do that - yeah that's so strange you know like that is really strange that you could like get a horse you got them in the barn the horses like  you you like no you gonna rope around them and they're like alright alright you got me ride me round now it's very strange I mean what a weird relationship people have with horses yeah very strange man my friend Whitney Cummings has a horse she's all in she's all in with this horse she rides a dare back she's like you have to have a connection with the animal it has to feel you like not a saddle I've seen Clint Eastwood movies it seems that he's riding the horse pretty good with a saddle she doesn't do that and she rescued this horse and she's like on her Instagram she's always like riding around this horse and hanging out with it you know and she's like spending all this time with it it's like it is I they call it equine therapy and like like I was trying to get just because my brain was working in all these ways like I got really excited about that treatment center that the mindset place and then again there's all those other people in there that are in there and the veterans as if I was like man if I could get some of them down there working with these horses one it gives them something to do cuz the ones that are disabled like their hate in life and in that place like it's awesome because after a few months of being there they all want to know how to help they're like like tell me what I can do around here you know and even that with that I'm like man if I could even get them down there like so sometimes if all you do at this place is shovel you know it's it's still like you're around these horses and this place in particular they're all rescues and they it's called Ferdinand's Familia and they've all been mistreated at some point or they were trained to be something that they never graduated to being and so they were trash and now they need to turn these horses into like rideable like horses or whatever like that's the goal and then they have this it's near Imperial Beach it's like on that land like right on Tijuana so you get the goal is to take them on this like trail that goes all the way to the beach and you can ride up and on the beach like freely zero can you ride the beach to Tijuana zero walls oh yeah you can write that both it is like a see-through wall and you see them in his room yeah I mean it's just like it's like panels and you can see right through it like I went down there I can swim around it I was thinking that the other day I'm like this you guys are almost too tempting like I almost want to go over this is it right here yeah it's there that's exactly where we right strange to me that is so goddamn strange so which side is Tijuana this is Tijuana the other side is the United States and yeah that's exactly what looks like they have their little umbrellas they're having their little barbecues like chilling playing music having fun meanwhile we're all over they're like huh like I almost want to try to swim over just to see yeah if anyone's gonna stop you cuz like there is a little bit of like if you keep going up that fence they have like one car with one dude who's watching who's watching the Border Patrol and it seems so easy to get here from Mexico hey Tom oh and how deep can that fence go yeah how deep can it go put up your put up your umbrella in like a special angle and your just climb yes that doesn't seem like it's impossible okay I mean I'm not the best climber in the world but I guarantee you I could make it over that fence a hundred percent look you just grab ahold of some gloves on so you don't  your hands on you're gonna have to do some soft sane stuffs and chaining cuz that sprint afterwards is gonna bring your legs out yeah but unless they're on dune buggies they're not gonna catch you those fat  I just I feel like swimming is the move when I climb it you just swim a couple hundred yards okay it's like 200 yards maybe go left and then come back it's so weird like build our wall build that wall people are so crazy the whole thing is so strange I think one day we're gonna look back on countries like the human race one I think one of the things that's happening to the human race for sure is that we're getting closer to each other we're getting we can like I read like tweets that someone a post in Spanish or in Chinese or whatever and you just press translate and then you get to read it you know translate to English I'm like wow there it is I could read this guy's words and they have this thing called the Google pixel it's a you know it's a phone and they have these pixel buds these ear buds and these ear buds will translate in real-time like you could say some  to me in Spanish and it'll translate it in real-time to English yeah and how long is it going to be before that's way better yeah and we're gonna realize that countries are stupid see but I think I mean I agree on that on the social media side like I feel like social media has made that connection for us on that like that I guess mental social side or whatever but us as humans individually like here and now right next to each other like I feel a huge disconnect like look at I mean a century ago more than less than like you knew who the town butcher was really knew who the blacksmith was you knew who the mayor was like you knew like and everybody had their position your kids were safe to run around like everything like everyone knew and there was a value to every single person for for what it is that their their craft was or who they are and now no one knows anyone and like people don't want to like like I almost feel weird sometimes that like you know my kids my kid doesn't see all of the same pictures that I see cuz I have facebook and he doesn't or you know but I'm not ready like to have my kid exposed to that labyrinth right there you know and it's a terrible thing for kids to be exposed to yeah and and I think that you know so like shoulder shoulder person a person I feel like a bit of a disconnect you know but social media like we get to share information sometimes not good information sometimes good information like the fact that people are communicating I think is important it's it's making people take stands on things that they're all finding out oh you believe that too or I think that too like cool like I can find my people you know but on the actual like oxytocin like social side people actually getting to know each other like those like intimate relationships like I feel like that part is is suffering a little bit from it yeah I think that's suffering a little bit in real life because people are in cars they're in traffic they're isolated then they go to work and they're in a cubicle all day and they get home they're in their apartment of their house yeah there's not a lot of like interaction with people and I just think this is just a side effect of modern life yeah you know it's weird that there's so many like in LA there's so many people next to each other and almost nobody knows their neighbor mm-hmm it's very strange Hey what I'm talking about is I think countries are stupid like states I think countries like states like I think we should build a wall over Florida before we should build a wall over Mexico I mean it's Florida's a state right but Florida is just as alien as like say Finland or something like that I mean it's just just a fact you can move out of Florida and like Florida man I'm gonna I'm gonna move to Atlanta and he'd go up there and like nobody stops you you just go but if you're in Tijuana like you're like nah dawg that's a bitch like this no there's no crossing that to me that seems like super strange and almost like guaranteeing that those spots are forever the only way those anything's ever gonna level out is if you let anybody travel wherever they want and nobody's going to do that because it might up the good spots like La Jolla would be like no no no you can't just like we're not equal yeah just come over I mean you think about it La Jolla has some of the wealthiest real estate in the world right and unbelievable beautiful views and you could walk to Mexico from La Jolla you could walk I mean what's the distance between Tijuana and La Jolla let's guess let me guess I'm gonna say it's 50 miles is it 50 I'm gonna say only 50 no it's not that many cuz it's already it's depending on oh yeah I would say it's a 30-minute Drive like mmmm like moderate yeah normal speed limit yeah no traffic yeah so maybe it's 30 miles so it's like a marathon like a marathon run which people do they run it all they've run marathons long time 20 32 miles 30 so you're in Tijuana you were in a third world country in one of the worst neighborhoods of a third-world country and 32 miles away you have like these unbelievable mansions on these bluffs overlooking the ocean look leave that  that's crazy you're in Coronado it's very weird yeah exactly it's very weird yeah and I yeah that Coronado the island that's all super wealthy people right yeah that's where Dick Cheney lives apparently yeah they they have the ability of shutting that whole island down if there's like vandalism or like because it's it's got its entry and it's out like what does it call the way so it's not exactly an island like it does attached to the land what does that call the peninsula yeah yeah so but they have an ability at both the peninsula edge and the bridge to shut it down as a community if shit's going down on the island and they don't want someone to get off yeah that's how rich they are yeah it's only one of the wealthiest places in the world and another one there's a one-off sod off of Miami there's like some little tiny island that's filled only with rich people star Island I think that was called yeah it's like one of the most wealthy places on the planet it's one little spot off of Miami just filled with rich folks waiting for hurricane to up their work is that it star Island is a tiny neighborhood of massive houses and drama oh there's drama I don't see the big X on it like this place okay not a drama damn badass houses though but they have a good brunch - yeah that's their little - so they have a little bridge and it's a little tiny island all right good luck people weird the place is filled with pirates the place is filled with weird it's just Florida so stir I love it I'm joking around that I hate it but I love Miami I just it's so strange it's such a every time I go down there I'm like you should have to have a passport to come here this is not America what anybody says it's great but it's it's chaos but then there's some Florida spots like we like Oh kinda Pensacola it might as well be other than Roy Jones jr. I mean he came out of there you put Pensacola on the map do you do any boxing training I do so I liance has been like real helpful on my hands like I would have say there's a ton of improvement as far as that goes like and I never really focused on boxing before like I worked Muay Thai and kickboxing and between Dutch and Thai style you know and then to go there and have my hand sharpened was was pretty cool I just never it was hard for me to like to relate boxing to any sport I'd ever done and like as a as a athlete growing up as a kid like if I don't if I can't understand something what I'm learning I try to relate it back to some like muscle memory of some motion I've done before in some other sport like volleyball or swimming or like what's the mechanics of how I've moved in something that I can even dance like turn into getting like some kind of value out of so I can learn this thing and like boxing was not like anything that I'd ever done before I think I've never had a predominantly hands-on sport that I was good at so it's been the the most what's the word I don't know there's the the most work and the less the least natural of all of the disciplines that's interesting because this way but you've trained Muay Thai so much and muy Thai has hands in it right but the thing I'm excited about the most and muy Thai is the clinching the cakes mmm you know so to set up those are you wrestling right yeah right and just having the hips and everything with that that came with wrestling that came with you know the footwork of soccer of Dance of all that that's like that that contributed I think easily and translated easily over to that but boxing was not so much you know but part of me also thinks like you know some of that had to come with with learning like you you got to get hit to realize you don't want to get hit this way to learn how to move your head yeah yeah and slip and roll with yeah it hurts my feelings to get punched in the face I'm sure and I'm happy I'm the kind of person that it pisses off you know like like so it makes me it makes me fight harder you know but like it's stunning it's stunning especially when you get one of those good ones in the nose and now your eyes are watering but you're not crying like that that weird stinging sensation yeah yeah learning all that that all was definitely within the last few years and it's been it's been fun it's been not fun but fun when you see like the evolution a lot of fighters are getting into yoga a lot of fighters are doing yoga a lot of fighters are finding that they have like real benefits and protecting their back and strengthening a lot of their joints and their ligaments and stuff like that yeah you feel like it's supplemental towards like the physiology of it or it's something as far as adding to the combative side I think both I think for sure it's good for your mental endurance because it's it's hard I mean it seems like something that should be very easy you hear about Yogi like housewives do that but if you do it a hundred percent and especially hot yoga you're stuck in that box at 104 degrees for 90 minutes sweating your ass off and I'm pissed at about 60 minutes and that one yeah so there's actually some mental toughness that goes you endure you endure a 90 minute hot yoga class but I think for your joints for for your range of motion and flexibility there's almost nothing better because you're so hot and sweaty everything's loosened up and you can get into like deep deep stretches and deep poses and also like for your foot strength and posture and balance all that stuff is amazing amazing for your back strengthening your back your knees it's really good for jiu-jitsu fighters I mean jiu-jitsu people love it so one of the best things for jiu-jitsu because jiu-jitsu so static you know so much of it it's like holding on and like trying to advance position and slowly and then there's these bursts of you know explosive movements but so much of it is just clenching and isometric yeah yeah so much of it is that and I think you really benefit from being able to you know in these yoga poses holding these poses for 30 seconds when your your body's burning and you're you know you're you're having a difficult time just standing up mm-hmm I think adding the heat component to it too especially if you're a weight cutting fighter like getting to know your body and teaching it how to sweat right like this last training camp was pretty awesome with that because I got a sauna for my one I got a sauna a while ago I was using a red light for healing and I was using the sauna because I know that you can naturally boost your growth hormone if you're in that every night and help yourself before you go to sleep so I was in that every night I try to go in for like 45 minutes and that was so helpful in going into the fight week weight cut because it was like I know what it feels like when it's time to get the out and I know what it feels like when it's time that I'm it's like that sound like when I'm dripping like crazy I still got another good 20 minutes of me sitting here like this you know in and I think it's really hard on fighters when they're not in a sauna or that hot for their entire camp and then they just expect that out of their body the day before a fight yeah I think you're right you know if there's some there's are only really good benefits as you said to for recovery or reducing inflammation you know yeah I thought hopeful I got a portable sauna to bring to my fights with me oh that's nice is it one climbing - uh-huh and like just your little head - yeah it's uncomfortable as hell because you can't lean against anything or it'll burn your ass in the chair yeah and the chair is like this little half chair and by that point you're like organs are so depleted and and you're like leaning all weird anyway so it's just hell but I mean it gets it off and you don't have to leave your hotel room oh that's nice - especially if you're doing something on the road like who was it that somebody that somebody was fighting somewhere and they didn't have hot water and they couldn't make weight because they didn't have the the bathtub I think it was I'm trying to think of who it was that misadventure that's full yeah they were I think they were fighting in Brazil and there was no hot water for some reason like the hot water was down and you know like what in the and they couldn't they want and why not not making wait I don't remember it was I wasn't there for that event but I remember thinking like that is one of the real problems with doing these some of these gigs in the road you know he'd travel into these places and there's no hot water if there's no sauna and no hot water how he's supposed to make way oh and it's awkward to be in a sauna with your opponent - and why I fought Kareena damn again is 2125 like a few years ago there is Eric Anders she too was very respectful yeah yeah Otto's Brazilian he knows but we were in North Dakota and we had to go into the same Sun and it became a competition in there and when she when she like there was a point like I'm sitting there my coach and I'm just like biting down you I don't even know how long we were in but it is like hard it is rough and it's kind of exactly like who's gonna break first who's gonna go first and she ended up being like Puckett she goes and she gets out and I was like oh you have quit in you and I was like I saw everything I needed to see we're good that's so true look there's something to that I mean you definitely don't want to die in there but there's there's moments when you're in the sauna you know I have one here and there's this thing that happens at like 30 minutes really like what in the am i doing well you start weirding out you're not gonna get out of here I gotta get out of here it's like it's like claustrophobia you know that if you just open that door it's cold air and you're gonna feel great there's a lot someone go in just want someone to ask you a question just let me run out that door that's right there but that is what creates those heat shock proteins is that your body realizes that it's in this terrible situation where you're way over heated so your body starts creating these anti-inflammatory proteins and that's what's so good for your body they did a study I think it was in was it in Norway dr. Rhonda Patrick brought it up on the podcast that they showed a 40 percent decrease in mortality from all causes from use of daily sauna 40% decrease in heart attack stroke cancer everything across the board it's unbelievably good for you you use the car yeah it's because your body in reaction the the response that your body has in reaction to the extreme temperature is just to create all these anti-inflammatory properties and that's just so good for your body inflammation is just the root of so many different diseases and problems that we have yeah so do you what is like the temperature and duration recommended for that I think it's a hundred and seventy degrees and I think 20 minutes is what they want they want 20 minutes at 107 degrees 170 degrees for four I believe that the test protocol was four days a week is that the same statistic for say like a red light sauna it's a good question they didn't use a red light sauna they didn't use an infrared traditional they just used a traditional sauna but the theory is that it doesn't matter because the what matters is your body reacting to the temperature change and it doesn't matter how it's getting to you they used a regular like hot rocks on that's what I have regular hot rocks on but I don't think it matters I think what really matters is just the extreme temperature and there's a lot of people believe in those infrared saunas you think they're better I don't know no I just know your body your body like sauna whenever I do it I just feel better mm-hmm sleep good it's just better it just feels better for my brain to I just feel better about everything I just think it's just like getting your body heated up like that and then it cooled off it just chills everything out mm-hmm just like a quiet there's like a quiet afterwards yeah but yeah yeah just everything feels like it works better you know and when I do it on a regular basis you know but I feel the same way about cryotherapy when I do cryotherapy on a regular basis to everything seems to work better yeah see I I only did cryotherapy a couple times and it hurt my boobs like so much that I I'm I just I don't want to go ice baths and I mean the thing is I'll get into ice baths and I'm really like I'll get in but I'm complaining the whole way you know like not not saying one nice thing to you or your mama like I'm getting in there and I'll do it when I'm ready and oh yeah and it's awful awful when those cryotherapy things like I appreciate the speed I appreciate like the they have but like do you really feel that they get through all of those layers of skin like down to an optimal level on your tissue well it's the same thing it's cold shock proteins what happens is I mean if they really got through your skin you'd be dead okay it really got through though but the idea is that your body produces these cold shock proteins in response to anything that's over or under 150 degrees below zero that's the sweet spot apparently when you hit that 150 degree below zero your body produces all these massive in anti-inflammatory properties because again it thinks it's gonna die so it's like freaking out and people with arthritis and people with severe autoimmune issues where the have a lot of inflammation real real problems with their joints in their hands they have huge results from cryotherapy there's a bunch of people that go to my place that they say that's really essentially changed their life they were just in pain all the time and now they know all they have to do is go there step in that thing for three minutes leave and they're gonna feel better and they just feel looser and relaxed and whatever their flare-ups and instead of their condition deteriorating their condition improved and stabilized things so it's about your body and the chemical value not yeah that's cold itself exactly it's about your body freaking out yeah what is this bitch doing oh my god and then when you get out of there you feel so good that's what does it for me when I get out oh my god I feel amazing it's like this rush of it's just the mmm what's it called norepinephrine yeah you have this rush of it in your brain it's like you just took an awesome drug you just feel fantastic I get out the Sun feels great people look better everything just feels better you know I do two sessions two I do three minutes and then I go out for ten minutes and then I go back in for another three minutes that's how I do we I try to do depending on how many times I do the sauna I want to do one or the other four times a week so either I'm doing the sauna or I'm doing cryo so you do I don't do both in the same you do some temperature manipulation yes for 10 4 days a week and if I don't do that I do hot yoga which is another form of temperature manipulation obviously because you're 104 degrees and you know you're there for 90 minutes sweating it out and that you mean it's not as hot in the room but your body absolutely has that same feeling that it has inside the sauna where you just like claustrophobic or the out of here yeah I'm gonna try it I will try that's how you know I'm there for the one sauna I'm good I sit in there and I just turn up the jams well if you can't good with the song just stick with the sauna I mean I think it's they're both really good yes well if I get in the cold shower after the sauna does that count thing I like doing that - yeah I like doing that after yoga especially in the winter when the water gets real cold I like to get in that cold shower and just really like feel the two of them you know the UFC has that set up to where they have the jacuzzi right next to the cold baths that they got that cold plunge it's like set to below 50 degrees you hop in there freeze your ass off and then hop in the sauna apparently there's like really good benefits to doing that back and forth like that yeah it was the last fight out there is sitting in that hot tub and then because I didn't have the sauna hooked up I just want to go in the hot tub and and then I laid on like the partition and I had like one leg dangling in the cold pool and one leg dangling and the water was really good-looking and I'm sure starving and dying and give no anymore it's just like I'm laying there like that McKenzie turn was laying over there looking a little worse than me was like what did you think would she miss weight by seven pounds Dutch it's kind of crazy isn't it it's crazy because she like I was literally sitting in the locker room with her like we are giggling at UFC 222 like because we're both like curvy right and we're sitting in the locker room laughing about how much that ways you know and it's like what can you do about that and even if you could you really want to like no I don't hate it you know but sitting in there and like laughing about it and and that was what what was the date of that March 3rd and then to come that much over like she got her fight right away announced right away you know that she was fighting me it was in 19th or something and it was just like that like when you have that data in mind I mean and granted it's it's not me it's her it's I don't have her body I don't have her problems I don't have her life I dot it's you know not my Nam it doesn't mean anything to me but to know you have a fight and it's signed up and it's ready like at that point it's maintenance yeah you know it's maintenance like that that's not even doing anything different is just maintenance but like these weight cuts are harder and harder on us as we get older I don't know what her body's doing I don't know I think she's 25 yeah young and I don't know I don't know what that to make 115 pounds asks of her and I don't know if she's on her period or not I don't know if that makes a difference to her with me I always I always get mine the day of weigh-ins I have I have like three other girls four other girls that I know that it's the exact same thing like the morning of made weight about to go downstairs and there's that looking at you right like there's there's why I couldn't lose the last two pounds see I would like to talk to John Crouch about what happened because he asked her to leave the lab oh that was where she was that was yes yeah did she ever say why she didn't say why he didn't say why either huh they're both playing it professional huh I know what happened but she was there a long time too though wasn't she were like cuz when I went to go train down there Shu she was already she was there one of the days you know I don't know I'm not sure I'm not sure but I know her dad he's doesn't he teach in Arizona Megaton I think so yeah I'm hurt you Jitsu is  nasty though isn't it so gnarly whoo she's good we come against each other yeah yeah I was beating her ass well yeah well it is rough is rough because I I it was worlds we were both purple belts I think it was the open division so I was like I was heavier than her by the next weight class and I I went to take her down I double egged are all big and then like where we landed so if this is like the square we landed like right here mm-hmm and so they called it out so they reset us in the middle so no points so because she's McKenzie dirt because I'm not million enough so I they start us again I'm like okay noted I can't don't go near that line so I go and I shoot another double pickup go take her down again same thing but like I it's out of bounds again because it's too close because my doubles like a tackle you know right and then so we go back in the middle and we shake hands and we go this time I go shoot I pick her up now look at the rest like like you're good put her down here yeah so put her down go to pass her guard and I passed and then I think she I sat back for a straight ankle lock and they're like and they disqualified me what and they're like you can't even act like you can't do that I can't do what and they're like you can't do that and it's in the rule books I'm like okay if I'm gonna look in the rule books what am I looking up what can't I do like you can't you can't do that I need to go you're disqualified I'm like tell me what I did and they said that I reaped the knee but I like I didn't like I don't I really don't think I did you know so you think they were just Juke in the system to try to get her to win because she's Brazilian I don't know I don't know tournaments yeah and I mean they they sent and the thing is like I love IBJJF tournaments and I want to compete in them for the rest of my life like I you know so but but yeah there is there's some themes that go on there like there's definitely birth rights that get you place it is that like right that I would really like to have but really no I don't want to have been born into I want to make the statement of like happier birth right like I got this you know I made it to some pretty badass tournaments and you know just like fighting the way I fight and trying not to give a about all of that and like I continued to do that I want to do the same you know but no that was that was a rough one for me like I was excited about that tournament I trained hard for that tournament and I think we were each other's like I don't remember what match into the tournament it was but to be disqualified and it was like but I still what do they call specifically reaping the need don't you have to go against the joint I don't no I don't know like I wish I could draw you a picture show you a finger babe come up with an excuse well be I mean the first to take downs like we weren't okay maybe well first maybe the first one we were on the line out fine the second one like we hit the ground and then we skidded a little so but we were in you know and then the third round I'm being a dick you know and I'm just like yeah here good you know and so they're like making me the points and then I pass and they give me the points and then I sit back for that and now I'm disqualified and I like her you know what I mean like I like her her dad was at my gym teaching a seminar at my gym in Colorado like months earlier and so when the match is over and we go and we're like standing next to them they like you know like did you see that somebody made an Instagram of her after one day in Liverpool no what do you know people make fun of her accent that it's not real oh yes someone just told me that recently yeah she apparently I don't know I mean people accents are weird to begin with like why do people talk the way they talk in the first place as they sound like the people around them yeah I mean it's it's weird but there's a video that somebody made of McKenzie Dern after one day in Liverpool and it's basically her talking but Darren tills voice instead I'm not playing it don't play Jamie don't even pull it up I will not do that to her oh that's pretty funny yeah cuz I was confused when I interviewed her when she won in the UFC they wanted a translator and I was like what are you talking about like she speaks perfect English like this is really bizarre so George grisel came in with me and he's like just in case she gets messed up anymore it's and like I didn't even question I was like okay I was confused I'm gonna put wait a minute I know she speaks perfect English like this is ridiculous he's raised in Arizona right yeah but she speaks perfect English so I don't know if they were selling it you know I don't know whose idea was don't know I don't know I don't get it but the internet got it crazy like what and the is happening I didn't question it I'm like look I'm just here to interviewer I just want her I mean she wants to speaking Portuguese she wants speaking English I don't give a but I was like why do you need a translator like that's that's insane damn I don't know all that either you know she definitely speaks getting English really well though does it is there a benefit to Brazilian well yeah I mean obviously that's a huge demographic issue support huge like primarily yeah the biggest but I'm curious if there's like a benefit or marketing like geysers there's there something to that that wouldn't make that more well Brazilians have immense national project yeah you know and her being Brazilian and the daughter of a Brazilian Jujitsu Legend and you know speaking perfect Portuguese and English and I'm just I guess maybe that's the idea behind it I don't know she's killing it though like technically and with her style and I mean like everything that she brings to the table is is already good you know it's like don't that up don't fact up with it some yeah yeah I don't know you know sometimes when I get people like I feel bad because like I try to be like really empathetic and when I'm around like foreigners and like I will totally slow down my speaking so they will get it to the point where sometimes I think I look condescending right you know where I'm like I just want this conversation who as easy as possible for you because yeah I'm already awkward like let me help you out you know that's a different thing that it's like you remember when Madonna had a fake English accent and everybody's like bitch you're from Brooklyn or wherever the  you're from not from England you can't do that stop well yeah I mean depending who she's around I guess I don't know fact that's the thing like if you're around people that have that accent you'll you will pick it up yeah like when I was a kid I definitely had a Boston accent but I heard myself talk on TV once when I was like 19 it was a Boston accent no I gotta get rid of that like how did I pick that up so quick yeah and my family is all Minnesota rural you know and so when I go home I get that and it'll stick around for a few weeks especially if you drink right yeah I'm tired yeah you have you around all those people it's like comforting access are  strange you know they're they really are strange that they're like specific to regions it just shows you how pliable people are yeah southern accents well I'm even like England like you have like like very very different like British accents sure which I'm sure to them sounds exactly like you know Texas versus versus New York you know yes the different Twain yeah my friend's wife is from Liverpool and she was trying to explain Scouse to me like the way they talk at Liverpool versus the way they would talk and like say London mm-hmm I'm like y'all sound like English to me you might as well be Australia no get it I get that you sound different than me I don't get what's happening though I don't get the accident until like somebody like like like Darren tails clearly has like that Liverpool accent it's so clear but I don't I still don't get it I don't know what it is you know I could say he's from London I'm like okay cool English that like whoever was a rain there had like a lisp yes and so then and then that ended up being what the people picked up as like was it a compliment or just how it happened because that's how things were like pronounced when they were being explained like I don't know maybe there's some kind of like speech impediment that went along with every doing that I like and really that is what it is with with Spain that the way they pronounce certain words is because like some king somewhere along the line had a lisp strange strange did you know that I was the place in Brazil that has a lisp also I forget really yeah I'm sure there must be like different axes yes oh right Brazil's huge oh yeah I mean definitely different sing songy type of tones tones I would say more yeah did you ever train down there yeah I've been down there I think three times four times to train train and a visit I did a I wanted they called you juicy turning me down there before oh yeah yeah I think it was like Brazilian Nationals something like that so we would go down like get fully ready to train get there the day before and cut because once you're there and then compete the second day I was there so the rest of its vacation because it's like once you're there all the food all of the like beach and like lazy like there's nothing in me that wants to work hard all I want to do is just enjoy the music and the sounds and the people in there I know how to cook down there just chew Hoss Korea's holy is that good you guys have them in San Diego they have them everywhere now thank God yeah but that style of cooking is the best those skewers over over fire that's what I'm talking about meat over fire yeah and then the little sauces like the creations just oil and lime and and seasoning is so good I better not talking to more you won't make weight oh my god I'm just a little bit more dead than others we just did two
