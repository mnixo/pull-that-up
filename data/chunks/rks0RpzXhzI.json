No abandon three two and we're live what's up buddy hey how are you I'm very sorry about that a sound of the thing in the background ladies and gentlemen here that wasn't does annoying well shut that off can we shut that off sure go ahead okay can you shut her off Jim um dad is because there was they were smoke in this room and the Godfather has a an issue with the smoke how did you get over your asthma around puberty it often subsides especially if you're quite athletic which I was and then it completely went away by about 13 and only came back by about 25 but now I'm not full-blown asthmatic only when I get sick if I let's say get cold it will migrate to my chest turn into bronchitis and what will take you four days to fight might take me a month of whooping cough well that's why I'm really careful about not getting a cold you know you must be a hand washer well that's why when I came out of the bathroom my instinct was to tell Jamie as I was shaking his hand I washed my hands because I'm always careful about taking other people's hand so I'd like to extend them the same courtesy yeah man I shake some people's hands and it's like they just dunked it in the pool it's some people like they get so sweaty and you shake their hand you go whoa okay but what's going on with this hand like what kind of weird bacteria I read this article that was saying that water bottles when you reuse a water bottle if they've tested them and they say that there's less bacteria on dog toys well that's why by the way I've resorted to fist bumping because I'm cool but it just reduces the amount of germ transfer from one person to the other by just going like this but don't you think that that compromises your immune system by not exposing it to a lot of different things there is actually research on this right now a medicine kids who grew up in very sterile environments end up suffering from greater respiratory ailments precisely because their system hasn't been kicked up yeah I believe that I rarely get sick and I shake a lot of hands but I know a lot of people that don't and they're kind of sick all the time like I don't get sick I'm like but maybe that's what's going on maybe we'll French kiss ADA after the exciting don't you threaten me with a good time it's um I think it's also really important I don't know how much you partake of this but to consume probiotics do you eat acidophilus or yogurt or can I do I do like yogurt I do like kimchi I don't do it by design I think maybe just those preferences are healthy and so I'm happy to hear that they are good probiotics and look for grapplers in particular grapplers are very particular about the consumption of probiotics because we get a lot of ringworm and also staph infections too there's a lot of different infections that people can get from especially ringworm though staph infections is really more for from an open cut but having healthy skin floor is very important it's why all you kids listening don't use antibiotics so it's not the right way to go there's a lot of healthy soaps that are used like tea tree oil and eucalyptus that are really good for you that are probiotic right keep the idea of warm in mind because later I'd like to talk about brain worms and how it relates to a condition that is afflicting the West we can get into it now or any worms I mean like Toxoplasma that would be one there's other ones there there are many others you want to get into that now sure okay so that's the Polsky on and on you know and I should write to him because of how amazing he is amazing I wrote to him a while ago maybe a year and a half or two years ago but at the time he was come on my show but he was bit I think very busy writing a few books which I'm guessing he's probably done what now yeah well he was busy then we got to meet him in LA in his hotel room it was a film that we only had an hour he literally landed got into his hotel room we went with him as he opened up the door to his hotel we sat down with them like it was just a little table and chair that is fantastic yeah yes so basically I I argue that in the same way that there are all sorts of animals that once they are infected with this brain worm and there are different instantiations of it they they Lou they become zombified right I mean right just to give you another example the spider wasp will sting the spider which which is much bigger than it rendering it zombified it then carries it into its burrow lays its eggs on the invivo spider and then when the eggs hatch they eat it in vivo and I argue that the the political correctness is akin to the spider wasps sting because it sambar fires us into walking quietly to the abyss of infinite darkness while horrible things are happening around us but why we think that we're doing the right thing while we think that yeah we're not we being not racist and good and progressive but but to go back to the brain worm idea so I coined the term not to be cute but to actually name this collective condition I call it ostrich parasitic syndrome you know I've talked about this before I know that that's a myth oh yeah that the boss yeah yeah it's become just a metaphor for sure yeah absolutely the myth being folks that ostriches don't really stick their head in exactly and and it's it's really taken on a life of its own at this point I'm actually thinking of studying this scientifically not just as something that I talk about on my public engagement what is it that causes some people to be more likely to be parasitized by the types of mindsets that would cause you to suffer from ostrich parasitic syndrome so a classic example would be which I guess will we'll get into how much evidence do you need to see around the world that there might be some religious ideology that is somewhat problematic and antithetical to secular liberal modern values how much information or what is the type of information that you would need to see before you're able to arrive at such a conclusion and so one of the things I'm thinking of doing is to formally quantify a score of o-p-s how much somebody suffers won't be as as a type of mindset and what are some predictors that can help us understand who is more or less likely to be affected afflicted by this mindset well there's certain people that just never want to hurt anyone's feelings right except when they think that it is within their rights to attack that person because that person is somehow another victimizing someone else and then they'll be far more egregious than the original offense did you know about that guy that in Canada that's getting sued well he the Human Rights Council fined him twelve thousand dollars because he walked apartment that he owned with shoes on yes says there was a Muslim family living there their lease was up and he was looking to rent the apartment they stopped responding to his texts and so he opened up the apartment to show this this apartment that he owns and because he walked into a building that he owns with his shoes on he has to pay them twelve thousand dollars for failing to accommodate their religious practices while showing their apartment to prospective tenants that's crazy welcome to Canada we just had a thing called the motion and 103 are you familiar with this look at this look at this statement I'm sorry to interrupt you but the human rights account tribunal of Ontario also found that he harassed them and created a poisoned housing environment right there you go because he refused to remove his shoes some sensibilities are more equal than others but that is just what why is it that people are so especially in particularly with Muslims like that you'll notice that there's a lot of people that are they will accuse everyone of Islamophobia yet they'll shit on Christians yeah it's really common like they don't it's not that they believe in religious freedom it's that they have like a pet cause and the pet cause is almost like being a contrarian to a lot of like far-right people who are really terrified of Muslims like they're trying to like figure out how to balance that out with their own ridiculous left-wing version of it well I think it there are two elements to it one is that they're just afraid to criticize these bums because there are greater repercussions to do so than to criticize seventh-day Adventist so just from a very basic sort of survival instinct but I think secondly which is kind of part of the ostrich parasitics Ramos speaking of there are all sort of erroneous ideas that people have been infected with you know the the the Muslim religion is a religion for the downtrodden the the brown people the exotic other and so to to criticize them when they are a hapless exotic minority is simply racist and sexist and people believe that even though most of the countries that these people are coming from when they come to the west not only are they the majority there almost the exclusive majority right so so they are out of I think 56 countries that constitute the OIC the Organization of Islamic Cooperation something like 29 or 30 countries they're exclusively Islamic they are no longer any religious minorities it's in the order of 99.9 something so to argue that people who come from these countries are you know religious minorities why me they're religious minorities when they come to the West but they're all coming from countries where not never mind that they're the majority they've never interacted with someone who did not share their faith I don't think people understand that if that happens here like you can't turn back from that without violence right like if I mean I'm not saying that it would happen in the United States but the fact that it can happen anywhere means it can happen everywhere I mean it really can I mean it's it's a it's a big reach on my part to say that because there's no evidence whatsoever that it's going to happen here but if you really look at some of the countries that are suffering under there's these really oppressive religious ideologies where women aren't allowed to drive where they have to we're covering all over their body that signifies they're a part of this religious sect like if that if someone tried to do that today like if you had some blond-haired blue-eyed guy that made all women wear a certain outfit and they weren't allowed to drive and they weren't allowed to have the same rights how many people would be standing up for them that's incredible especially if it was a new thing there's something about old things like old ideologies and legitimacy it's so strange yeah what is that well it's exactly you said you take an idea that someone holds if he doesn't cloak cloak it under the robe of religion you commit him to a psychiatric institution if he says no no but this belief was part of my religion suddenly you get a free pass it's grotesque but to speak to your point about well that you were stretching about it happening in the United States you're not stretching it at all as a matter of fact I've argued for example one that when Trump won that if you look at a long term view of the issue of Islamic immigration if what you focus on is do we have the proper vetting processes to stop terrorists Isis terrorists from coming in that's a very short-term view of the but if you recognize that societies will take often very very long time before they become Islamized it's not as though every single country that today is Islamic became instantaneously overnight Islamic in some cases it was a very very quick invasion in other cases it took five hundred years before the demographic realities shifted and so yes if you look at it from the perspective of ten twenty fifty a hundred years the u.s. stands no threat but take a long-term view I love this quote from that I think it was the Taliban who said it that the United States have all the clocks and watches we have all the time in the world in other words inshallah eventually God willing we will conquer you so this is the right way to look at this issue do you wish to have a society become more Islamized or less let me draw another analogy at the end of every day you can weigh yourself and one of three things is going to happen you've either lost weight that day your weight did not change a single ounce or you've put on weight so let's analogize this with Islam when Islam comes into a place either the society gets better nothing changes or it gets worse do we have enough data at this point after 1400 years to suggest that we can try to bet what will happen to a society the answer regrettably is yes again I hate to have to preface of course most Muslims are lovely and peaceful and wish to simply raise their children but Islam as an ideology when it comes into a new society is it a good thing if yes let's all turn Islamic if no then maybe we should have an honest conversation about this an honest conversation is what's really important because these things get so emotionally charged like the infamous ben affleck sam harris debacle on bill maher show but that to me is a perfect example because sam speaks in such a measured tone and he's so educated about it he's not making these big gigantic leaps but people love to jump on him and call racism he sent me some video but I just watched the other day we were a bunch of people or just taking complete out of contact statements attributing into him being like this is what he believes on things when if you listen to the full extent of the conversation he's literally saying like that I'm gonna say something here that could be taken out of context but what I'm saying is like imagine if someone was saying this right how do you respond to that and they use that as a statement I mean there's there's so much of that going on there's so much so dishonest well there's there's this weird not me thing that they're doing it's like they they're I'm not the racist he's the racist and they get very you're racist like the Ben Affleck thing like he was like that is so gross that it's so racist like instead of just discussing this conversation I'm discussing this especially on the Bill Maher show because that shows all those shows is not to criticize that show but all those shows we have a panel of six people what you see is a bunch of people waiting to say something and they have to jump in and it's almost like they have to be salacious or they have to be outrageous just to get heard you know everyone it's it's it those kind of shows promote this sort of disingenuous communication because you have to you can't be polite like you and I can be polite it's just you and I we can talk and we can have these long-form conversations but on that show do you don't have the time to unpack what's wrong with all ideologies all things that tell you how to think forget about whether or not you think you came from Jesus or the Prophet Muhammad or Joseph Smith any time that there's a doctrine that tells you how to think because of some mystical presence some God or deity or prophet who has gotten the wisdom of the universe and you must not question it and women have to wear veils and dress up like beekeepers and I mean all that stuff is very very problematic because people are prone for whatever reason I mean some I guess it's some something it goes back to tribalism and alpha male chimpanzee behavior we're prone to follow their own to follow leaders I mean it makes it easier and that's one of the things you're seeing here well what's amazing is that it's one thing to attack Sam because in the game of identity politics he scores really poorly right he's a Southern California and white male who doesn't speak any the languages that matter Arabic or so on and his parents had money that his parents had money so I've loved that Oh your parents had money you sinner exactly I only recently found out maybe a year or a year and a half ago when I met him last that his mother is the creator of Golden Girls did you know that no I didn't even know that yeah yeah and I actually I I just looked at one of the Golden Girls that was rerunning and you see I think it's Susan Harris or something but anyways uh someone like me who comes from the Middle East who escaped that reality someone like iron Hirsi Ali and I had many people on my show I don't know how much you followed but a lot of people who've all escaped from this world either theirs they still consider themselves Muslim but you know not you know Muslim light or X Muslims in many cases yeah they will be attacked so imagine you know so there is some woman who went to Wellesley College who doesn't know anything about Islam short of whatever she learned in her bullshit progressive course she will lecture to us what true Islam is not the people who lived under it not the people who ran away from it she knows better because so it's it's really it's grotesque it's infuriating it's stunning and it's also confusing cuz like when you see them do it like I mean anytime someone goes so far overboard that objective reasoning is out the window and you're you know you're so committed to whatever position that you're in that you can't look at both sides of it I mean I I could see why a lot of religious traditions would be comforting to people remind them of where they came from give them pride of their homeland give them a personal good feeling that they're connected to some sort of an ancient tradition right as long as it's not oppressing other human beings and there's got to be some I mean I actually cultural patterns of behavior that people do like celebrations like oktoberfest or something like that those things you know promote some sort of pride like I guess a pride in Germany and their beer making and all that stuff without oppressing people you know but by the way this is a good segue to what you're talking about is something that is upsetting me these days increasingly so so some people are now trying to draw a distinction between Islam and Islamism the reason why I mentioned this because Islam has two elements there's a spiritual part right which is you know kind of like your Oktoberfest that pray this way right leaving a guy in a monotheistic God and so on but then within Islam is a much larger component of politics political Islam so when you say something like well you know we should be attacking Islamism as if it's something that is outside of Islam that's simply false Islamism is Islam right or the one the Prime Minister of Turkey and I can quote many other Islamic experts said Islam is Islam the term moderate Islam Islam ISM and all these other qualifiers are nonsensical now the reason why that upsets me is because it grants people a false sense of security and hope you know Islam is wonderful but we need to attack this separate thing called Islamism well from day one 1400 years ago Islam was Islamism now that doesn't mean that there isn't a spiritual element that doesn't mean that most Muslims just want to practice the spiritual part but there is no set of doctrines in a separate book called radicalized Islamism it all comes from the same text it comes from the Quran it comes from the Hadees and it comes from the serie the biography of Muhammad so so this kind of false narrative that people are promulgating so that they seem as though they're not frontally attacking a religion while laudable while nice I get that reflux it's false and so again to go back to our point of talking honestly we need to talk honestly there is only Islam some people choose to practice it fully some people choose to ignore the ugly part but there is no such thing as Islamism Islamism is part of Islam now you're a person that goes out of your way to say no we're not talking about the kind sweet Islamic people that just want to raise their children now so how do you sort of manage those two ideas that they're the same like when the term radical Islam gets thrown around right so radical Islam simply means I really take my is seriously right it's like let's try a silly analogy if I don't eat pork a my radical Jew or am i a Jew right now I happen to be Jewish I simply ignore the kosher edict that says don't eat pork that's why do you do that though because in my case I simply identify as Jewish in the sense that Judaism is a multi attribute identity it includes a shared history shared lineage a kind of a race it's what some could argue it's a race so it's considered in a lot of people's ideas so I could still in the same way that you might identify as coming from Boston and there's a shared history from all people who grew up around the time that you grew up in Boston and there is a sense of affiliation and tribalism with that reality being Jewish as far as I'm concerned and for most Jews is exactly that we don't necessarily take the religious elements very seriously now that doesn't mean that we are practicing a light Judaism or non radical Judaism we're simply ignoring those parts of Judaism that we choose to ignore so there is no such thing as radical Islam there are no books called radical Islam there is a set of doctrines called Islam and then I could do what's called cafeteria Islam which is I pick and choose the parts that I wish to adhere to so again that this course is a false narrative I understand the reason for it because people find that rather gauche to attack frontally and religion at least attack Islam so they have to I call this the the the ISM magic heuristic right you add ISM to something it makes it bad Islam is good Islamism is bad you for you I would like to defend you if there's a lot of people that are listening right now or offer up some not not even defend you but offer up some information like you grew up in a place where being Jewish was lethal I mean you your life was threatened certainly when the Civil War broke out prior to that you could live in Lebanon as a Jew people knew that we were Jewish but know your place Jew that by the way is something that I explained when when discussing and I'm not sure if we discussed this on the show but it might be worth repeating discussed your past and Lebanon how you yeah okay so but so do you know what a Dimi is have you heard that term yeah yeah you explain it please do again just so so it did me is a third class citizen comes out of Quranic edicts that basically said that when it when Islam comes into a society you basically have three choices if you're not a Muslim you could either convert you could either get killed or if you are people of the book meaning Christians and Jews meaning people of the book that you're also monotheistic you're also from an Abrahamic faith then you could live as Adam me and then me is a protected class protected in quotes we tolerate you and in order to tolerate you we're going to remind you repeatedly of your subservient position now at different points across the last fourteen hundred years that mechanism was either instituted very forcefully or more lightly so in the context of Lebanon which is which was a very progressive and modern country in the Middle Eastern context there wasn't somebody knocking on our door and levying the jizya pay us or else we're going to rape your daughters but you didn't wear a big Star of David because that might be construed as inflammatory just like the the example that you started off the show you're hurting our sensibilities by pushing your Judaism on us right so your your status did not always have been threatened in that my head is going to come off at any minute right my parents grew up and lived there they didn't die but once the civil war broke out then it became lethally dangerous to be Jewish I mean we were going to be executed we left so you never know when we're going to go from tolerating you two off with the heads and that's been the history for the past fourteen hundred years and so again when people think but Islam is not that bad look in andalucía jews and christians and muslims used to walk around hand in hand in spain around the fifteen sixteenth century below me yes people were not being beheaded every day but you knew your place that's not equality and it's kind of interesting when you talk about this idea about how people are reluctant to criticize Islam because they're worried about the repercussions of this it kind of speaks to how rare it is that people do violate those principles in those countries because if you do have a culture that's 99 percent Islamic especially if they go by the book like every step of the way like there's not going to be a lot of people that are stepping on the line for fear of the horrific repercussions now psychologically in this country you're seeing that for some strange reason emerging from the left and emerging from a lot of like really progressive colleges and universities where they want to be almost the first ones to step up and say don't criticize this one particular religion which is it's very odd because it's the most regressive it's unbelievable it's it's very it's a really strange position to be a progressive who's reinforcing the ideologies of a regressive culture that's very ancient but what's incredible is that they'll come up with ways to defend this cognitive inconsistency and hence that's part of the ostrich parasitic syndrome that I was mentioning what are some ways they defend so example let me just give you a few manifestations of ostrich logic my friend Muhammad is a very nice guy and he drinks and he fornicate and he's very liberal so the idea then becomes that as long as I can identify a single exemplar of a Islamic person who does not otherwise adhere to what Islam dictates then it's not true that Islam is bad now this is this is a manifestation of a more general cognitive bias which goes like this if I walk into class and I say look Homo sapiens are sexually dimorphic they are innate sex differences between the two sexes men are bigger than women someone will put up their hand and say about my Aunt Linda is taller than my Uncle Joe oh gee Darwin is dead right so they they identify a singular exemplar that is supposed to falsify a statement that is only true at the population level so here's so that's one example Muhammad is nice there Islam is nice here's a second example they point to a particular historical context where Jews lived in Islamic countries and weren't killed hey but God's out you lived in Lebanon and you still have your head and the retort that I usually give as well until they were going to cut off my head but secondly Jeffrey Dahmer if you take I think he he was guilty of 17 murders if you take the number of days that he lived as an adult until he was caught as a percentage of the days of that he killed somebody 99 point whatever percent of the days Jeffrey Dahmer is a lovely guy so it's unfair for you to say that Jeffrey Dahmer is a mean guy given that 99% of the time he's nice so what you have to basically do is take each of these ostrich logic arguments and analogize how idiotic they are but it's very exhausting because they bent as you said of all these progressives is to do whatever they can to protect the ideology and so it becomes exhausting to consistently have to try to fight through all their clutter and it's not a thought that it's it's not something that is structured with objective reasoning it's something that's structured with their own particular ideology that does not want to criticize this one segment of the human population that they think is being persecuted right and meanwhile if you think about throughout currently in the world which ideology persecutes the most number of other people so if you talk about bloody borders right Islam has fought with Buddhists Islam fights with animus Islam fights with Jews Islam fights with Christians Islam fights with Tibetan monks is right so in other words Islam doesn't necessarily make for very good neighbors why because again notwithstanding the fact that most Muslims are lovely and just want to raise their kids Islam as a supremacist ideology it basically says that the world is meant to all be united under the flag of Allah now some people take that seriously others don't but the doctrines of Islam are very clear we should all submit to as so even if 95% of Muslims don't adhere to that tenant if only 5% do that means we're always going to have friction in some cases it'll be like Lebanon by the way I've predicted that in Europe this is on record we can probably find it that in Europe within 15 20 25 50 years we're going to have Lebanon all over the place and now it's starting to happen right at one point we were having daily attacks all over Europe so so again if you're going to increase Islamic immigration to the west of course most people are nice and just want to escape to a better world but are you willing to take the risks for what's about to happen are you willing to accept people whose cultural and religious values are perfectly antithetical to yours so example if you do pew surveys from around the Middle East or Islamic countries about your views on Jews well you'll get things like 95 to 99 percent Jew hatred so if I am can if I'm a Canadian Jew right and I see that 50,000 Syrians are going to come in is it that I'm filled with hatred towards Syrians or am I simply someone who calculates statistical regularities and basically says that out of 50,000 people if 95% have endemic Jew hatred as part of their identity do I have a right to be concerned about this I'm not worried about haitians they're black people I'm not racist I'm not worried about the Vietnamese right I'm worried about the cultural and religious baggage that you bring in what about your views towards clitoris Azure homosexuality or religious minorities or or black dogs Darwin forbid if you're a black dog you're not black dog yet I mean Muhammad hated dogs but he particularly hated black dogs so again so what do they do with black dogs now go go on honey you'll see some pretty ugly animal cruelty they're not very tolerant towards dogs if you touch a dog before you're heading to prayer this is called measures its impure by the way the Kafar the non-muslims are also measures they're there they're there as in pure as urine and blood and sperm and feces so should I feel bad that is an ideology that considers me an impure quality now does that mean that all Muslims are like that of course not 99% of the Muslims I've met have been lovely and many of them are my friends but we should be able to talk about what's inside those books and those books are not radical Islam there is LOM well let me ask you this what's the alternative like save for Syrian refugees I mean any kind caring person who has concern for our fellow human beings sees these people fleeing and sees the horrific conditions that they're that they're confronted with in their own country and they really don't have a lot of options and they're trying to escape to the West what what are the options what do you do there are no clear answers I would certainly say you first place the people who are most at risk in those societies in the front of the queue so you bring the Yazidi women you bring the Christians who are being persecuted women but what about the father if the dad is with the wife and the children you can't just have the father stay back behind the tent you let the mom go to Toronto with the kids no fair enough but what I was saying though is that let people who are non Islamic who are fleeing those areas at the front of the queue first but isn't that isn't that religious persecution I mean or at the very least it's prejudiced right I mean you're you're you're singling people out because of their ideology or because of what religion they're from not because of their past behavior or any predictors whatsoever about their future behavior but we do have some statistical regularity about what types of values those guys are going to come with so I'm not suggesting we close the door right wouldn't that cut in a way I mean just to play devil's out wouldn't that in a way kind of put the Muslims in Toronto who do immigrant would have picked that City who tried to immigrate to Canada in the same sort of a position that your family was in in Lebanon where you were hiding the fact that you were Jews no one has an inalienable right to integrate anywhere correct so if you wish to immigrate to the West then leave every single syllable that constitutes a belief attitude position value that is contour to ours at the door and then welcome in my brother but man isn't that a crazy thing to say to someone whose entire life and their ideology is a big part of their identity and who they are like how they view the world so that's the structure for which they interface with other human beings but if those values so let's suppose they were with you know in a way I agree with you overall when I talk about the entire human population that it would be wonderful if we did that but from individual to individual we know about the trials and tribulations that people go through in a day to day life and religious freedom and a religious ideology in many cases helps people get through the pains of life it helps them get through the struggles I'm not saying that it's rational but I am saying that in many ways it's a scaffolding for their own personal behavior got it you would have to then ensure that your religious practice is exclusively practice privately never should there ever be an intrusion into the public sphere no asking for prayer rooms at the University the example that you gave is the slight creeping she had right it's the slow it's so my next book is called tentatively it might change death of the West by a thousand cuts right it's the idea that when you take again a parable of the Frog when you put her in boiling water and you do it very slowly the Frog if you do it very very slowly if it falls below it just a noticeable difference it doesn't notice that the temperature is rising until it's too late and it boils to death right so this idea of just noticeable difference is something that's very important this conversation we're not going to get Islamist overnight but Egypt before it became Islamic used to be non Islamic once upon a time today it's about 10% Coptic Christians turkey is now 99 percent Islamic one day it wasn't Iran the great Persian empires were non-islamic today it's almost exclusively Islamic so the United States and Canada are not going to become Islamic you know in the next ten years but give it enough time have a long enough view of history and I worry about your grandchildren and mine and so we that's how you have an honest conversation and I'm not sure what the answer is one possibility which I've discussed with folks on my show who are trained lawyers is that there there are provisions in the law at least in the United States to declare and ideology as being seditious right so in the same way that you could say that Nazism is seditious to our values or communism there are elements of Islam the non spiritual parts that it doesn't take n stein to recognize that they are perfectly antithetical to every single value that you and I would hold dear as Westerners so like what what would be some of those values so take for example Sharia law right which is the Islamic law by which you organize society the first premise of Islamic law is that the crime its severity and its punishment depends on the identity of the perpetrator and the victim so imagine the idea and the American Constitution that justice is blind well that is already violated as the most fundamental tenet of Sharia law if a Muslim kills a Jew it's very very different crime than if a Jew kills a Muslim you can just go to go look up reliance of the traveler which is the English translation of Sharia law and you'll see all these things so why should we tolerate this kind of stuff you right come in my Muslim brothers but keep the stuff that you yourself escaped from out of our country we don't want it and if you keep it out come in and let's grow together and hug it out but why should I be tolerant towards the Intolerable I agree with you in theory but I think the problem is as soon as you tell someone to not follow certain aspects of their ideology those aspects become even more attractive and especially if they consider the West to be decadent and filled with sin and fornicating and drinking and all the all the things that they think of disgusting and then these people are the ones are telling you that you can't follow the Word of God has brought down by the profit from up on high it becomes even more attractive to them so what do we do what so what's your drugs psychedelic drugs everyone gets on mushrooms and I'm not kidding I really I really think you need transcendent experiences to escape from the day-to-day vibration of normal life how about just a commitment to reason and science it would be wonderful if we could do that but people are so terrified of death and they're so terrified of the unknown and they're so terrified of not having structure people love having ideological structure that they can govern their life by real clear established rules and people get mad at me when I wear a fanny pack and I'm not joking one of the reasons why wear it is because people think it's disgusting like you think it's disgusting that I will have a bag around my waist that I can keep my keys and phone in it's like but we have structure you know men aren't supposed to wear sandals you know if you're a man and you're wearing high-heeled open-toed shoes you will get ridiculed why because we have a structure and this structure we I mean that's a bad example but it's not really because it's along the same lines of thinking that's that we would expect you to behave like we do so that we don't have to worry about your behavior I like gentlemen I like a man with a tie in a suit because I'm pretty sure that guy's not gonna spit at me and stab me and rob me we have these ideas about people that dress and behave a certain way you know if someone if you're in a business meeting and a guy starts swearing you know like whoa all bets are off this man's not establishing the gentlemen's protocol he's not following the standard business oriented you know I would just like to exchange numbers and funds with you protocol and so I don't understand what his behaviors gonna be he's unpredictable he could be a random street thug with a hoodie you know that was a thing for a while people were scared of young black men with hoodies on because a gentleman would not wear a hoodie on the street that's a dangerous person but by the way our brains have evolved to think this way and so this idea you're asking me earlier give me some examples of ostridge logic so this kind of hashtag not all right yeah okay now that again is idiotic why because when we think about it let's not talk about Islam for a second if you're going down a dark alley and you see four young men forget about hoodies and pass just for young men so all you've described is the fact that they're young and they're men if you see four young men versus four elderly women just because of your statistical regularity that you'd calculate which is more which group is more likely to end part violence on you then you might avoid the alley with the four young men even though not all young men right even though the probability that a young man is going to jump you and gang rape you and mug you and stab you is a small one but your brain has evolved to calculate those statistical regularities and to then be very careful be very risk aversive and putting yourself in harm's way so again even though most Muslims are very nice and very lovely I think we have enough data right now if we look at the last since 2011 a 2001 9/11 there's been over 30,000 terror attacks committed in the name of Islam right I challenge anybody in your comment section to list me another ideology that comes remotely close if you add it up every single other ideology since 2001 you wouldn't come up to a hundred so what is the statistical numbers that you need to see before you're able to simply say look let's have an honest conversation notwithstanding that not all Muslims and most are nice is there a problem with Islam yes it's not radical Islam it's not Islamism it's not militant violent extremism let's stop with the bullshit euphemisms there are inherent elements contents within Islam that are problematic it's not my job to find a way to get rid of them but if you wish to be part of our Western societies then you need to find a way to expunge that stuff if you do it welcome my brother were all brothers if you don't then I should show preference to people who share similar cultural values to me that's that's called survival instinct now what about people that would say that there's inherent problems with the Jewish religion there's inherent problems with subscribing to that ideology that there they have been persecuting Islamic people in Palestine that they've been prosecuting and in treating Islamic people as inferior to Jewish people that's not me I know you're not necessarily but that's all part of ostrich logic that's what I call but ma the Crusades right and it's not me who actually came up with the button MA right so every time we like but ma more like it's it's a it's it's a way of saying like but bro well what about the Crusades oh ma muh where's where's that from I think I first saw it and he'll be happy that I'm giving a shout out I think a guy on YouTube who goes by name of T and kraut or kraut and T he's a german youtuber I'm sorry I meant like that's not from a language or anything oh no no it's it's like saying bro likes uh the Crusades as soon as you as soon as you point to some Islamic ugly reality than someone points but bro what about Israel but there's no valid comparison I mean you really but you're kind of claiming an ideology right right I mean but when you're saying you're Jewish and I support you saying this 100% especially considering of all people you should be in some ways proud of who you are considering that you come from a line of oppressed people that escaped a horrible situation no one is arguing that there is a monopoly of ugliness that only stems from Islam Jews can engage in ugliness Christians atheists why subscribe to any ideology then because in the case of you talking about specifically Israel any any ideology and by usually five not necessarily Israel which is a land but I I reject all the religious elements of Judaism so so why you do because I am part of a people at part of a shared history so it's like I'm Italian you're Italian right I'm to the lineage in the same way by the way I recently put up a clip on my channel where i talked about academic lineage so in the same way that you could build a genealogy of your family tree or of a peoples you could do what's called an academic genealogy so for example my thoughtful supervisor is my academic father and then I could look to see who was his academic supervisor and who was his academic supervisor and do that in martial arts is that right there's exactly and so on so I could literally go back to some of the founders and only three or four generations I'm with some of the pioneers of psychology and so I belong to that particular tribe comes academia when it comes to my ethnicity to my religious heritage I belong to a group called Jews now that doesn't mean that all the booga-booga bullshit in Judaism I buy into I reject it so it makes me already somewhat less dangerous and that if there are any ugly elements within Judaism they're simply not going to be instantiated because I'm openly rejecting all that shit right I understand now you as an individual you me as an individual and most Jews in the West I think would fit into my category by the way later we should talk about a four and a half hour talk I had with the Hassid a very religious Jew let's do it flying to cut too much to California I'll do it so on a second now if most Muslims said look there's tons of historical elements in Islamic societies that's beautiful is Lama architecture Islamic Islamic some atomic science some Islamic philosophy you know there's every one of the first intellectuals in in modern data in big history so so I could be Muslim and that I come from a shared lineage of people and I could be very proud of that but I can also have the moral compass and the moral fortitude to say but there is stuff in my book that is truly grotesque and no amount of obfuscation and entry interpretive dancing could alter that ugliness right there is no way to take kill kill kill kill kill take an espresso break resumed killing there is no way to take that and reinterpret it using modern sensibilities to mean killing with caresses right let's not play this reformed game so be proud of your cultural identity if and if that incorporates an Islamic identity great but reject all the bullshit right and so I think that's where Judaism and Christianity at this point it's somewhat different from Islam for most people who are Islamic even if they don't necessarily believe it they'll feel very reticent to openly admit it that they despise a lot of the ugliness they'll say it's not true doesn't exist you didn't understand that you misinterpreted that reza aslan bullshit right right no be honest about it say it exists say you reject it and let's move forward but stop obfuscating well then there's people like Majid Nawaz who has he identifies as being a Muslim but he does reject those things but he says that you could reform them and Majid and I have had in case some of your viewers don't know this I invited at one point Majid to for to chat and he refused because I think he refused and I can't put intent into his mind but I'm I'm analyzing his rejection to chat with me I think it's because he sees that I'm going to call him out on a lot of his narrative well no one knows why someone rejects I'm sure did he openly reject it like he has no room you are in the future yeah I mean at this point I retract that invitation so even if you wanted to right there's an expression in Arabic I'm going to use this for a second okay imagine this is the pen he's holding a pen I'm holding a pen yeah the people at home listening vast majority - listening imagine that this spend were a cork the the cork of a wine bottle there's an expression in Arabic which I'll say in Arabic some people have heard mentioned before the expression is this scatter builds BB this scatter builds BB is to get drunk simply by smelling the cork right so I look I'm smelling it I'm already getting drunk that's what Majid there was is he he gets people drunk with his hopeful reform message mmm sounds so liberal that sounds so hopeful it's an expression yeah this schedule beliefs BB I can't even make that noise in my face but this guru bustier but that yeah Nia Hanabi there you go do you want me to have the rest of this conversation in Arabic be fascinated I wish I could speak it sounds cool actually what happens with a lot of the guests that I bring in on my show who are Arabic we always start off the start of our show speaking only in Arabic because for most Westerners it's fetishize it's so exotic like my goodness that what so a lien to the way he seemed the sounds right but so going back to Majid I think what maybe his heart is in the right place I don't I'm not I'm not trying to infer or imply that you know he's diabolical or duplicitous I think he probably truly believes that he's doing something worthwhile the problem is that it's not as though until Majid nawaz came along no one had ever thought about this idea of reforming Islam geez really we never thought of that in the last fourteen hundred years but the reality is that there are elements within the doctrines of Islam that simply don't permit for this Reformation to take place and even if it could take place we don't necessarily have the time to wait another four hundred years while we deliberate how each syllable in each of the problematic passages should be reinterpreted while people bodies are being stacked up all over the world and so therefore I think that there needs to be a much more direct intervention and what I mean by direct intervention no there doesn't need to be reform doesn't need to be interpreted it needs to be expunged these types of ideas if Judaism has certain ideas that are belligerent to woman's clitoris then I want those ideas and Judaism out they don't belong in the public arena of ideas that's it now how did Christianity reform and Islam did not how did that go about happening because at one point in time Christianity Christianity was a very repressive religion and the the apostasy the idea of it was much more oppressed than today right now like Islam is the only religion that I'm aware of I mean maybe there's more that I'm just ignorant to where if you leave the religion they can kill you absolutely I mean that's like that's what God wants God wants you to die because you don't believe in him anymore well I've always said that Islam is the perfect Mima plex so are you familiar with that term meme plex no so a meme is a term that richard dawkins coined in his book in 1976 selfish selfish gene thank you where he was analogizing the idea of the gene Gene's propagate correct well memes our packets of information that spread from one brain to another and so memes also spread we are both a biological and a cultural animal right both our genes spread and our ideas spread so a meme is something that can go so if you read my books I am infecting your brain with my memes with my ideas correct a library is a collection of memes so a Mima Plex is a collection of memes that in this case falls under a religious idea ideology well Islam is the perfect meme of Plex in what sense and that its contents are made to spread for example Judaism you mentioned earlier Judaism do you know how many Jews there are in the world well John spawn twelve what No okay let me think how many how many seven billion people in the world I would guess there would be somewhere in the neighborhood of billion Jews a billion Jamie you wanna think maybe five hundred million maybe come on I'm gonna take a very conservative guess I'm gonna change it to 500 million I'm so glad that we did this you're going to be shocked how many there's somewhere between 13 to 15 million Jews thousand more than that New York no shut up Mike loves guys talking crazy he's an agent I'm a Zionist shill let Jamie now do his little Google magic 13 to 15 million 13 to 15 million there's more idiots in America than there are Jews and that's only in Arkansas I'm just sorry guys is that really it yeah well think about how many Nobel Prize winners are Jews and 25 to 30 percent it's incredible right and that that by the way some people will say there's a genetic element but even if here we go what do we got fourteen million two hundred thousand I just saved between 13 and 15 million it's always perfectly accurate what is the enlarged what does that mean a cassell the world most the most the largest number Possible's 20 million I know it's like given I've never seen 20 million it's usually that I've seen a 16 million it says core Jewish and in large Jewish what is that like dudes who get converted because their wife makes them I don't my uncle did that but by strict but by strict the conversion laws that would not be allowed I'm not allowed to convert for ulterior motives what alternative motives he was a Jew not necessary spiritual it's a spiritual awakening well he went through the whole process he went to Hebrew school but that process has to be for no ulterior motive that can't be because my wife would not marry me otherwise but I think he did it because she wanted him to do and then he decided to do it because it was what you know I mean I get it but anyways let's go back so they are there are about 13 to 15 million Jews there are 1.6 billion Muslims 1/5 of humanity to to everyone Jew there's a hundred Muslim which ideology is more successful based on propagation Islam or Judaism right now why is that well take for example conversion laws free as you said about was it your cousin no my uncle in the way that he did it as you said it's a very assiduous process it's takes a long time before and as a matter of fact the rabbi's are supposed to try to dissuade you from converting to Judaism because that in a sense tests your your your faith your desire in Islam do you know what you have to do to convert what I won't say it because if I actually say it in Arabic then I'm gonna be making convert and I've converted and therefore if I leave it but basically you just have to say the Shahada which it's like the I testify Wow yes it's a once one sentence and then that's a BAM you're in and if you leave and Judy isn't there isn't that how about laws laws for marriage a Muslim man can marry up to 4 women including non-muslim women and convert them but a Muslim woman cannot do the other way around so the whole structure of Islam is built on the propagation of the belief system so just by that which one is going to be more dangerous one is a priscilla tiesm religion the other one you're not allowed to in in Judaism - priscila ties you're not supposed to try to convert others and in Islam Dawa is - priscila ties you have to now in different countries do it in different ways in the West where they are in the minority they'll do it through interfaith exchanges but the interfaith exchanges are always the Muslim telling the non-muslim how great our religion is and why you should convert it's never it's never a give-and-take so just going back to your earlier point about Israel and so on yes of course undoubtedly there are some Israelis that do very bad things to their non-jewish brothers no question but when we're talking about existential threats to our Western ways you and I probably don't stay up worrying about radical Jews yeah no don't I wonder what it is about people that makes us so susceptible to ideological thinking and still and whether or not it's ever expungeable you know whether or not it's ever something that we can eradicate from the thought process it just seems inherent to being a person it's so much so that I recognize it in myself like here's a perfect example I ran into a guy just a few days ago and he was he said hello to me and then he explained to me that he trains jiu-jitsu with the Machado's and immediately we were like brothers because that's my lineage yes right so it's like ah what's up man like immediately and I'm like that is so weird it's so weird you know like I I understand like when I talk to someone like oh how long you train 12 years oh okay so you understand me and I understand you where do you where do you train to Machado's oh we come from the same thing oh we're like brother there's a weird thing like I'd give that guy ride don't even know I'm you got a miniature but that's that's the case with religion that's the case with with many things it's the case with that myth ethnicities oftentimes with even with State pride like we we branch off into groups and we have micro groups and macro groups and it gets real weird when we do this but we all do it so to speak exactly about this ever granular way to comport them up compartmentalize us-versus-them let me mention the Hasidic oh yeah please do because the reasons not the reason that's a good segue is because I actually raised it with him on the plane I used to live in an area in Montreal called ultra mall for the Montreal is out there don't know where it is where there are a lot of Hasidic Jews so now you would think that within this very small group of people called Jews within an even smaller group of people called Hasidic Orthodox Jews once you're an Orthodox Jew you're an Orthodox Jew no on this side of the street are the Polish Orthodox Jews on this side of the street are the Hungarian Orthodox Jews and I wouldn't be caught dead marrying my daughter to those heathen pigs from the other side of the street so in other words our ability to create us-versus-them distinctions as you said is is infinite that's what by the way I hate most about religion and not only Islam right certainly every Abrahamic religion has a very clear daily nation between us and them if we are Christians we're going to heaven the rest of you who haven't accepted Jesus are going to hell if you are Jewish there are the Jews and they are the goys right then the Gentiles if you are Muslim of course there are us Muslim believers and all of you go far right and so it's as an inherent part of Abrahamic faith to play on this very innate mechanism of tribalism us versus them it's it's grotesque it's also what happened in Iraq when we got rid of Saddam Hussein it created a civil war between two rival factions of Islam Shia and the Sunni yeah and much but most people had no idea that was even a situation over there exactly exactly but should we do you want to talk yeah yeah so I was very interested in asking him things that I actually thought about studying scientifically as part of my research so one of the things that I study as you know is well I apply evolutionary psychology to all sorts of things one of which is mating preferences you know are there certain mating preferences that are universally true irrespective of culture right and the answer of course is yes so whether you go through the yanomamö tribe in Brazil a closed society or you go walk around in LA there are certain things that men will look for in women and other things that women will look for in men that tend to be universal for clear evolutionary reasons so interested at one point in studying the mating preferences of the Hasidic community again the idea being that here you're taking a community that culturally and religiously is very close where the cultural and religious brainwashing is very very strong and in this moment this movement that you're making with your hands does that represent the sheet with the hole in it as you're doing this thing keep doing this thing with your hands it must be a subconscious thing yes is that real I don't know if it's real I think it might be the ostrich thing it must be maybe it's a find out if we're talking about explain what we're talking about the idea the idea is that when a Hasidic couple has sex they have a sheet between them where they make a hole where the genitalia goes and that's how you get it all that's what I thought why you kept doing that you know maybe it was a Freudian thing and some my idea was at one point is to see if I can get access to the Hasidic community which will probably not be easy to get into the Hasidic community ass and what their mating preferences and so it was a small idea I had over you know an afternoon and then kind of dropped it and moved on to other things but here I was sitting with a couple a Hasidic couple and I thought okay I can't do a scientific study but at least I could come up with some anecdotes to discuss and so I actually asked them things like you know can you can we talk about some mating preferences that take place within the Hasidic community and there were some really incredible insights that came out so for example the what the wife said that one of the attributes that she absolutely was looking for and a prospective mate was that he'd be taller than her okay and it turns out that this is a this is called assorted of mating birds of a feather flock together so if you look at naturally occurring couples it is almost never the case that the woman is taller than the man there was actually a study done with 720 couples a single couple the woman was taller than the man so here's an example of a very basic physical desire in this case I just need the man not not to be tall just taller than me right that was replicating in a completely different context and a Hasidic community I even asked him about things like well will a Hasidic woman ever look at a non Hasidic guy that's walking down the street a bad boy that has tattoos and grease back hair and you know the swimmers body and desire him or has the cultural and religious brainwashing been so great that her eyes are shut off to these possibilities and she actually said that no I mean at bottom line as yo Wilson said the jeans halt culture on a leash in other words no matter how much cultural and religious brainwashing you have if you scratch far enough you'll get the same human nature and that's what I basically got from my conversation with them that's a fascinating way of describing it the genes hold culture my quote that's yo Larry that's yo Wilson that's a real perfect way of saying it that's a yeah every now and then you hear a phrase we like yeah yeah I you know I wish you could get him on your show I'm not sure if he's now probably 85 do you know who L Wilson no I do not so yo Wilson is a very famous scientist at Harvard I've heard the name I just don't know yeah he's he's amazing he's a by training he's an entomologist a insect scientist he specifically studies the social social ants basically and so he looks at things like reciprocal altruism kin selection all of these mechanisms of altruism in the context of B he's another quote that he has that I love communism slash socialism great system wrong species what he's basically saying is that that political system of we're all equal under communism is a great idea but it applies to social ants it doesn't apply to humans yeah so he's got these wonderful pithy quotes I wish you I mean I know that Robert Sapolsky is great but if Robert Sapolsky is great you need to get your wilson on this podcast well if it's possible I'll look into it where did you say he is he's at Harvard Harvard so I've probably have to come to him probably now he travels a lot of this stage probably well I'd be willing I'm gonna be back there eventually I'm sure so how often do you go back to to Boston well I haven't been in a while I'm gonna try to get there in the spring okay I'm thinking about filming my next Netflix special there what why there now is where I started right okay trying to figure it out it's either gonna be there here I think very nice those are my two options Boston or California very nice something either my current or my former home right right I don't know but so when you talk to this guy for four plus hours and I my wife was pissed by the way wow she didn't talk to her because she felt ignored she felt she was getting bored and she had to take care of the kids while I was having this one as my fact I thought later wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have taped it and I could have released this conversation you know on my show oh yeah because it was so honest try to keep in touch with this guy and so we exchanged and I actually asked him permission I didn't mention that I said I were much I said would you mind I'm going on this you know very popular showed with Joe he goes no no go ahead and feel free and some and it would be cool to get you guys together and moderate yeah that we could cook well now um it was an amicable conversation very and I really pushed him very politely so at one point I said to him you know what would be the evidence that you would need to see to have any questioning of your faith and his answer which is a classic argument from the I don't feel leagues term God of the gaps are you familiar with them no so god of the gaps is basically at one point when we didn't know much in science God could be found explaining everything right why does Thunder happen well God does it right now we find out that there is a very clear material explanation for for lightning so now that's often how God goes and hides somewhere else and now he constantly finds the small gaps where science hasn't yet been able to uncover an explanation and he hides there that's called the dawn of the gas argument and so he used the the granddaddy of God at the gap he goes if you take me back to the Big Bang and you show me that there was no God at that point then I'm willing to renounce my faith to which I answered even if I were able to do that you would still find the way the Nagel your way into justifying your belief in other words there is no amount of evidence that I could ever provide you that would shake your foundation so we really got into some heavy stuff by the way that's one of the differences between I think in his case he's an extremist Jew in the sense that he is the most practicing of Jews well how come we could have this very very difficult conversation and leave at the end shaking hands both richer for it and no one's heads come off well you were also Jew though I mean then it helped I mean what if he had that conversation with a Muslim don't you think that maybe maybe the more attention but nobody's head would be long at least the German United Airlines right my point is that I think part of Jewish tradition even when you for example go to the yeshiva to study say the Talmud is that there is this mechanism of we constantly argue about everything nothing is settled we have to debate over everything right so you have to have that openness of spirit to have your ideas question and I think that if already Islam were open to that a bit more than maybe would be in a better place I've heard some of the most compelling arguments against the big bang from religious people what give me some of those well the argument against it is you're not willing to believe that there's a creator that there's some sort of a system that was put in place by a much higher power beyond what we can describe but you're willing to believe that everything came out of nothing right something smaller than the head of a pin for some reason and no one's ever figured out and the only evidence that we have is the radio wave echoes of this event right so this is I mean I've heard similar arguments I mean Thomas is acquaintance is the guy who always argued I think in the 12th century about the first mover that you could always go back and say at time zero what started that what started that I don't think you could ever really ultimately shake somebody's foundations right there's no amount even forget about the idea of shaking someone's belief system it is odd that we're all willing to believe the most insane version of the creation of the universe ever without a doubt like every person of science people that believe in genes and atoms and subatomic particles and quarks and gluons and they believe that at one point in time there was something that was smaller than the head of a pen that became the infinite space that we see in front of us that's constantly expanding and so infinite that one of the things that Lawrence Krauss really really fucked my mind up when he was here he was explaining to me that when we're seeing the universe we're talking about 13.7 billion years or whatever it is you're seeing as it was well yes not just seeing as it was but he said you're only seeing the observable universe because the the universe itself is moving faster than the light that you see from it so it's entirely possible that it goes back far further than that you just can't see it right well yeah and not you listen and Richard Dawkins the guy that we talked about earlier about Selfish Gene has a wonderful concept it's called middle world have you heard this before no but I read arrow junior are tokens that middle-earth is that oh that's a Lord of the Rings okay I'm not I'm not too far with that stuff but he talks about middle world the idea being that our brains evolved to understand phenomena at a level that our brain interacts with right he calls that middle world so that which is at the cosmological level right at the Lawrence Krauss level of cosmology or at the nano level quantum quantum physics it's so esoteric then our brains haven't evolved to understand phenomena at that level right so in a sense it's counterintuitive for us to even do side that I mean think about it when you and I are actually most physicists what they study things at those levels they will tell you that the stuff is so esoteric right richard fineman the very famous physicist right said you know if you if you if you think you understand quantum physics you don't understand quantum physics or something to that effect that it is so esoteric and difficult for human brains to understand things at that level small or very big so but that notwithstanding that doesn't mean that scientists succumb to belief just like religious people do because scientists have epistemic humility which basically means what I'm always willing to see data if Joe Rogan tomorrow comes to me with data showing that the mechanisms of evolution as enunciated starting with Darwin are wrong then I would be a dishonest scientist to not revise my beliefs in light of Joe Rogan's evidence so in other words scientists are always open it's always provisional knowledge it's it's only the best that we have now whereas in religion it's revealed truth it is true because it is true because it's in my book because it's true so in a sense religious people are epistemic Lee Hari they're arrogant because nothing could change their opinions whereas scientists change your opinions every day so in that sense I don't think we're both succumbing to belief systems no I'm not necessarily saying that and I'm not equating them I'm not saying they're equal but it is an odd belief and not necessarily even belief for lack of a better word but Sanaa it's an odd concept that because we know that this exists and because we have some sort of residual trace of an explosion a long time ago you can try and let's mind blowing I mean I I probably just as a layperson in physics probably 1% of what I see in a National Geographic on physics I can even remotely understand right because it just seems so and it's not as though I'm not capable of complex thought but it's just so difficult for human minds doing what does it mean 16 billion light years away right I mean right for the light to travel for 16 billion light years that's the envelope I mean how do you understand these kinds of it's too big and then the concept of life and death is also like our physical limitations because we know that we live and die and we know that the Sun is gonna burn out and we know that life on Earth lives and dies and things so we we impose these physical restrictions on the very universe itself when in fact it might be some constant process of expanding and contracting that's one of the most disturbing is that the universe is gonna expand infinitely and then contract infinitely and then do it all over again so that I mean I don't know if this is even a correct theory I don't know if maybe it's been disputed but I had read once that there is a theory that the universe contracts to some insanely infinite position and then retracts down to the head of a pen again right and then the whole Big Bang is this continual process that might take you know a hundred trillion years or something insane I don't know I don't know I if you understand one percent I understand zero zero zero point one I actually had this physicist on my show he might be a fun guy to hop on your show his name is Lee Smolin he's a guy who produced I did the way that I discovered his work is that I was looking for every possible field that I could think of where evolutionary theory has been infused into that field right so for example in my case I apply evolutionary psychology and consumer behavior you could study criminal criminality from an evolutionary perspective you could study medicine and so I was trying to come up with a table that listed all of the various scientific disciplines where evolutionary principles have made headway and the the field at the highest level member we're talking about middle world and cosmic he argued that the process of natural selection operates at the cosmological level where this grand set of universes are being selected in other words in the same way that we select genes right some genes get selected and others die out that that mechanism sort of a cosmological natural selection at the cosmological level and so that's how first this it is so mind-blowing it is so esoteric it's so difficult to so non palpable that it it borders on taking mushrooms or psychedelics someone that that's how mind blowing so you should you maybe should check out our chat on my show it's really cool guy you might enjoy him well it is fascinating we think of how much the universe and how many possibilities exist in the universe right I mean how many different solar systems just hundreds of billions just in this galaxy one of hundreds of billions of galaxies it's almost like for our little tiny worlds like when we try to look at it in terms of the big picture we're not capable we don't have enough processing power we don't have enough hard drive space we can't take all of these points of data and bring them into our head and consider them but it's entirely possible that everything you see in the ant world in terms of competition everything you see in the human world in terms of competition natural selection and the constant and never-ending desire for innovation a novelty for new things we have this constant desire to improve upon every single thing that we've ever done no one ever looks at like a car I mean and says this is the best car ever it will not be improved upon we're done we don't need to make cars anymore right they always want to come up with something that's better airbags faster zero-to-sixty more protection for the passenger automated controls you know you can sit back and sleep while your car drives you to work there's all these things that we just take for granted but they're always moving in the direction of improvement and you could do that with life on earth you go back to single-celled organisms which become multi-celled organisms and we always look at it like oh that's just a coincidence and it's dinosaurs and then it becomes mammals and then it becomes humans then it becomes airplane riding cell phone using video having you know I mean it just gets more and more complex but we just oh that's just coincidence but is it or is it moving in this constant state of improvement until we create an artificial being that can accelerate things far path far faster than our biological limitations are capable of doing yeah so I'm not sure if this is where you want to go but as you as you were describing this sort of quest for improvement one of the one of the threats of that reflex or one of the dangers of that reflex is precisely how totalitarian ideologies develop where they argue that our current state of the world is faulty and if only um our ideology the Jew it could be communism it could be it could be perfect it then it could be perfect socialism exactly so so there is a way by which we could reach that utopia if only you had here to our ideology so there's a real danger in sort of succumbing to that and by the way that's one of the I'm reading right now a book by William Gardner who might come on my show he's a I think a political scientist his book is called the Great Divide where he actually lays out some of the sort of fundamental foundational differences between liberals and conservatives in terms of their worldviews and how because of these starting positions being so different having no overlap between them the Venn diagrams don't overlap that's why you end up speaking over each other without being able to find common grounds so one of these differences is that and and I described something similar using different terms a lot of the quote liberals and progressives view our brain as being blank slates right it's infinitely malleable right and so if you see differences between people it can't be because there was a starting point difference Michael Jordan was not innately likely to be better than you in basketball there were some environmental conditions that led Michael Jordan to become who he is and not gas hog to be the best NBA player ever and if only we can find the appropriate social intervention strategies then we could all have equality of outcomes and so that is a faulty understanding of human nature because human nature as you of course you know is really an interaction of our biology and our environment but so much of the welfare state is based on this idea that no we need more of your tax money so that we could implement a social engineering program so that we could reach that utopia where we are all equal outcome and frankly I think that that's complete nonsense it is fascinating that people seek comfort in communism and socialism for that very reason like they almost are trying to slow down the competition that they can't win right exactly yeah I see it by the way my university so in Canada a very sort of social welfare state and Quebec the province where I live is sort of socialist on welfare on steroids and so in the context of the universities every all of the metrics of reward are removed so that we can have equality of outcomes and the way that you instantiate that is through the unions right so there's a very powerful union that ensures that all professors are roughly treated equally because we're all social ants there's a queen bee and then the rest of us are all equal but of course humans are not equal some are smarter some work harder some are more apathetic some are honest some are cheaters and so this idea of constantly having to have some external agent manage the process so that we could all be equal to me is grotesque and it goes back to I think probably our first conversation you and I had when I was saying that you know I would love to eventually come to Southern California because at least in the United States the Society has been less parasitized by the social welfare idea of course the the Democrats are more so than the Republicans but as a general rule Canada is basically pure social welfare we're all equal and of course Justin Trudeau is certainly trying to push that idea even more he's too handsome that's that guy's problem he's trying to make up for the fact that he's beautiful and he's trying to be super sweet to everybody that's what's going on up there did you hear about the I just put up a clip a few days ago about the almot father case do you know that is no actually a few people tweeted oh please talk to Joe Rogan about this so all my father is a Muslim guy whose family had become Canadian citizens but the father had taken them away I think to Pakistan at one point until Afghanistan at another and at one point they were living in Taliban territory this is 2002 I think and the US military had engaged in some firefight at one point they even lived in the compound of bin Laden so these were really real apple-pie Canadian folks and all my father who was 15 years old apparently threw a grenade engaged in a firefight killed one US soldier and I think blinded a second one he was taken to Guantanamo Bay as a 15 year old spent many years there he was can a military tribunal u.s. Guantanamo tribunal gave him a symbolic sentence of 40 years but it was symbolic and that I think it was only going to be a eight year they agreed on a plea deal of eight years okay then he was extradited to Canada very quickly after that he was released because he already served quite a few years in Guantanamo and then he filed a lawsuit against the Canadian government for not having protected his you know Canadian charter rights because he was a child soldier and so on and he just settled on a ten point five million dollar settlement and an official apology by the Canadian government and then some most people were outraged most Canadians are outraged but then you should see the comments and some of my on my youtube channel you know what kind of pig are you talking to me that I would not understand that this was an innocent child soldier who yeah because most of us are usually hanging around while we're fifteen and the compound of bin Laden and lobbing bombs at incoming Marines you know that's a very Canadian apple-pie thing to do so again the reflex is not to be outraged that my taxpayers are funding this guy now and at ten point five million dollar settlement I'm a pig I'm a racist pig for not understanding this was just an innocent child soldier at the wrong place at the wrong time okay let's look at two different things one the amount of money they gave him yeah it's kind of crazy that your tax dollars go to that but let's look at the fifteen-year-old kid right what do you expect and what could possibly be done to dissuade him from following this pammi's living in bin Laden's compound you're talking about someone who's vulnerable to ideology fifty year old men are vulnerable to ideology what about a fifteen year old child like I don't know how much blame you can put on a kid now when it comes to throwing a bomb at someone and taking the life of another human being well there's got to be a lot of circumstances involved nan I would like to know what they are before I think about any judgment whatsoever because I don't know with a shooting at him were they shooting at someone he knew did someone he know get murdered by a US soldier was he actively engaged in some sort of military training and considering becoming becoming a militant I don't know right saltine is a baby I mean yes or no right I mean you can you can drive a car at I mean in 16 and Quebec yeah yeah you can start drive drivers yeah at 15 is that what is my team yeah my my my mother and father my mother my father was 19 my mother was almost 16 when they got married so you can procreate and have a child but you don't understand the yeah but let's be real about physiologically your frontal cortex doesn't even get formed until you're 25 when you're 15 years old you're not capable of making like especially living in a war zone yeah you're not capable of making moral and ethical judgments above and beyond the ideology that you're being raised in fair enough I mean III agree that most of us in that situation may not have been able to extricate ourselves from that and what I'm going to say next doesn't necessarily support the outrage but it gives it greater context he does come from a family if you later if you check when we got off the air the sort of the the cues of this family they don't seem as though they are assimilating very nicely within Canadian value system in other words for most Canadians the reflex of taking this guy who seems to be quite resistant to liberty and modernity and freedoms and rewarding him with 10.5 million thought that by the way this 10.5 Canadians so it's probably $30 American at this point and doctor I thought you guys were real similar no we we were - a few years ago we were at par and I think now we're at 1.3 so about 30 20 25 30 % less than you so that's how it was when I was when I first used to go up to Montreal like in the 90s give me at the par or different different the way it is you're saying the American dollar went farm longer that's right yeah it's heading back towards that no and not at not not to the worst the worst that I've ever seen it was when we lived in California in 2001 to 2003 at one point it was point 64 or 65 now it's at about point 75 mmm so it's not the worse that it's ever been but we're heading in that direction but since we're talking about Canada maybe you'd like to talk about and I know that you've had Jordan Peterson on did you follow both of our respective testimonies in front of the Canadian Senate regarding bills you know I didn't you know I've read a lot of Jordans stuff on that I've seen him speak a lot and I've seen I saw that one conversation that he had on television in Canada with some person who was a professor in Gender Studies who is ambiguously sexual I don't know what they were right whether it's a guy or a girl or a transgender woman to man this is what it seemed to be right yes and the one who's saying that there's no that gender there was no biological difference between men and women yes which is just fucking horseshit I mean that is just like one plus one is not - I mean it really is there's obviously a broad spectrum of variation and both sexes and they kind of coalesce in the middle somewhere it's with some well what's amazing is that I've been fighting this battle in academia precisely because of what I do which is introduced evolutionary psychology in the social sciences so these types of conversations these ludicrous conversations I've been experiencing them for much of my scientific career what's extraordinary at this point is that some of this nonsense is now becoming law and Canada so to kind of give you the background to what happened so I was invited both to speak in front of a Canadian Senate and also to give a talk in front of parliament on Parliament Hill but the Canadian Senate part was built c16 which is a bill that that seeks to incorporate gender identity and gender expression under the rubric of hate crimes right so in the same way that I can't discriminate against you for your religion or your race or your ethnicity I can't discriminate against you because of your gender identity or gender expression because then that would be a hate crime and so I appeared in front of the Canadian Senate to simply say that while of course everybody's personhood should be respected and we're all equal under the law the manner by which the bill was tabled the way it was written it was so vague as as it for it to be dangerous and so I give examples so let me just mention a few here for for your viewers so I said look Harvard University they're LGBTQ office came out with a pamphlet that said that the idea of promulgating and I'm gonna quote fixed binaries and biological essentialism close quote fixed binaries means male-female biological essentialism is to argue that anything is biological so the idea of promulgating fixed binaries and biological essentialism is a form of transphobic systemic violence this is not violence violence is and it's not metaphorical it's not allegorical it's not they mean violence in quotes it is a form of transphobia but specifically systemic violent transphobia no how do they define violence because there's a very specific definition of violence well I don't know I in the general sense I think it's the desire to come up with ever broadening definitions of violence so that any any transgression that you commit could fit under that root even micro aggression micro aggression is a form of violence right so so then I went from front of the Canadian Center now I'm not you could watch this later it's on my channel I said look every single thing that I teach in my courses would constitute transphobic systemic violence based on that sort of standard right it is on scientific data exactly so if I get up and say here's how sexual selection works right sexual selection is the mechanism that explains how sex specific traits evolve well sex specific traits evolve you recognize that there is male and there is female here is why human males are likely to have been sexually selected to be more risk takers right well by engaging in that conversation I would be promulgating fixed binaries and biological essentialism and transphobic transphobic violence because a trans transgendered student could come up to me and say look professor you've thought your quote I've listened to your course thirteen weeks you talked about evolved mating preferences and so on not once did you talk about the non gender the non-binary the gender fluid the the other can and so on that's marginalized me that's excluded me you're being biased you're being prejudicial so I try to argue that most of the liberal senators either laughed and scoffed one of them accuse me of being pro genocide this is on record in the Canadian Senate so a scientist what's this person's name I think so I'll send it there ja but i pushing thee which is not become maybe a an internet did you have a conversation with him I did it in there so we the conversation we had was moaning genocide someone said well how do you respond to that when someone says that so that my response which you could see I'm paraphrasing he says well I'm not sure that given the fact that I escaped execution in Lebanon because of my Jewish heritage that I need to be lectured about genocide and that sort of took him back now apparently later and I didn't see this apparently later he wanted to retract some of these comments and apologize for them I don't know if you heard or not how do you justify genocide like what that's what happens when you have your brain parasitized by ostrich parasitic syndrome what how does how is it okay to study all of these behavior patterns and ants and monkeys and dogs and what-have-you but you can't with human beings because if you do with human being somehow or another anything that you find about generalized behavior patterns or specific sexual preferences that somehow another marginalizes or in some way diminishes how another person's living their life to the point where it becomes violence so there's actually a term for what you just asked it's called the human reticence effect and simply put a lot of people are perfectly happy to use evolutionary arguments to explain the behavior of the salamander hyena the mosquito the dog but if you use the exact same evolutionary principle to explain human phenomena then suddenly it's no go why is that do you think is because we're aspiring to something better I think it's because people succumb to wrongly so to the idea of biological determinism they think that if you if you call up in explaining a phenomenon a biological principle that means you're doomed to your biology it's a fatalistic thing which of course is nonsense because there's no such thing as biological determinism because most of the things that are triggered by our biology have to be triggered by interacting with the environment right genes are turned on or off as a function of environmental inputs and outputs so the idea of biological determinism is a false worry much of what we do it's called the interactionist viewpoint much of who we are is an interaction of our genes and our environments but for most people there is something vulgar about reducing the richness of the human condition to our biology it just feels wrong this explains the behavior of the hyena but we are above that we are cultural animals we are prone to conditioning and socialization and higher-order cognition so you could even take evolutionary biologists so these are people who are trained in evolutionary biology they will commit this error I mean that's breathtaking right so the classic example is a guy who is otherwise in utter buffoon his name is PZ Myers but a fifth-rate academic and I say this because not to denigrate him but if I said use the word that's the letter Z Z yes yes Canadian so PZ Myers his claim to fame is he's got a very an hats off to him he's got an incredibly popular scientific blog called fur Angola which you know that's a hundred million views or something so he's done very well for himself but he's a guy who is perfectly happy to use evolutionary principles to explain the behavior of the mating behavior of the salamander but if I come along as an evolutionary psychologist and use the exact same principle the exact same logical structure to explain human behavior or what's the scouts are doing with this bullshit evolutionary psychology stuff that's nonsense that's pseudoscience right and the the reflex he has that is because to somehow explain it for the salamander makes sense it's National Geographic but humans they don't they're not prone to biology and I'll just give you two other examples Stephen Jay Gould Richard Lewontin who were very very famous Harvard evolutionists also despised evolutionary psychology but for other reasons they were avowed Marxists they came sort of from the hippie generation of the mark so they're probably about twenty years old and they were one of the mouse passed away Stephen Jay Gould is dead but they were guys who thought that if evolutionary psychology is right then they're marxist bullshit ideologies would be wrong so they were strong anti evolutionary psychology folks even though all of their training suggested that they should be for it so they are the guys by the way who used to do Wilson I mentioned earlier mm-hmm so Ito Wilson the social ants guy wrote a book called social biology in 1975 where he explained how evolutionary theory could explain behavior across all sorts of animals everybody was happy with the book and one of the last chapters he applies all these principles to the human condition he became persona non grata he became a Nazi he couldn't go anywhere to give a talk without being shouted down not unlike how you're seeing Milo today being shouted down well Ito Wilson went through those culture wars 30 years ago because evolutionary psychology was attacking the pet political ideologies of his colleagues at Harvard I don't know if Milo's a valid comparison I think Jordan Peterson probably others comparison fan because Milo is obviously a provocateur any children purpose true what are you but to just instead of pointing a finger at individuals I would like to try to figure out obviously we're not going to but let's discuss it sure what what is the motivation why do people resist these ideas of looking at the data of human interaction and genetics and sexual preference why do they resist examining these factors like what is it about and what is it about people that like that guy that you were talking about that wants to point at you for examining these factors and call you horrific names and just for looking at actual provable data data that you can mean you could show it you could do I mean it's reviewed you can what what is what's the motivation it's ultimately ego driven so in the case of those Harvard folks mm-hmm they are committed Marxist right if evolutionary psychology is right therefore my pet political ideology is wrong therefore I have to shoot it that's one example let's let's do it okay suppose I am a overweight woman okay and I don't I don't get much action on the mating market one of two things can happen I could either believe that there is an evolved preference that men have for certain universal standards of beauty or I could go for the much more comforting message which is that these beauty standards are arbitrary sexist patriarchal standards and if only men would stop being shallow and buying into these Hollywood images then myself this beautiful 800-pound woman would be getting all the action in the world so it's nothing wrong with me it's that there are outside forces that are causing these arbitrary preferences to arise right Naomi Wolf wrote a book in the early 90s the beauty myth that sold millions of copies where she argued that there is no such thing as universal standards of beauty it's all a beauty myth it's the patriarchy that imposes these beauty myths on women to attack their sense of self well if I'm a woman who doesn't score well even if I'm if I'm a man for example and and we know that women prefer men of high status well I could do one of two things I could get out there and shake my butt and get the status right Joe Rogan nobody gave him all the stuff that you have you had to work hard for all your success so that you could then hopefully do well on the mating market or I could say you know what these are arbitrary standards I mean in a just world my being a lazy apathetic beta male would just be as worthy of love and so I think ultimately there is an element to biological based explanations that's unhoped 'fl to most people right the idea that we could all be anything is a lot more hopeful and the idea that we could all be anything unconstrained by biology only exists in the recesses of ideologues the the world is not made up like that beautiful people are more symmetric now that doesn't mean that if you're not symmetric you're doomed to a life of celibacy but no the fact that Brad Pitt Brad Pitt is considered handsome because he exhibits certain cues that women all around the world agree are beautiful so to answer your question there is something very non hopeful about buying the idea that we are biological beings it's a lot more comforting to know we are infinitely malleable infinitely socialized Abul because then any of us could be anything given the right conditions I could be the next Lionel Messi that's hopeful and therefore I'd like to subscribe to that I think there's absolutely something to what you're saying but I think there is also this very strange and vague possibility that we are aspiring to a higher standard because we recognize that human beings are evolving and that we're moving into some strange place where we're no longer just creatures of the flesh and that this need to put people on this even playing field is this is a part of this aspiration I definitely think there's these influences and I definitely think there are these there's a lot of people that look at beautiful people and they get upset I mean there's a there's a way that they do it where they feel that they're justified and being prejudiced like they can see a guy like the rock for example who's as big handsome man's big burly man and they think that guy's a fucking idiot immediately meanwhile that guy probably reads a lot he's probably smart as hell right he's obviously very ambitious so he can control his mind charismatic he's very disciplined he controls his mind far better than a lot of overweight people that would criticize him and call him a fool but meanwhile they let their body rot to the state of decay which is not an intellectual thing to do if you're looking at your body and a like a leech is a finite resource and how do you manage that resource well very poorly if you're eating ring-dings drinking fucking soda and smoke and cigarettes and then talking about the rock being an idiot right I mean that's these are obviously straw man exemptions but I wonder if what we're doing with what's going on in Canada and this this liberal social justice warrior approach to everybody being equal and if they're not let's try to make them equal and if there's anybody that superior let's try to push them down and bring the brown people up and I wonder if we're trying to achieve some sort of equilibrium some sort of balance some sort of some sort of state where we're no longer just monkeys we're no longer just creatures of you know I want to fuck her cause she's got big tits right you know these are base ideas these are base instincts that it's fine if we observe them in bonobos but we don't want to see them in Harvard educated kids right so the male gaze becomes problematic right a man staring at a woman becomes a microaggression meanwhile she's wearing almost nothing right she's got a short skirt on and painted toes and you want look you can't help yourself the jeans come firing up you must suppress those because we were eventually moving past the flesh and you are of the new generation the new generation that will someday be neutered and there will be some non-binary expression of your humanity that you know exists as an avatar and some virtual reality world that you'll be forced to subscribe to when you when you join Yale but by the way that's when you talk about the male gaze I'm not sure if this we've discussed this on this show before but it's precisely this type of thinking that causes the Western feminists to view the burka as liberating and the bikini as patriarchal oppression it's exactly that right the to the extent that the male gaze is a form of visual rape yeah right and that should be condemned that should be stopped because it is a type of assault and quotes right the burqa by removing that male gaze becomes liberating now this is not an argument that I'm making up this is I've heard this argument on the other hand when a woman wears the Brazilian song and you and I look at her and have the exact same predictable response that most men would have because it's an evolved response well that's well that's bad because we are part of the patriarchy and we are succumbing to this rape urge right so this is so when I talk about ostrich parasitic syndrome I don't just use it as a metaphor it's genuinely the case that people's minds are becoming infected with such garbage that they're incapable to rational law to think with reason and that's what I end up doing most of the time that's what Jordan Peterson ends up doing most of the time which is we are committed to truth unencumbered by political correctness earlier you were saying what would be some you know how can we get ourselves out of you no sir coming to this tribalism and so on I think the only way you could do it and I'm not saying that anybody can reach that level is to simply be dedicated to the pursuit of truth when I was on Santa Harris's show you know earlier this year about six seven months ago he asked me is there any research question that you would not tackle in your in your in your scientific career that is too taboo and my answer is no right as long as you address the question honestly and objectively there is nothing that should be off-limits right because then it becomes very easy to say well sex differences we shouldn't study that because then it will marginalize one sex or the other race differences we shouldn't study them for the same reason so on that becomes forbidden knowledge know the highest ideal that any honest person should pursue is the pursuit of truth and certainly an intellectual so no don't be encumbered by political correctness just pursue the truth and I think one of the reasons with Jordan Peterson's message and my message has resonated now with a lot of people is because at least they see that we are ascribing to that ideal to the best of our abilities of that truth hurt your feelings fuck your feelings oh I'm triggered oh you didn't believe I used the f-word Podcast has an effect on people yeah I think it's um you know it's a bunch of different things going on all at once and there's obviously some tribalism going on even amongst these social justice warriors these virtual signaling people who are trying to get as much credit much you know social justice warrior street cred as they can like what happened with brett weinstein up in evergreen college and when I had him on I I just read some recent thing where they're doubling down on their hate of him and you know me they they're they're accusing him of all of this by simply going on the tucker carlson show now here's what's fascinating huffington post which is a really left-leaning establishment right i mean if any website is left-leaning its huffington post and i think they have some great articles don't get me wrong it's not like i'm not critical of all their stuff but it's very left-leaning like openly regarded they had a piece breaking down how preposterous these students are and the faculty and the president and what they have done to brett weinstein and criticized each step of it by showing a transcription of his conversation on the tucker carlson show which lasted like five minutes or i think and you know they called tucker carlson alt-right okay I don't know you redefining alt right now by the way I've been called alright they've Rubin and I are leaders of the alt-right disease are we're leaders with the actual leaders they all right I wrote a tweet about this like the fact that they can call Dave Rubin who is a gay man who's married to a man who used to be on The Young Turks who's Jewish who's Jewish and I mean I guess I called him a progressive but a progressive and the idea that he he wants progress I mean the real broad term of progressive progress meaning equal for all but honest honest about the approach but I would consider him probably more of a in a libertarian bent if you wanted to get like political which I guess I'm sort of in this sort of progressive slash libertarian left-leaning thing but I also believe in a lot of right things as well like you know that I think that competition is probably ultimately good right and I think that blaming other people for your lack of success is really easy and it's something that people do all the time but when you do that if you look at things in that way then you're diminishing the struggles that downtrodden people and minorities and the oppressed and all these different you know small groups that have been somehow another marginalized their your diminishing their struggle which is that absolutely not the case but there have been people that have emerged from those groups and done amazing things but oh those are outliers and you can't hold people up the standards of those outliers and you know the real problem is that the competition is stacked in the favor of these white men who experienced white privilege and what we really need to do is squash white men right by the way I have a theory about all this stuff what is this oh it's I call the collective Munchausen oh you've said this before please go again oh I'd like this to stand alone thank you so remember how earlier I said that the highest ideal should be the pursuit of the truth yeah so that the currency that I operate in is pursuing truth wherever that leads me a banker cares about the bottom line how much money how many zeroes there are in his back right and my case it's truth now in the social justice warriors currency it's how much ego strokes he or she gets by proclaiming unique victimhood status now why do I call this collective Munchausen so in 2010 I had published a paper in a medical journal where I was looking at a specific form of Mahatma so Munchausen's syndrome as a psychiatric condition where someone feigns illness to get attention to get empathy to get sympathy it's a real psychiatric condition I know a lady's got it oh yeah I was crazy okay tell you later I won't yeah okay right okay Munchausen's syndrome by proxy is a different this is a situation where you try to get your ego strokes by harming someone else and then getting the rewards so what does that mean your for example a biological mother who has this condition you will harm your child your biological child so that then you could take him to the hospital and because they're poor you you've got a sick ailing child and so on and then you get your your G astok orgasmic strokes by getting that attention and that empathy right or you could do it if you have a pet or sometimes with elderly parents but usually it's your biological child so I was writing a paper trying to explain this from an evolutionary perspective how this pathology could arise and so that's how the the psychiatric syndrome was in my radar and then as I started seeing all these social justice warriors navigating the world through a game of oppression Olympics where the the highest goal you could achieve is to be declared the winner of the oppression Olympics game right it's not the pursuit of truth it's not making the most money it's can I be anointed as the guy with the greatest and I call this collective Munchausen because it becomes a form of Munchausen but at the collective level right let me give you another example as writing to Donald Trump when Donald Trump won the you know the election just on my Facebook page private personal Facebook page I would see people outdoing each other almost as if it were satirical in terms of their collective munchausen I am a brown woman who is attending this University now that Donald Trump has won I'm afraid to go to classes I mean just think about how outrageous that sounds I mean you may like or dislike Donald Trump do you genuinely believe that your ability to take classes in your bullshit College in Maine is going to be affected you going to experience personal safety because Donald Trump is setting up roadblocks so that he could create internment camps for all women of they get gangrene what is the fear that you have that you're literally right but they're testifying like their nests defined and so it becomes this collective psychosis where the way that I win is by demonstrating that I am the biggest victim and so that's what social justice warriors do is that they have to win that game and so there is no so the Brett Weinstein example is those guys seeking to win those Olympics how dare you say that you could come on campus don't you know what kind of victims we are and so on it's it's a it's a complete departure from reason it's grotesque it's a psychiatric condition it's it's weird how prevalent it is though and how it's almost one of those things that you as a professor are not really allowed discuss with the people that are exhibiting that behavior because then you're diminishing their fear right you're diminishing or marginalizing their their own personal issues that they feel they have except except because I always can pull out my victimology card which usually outranks all of them because they're screaming while sitting at Wellesley paying sixty thousand dollars that they are marginalized whereas I say I'm not sure if I could be sympathetic because let me tell you my personal history well that's what you did with that guy and in the meeting when he accused you of genocide you hit him with four aces exactly like suck it stupid exactly and so now by the way the only way I can improve my score as I have jokingly said is if I self-identify as a woman mm and I'm transgendered would you shave though if you self-identified as a woman why do you have to assume the appearance of a woman I mean if really appearances don't matter exactly I mean if well yeah I mean this whole idea that beauty standards are bullshit and that are constructed by the patriarchy why can't you grow a big ol Santa Claus beard steal still identify with a woman I'm with you I can't you well let's let's set the trend but where do we draw the line though because I have no problem someone identifying as a woman if you want to be a woman that's fine I don't care right well where where do we draw the line though where are you allowed where are you how how out there can you get before I'm allowed to go well that guy might be fucking crazy well have you heard about this new there's this new I think called I think sis sexism have you heard this no I I think I covered it in one of my sad truths clips it's basically the idea that so you you're a heterosexual male and cisgendered alright which is not real right that's not a real expression but it is real but we're all expressions are created by humans right so facial some humans accept so you and I wish to mate with women hence we are heterosexual do we okay right now stay with me okay now by you restricting your preference to this old antiquated term of women meaning that they have vaginas you're actually engaging in a form of sis sis sexism because there are women who have nine-inch penises who should also be privy to your attention so by you saying yes I'm attracted to women but only the women that are cisgendered that have female genitalia that's a form of cysts sexism this idea is now being promulgated so you even saying that you have a hetero sexual orientation towards biological women as a form of transphobia not unlike by the way here's another example trans racialism of your to the side yes okay I love this idea isn't it fantastic it's wonderful so how far could we take this like how we are guilty far okay so yeah you think that you think the fulcrum is not gonna start swinging the other way at some point for sure it will and it has and I think that's one of the reasons why Donald Trump got into office is people are so upset with political correctness they went with the exact opposite which is buffoonery right outrageous you know like braggadocious male buffoonery I mean that's really what yes I mean he's a braggadocious buffoon and in a lot of respects especially the way he talks about his ratings and examines talks about himself in the third person you know like he was describing Kanye West that Kanye loves Trump I mean could you imagine saying that about yourself like describing yourself in the third person but a famous person loving you right it's so bizarre well you know a lot of people who follow me think that I joke that that you know they think that I have these Trump posters in my room and you know he's my big hero which of course he's not and by the way I'm Canadian so I truly don't have a bug in this fight the reason why they think that is because I offered prior to the election being done I offered some compelling reasons psychological reasons why people might vote for Donald Trump so most famously perhaps in my chat with Sam Harris I explained the psychological mechanisms that could lead to otherwise perfectly reasonable people to vote for Trump simply proposing these was complete unacceptable I'm sure you're aware of what's going on with Scott Adams and Scott Adams has lost millions of dollars for simply stating that he believes that Donald Trump is a very persuasive person and correctly predicting that that power of persuasion would allow him to win the presidency zenyk oh he doesn't even vote Scott Adams says because he talks so much about politics he does not want to have a dog in the fight so he doesn't vote he told me that on the podcast and so people think that he's a trump supporter he's like I'm absolutely not a trump supporter he goes I'm analyzing the human behavior exactly and so here's so just to kind of repeat what I had told Sam so there are different decision rules that one can use when they're making a choice between the competing alternatives so for example if you're choosing between cars each car is defined by many attributes right it's gas efficiency it's it's the power of its engine its price and so on and so there are different ways that I could apply a decision rule in choosing between car a and car B so here's one rule I could look at take all the attributes put them together multiply them by the importance weight of each attribute and pick the best product so using that decision rule maybe Hillary Clinton would have won because maybe if you put all the attributes together she ends up scoring higher than Donald Trump but here's another the decision rule it's called the lexicographic rule lexicographic rule basically says I simply look at my important attribute what's the attribute that I care most when I'm making the choice within this category and I simply choose the alternative that scores higher on that most important attribute so for example if it were cars I only care about the power of the engine so I choose car a because it has a stronger power engine right in the case of Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton suppose that my lexicographic rule is I care only about the position on immigration that's my decision that's the only thing I look at well it's very reasonable for people to think that Donald Trump had a more conservative tough view on immigration than Hillary Clinton so if I use that decision rule that psychological rule I would choose Donald Trump it wouldn't make me a guy who is sleeping with my sister and I'm a tooth I'm a toothless guy in Arkansas and a hick it simply means that I'm using a particular decision rule that causes me to choose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton so again all I did not unlike what Scott Adams did in his own way is offer the different psychological processes by which a very reasonable person can end up choosing Donald Trump rather than Hillary Clinton and it's unbelievable the kind of fuck I got was crazy because it's your absolute area of expertise I mean it's what your education is it's what you teach exactly it's so strange that if it doesn't jive with people's belief systems they get upset at you for teaching something that's science right well I call this by the way the the I used to love you got sad but rule so I used to love you got sad but Trump I hate you always loved saying that though they used to say love saying that they love to try to instill a seed of regret not just criticism but regret because it's even more painful right like to say I just think you're a fool it's like all right well fuck you you know my fan I'm not into you what's the number one source of flak that you received from your gigantic fan base the one the one issue that triggers the most animist to you boy I don't know to me like personally like you know Joe I think you're a great guy but my you're such an idiot because of X what's X there's so many things we need a three-hour podcast just to name them all I get a lot of facts wrong a lot of things are remembering correctly because a lot of like these freeform conversations like we're having it's not planned out the subjects aren't planned out in particularly like the divergent paths that we take sometimes we'll go down a path and I'll go to dad what was a story about that thing and I'll get that shit wrong all the time because it's just I mean as good as my memory is and it's pretty good there's just a certain amount of data that you could instantaneously call up to the I mean if you ask me questions about certain things that are in my constant day-to-day existence like maybe perhaps stand-up comedy or martial arts I can I can give you a staggering amount of information off the top of my head but there's a lot of stuff that you know we talk about in these podcasts it's just people say we should have prepared for it well I didn't know we're gonna talk about it there's no it's one of the things that makes the conversation so interesting right so in that sense I'm giving myself a get-out-of-jail-free pass but um I don't know I mean getting things wrong is probably the big one that yeah talking over people being a meathead all those things I'm guilty of I think probably the number one thing for me over the past few months has been this Trump thing hmm where people simply can't on this think I'm his waterboy which of course I'm not but I'm simply saying look very very reasonable people could have converged to a Trump decision a vote but don't you think that's like one of those 140 character criticisms like it's really like I've been called a trump supporter I'm a hundred percent not right but because of the fact that it's a cruel thing to say to someone yeah it's still loving Trump now you fucking idiot like loving Trump right like I have a seven minute long bit about him on my act like how am i loving them like we talking about it right but doesn't matter because by saying that they could diminish you oh you're a racist right you know oh you're a sexist you know oh you're like the one of the craziest ones is someone if someone gets unfairly or unjustly or inaccurately accused of rape right yes immediately that person's rapist and they did and it is incredibly difficult to exonerate yourself from that and people that have been accused of rape I mean not people like Bill Cosby when he can accused him at fifty fucking times or something crazy but I've known people that were accused of rape and it was all a lie and they were it was done by an ex and it was just someone who was a scorned lover and it was angry and they wanted to cast the worst possible light on this person in order to give them some taste of the pain that they feel from rejection or from whatever reason and this is not uncommon I mean I don't know what the statistics are as far as false rape accusations versus actual rape versus people who are raped who don't talk about it but either one does not invalidate the other by saying that a lot of women actually have been raped which neither you nor I would ever argue with of course and it's a horrible crime and it's a terrible fucking thing to do to a person to take away their humanity in that way that does not that does not somehow or another make it okay that people have false rape accusations well that's a horrific thing to I mean we can quantify what's worse or what's better you know and I think we would all agree that it's probably worse to be physically raped than it is to be accused of rape when you didn't do it but they're both gross but Jews think that and I've actually written about this do you think that the punishments for false accusations of rape are 2 lakhs because I do I think that I don't know what they are but I would say that they should be pretty horrific right almost to the almost the same amount of what he would have spent in in prison yeah I think maybe like 70 percent I think I think false rape accusations especially if you like really chase it down and try to give this person locked up I mean there's so much wrong with that it might be like 70% of rape I mean 70 percent meaning like 70 percent is bad I shouldn't say a number I don't think it's as bad as physically rewriting someone but it's in the neighborhood but I mean think of it this way not to get too philosophical every day that a guy spends in prison as a false Hugh's rapist while you the woman who falsely accused him is sitting in your house I mean you are quote committing the crime every day of his life right every day that you don't step forward she's not punishing right I mean again not to diminish that one act of rape but you are raping this guy metaphorically every single if not literally because he probably is going to be raped and imprisoned for having that accusation on top of his head right right because that's a targeted person targeted person so in a sense you're almost as diabolical as a true rapist because you are living with that false information and every day you're going to buy your tomatoes and groceries unencumbered by the fact that there is a guy sitting in prison who is probably passing some very ugly moments because you're unwilling to correct the wrong that you've done so I think it's a pretty diabolical person who does that it's a death it's definitely a diabolical person the problem is whenever you bring up this diabolical person you automatically get lumped in with someone who is some sort of an enabler some cisgendered white male privileged position tear about actual rape victims because you're more concerned with men who get falsely accused of rape right it's just another thing it's not it's not diminishing the actual crime of rape which is one of the worst things in the world next to murder it's just a horrific terrifying the aspect of human beings that we're even capable of doing that but it doesn't mean that false rape accusations aren't also a horrific aspect of being a person there's just a lot of shitty behavior that people exhibit and as soon as we lock ourselves into these these little groups that will always blindly support like I have this bit I've been doing lately about a bumper sticker I saw on a girl's car that said girls kick ass like you imagine if a guy had a bumper sticker that said boys kick ass I mean so propel you're signing off on a hundred and sixty million people that's so crazy but it's one of those things where we'll allow that because we all agree that women have a harder go of it in this country in particular in other countries far more so right and we could go back to ideology for the reason I of that what we're talking about earlier by the way speaking of rape I don't I don't think we've mentioned this everyone this show a to of my colleagues one of whom I know well the other one not so much if at all wrote a book around 2000 or 2002 offering an adaptive evolutionary explanation for rape he had there you go you don't need to hear anything more so yeah exactly so actually I'll tell you their names surrounded Thornhill who's a very very serious scientist and Craig Palmer they wrote a book I think it was in 2000 now they weren't of course justifying rape of a warrant condoning it they were saying look if you wish to understand rape then you better have a good scientific basis for why it happens and therefore they offered some an adaptive argument which by the way that's one of the main things that people who hate evolutionary psychology commit as a fallacy they think that when you explain a phenomenon you are justifying it so if you explain why men and women might cheat on one another in monogamous unions oh you're offering a scientific justification for cheating of course you're not usually my rebuttal is the guy who studies cancer an oncologist does that mean he is for pancreatic cancer he's justifying no he's just trying to explain why pancreatic cancer happens is that across the board though I mean what if you try to explain why people commit violent crimes or explain why people steal things from stores yeah that's a great question I think there are certain phenomena that triggered that response more than others that and it's an open empirical question what's the quality of the phenomenon that causes you to react that way around well I would say that it's most likely the stronger person who seems to have the priviledge victimizing the weaker person perhaps males versus females child abuse that's another one so an actually feel yeah exactly so the book so the the book that got me into evolution in psychology I've mentioned the story before maybe not on the show it was my first semester as a doctoral student at Cornell and the professor this was an advance of a psychology course and the professor assigned the book called homicide by two pioneers of evolution psychology husband and wife team Margot Wilson and Martin Daly where the book is about understanding patterns of common criminality via and evolutionary lens and one of the things in the book that had struck me as so powerful was looking at child abuse in a home and then demonstrating that there is a very clear evolutionary reason why that happens so let me ask you that every discusses before in this show I don't think so I don't recall can you guess at all what is the number one greatest predictor of there being a child abuse in a home so for example you might say oh it's poverty you might say I would say it's probably parents that were abused as children no bigger than that bigger than that much bigger I'm a fact that one factor is a hundredfold greater than it so in other words typically when you say and what's called an odds likelihood ratio 1.2 so you have a 20% greater chance of getting cancer if you smoke so just having 1.2 greater odds is considered a big number here I'm telling you a hundredfold greater so it's something that's almost never seen in science what is it having a stepparent in the home ok now think again here of another animal to get the people who don't like 100 times greater listen to this so and actually it's now been called the Cinderella effect because in Cinderella right she she shows the the the evil stepmother loves her to biological daughters but hates the stepdaughter Cinderella so that's right ok now think about with lions right in a lion pride you have a one or two dominant males who control and protect the pride and who control sexual access to the females there's constant testing of these males by bands of young males who are looking to take over and for a while the resident males went out and then eventually they lose when they lose and they're either killed or banished from the pride what's the first thing that the new incoming bosses do they kill the babies they kill the babies what happens to the females that the lionesses when they kill them they go into investors right so I mean instead of playing Barry White music and the violin to get them in the mood kill their children and they get in the mood right nature is brutal right well in the context of humans when you have a stepparent who is not biologically linked to the child it simply increases the likelihood of there being abuse right now usually when you explain this what is the first thing people say oh well I grew up with a stepfather and he didn't do this to me you're an asshole or but but what are you saying that means it's okay to do it because you're explaining it so look how they conflate explaining a phenomenon with justifying the phenomenon right so I think rape child abuse and probably marital infidelity are the three evolutionary phenomena that when you explain using an evolutionary lens people go completely whacko yeah that makes a lot of sense I mean it's something that it's you you almost can't look at it it's right forbidden language as per my conversation with Sam Harris avoid that topic because you'll get too much flak and that's dangerous nothing should be forbidden so these scientists that wrote this book whether you're examining rape and the causes of rape what was the repercussions so I I was invited to Randy Thornhill's at the University of New Mexico and he's still there great guy when when he invited me to when his group invited me to give a talk at the University him and I went out for a while and I asked him that question he said at one point there had to be constant police patrols because of all the death threats and so on that he was getting now I suspect that at this point it is subsided this is 15 16 years ago but when the book first came out it was dangerous to be Randy Thornhill is so bizarre were people that you would think of the left right and as soon as you think of people that are liberal and progressive you think these are nonviolent folks that just want peace and happiness and love but look what happened in Evergreen I mean this is what brett weinstein talked about the threats and then all of a sudden you've got vigilante patrols with Tasers and baseball bats these are kids that are running around trying to justify using violence because someone doesn't agree with their thoughts the whole idea of it was a day of absence a day of inclusion or a desert day of presence right right that was the idea was that white people should stay home just and Bret White's he was like that's fucking racists like you can't do that and he as he self describes is a deeply progressive person and all my conversations with him indicate that in a huge way and he's just a really open minded progressive guy who he doesn't but he doesn't want racism against white people to exist any more than he wants it against black people but by the way I was so he came on my show too we had a great chat and then sick in hiding now so interrupt yeah no no isn't he yeah I mean I don't know if full hiding but he's certainly not on campus he said he said he had to move his family yeah I even know where but maybe I shouldn't say where oh yeah well if you look at the comment section I wonder if the same thing happened when he came on your show I was amazed at the Animus that he that was being levied at him from people who were saying hey the guy is part of the problem he's a progressive who created the monster that is now biting his ass and so let him let the snake and I thought that was so much charitable you know I didn't get that but I do understand why fools would think that because he's not the real true progressives like a non ideologically based progressive it's a good thing exactly it's a good thing I mean to do in order to think that hey man we should all be the same regardless if you get dreadlocks or a shaved head or if you're white or black or it's a weird thing like like sexual preference that we were talking about this before like if a man is only sexually attracted if he says I am sexually attractive I prefer white women you are a fucking racist but if you say I prefer black women like ooh spicy yeah weird by the way this this cuts both ways so and I've actually commented on this if you say I'm attracted to overweight women mm-hmm you are objectifying and fetishizing our corpulent bodies are you know no that's what they'll say that's what they'll sell the complainers they should be happy somebody likes it if you say I don't like fat women because I'm not then of course you're you're a bit so same thing with with black women right if you say look I just have a preference for black women oh yeah it's the old stereotype of the sexual black woman with a beautiful behind you're objectifying us you're racist if you say you know I really don't like the the the the body types of black women I prefer Asian women well you're a racist so all roads lead to you being an asshole if you like them it's bad if you don't like them it's bad but if you just say you just enjoy dating black women because of the way they communicate some reason someone will probably accuse him listen correcting somebody for their grammar if it's part of their dialect is racist right so Ebonics actually I was I was coming when we were coming here I was listening to a song by Hannah grace Sierra Sierra you know what that is no she's a she's a hip-hop singer and at one point in one of the songs she goes there you is they are us and so I told my wife I said you know it really pisses me off when they commit these grammatical errors yeah but that isn't that an art thing I mean like I might say something grammatically incorrect on stage ever think it's funnier than singing correctly okay fine if you're doing it because it is part of the sort of the contextualized shtick but isn't that what she's kind of doing this rap song I don't know I don't know it's an open question I don't maybe it just rhymes better there you are don't say they're us but what if it's she's trying to run what rhymes with is fizz fizz yeah I don't know sitting champagne get my fizz it look over there there you is Shubin a rapper by the way you said this about you said that saying that you're attracted the black women might be right or not did you hear the latest with the new letter that was uncovered from Tupac Shakur to chicks no no no that he broke up with her because she was a white woman he broke up with Madonna Madonna yeah yeah well he just she was annoying he was just trying to find our excuse that's a good way like that you can't ever change right you can't change the fact that you're white that's a good move but imagine other way around right if if she written him a letter saying hey dear Tupac I would have loved to continue this relationship but given that you're a black guy her career would be over but him saying it to her he actually said he goes he said if you date me it appears as though you're an exciting cool woman but if I continue to date you a lot of the people that made me who I am would I would lose credit with them you know Craig Italian water she was throwing that pussy correctly probably still a little stuck around she's probably annoying it's probably talks too much she probably talks about herself in the third person like Trump probably likes you I I'm going to admit something now that's gonna come back to haunt what 1985 my cousin and I I shouldn't be saying this what did you do drove to Toronto to see Madonna I would have done that 1985 she's a fantastic performer she's a huge superstar and still kind of is I'm just joking around about being her being annoying she's a funny thing to say I was always big Madonna fan when I was younger I think you know two's beautiful and interesting and bold and I mean you don't get that without a certain amount of ego so the tamaak that egos like well of course you know it's like that's who she was yeah true you know it's and then on what Tupac is doing this I mean he's kind of like locked into the identity politics of the 1990s I mean that's what what where he was it's you know is there is there a a person that you would love to have on your show who is a artist that you really love um there's a lot of them there's not one there's one that's coming on my show oh yeah I had an announcement so I hope that he doesn't somehow back out but I'll mention it doesn't matter if he doesn't end up coming that's okay do you know have you heard Wayne Newton the way no no it's Ricky Martin oh I'm kidding no it's livin la vida loca do you know do you know the group stylistics no the stylistics were a old soul group that's part of a genre called the Philly sound so there's a type of black music in the late 60s early 70s that's this very soulful sexy soul type of music Simon stylistics were the epitome of that genre now this is a group that I grew up listening to all the way back at Lebanon when I was a kid and I've made contact with the representatives of the lead singer and he said that he will come on my shorts oh so all the people that I've had on my show all of whom have been lovely and accomplished people I think and I hope I'm not being insulting to anybody I don't think I'm as excited to be speaking to anyone which shows by the way the power of music right as much as I am in speaking to this gentleman you know who in this there go there that's actually not the singer is that a bare chest under a suit coat that's the guy mm-hmm that's Russell Tompkins jr. Wow that fro strong he's got what's called the falsetto voice she goes very very high with his voice there you go you are everything there yeah I've heard that song isn't it funny how like people used to dance and move back then like look everyone was like synchronized and there was like a thing they used to do together I know that doesn't really happen anymore I wonder what happened where people decided that synchronized singing like five men together on stage is not cool anymore well you do have boy bands you have Backstreet Boys or men is there been yet these are men these are this is five men moving their arms and singing in synchronicity while people dance slowly which no one does anymore no one dances like that anymore who fucks things like that anymore who fuck dance like that dances like that anymore it's weird right I know so we need to bring back to train in in 2001 when we lived in Southern California I had the crazy idea of calling the representatives of the stylistics to see how much it would cost to hire them for a private concert somehow I thought that a professor had enough of a salary the higher the stylistics there were a private concert how many people parently you know I just had this fantasy that you know would it be amazing to invite people to yeah apparently I'm much poorer than I think I am yeah I think it's five dudes it was actually I can't remember the exact number of it was something in the order this is 15 16 years ago was like I remember maybe half a million dollars the whole cost of flying them and their feet I'm sorry UC Irvine was not paying me enough I came over the exact number but it was much more than I could afford whoa were you hoping for like 10 grand 50,000 50,000 you were hoping for yeah that would seem like reasonable that's like you know I thought I had joe rogan money but I only have mere professor money that's a even 50,000 it's like I wouldn't spend that much money it really is Christ you know you could what's your favorite group it's probably Metallica on my right I love Metallica I love me some metallic especially when I'm working out and sure I mean you did tell me prior to our starting how much you love so who's your favorite I do not have a favorite give me really don't Led Zeppelin okay let's Aplin how they steal music well what they got exonerated yes they paid off some fucking is that true do you know how much money they would have to give back how much the record companies would have to give back but it was average that it was stolen like in terms of the you want to play it you want to play it here here let's play it so we could just can we do it or would they will they fuck us you two would you two before goes alright so we'll we'll do this and it won't be on YouTube so the people listening right now on YouTube not gonna hear shit but this is what will do we will synchronize Jamie will tell you what this is and you can synchronize it because anything work like that can you open up to YouTube windows I'll put up that I can put the video in the corner so you can see what way it's a 56 second video called Led Zeppelin verse spirit stairway to heaven compare yeah so we'll have to kind of talk a little bit of it otherwise the people that are listening to this live streaming and you get this there's gonna be like dead air so this is the original song this is not the Led Zeppelin version this is the song that Led Zeppelin fuckin ripped off this is exactly like dude it's a hundred percent it's not like 80% or 70% that's a hundred percent they stole this this band openers down oh it's only one of many I mean there's a lot of influences that they had from old blues songs that they added to like some of their songs which is more forgivable almost akin to what they do today with rap music with Sam Stanley yeah which I don't have any problem with it all I mean I think it kind of enhances it it makes you think about the old song but this is egregious so what was their position it just happened by fluke came up with the same notes just hire the best lawyers they got themselves some Jews is that is that a nice a masam being lawyers so here did you play the okay it's both of them okay we'll play that play the second part of the first wall so the first one is stairway to heaven listen where does it go there's a better version of it oh that's the compare okay let's play go back to it see if you can what we'll see which one is uh okay here we go this is this is the California bass psychedelic band spirit this is a Taurus this is not sound now this is different is that that's not it the Taurus is a sound you're listening to right now hold on a second it changes hold on a second here yeah okay you hear this part yeah okay the chords that's not even a good version yeah there's a better that's it maybe there's one of the other songs okay so no not-not-not what's standing the potential for them having done some unsavory things they're pretty badass you couldn't you wouldn't spend fifty thousand dollars you have as your guest of honor the godfather at your house and then you say ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen letters are you you're gonna he's a closet Led Zeppelin fan I get what you try and do each other you know how much we'd have to first first of all you know much money you'd have to pay like you was here about these guys like um in the Middle East some sheiks yeah like Rihanna to go over there and perform I think a million is like a bargain is that right yeah like what it didn't Beyonce go and do some crazy concert for New Year's and Dubai for somebody for like five million bucks or so on yeah it's pays to be super famous I guess what do you think of first Joe Jackson marrying some oil she's like full-on burka she's burka yeah well some of those videos need to be expunged from our collective memory how about when she pulled at it out at the Superbowl jay-z and Kanye paid six million dollars to perform and Dubai wicked it's hilarious this is there a place that you would be invited for a very large sum of money that you would refuse because you disagree politically or ideologically with whatever that person was inviting your stance for sure okay yeah for sure certainly Nathan didn't know they were bought for some price well it's a little bit different what they do because they would go over there and they I guess they would know like what their material would be you know like if they went over there to perform 99 problems that like jay-z's as lyrics are out there you know they say like hey we would like you gonna give you six million bucks we want you to sing 99 problems and all these different songs the lyrics are clearly established right but if someone like me went over there and did comedy like who was it was it who one of the guests I had in the past house parks I think it was house parks that went over to Dubai and he had did a bit and he was told by one of the people in the audience he was going to be arrested because he referred to one of the royal family by the wrong name called him sir instead of your highness and so they were gonna arrest him Wow but then some other member of the royal family stepped in and stopped it because they said no he was respectful and he just didn't understand the tradition protocol yeah but they were ready to lock him up in a fucking cage cuz he used the wrong term not even in a disrespectful manner right yeah just just called him Sir you know whoa yeah like that's not the place that I'm going I'm just I'm not interested in any place look man there's a real problem with Canada right now you know I know you know what happened in Vancouver where a comic was heckled by these lesbians yes and he shit all over them and they sued him and won because he had done something to violate their human rights because they were heckling not just him but people before him they were disrupting a live performance so do you think that this trend of famous comics refusing to perform at universities is only going to continue crease or again have we reached the maximum and now there's gonna be blowback because I know Jerry Seinfeld doesn't do it Chris Rock doesn't do it right I haven't done it since 2003 maybe was the last time I did a show yeah I don't think they have enough life experience you know I like to talk to people that have lived when I when I talk to people I want to talk to someone who has had affairs love affairs and has had jobs and been fired has had education and as I want someone with life experience enough is anything wrong with being 18 or whatever 19 but I want someone who's got some living under their belt so they know what the fuck I'm talking about I don't want to have to explain everything I don't I mean I did a concert once a concert I did a show once at a university I was talking about something sexual and I saw this bewildered looks in the audience here how many you people are virgins I go don't don't even raise your hand because I don't criminate you I could just blink real fast and they started laughing but it would got real uncomfortable I go would you again I go I'm not gonna even look at you I go I'm gonna look at the sky would you say that I would be out of line if I said 10% of you were virgins and the place won't do one no no that's probably about right people like yelling I'm like that's crazy ten percent of you are virgins that's like if there's 200 people that twenty of you are fucking virgins really that's a lot of people right and it's probably more than that they're probably being modest or not being honest about it I just it's not nothing wrong with being college obviously but as far as like where I want to perform I don't have a lot of you know if I have a day there's 24 hours in that day I don't have a lot of hours to perform at night if I'm performing at night I get a couple hours you know I like I like doing actual comedy I like doing what I do and then one of the things about comedy is it's it's different than any other art form in that like say if you go to see music like you know what you're gonna go see you don't usually just say oh live music like well let's hope that it's something I'm interested in you know we're gonna see jay-z followed by Johnny Cash followed by Loretta Lynn no it's not gonna be that way you're gonna go to a rock-and-roll club you go to the Viper Room most likely gonna hear some rock roll you go to a country-western bar you can see that I think with stand-up comedy people get upset if you're not doing like what appeals to them and their sensibilities so I like to go to nightclubs that's right I don't even do corporate gigs I get a lot of offers you do these corporate gigs and they'll they'll pay you a lot of money cuz they'll be to tame the audience they won't know it's just like it's not a it's not a real comedy show it's like you guys are pay it's like you're GAD sad paying 50 grand to have these guys sing in your backyard some weird ego thing right I saw my friend Dana White who was he's the head of the UFC he had a birthday party years back and Stone Temple Pilots played before that dude died of an overdose plant and man no he was fucking paying attention it was weird Stone Temple Pilots I mean they kind of got everybody to pay attention got everybody moved towards the stage but people a didn't know to expect Stone Temple Pilots it was a big surprise and when I even introduced them when I introduced Stone Temple Pilots people didn't even think that it was really gonna be Stone Temple Pilots like I said happy birthday to Dana thanked him for everything that I said and I'm gonna you know blow your mind right now ladies and gentlemen Stone Temple Pilots and they came out and it was really stoned Temple Pilots they they went hard they did their it was really really impressive stuff because they did their full-on concert like a hundred percent all-out it was intense it was really amazing but it wasn't a lot of people pay attention and why was while I was sitting there watching that I was like you know what yeah never again I'm never doing I mean I'd already decided I wasn't gonna do it I wasn't gonna just do that anyway but I remember something that you said I think in our first chat several years ago which has resonated and stuck with me you were comparing your career as a stand-up comic or in fighting to the truth that comes in science that you and you were comparing that to acting which is very ephemeral and fuzzy and you were saying basically look when you're a scientist you have to present stuff and it's either right or wrong and people are going to judge you and you analogized it to comedy you get up in front of a crowd you either know you're I mean you're either funny or you going to bomb you get up to fight you either are red are you gonna get pummeled and I thought that was a really good analogy because there's truth and honesty in that right there's no way to wing it as a comic you get up and you better be funny right yeah but it's very subjective like one thing to make might make you laugh is different someone might think is terrible I mean there's a lot of people that are fans of certain comedians that other people think are all awful it's just like music you know there's certain types of it's it's all subjective it's it's like when you consider art what's really did like fighting even it's like who's it's not necessarily even who's necessarily better sometimes it's like what happened in the moment but sometimes dudes collide heads and it changes the course of a fight and it's not because of a skill it's because in the moment something happened chaotic like someone got poked in the eye and they couldn't see well and then they got knocked out are they the worst fighter not necessarily it's like sometimes there's there's all sorts of unpredictable variables that come into place there's a guy that I recently quote discovered he's an Italian comedian who had an HBO special I thought exhaustion so yes - ah oh he's a buddy of mine he's been on the podcast no kidding hilarious guy I I live usually when I watch stand-up comics I mean I laugh a bit I think this is funny but that guy and hitting that show I probably watch this on Showtime as a short time yeah I literally could not stop laughing because somehow his humor very much resonated with some of our sort of Middle Eastern yeah yeah and I just could so gravitate towards him this guy's fantastic he really is he's a great guy too he's he's like nobody hates that guy like that guy's loved in the comedy community but he is he'd been known for long he's been doing it for a long time and he's an interesting case because when he first started out he wasn't doing that good you know he had to really work hard at it to become who he is but he stuck with it and chipped away at it and got better and better and better and I didn't see him for a long time because I had taken my hiatus from the comedy store and I saw him on Showtime when I wasn't at the comedy store anymore and I thought it was so fucking funny I remember tweeting at him then I got a hold of them I said dude that was amazing it's so good and I had heard that he was doing really well but I hadn't seen him perform and was probably like six years five or six years at least and he just had gotten so much better that's innate right you agree that much of our humor I mean it's not something that you could teach in a workshop right how to be funny 101 right it's just you either have that delivery you know how to I would say you have an ember okay and you if you long as you have an ember you could become really funny but I've met a lot of people that sucked in the beginning and they just got really good they because they really worked hard at it and here's the most important thing and this is like it's this relates to what we've been talking about being objective about the actual root cause of why people like you or don't like you try to figure out what what it is about what you're doing that people don't like and correct it right get better improve and the only way to improve is not blame the audience oh you're a bunch of stupid yeah I mean but people do do that and the people that do make those excuses and don't instead look internally you know like sometimes you can have a bad side you guys say well you know what man I fucked that up I just wasn't tuned in I got I got a I got a readjust I got a you know maybe I was sick that day and there's always like reasons necessarily not not necessarily excuses rather but you gotta examine those uncomfortable moments and some people excused themselves by that by saying that audience sucked or you know these people are assholes or you know this people are stupid there's a bunch of excuses that people make and it's super critical that you don't do that you got to look at gotta look at the whole thing you know do you do you in terms of actionable feedback do you look for it from other professional comics because you trust their opinions more or are you looking for the civilians in the audience to give you that feedback which one is more actionable from your perspective as you're trying to improve your craft it's very problematic to play for the comedians because comedians like weird shit like we might like something completely obscure that we don't see coming you know but the nota of audience might not be laughing and you might hear one comic in the back of the room gum and the audience doesn't think it's funny and then there's a trap that the comedians will fall into where they start playing for their peers specifically there's a bunch of guys that have I don't want to call anybody out but there's people that have ruined their career because they essentially became the comical place to the back of the room and the audience didn't think they were funny and essentially they're making fun of people who try to be funny and instead exonerating themselves from any real pressure to be funny because hey I'm here to make the comics laugh I'm a Comics comic right well the real comics are comics comment like Dave Chappelle's a Comics comic but he kills the audience too right because he's real he's got over the full package where there's a lot of comics that bomb in front of the audience but you'll have like 20 guys in the back of the room to think it's cool to chuckle at obscure references and very bizarre words that get used in some sort of strange way that would be sort of like that right because he just follow his references takes you like a flowchart of 20 pages long right I talked to noir McDonald about him once was really funny yeah you know he's not really that smart has really know those words I go why yeah yeah yeah that's crazy he just finds their words it people don't know and he uses them and people laugh even though they don't know what he's talking about so someone played a joke on him once where they use some reference they use some reference on Dennis Miller that they made up Oh was dom i rera used a reference on Dennis Miller that he's made up and Dennis started laughing at it even though it wasn't real cuz it was like something had to be like cool - no I'll get Dom to remember the story but he was like you know he's like he was I fucked him with his own thing I tricked him with his own trick you know he's just used a reference that isn't real yeah yeah and he just yeah because people don't like to be on the outside like people don't like to say what the fuck does that mean right I'm a big fan of saying what does that mean yeah cuz I doesn't look I'm at nine hundred plus podcast with 700 people way fucking smarter than me so like I have to say I don't know what that means like you gotta be I mean but there's a weird thing where people don't like to they equate not having information with somehow another being less intelligence which is a really bizarre thing because like it's okay if you're talking to someone about something that you couldn't possibly have data on like you know whatever a video game right that you don't play like what's it about like how's it go like that's okay that's fine but as soon as it's something about like some sort of cultural reference or perhaps a book that maybe you should have in English as you to admit that I don't know that's a weird damn you know it's a weird thing to be somehow another you to feel diminished by information or a lot but it's so funny that you say this because in my classes the students will oftentimes ask me a question that has me stumped and I will usually answer you know what I actually don't know the answer could you send me an email so I could look it up and they are really impressed by that honesty as impressive hell yeah so I hear you yeah it's about takes humility I guess yeah on the other hand when I know something I come out with the bravado of I know my shit right right so so have the have the humility to know what you know and what you don't know as the old saying says well you have that we would say bravado it's like a pride of hard work I mean usually accumulate adamm a savant of knowledge of see from seeking this knowledge and studying very hard so it's something that you should be proud of thank you but it's not something that you look at like when you're proud of it you're not diminishing other people that don't have that information you're saying like this is what I know to be true and this is a fact this is undeniable right but that's a beautiful thing that you could also say I don't know that's something that you don't know right that will give the people that are listening that would give them so much more of a sense of respect for you adventure then horse shitting around and pretending that's such a weird thing that people do and by the way the media oftentimes they want you to weigh in on things as a scientist which you don't feel that your area of expertise would allow you to and they get frustrated because then they feel as though you're equivocating but look I'm sorry I'm not willing to make that statement with that level of certainty but they want it because that's what the headline has to say yeah and then they get frustrated that you're tippy-toeing but I'm just being humble about what is true and what I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough to say it's true yeah I've had people get upset at me about talking about upcoming martial arts fights because I don't give predictions I very very very rarely give predictions unless there's some gross mismatch that really shouldn't be happening in the first place because you really have no idea what's going to happen there's a high likelihood that something might happen if I look at the way one guy moves versus another guy moves and I go into my database of experiences of seeing a lot of live competition and knowing what one person is capable of I can make Seiken make a statement with reasonable certainty but I don't know if they were injured in training I don't know if they come into the fight sick I don't know if they're breaking up with their girlfriend I don't know if they got staph infection two weeks before the fighting they're on antibiotics there's so many variables I don't know if they might get head-butted like we talked about earlier or they might have an injury like in the middle of the fight like something goes wrong and their knee blows out there's so many variables has the thing between the boxer and the MMA guy happen yet a thing see this is I love when someone I know I love that though but I know I'm not criticizing you but I love when someone is so far removed but they're still aware of something that's like a big cultural event no it takes place August 26 I think even I'm an unbelievable novice when it comes to this stuff I think I could make a prediction here in front of your huge podcast that the MMA guy is gonna get trashed correct I would imagine that most likely he is going to lose a boxing match to the best boxer that has ever so what's the point of this fight just for my name thing if you wanted to see a figure skater play hockey against Wayne Gretzky okay so why would the MMA guy put himself up for that potential humiliation my dad Chetta dolla dolla bills y'all been on your show no he has not I fucked up I should have had him on back before he blew up he's too big now I refer to him as Conrad last time or something right well yeah something like that his name's Conor Conor McGregor yeah aye it's him he's a real meteoric entity and like the most meteoric in all of combat sports he became so famous so quick and for because he's a real unicorn in a lot of ways he's got so many different things that going for him handsome guy brutal knockout artist predicts two outcomes and pulls them off and and has been incredibly successful in a short period of time one two world titles in two different weight classes and is arguably the greatest trash talker ever he trash talks better than anybody is that right yeah there's actually a big thing that's going on today right the press conference actually I'm reading the thing they're scalping tickets outside of it for 40 bucks right now to my 40 it's a free was free oh my nephew's probably all over that stuff right probably yeah yeah it's it's um it's the press conference itself will be a show because this guy is so good at getting people riled up and talking shit and that's half the fun like I was too young to appreciate the Muhammad Ali days but I would imagine that like when Muhammad Ali was challenging Sonny Liston like half of the fun was Muhammad Ali talking shit like this guy's crazy that's exactly the mechanism when I take on some random person online and I just have fun with it sometimes people misunderstand this to be I'm getting pissed where I'm just have I'm just doing bantering I'm usually doing this with a smile on my face but they think of it as though I'm but I'm just trash-talking them yeah yeah it's a weird thing man it's like engaging with people you don't know it sometimes that person is insane and then they'll make it a career to go after god sad all day long it's like it's interacting with people in text form is very problematic right it's like a lot of issues you don't you don't get social cues you can't adjust you can't you know like in our conversation we're kind of going back and forth and you say something and I react to it and we laugh and we see each other all that's missing when you're writing things you know they show especially if someone like writes a blog about you if somebody listens to what you've said on this podcast and they write a blog about you defining you he is a man that does this his whole career is this and you read it like Sam Harris was just explaining something to me that someone did about him and I read it I was like wow this is a weird way to describe and interact with a person you've never even met credible to write a one-sided thing where you don't even know the guy you don't really know him like really know them like you know you've you've seen some videos and that you would muster such animus towards a person that you haven't met right I mean I I'm fortunate enough to not have too many of these you know haters and trolls but there is one or two guys that have come to my attention that it seems as though they spend 90% of their day doing heat rash stuff about me and you think what could it be that I could so trigger in them that they would construe it as a valuable use of their time to take on someone whom they've never even met but somehow they're pissed at you and they think it's a worthwhile cause to trash-talk you all day well it's a weird thing like even if they have a valid point that becomes some sort of weird symbiotic / parasitic relationship with the person that you're criticizing like you are inexorably connected to them they are your enemy you think about them all the time and by virtually that you become part of them right or they become part of you like their that's a weird thing about thinking right like when you're on stage and you are giving a lecture one of the more amazing things that happens when someone is on stage talking about something is you allow them to kind of think for you in the sense that when you are and that's one of the reasons why it's so important to be articulate and so important to be very aware of what you're going to say in advance the point where comes out smoothly and there's good entertainment value to it is that it's pleasing to listen to if you're aware of how annoying certain speech patterns can be and you avoid those you're aware of how compelling other speech patterns can be you embrace those and so it makes it pleasing for the person to listen to so they can just sit back and listen to you talk about evolutionary psychology whereas when a person sucks at it it's like grading it's painful it gets in your head you're not connected with them you're not allowing them to think about for you right there's there's that that happens with comedy too like when someone's really good like you see like a great comic like a louis c.k or someone like that when he's on stage and he's he's really in the groove you're kind of allowing him to think for you right you're like letting him take the reins of your imagination and your mind and your visualization but boy it must be a tough job because I always think what if you just had a fight with your wife I've had that before and you're pissed right but in 10 minutes I don't give a shit about your fight you have to perform right what kind of comedy you have like if you're Sam Kinison it's probably better cuz you ain't go on stage like you would go on stage probably angry pumped I mean it really depends on what you're trying to do it also depends on like what the fight was about whether or not you were wrong or she was wrong I would be way better off going on stage if someone wronged me versus if I wronged them like if I wronged someone you feeling guilty yeah intrusive thoughts in your head remorse and yeah just in and then re-examining your own behavior patterns and finding fault in them and just fine that's that's the last thing I ever want to do is like treat someone wrong and then go on stage but if someone treated me like shit and then one on stage I probably feel exonerated you know I'd feel like I'd feel I probably energized you know I'm just like very interesting I'm not sure how much time we have left think we're done it's - we did three hours it's very next time we'll talk about cuz you mentioned I guess it's related to regret yes we'll talk about the psychology of regret psychology of regret Oh smart exam all right always a pleasure my friend thank
