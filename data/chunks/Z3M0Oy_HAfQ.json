and will Harris your life man this is you're on the other side of the camera now let me give you an introduction our people don't know will is the man behind anatomy of the fighter if you ever seen any of those videos like particularly the most famous one was when Conor McGregor threw that dolly at the bus with khabib nurmagomedov was on it and it became a huge part of the promotion which I thought was weird that it was this shameful act right that he did that I mean really awful cut a bunch of innocent people that were on the bus but they used it over and over and over again that was your foot yes a lot of people didn't even know including me no one did you know I was telling a friend other day what's funny no one has ever heard this but when it happened a show could be at the back of the bus because he was had a smile on his face and I showed him and everybody else on the bus that I actually caught kind of doing it because they didn't really know it was Connor right so I remember could be looked at the footage I was holding the camera and he was like brother you could get paid from this yes like bro this is worth $100,000 he looked at his manager ollie a shout-out to javi and he was like get just get him give him some money he deserves this and then I gave it to the UFC to use for embed it and I thought it was that was just sit and they promoted the fight with it I was like damn I should have just leaned my head to the right and got hit by the dolly so I not have to be doing it you know go fun means and shit well what he should have done is asked for money for it that video footage was it turned out it was very valuable because it set up the fight which also set up the post fight brawl I mean there was there was so much that was involved in him throwing that dolly and you caught that video they played that shit over and over and over I was actually kind of shocked that they did that because at the time we like woke I might go to jail like that was that was like legitimate assault they used it the next day I was like damn I WI I mean when I saw them like when I saw it on Fox News and CNN I was just like that's my footage yeah you know because you know when you building us like a channel or a series like that you think oh this is my moment every everybody a moment yeah and unfortunately the UFC promoted it shout out to them because they've been nothing but good to me I can't say anything I still wish I would have got something from it you should have got something fun pull this my god just get it up there ya know you do a fantastic job I mean you really do and I like I said until that video footage came out I didn't know that you weren't even a part of the UFC's promotion team I didn't know I thought maybe WME had hired you and this is another thing they're working on I did not know that you were independent well what was crazy is that I started it almost two years ago um I was just sitting at home in Florida I was living in South Florida and I was I was hanging out with the guys at the black zillions at Jaakko I had stumbled over there one day at the gym and I seen it when I was grocery shopping and I just stopped in I mean I was doing stuff with Shannon Briggs let's go champ let's go check I was going to the heavy weight Factory you would have you do all those I wasn't doing the videos what happened was I reached out to him and he invited me to the heavy weight Factory Holyfield was there everybody and I just went there a few times and I created some creative videos for him feel still working out he was when I was there I seen he still looks good he does many like what crazy 650 some nice 50 years I got some amazing stories about like that I've never released about Tyson fight like crazy things like his stuff yeah well initially Anatomy fighting was just supposed to be a documentary that was it and I was that was it just a hour-long documentary I never knew who a kabhi was and nothing like I just didn't know I knew Michael Johnson all these guys because there was at the black zillions so I knew the first day I ever went in the gym like Michael Chandler Kumar whose mine shout-out to Kumar who's my cuz I the first time I ever saw him I thought he was a bum what cuz Michael Cheerilee gave it to him and I got it on camera and I don't shower was the stud right and then it was that all he won the ultimate fighter things like that so that was almost two years ago yeah Johnny was a bum ya just I saw tough day in the gym it was sparring it was this barn so I mean I'm going around filming people and then I just turned to the caging like Michael Chandler just dropped him with like a low shot in there Michael Charlie like walking around him like I created this film called the portrait of the Blackzilians that was like the first thing I ever made because it was Glenn Robinson r.i.p to him and Tyrone Spong that really pushed me to do MMA they saw the stuff that I did with Shannon bricks and they called me into the office that same day that I gave whoever the manager was at Jocko the footage and Glenn just said listen we need this type of work in MMA like this is high quality stuff and our own spawn was boxing so I knew he was probably loving the footage with Shannon Briggs because he in boxing and that's after he broke his leg against coach yeah sake and he decided to just go straight to box so he you know tyrone he's very persuasive and he was like hey hey this we need this in the gym so they gave me a pass to go to a spar and day and really work out with them and yeah there it is right there but uh yeah that's how it happened and I just kept going to the gym every day put that back up just okay yeah that's the first thing I ever filmed in my life called the portrait of the Blackzilians and that shot of Michael Chandler our Peter Jordan Parsons that was a fighter that you know died after getting hit by a car but that's the first thing I ever filmed for Anatomy on fire that was the sparring match and yeah that was it and from there everything was born um I still was like focusing on doing like a documentary until I moved to Vegas like a summer after that during a Conor McGregor in a Floyd Mayweather fight I just wanted I felt like I needed to move to Vegas because the energy was taking me there and I felt like oh if I'm gonna do a documentary I might as well be in Vegas where a lot of fighters is this is a giant shift for you right so what were you filming before two years ago well at the black zillions before that like I have a wedding business so I was doing weddings my big black ass is doing weddings which is funny I go to these weddings and people cuz we'll sit down was gigantic totally six five so he's towered over all these people oh and there I really thought like man my life is miserable at one point I was like I'm just shooting Eva yeah after a while like you win a ward in another ward in another award and it's all based off reviews right it was like man I got I got to do something more than and so I did like basketball documentaries in Italy I lit I lived in Italy for a minute I went to China I did a basketball documentary there cuz that's my background basketball but after that I was just like man what what else can I do and I literally just stumble I saw the gym one day Jocko and I was like that's where doesn't Blackzilians train and I went over there and that's how all this walked in know martial arts training nothing I just saw the gym and I was like that's Jocko I know the black xilians trainer so I went in there like midday nobody was in there and I just said listen I'm a filmmaker I would love to film some of these fighters and that's cool for that yeah so I went to college at University of Southern Indiana in Evansville on a basketball scholarship I was a top senior in America coming out of high school and I went to this top division to school after I've tried to wait my senior year to get some division offers if people know like Division one is the top level of basketball at the end Division two is right under that probably not now but back then it was and I went Bruce Pearl was my coach he was very persuasive to get me to come to the University he coaches that are Byrne now they just went to the Final Four this year if you know anything about basketball but I played in my first year and then going into my second year I tore my ACL and uh my life was over all I knew was basketball if anybody know anything about Carbondale it's about 25,000 people people don't leave that town it's kind of a miserable you know thing I think like the average household median income there's like sixteen thousand a year for families yeah like so you come from the bottom did you get it repaired yeah so I had surgery I had to redshirt so when you're in college and you sit out of your racer so one day I was dating this girl and she was going to Walmart and she literally was just like ah you want to come to Walmart with me and I was like yeah I had some Pell grant money and I was addicted to the remember to MTV show road rules in real world yeah I used to be addicted to that stuff so I used to watch it all the time and I went to Walmart that day and bought a camera that was my Sony Handycam the one used to put little mini DVDs in and that was the birth I literally my life changed soon as I bought that camera and I was like Alma just filmed my rehab and come back more ferocious and all I was doing was like filming girls at parties long shit like that literally for four years I had a camera every day so you just stopped playing basketball no I fucking I continued to play basketball I came back a year after my red shirt I finish it one of the top five scorers in school history and university history top four rebounds all-time leader in field goal percentage all-american in my senior year we went to the national championship played on national TV everything after that was done I wasn't the same player after I told my AC I can just submit that like I was this high-flying super freak athletic 45 inch vertical type of player too I couldn't do that anymore so I had to adjust my game what was wrong I don't know maybe I just you know it was different back in 2001 right the stars yeah for surgery and got the patellar tendon patella yep that's and they don't do that anymore they still do they do yeah George st. Pierre had that done yeah they do that sometimes because they think that the patellar tendon I had it done in 90 no yeah 93 I had it on this leg and then this one I had the cadaver which is way easier yeah cadavers like a six-month rehab and I was back to jujitsu a hundred percent I was always like slightly knock kneed right and it's like that surgery made my left knee even more knock and it's like that's why I was telling Jamie like I need that because I feel like I need to like strengthen my yeah yeah this crazy roller thing with nothing called young Jimmy roll sorry yeah I need something like that thing Jamie's showing everybody there yeah it's crazy have you clamp that thing down your thigh it didn't seem that good for my my cowboy you were like standing on you got like you can't have any time but your thigh it seems like it would be a lot of pressure cuz it's for sure like a spring get a thicker your muscle yeah it's like it's hot I don't know how much weight is pushing on it but it's a lot it's good and you could also push with this I sure yeah you can it's a call then our eighth roll recovery it's like medic it said medical grade on the box I was like okay great like weed yeah I feel like I need that to like wake up my left leg still to this day also two two decades later did you go through rehab and everything and I did I did all that didn't work so listen I recovered fine like my college career was totally fine you just didn't feel assisted honestly I lost the love of basketball honestly after filling girls that's all I had in my life was basketball so once that was gone even when I came back I wasn't the same so even though I had games where I was 25 points 15 rebounds like it's great games winning all these awards all regional I it just wasn't there anymore and I had this camera that I love to just have because that year off I was able like my first ever film I ever did was I went around campus and filmed like girls acts from who the hot as a fleece was felt like they gave me power I gave me powered like just to be able to because back then that's when girls gone wild was popular oh wow yeah that was 2000 John Wow that man girls going walk Doug Stanhope hosted that at one point in time yeah that's funny but so I graduated college in 2004 and I moved to Phoenix with my best friend mr. organic and he was out there just living and I wanted to get out of my little town so I went out there and I kind of wanted to like take a year off and then try to play professional basketball because you either play in the NBA or you go overseas to play basketball so I went to Phoenix with no idea of what I was gonna do in my life and I literally start working at a call center Merritt uh it was uh what was that old phone company that went out of business I can't remember what it was called but uh I used to just call people collect and try to get him to sign up for long-distance and you get caught like I got caught every word in the book everyday but it was funny like people's calling you the n-word and everything and you just laughing because they bad right and then you like convinced I'm like 90 year old lady to sign up for loan this is known as illegal as hell like you just convince convincing his lady to sign up for long distance but I was good at it I was good at it so that was like my first job I ever had in my life so it's like one of them shady phone they call you up like I get those robo calls yes cause you did that like do you want unlimited long distance do you feel guilty a little bit but they went out of business like six months after I had the job okay and from there I just didn't know what I was gonna do and I had a he's not my cousin but he's like somebody we all call our cousins like black people we call everybody got cousins but he played in the NBA his name was Troy Hudson and he was from my town so he was like the most successful person that ever got out of our town he was um you know playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves and I reached out to him because I basically was like listen man I need help cuz I want to play basketball again but I don't know how I'm gonna I don't have an agent I don't have anything so he kind of invited us up to Minneapolis that's the first time I live literally from Evansville Phoenix to Minneapolis to try to pursue this whole basketball career and I did that for like three years like chasing it going to tryouts things like that sending tapes to agents and things like that and it just didn't pan out nothing stuck you know I had opportunities that I just wasn't the same player and I can admit that and I'm comfortable with that because I know I had a successful basketball career just didn't go to the level of where I made millions of dollars so after that man I was literally stuck after traveling around the world I ended up in Malaysia I was in Australia trying to procedure you don't want to know how I ended up over I do want to know man this is funny only a few people know this story so when you at your bottom you try to find something for comfort I've never done weed or anything in my life but I was addicted to like online dating back there yes I was like trying to meet girls like just to try to far have some situation I felt like I feel income so let me like online date or whatever and I met this girl like one of my friends in Phoenix play basketball in Kuala Lumpur so obviously you need a visa to go over there so I'm thinking to myself like what's that the way I could get over there to Kuala Lumpur and try to play basketball so I was like online data only you remember what website or C you're a good looking guy I know how are you not getting girls in America I do but I'm just saying I was just listen my point was I literally met this girl in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia she was from Canada she was the singer over there singing in little military bars or whatever little hot blonde or whatever she was and I remember talking to her for about a month and I convinced her that I wanted to come visit her but my whole intention was let me get over there try to find out what this team is and see if I could like try out for him some crazy shit you don't do that today I did it back then so I went over there to I'm laughs because I know people that know me is dying listening it right now this is a true 100% story I get over there to Malaysia with no money I may have four hundred dollars I got people to pay for a ticket here I'm going to Malaysia to play basketball just lying to people right so I get over there this girl I only want to say her name she might sue me uh-huh but she picked me up at the airport she look exactly like her pictures beautiful from Canada everything so she take me to her apartment she got this nice apartment it's like in a jungle Cho like I'm talking about the balcony I seen like little monkeys on a balcony oh yes it was crazy and then it's like a rain forest right and then in Malaysia if you ever been to Malaysia I don't know if it's like there now the doors are high off the ground like two inches so it's like anything can crawl under the doors or whatever so that's the first thing I noticed when I got to Malaysia I was like this is some crazy shit right we're in the jungle and adult-like what about snakes or bugs I remember actually these little kids when I first got to Malaysia I was like have you ever seen a snake like in this area he was like yeah I've seen a cobra and all this stuff and I was like holy shit but the back to her she turned out to be a sex addict yeah congratulations man listen yeah this is crazy like because this is way before I ever decided to I'm gonna do film for a living right I was over there the first day I got there like I had a good time with it did not you know ended up having relations with the lady and she turned out to be a sex addict so you know as a man I just flew all the way across the world to see this girl sleep with her and then all of a sudden she want to do it again and again and again and then when you like slowed down like you know I just got hit bro she started crying and going nuts and I'm in Malaysia I'm like I'll know who this girl is oh no listen she's crying cuz you won't fuck her yes how many times you fucker about two times I had she wanted yeah - long time still late but it's crazy so listen I am in Malaysia this I'm not in America I'm in Malaysia so what the crazy thing is probably after a week she started to go crazy and complain about I'm not sleeping with their mo I'm in my I'm in my prime my sexual peak and you don't want to sleep with me and I'm just thinking of myself like I don't know what the fuck am i doing over here in Malaysia like what this lady so I ended up meeting this black guy that she introduced me to there was like a hustler in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and I start hanging out with him just to get out of the house any money to go home oh my god with this beautiful girl that you have to fuck all the time yep first of all problems right serious person she started getting even bitter like I hate Americans you Americans are so ungrateful and I'm just thinking like damn wow you're representing America yeah it was crazy I was like damn I must have just didn't do it good enough right well maybe she's just extraordinary she was like in our late 30s and I was in my early 20s so some girls in her late 30s they hit this pitch epeak man just like oh she's she you know kicked me out her house in Malaysia Joe like I went out with Bobby one night this dude his name was Bobby too and I came home and she said um your stuff is outside like she texted me I had a little international phone she liked your stuff is outside I'm thinking like she was like yeah this is not working out so think about that imagine being in another country and this is not working out no money no money zero oh not a dime and I got it I was worried I told him what happened he was like I'm gonna take you over to get your stuff he could stay with me until you figure it out I get there and all my stuff is outside everything she's not there she was done left or whatever and I had some brand-new timberlands remember the boots toeffler hi I'm Porsche ed I need them timberlands they in the house I had more on brand new so I kicked the door down no no yes like I was trying to get in the door I just kicked it and it broke like the little halo broke I got in got my timberlands left I remember she text me she was like hey did you break my door I was like no no what you talking about I just left so from there I was I stayed with Bobby for like three weeks in Malaysia I was hanging out with him every day going to parties and I'm like Brock I to get home to America so I contacted my one of my mentors growing up in Australia he was playing professional basketball in Melbourne her name was shot Tucker shoutout to him and I convinced him to get me a ticket to come over to Melbourne because I was like bro I need some money to go home he's like no I mean I just get you a ticket to come to Melbourne I was like bro literally like I'm trying to go back to America I don't know what to but then when he sold me on I was like damn I really ain't going back to nothing so let me go he was I mean you can come over here and try out for the team you can try practice with us and I was like oh that may be my opportunity to play professional basketball he's one of the top players in Australia so I ended up in Melbourne and I was in Melbourne for three months not doing shit but going out practicing with the team there was mid season so I couldn't like make a team because they was already you know they think and then I end up getting stranded over there too because he left me because he cheated on his girlfriend and he had to go make up with her so he left me talking about imma be back and then I was just stuck in Australia like yo bro I need to get back to a man job no job no money nothing oh my he was like I'm glad I was young when I did all this stuff he was like Amy and tell her tell one of them girls a sob story did get you a I'm like a sob story bro you have money buy me a ticket to go home man I can't do it right now I'm like man so I had to tell this girl a sob story her name was deanna deanna kai saw I'm giving her a shout-out because she saved my life she bought me a ticket home she she went in her savings and bought me a ticket back from Melbourne to Honolulu to Las Vegas and I didn't know why I chose Las Vegas but I just chose to go to Las Vegas so you literally has zero money zero Mirage Oh how are you eating shit her people that I was around right they just fed you yeah man sometimes you have angels in your life yeah and I guess these people were angels too because that's what I was just telling Jamie like I just seen a documentary on homelessness it was like four out of five people in LA County paycheck to paycheck I think it was like eight like or as four out of five people are like one $400 emergency from being broke or it was like 80% of people live paycheck to paycheck so I always tell people like when I'm inspiring people now I'm like bro I was homeless once because that's essentially homelessness yeah if you ain't got an address you can't pay bills you're homeless yeah no matter if you got a roof over your head and I think I feel like people you see all these beautiful moments that I do now or what anybody does does and they don't see the story that ultimately led you like what what ultimately turned to you doing what you're doing now so after Australia I went to Vegas I was living with two strippers yes I live with two stripper gratulations yeah yeah I lived in Vegas with two strippers that worked at the Rhino the Spearmint Rhino I met him on Craigslist for rooms to rent Jesus Christ even I had enough money like six hundred dollars to move into a room so I literally moved in with these girls and one day have you ever been into Vegas casinos because this is like the climax you ever seen like the mega bucks your slots sure so one day it was Floyd Mayweather versus Oscar De La Hoya so that was the year I was in the Mirage and I've seen these two hot black girls and I had like some money in my pocket cut honey to something so I wanted to sit down next to him so I went over there and sat next to him I was just you know trying to shoot the shit and I put a $20 in on the slots because you know you can get free drinks if you put in a slot so I just hitting it talking to him where y'all from you're going to fight blah blah blah and then one of the girls was like hey you want and I was like okay you know you're thinking winning those slots guess how much I wanted how much nine thousand dollars whoa swear to God nine thousand dollars to somebody broke Wow yes nine thousand dollars so let me give you that do you pay taxes on it later yeah am I wrong social security number - you getting the wrong sir yeah I gave the wrong yeah because they just actually Anam you in Social Security number oh okay maybe you shouldn't just told everybody that Fallon they can't prove that I want anything they can't that was like 12 years ago they didn't have records back then I don't think so oh not me to me nobody can watch this nobody's watching this this is no why's nothing so after that I literally lived off that 9 grand for about the rest of the summer and uh I ended up moving to San Diego after that like I'm skipping some stuff but I moved to San Diego and that's when my life changed because I lived in San Diego and was just partying what brought you to San Diego I met a guy in Vegas during the night at the Floyd Mayweather fight and just party with him that night and I just got his phone number one time and then I was just you know staying in touch with them whatever and then he was like I live in San Diego he's in the Navy doctor bill and I literally said let me come out there one weekend I was like let me just come out there and kick it with you or whatever cuz he was telling me how great San Diego was and I went out there and I didn't leave for four years San Diego is pretty awesome yeah I love San Diego but I essentially was doing the same thing I was doing for the past couple years lost because it you gotta understand like athletes go through this now like I just did I just released the episode where Ryan Bader on my channel and I talked to him about that like when when your sports career is done a lot of people go to something else they lost and things like that and I was for about four or five years and it wasn't until I lived in San Diego that I figured I was like man I gotta really do something with my life I'm literally a failure I got a I have a college degree I graduated from college so it wasn't like I just didn't want that responsibility of having to do a nine-to-five oh and things like that so it wasn't until I live in San Diego that I literally talked to the guy that I was living with him was like bro I don't know what I'm gonna do in my life bro but I gotta figure something out I was like nearing 30 and I ended up moving to Minneapolis back to Minneapolis and I got a job as a teacher like a teacher's assistant they called it behavior assistant I was like working with kindergarten kids she's literally crazy life right what a crazy life end up where I meant now to be on Joe Rogan right so it it was March 3rd to 2011 it was like negative 20 degrees outside I was living with my guy my best friend and I went to work that day and it was freezing outside and they literally still went to recess that day I'll never forget that it was like Oh put your coats and gloves on kids it's time to go to to recess and I was like what do you mean we go into gym or outside it's like we're going outside I was like man these people in Minnesota class is hard those are hard people bro that was the last day I ever worked in my life he said fuck this I can't do it man I was lying outside now whether it was just the fact that I was like what am I doing with my life I'm working with Kenneth the great rewarding job I'm like what uh it's nothing wrong with me right I'm physically able to do anything I'm intelligent enough to do anything I'm qualified enough to do anything you're a victim of circumstance they must just kept happening things kept happening and a lot of it is my fault like because you're just lazy right so March 3 2011 is the day I said I'm quitting my job I went back to my apartment with my roommate he was pissed he was like bro you always quitting jobs he was like bro what you do I was like girl I'm finna figure something out I'm finna buy camera do something he was like yeah yeah whatever and

something out i Pell Grant was coming up I was getting my tax returns back and I had enough to buy a camera and the first camera I ever bought was a Canon t2i it was like eight hundred dollars and I bought a lens and I was it that was it it changed my life and I literally spent like the next year shooting videos in garages like cars coming up filming the wheels and I was just really literally honing myself because back then when I had a camera in college digital cameras weren't even out until 2008 like these little new style cameras so I had to relearn everything and I relearned a lot from YouTube and Vimeo and I was watching the I had a creative eye and a mindset so I was just like I got to get the skill set so I started doing rap videos for $50 $100 free you know I tell all these kids they message me now like bro I spent two years on videos for free just trying to learn how to do the stuff everybody want to get paid for something and I'm like you probably don't deserve to get paid yet so I I have friends shoutout to Mac Irv mr. organic like I was shooting a videos for free and I was just getting better I was getting better and better and better and better and in like three years in tour I shot a music video called Saks Fifth Avenue and so you're editing these as well I'm adding them doing the multi editing on at the time I was editing on Sony Vegas hmm a whole program

me the laptop and I get to Sony Vegas program and then I started editing with that and I had that camera for about two years I was no girl I don't know just a lot of that in my life and I'll blame girls listen yeah I used to be one of those guys you know them dumb girls this materialistic and they all about nice things and he liked to travel or you're a data girl and you like see her previous boyfriend and they'd be like damn they don't went to like Napa Valley and in Vegas for her birth or New York Russia you like damn I can't even take you to the movies I'm like Tim so for me if a girl get tired of you now they call it ghosting right they'll call it ghosty but back then ghosts and that's what ghosting was it was like I this guy ain't worth nothing let me get rid of him so she left she left I had a summer job my last ever official job was at forty three hoops in Minnesota as a basketball academy where I was daring with a lot of pro basketball players or semi-pro or gods that had college experience and we just taught kids all the time and I was getting paid you know $20 an hour $25 an hour per session to teach kids and I kind of made a ruckus there too complaining about this bro we teaching twenty kids and I'm only getting $20 how much are y'all getting for all these kids right but I mean that's just work right I shouldn't complain about a job but that whole summer I was just telling everybody in there I'm trying to do film I'm moving back to California I'm about to just do film about to do film cuz I had enough like I was doing videos at that point but now I have a part-time job that I'm able to do videos and I never forget one day I was telling a group of guys in there I'm quitting his job and I'm trying to go do filming I just remember the look on a face like you know like the boy that cried wolf whatever man you ain't gonna do anything but that drove me insane Joe doubt doubt drove he was out and people doubted me that's what I needed I needed that fuel where people could tell me I couldn't do any needed haters I needed haters it drove me insane and I went nuts and I started shooting a lot of music videos that any videographer out there that knows this industry they know like music videos feed you you make a lot of money it's a recession-proof business people always gonna need music videos especially rap videos and I got good I got very good I did a lot of high profile videos I made a lot of money who'd you do them for I did a music videos for like rappers a lot like Chief Keef you know yeah yes you did his videos yeah that seems like you'd have to wear a bulletproof vest to be around that there was a video called traffic you gotta check that out okay I think I've seen that yes thank you wild on the street so I would imagine wow they're legitimately wild yeah that was real gangsta shit going on with ya cago rappers and stuff like that well that dude is like the king of that shit right yeah there's only like 20 right I think now is 20 nah he probably like twenty three twenty four now yeah there was kids man but I was shooting a lot of music videos in Minneapolis and and I got popular because that's a huge music scene it's a very indie you know prints made it popular but I think the hip-hop scene is very enriched there that they just don't they haven't had anybody like explode out of there so I made a living just in Minneapolis like shooting music videos but after a while I remember I was dating this girl and this one lasted a bit and I remember I used to brag to her like look at this music video this music video and she was like you want to just be known for doing music videos you want to be a guy to just do music videos you need to do other stuff and that's what woke me up I was like let me see if I can tap into my creative side and do other things so I did like a film called like the confessions of Skid Row I would literally went to skid row and filmed homeless people oh wow yep and I was that available yeah if somewhere on the line oh my girl freaks me out yeah it was called the confessions Skid Row and then I did it was I was like I'm gonna make this this series called the confessions and then I did the confessions the Gay Pride and I literally interviewed this guy and San Diego about how when Obama passed Don't Ask Don't Tell like I interviewed this guy and he told me how he came out to his parents and I'm like I know my boys just look at me like what the hell are you doing like right these type of films but I was fascinated by documentaries so I thought let me just do this type of documentary content doing the one on Skid Row did that have like an extra impact on you because you were basically home yeah 100% I told I told the guy I was like I was literally homeless so I know what you feel like mmm and I don't think people understand it like if I look at my life now I live in downtown LA view of the Staples Center things like that like they don't understand years ago I didn't how I couldn't afford to live in a $400 a month apartment you saying I'm saying cuz you didn't have any guaranteed income and that's how I was even the beginning of my film career I lived out it like you know them shitty hotels why are they not shitty to everybody but like extended stays yeah I live in extended stays for like two years literally like I say I was getting a four hundred dollars for a music video from a rapper or something like that I would use 200 and that for six days in extended stay cuz you know it was like thirty dollars a night mm-hmm it would be nights where I'm like damn I got one day left I got to convince somebody to give me like $200 to shoot a music video solves hustling like reaching out to people on Facebook amen you try to shoot a music video you trying they not knowing I need this money to just live somewhere Wow so once I was able to sustain enough income because it's just too long of a story but I was able to really get myself to a point where I was making some money I moved to Florida when my best friend tone from Macedonia six foot nine Macedonian mercenary that's what he want to be like he a crazy guy like he wants to like go around the world and kill like drug dealers that's literally he from Macedonia man that crazy man that crazy so brother tone I moved in with him in Boca Raton and that's literally has started that's how all it is said that email fighters stuff started I moved to Florida live with him I had a roommate so it was cheaper to live I went to Italy that year and shot a documentary so I got some money from my god Bobby Jones and I was able to have a life I felt comfortable I wasn't like felt like a monkey was on my back at that point you get momentum I got momentum I had a lot of momentum at that plant about 2014 I was making money so when you were doing these documentaries like confessions at Skid Row in confessions at Gay Pride like what are you doing with them and how are you getting paid from just releasing them online for free really and then I didn't get paid for anything I paid I paid like I pay like the home is God I let you talk YouTube they gotta be on Vimeo there guys why don't you put them on YouTube and get the ad revenue from yeah that was back in the data are you but there are they out there right now yeah okay no I have a great one if you know Alan Watts yes so I it's called the beauty of nothingness by Alan Watson if you put the beauty of nothingness by Alan Watson will Harris you'll see one of the most beautiful homeless films you ever seen that was like three years ago I went to New York I was here in LA I was in Florida I was just sitting on the streets my homeless people talking to him for for two days and is it Alan was narration yep he's the beauty of nothingness it like won an award in New York well when I first saw I don't remember what video I saw of yours that was first but I was like this guy's got an eye for shit you you it's not the Stan you know sometimes you could see videos and you're just watching a video like okay this is cool I'm seeing how these guys are training I'm seeing their life style is I'm seeing you know their family but then you see one and you go oh whoever the fuck is filming us they know what they're doing yeah that's what I got from you well that's cuz I look at all the shit I've been through yeah you see that's also yeah your focus yeah like you you you have a vision like it's very clear that you're an artist like when you're doing these videos it's not simply you're filming things like you're thinking about yeah about the angles how to edit it what what you know how to have people talking or you hear their voice while their mouths not moving because they're talking from another you know I'm saying yeah then we need a narration yeah when you see things that where someone puts it together and like it makes it richer makes it more interesting and did you ever hear of a documentary called hoop dreams yes it was uh that was my high school life like they were older than me but when I was in high school that film came out that fascinated me and I was like documentary documenting somebody for five years followed a life I was obsessed and then my favorite documentary of all time is pumping iron oh of course so when I saw it in college I was like I want to shoot documentaries so I was you always obsessed with documentaries like oh no if you remember Ben you remember banging in Little Rock yes yes yes banging a little although that's what I like I don't like movies I like documented me too so for me I've always was obsessed with docks I'm like if I can ever shoot a dock I know where that passion comes from so when I literally moved to Florida like I literally just reached out to Shannon Briggs one day I was like because I was doing weddings and music videos sobs making money especially with weddings I was make a lot of money with weddings cuz that's just I mean people get married every weekend right right so I mean you can get and if you get good enough you can get three four thousand dollars a wedding video so I mean I'm booking two a week I started to get to a point where I'm let's go Chad that's one it yeah that's the one of him that's the one so that was that was three years ago ever see the podcast I did was yeah of course yeah here's court called portrait of a boxing gym yeah so like who is the God Deonte water knocked out Berber main stir vain yes the burster me it's the Verne yeah that was I remember he was in there that day so I used to do stuff like this before I ever decided to do Anatomy if I say Who daunted Deontay Wilder knocked out you gotta say everybody fought yeah that's true forty knockouts 41 upon craziest fucking recognize in theory too well basically in seconds yeah no you didn't get that's my drink listen if you ask me who my dream guest is on anatomy of a fighter Deonte one I would love to do a behind-the-scenes fight companion with you guys just being here with the camera filming y'all motherfuckers talking but what that's what the fight companion is no no no but out in the hallways on right is Eddie Bravo bring up here buddy some crazy seasons well hopefully hopefully I get any Bravo on the day sheet over yeah you get him on yeah Cheetos fight is canceled right I know so they trying to give him a replacement opponent I was hoping he showed up the cheeto Vera yeah he loved your show bot I love him he tough motherfucker he is he it was a lot love sugar shine a lot of old I love how you taking it - yeah he'd taken it because you know I've seen a lot of people online talking about you know already gonna move the card to enter home now I'm doing that for sugar Sean no no he got a you got a tainted supplement yeah it's it's these new studies are these new tests that they have they are so fucking extensive they catch shit that you did years ago that's crazy and if you took a tainted supplement with something that has zero performance benefit years ago it can still show up in your system whereas they used to have like oh it'll be out of your system in six weeks oh you especially talked like a gem professor like there's a lot look there's a lot of cheating in professional sports there's always it cheating for sure look a lot of cheating in MMA a lot but less than they used to be because of you sada and of its and what the UFC's implemented 100% there's a lot less but supplements are a dirty business I know this firsthand from on it from being one of the owners of on it yeah and not even supplements tainted with things that are illegal when we first started making alpha brain we had it independently tested we get all our shit third-party tested yeah and we were like what the fuck is this doing in there we had stuff in there that's not supposed to be in there well it turns out when you get stuff made like say if you have a you put together some sort of a pre-workout drink and you want to have vitamin b12 and all these different things in it you get those mixed by a third party lab this lab mixes it all for you but you don't know what the fuck they're doing I don't know what they do that they're not cleaning out their shit so they might have been doing steroids right before they do your shit and you're having to make mix you have some creatine and your creatine has austrane in it which is like you know what is it some kind of steroid I don't know what it is it's some kind of steroid I was talking to a bodybuilder Micra she'd about supplements cuz you know obviously he a bodybuilder yeah he has a company I think he he works with trifecta two or something like that and I was just like how do how does that happen like these tainted supplements and I interviewed him about I'm gonna release it one day how he goes into it but you know we're bodybuilders they catch flack because they bodybuilders you got to be on something but these guys know they shit he has a legitimate business so I'm sure he does but most of them are on something like if you want to get to the size of like a Lee Haney you don't get that big without steroids it's not a human size you know when you get to like you know you just go back and look at like Franco Columbu oh my god but but then you look at like Frank Zane Frank Zane you can get that body without steroids what about possible what about Francis Francis in Ghana he started to be a bodybuilder oh my god gigantic yeah yeah there's naturally there's natural Kamal's maan is a freak yeah like everybody's affair they freaks Rock Lesnar's a freak there's freaks it there's look there's girls with giant tits they're born with triple F tits yeah this is how it works some guys have 20-inch dicks this is just how the world works some people have big noses the world's weird I wouldn't want to have a 20 dick though now it's too big imagine saying that I'm too big like a plane though you can't complain 89 is good but you know me dudes are crying out there with a 3-inch Derrick tabouli I know who's 17 more inches yeah he's better off having a 20-inch dick than a three inch thick did you just find a girl's head like eight kids and just wrecker it'd be weird like listen we want to know another fun another funny online story of my life these is all in the past but I remember uh Dayton is like older lady and she was like oh I'm a freak I'm a freak I'm afraid I was like how much of why she went in her drawer and pulled out like a dildo 20 inches I was like like a horse cock and I was just like what the fuck I'm gonna do with this I did everything in my power drop she didn't feel shit I got mom's dojo I believe you I believe hey some weirdos out there man we all weird in a way yes every we all listen we're vegans are weird people that say they don't drink are weird people that only eat nuts and berries are weird we always we're Christians are wired you can't judge nobody God never smoked a weed in my life but then I'm I be online dating that's some weirdo she's never smoked weed ever never now one huh I'll come drink a little bit maybe five times a year how come you never smoke for you um I had an addictive family like I seen it and it was it was embarrassing and struggling like my mom was 14 years old when she gave birth to me and my mom was born the same month I am so she was born May 3rd born May 19th so she could have had me at 13 my dad was the same age so I didn't grow up with any parents I mean you know your parents I hate hearing it but I'll know my dad at all I maybe have money I may have talked to him twice you know the only the last cunt you know the last conversation I ever had with my dad he had got out of prison and I was living with his mom my grandmother the one that raised me and he like overtook the room that I was living in because it's his room again like a grown-ass man telling his son and I found his porn tapes I mean my best friend like I knew I said you know you wanna watch some porn so I like went up in the closet took out the tape put it in and then I heard him coming in the house so we ran and put the tape back and this is how precise he was with his porn probably he noticed some clothes move so we like left the house he came out the house hey stay out of my room I said man shut up you a grown man watching porn here's my dad that's like the last conversation Wow he's been in prison I'm in and out it's life that's the thing it's like listen man everybody can pick make a picture out to be poor me yeah I don't that's not me you me telling you all this stuff ain't poor me it's just real it's just life right right where I'm at now is beautiful you know I was filming videos to survive and then I finally found something this stuck I never my fucking life thought it was gonna be mm a never easy never so you you saw people with addiction problems and you just didn't want to have anything to do it yeah I just thought it was luckily for me man I found sports in the fifth grade and I just was I have an addictive personality wasn't whether it's masturbation or anything very similar situation uh you know what's crazy I've seen money like what's fascinating about this podcast is that if you go to your channel on YouTube and you go to click oldest videos that's why I'm not in a rush for anything because everything takes time I looked at like one of your podcasts with Eddie Bravo like three hours long I like 11,000 views oh yeah yeah like 20,000 we just want to say like hey how do I get paid from podcasts and like doom for six years yeah I didn't get paid at all for a year I mean this podcast is almost ten years old and I didn't really start getting yeah like five years ago and it's fascinating to see that like you go look and show all these videos 20,000 30,000 views yeah and that's the thing like MMA fans are fickle right they like who they like they don't like they like it's only about three or four fighters that can get a lot of views but on you tense that it's that way with everything I'm saying comedy so it was yeah and people are fascinated like I'm lucky enough to know a khabib right or somebody like that like I didn't know who this guy was until Rashad Evans was like yo let me introduce you to golly and then I met Ally filming some hens Oh Gracie stuff for him and he was like hell I like you man let me put you together when my fighter could you know who could be because I was like is that they kind of fought Michael Johnson I didn't know who could be was he was like I think y'all will be a good fit because the way you do stories and stuff like that I think you hear like you and you're like him and I literally met him of January of last year of 2018 in Boston and when Francis finds steep a invoking was fight in DC hmm and that was the first time I ever met could be even the rest is history I filmed them up there he was finna fight Tony then I found him doing a whole Connor Fiasco a la quinta then I went to Dagestan I went to Dagestan what's that like intense but it was it was beautiful because people tried to scare me when I was supposed to go to Dagestan who like I got people in the USC that was leo be careful over there I'm like I'm like even at work for the yeah just staying like be careful like I'm thinking of myself like in my DMS on Instagram like bro just be careful they don't fucking play over there I was going to I went doing Ramadan I last June at the end of Ramadan and uh did you have to observe while you were there so kabhi wanted me to come doing like the last tail end of Ramadan right so I went over there by myself went and got my visa in Miami and went over there just got my ticket and I went over there I remember the first day I got there I was in like customs for like two hours because they couldn't speak English it's just little airport in Dagestan and Kobe was outside and he wasn't come in the airport cuz he too famous right and this is in the middle of the night and I remember when I first got there it was just checkpoints everywhere when I got there like we like to drive down the street person with some guns I'm like all right cool yeah well I don't know what yet but this is Dagestan and I ended up getting to this this I stayed at his uncle house I think and from there it was it was just a beautiful moment the Dagestan Chronicles is my most popular thing on my channel obviously because there's Sean khabib in a way no one has ever seen him I observe I'm down the whole time I was there I didn't eat I didn't drink I did exactly what could be eating them did because I think a problem with us a lot as Americans as we take our culture somewhere else and I wanted to observed a culture and really see what it's like and I was fascinated I wanted to know why women covered themselves and I asked all of those questions all that stuff is in the documentary and now when I get all these millions of people watching these videos the most common thing is where is the women it and I'm like why are these people so obsessed with where two women and and I literally went into that like I asked like when you when these women are married you don't point a camera at these people like I've seen women you just don't point a camera at them it's rude right and that's like in their culture and their culture today explain this - yeah they did what did they say they literally just said they look at they like I talked to a couple of them a couple people over there and it was just like we look at our woman as women as queens and we cover them because in in in in the Quran it's you know the man is weak to the flesh so they don't want their woman to be you know looked at by other men all things yeah that's the word I was looking for so you just cover themselves up and in our culture that's you know that may be weird but I respect it like what they told me it made sense it literally made sense where it was just like listen we don't let another man look at our wife right I'm not gonna bash on that culture because I feel like that's silly a woman can do whatever they want to do that's just how they feel like I don't you know so but I've seen women I've seen some beautiful women - while I was in Dagestan so it wasn't a fact that I didn't film any women I seen women but they explained to you when you go here you cannot film the women no no it was just yeah in a way like just don't film another man's woman like I think I talked to Chris Wyman once when I was at his gym when I was doing a la quinta he went to Chechnya yeah and he told me a story I think him and for doing went to Chechnya and he was telling me a story of like he accidentally touched the woman's hand and they like literally got on like you don't touch another woman you don't touch a woman's hand over here cuz that's bad on her right right and I was like dang that's crazy you came because he said he was just like reaching out shaking people hands and right you know human instinct you reach and grab some on hand and he just said man that that's a different culture over there you can't a woman can't touch another man's hand so yeah that guy from Chechnya the the leader of Chechnya he's like really into MMA right he flies I know people out yeah you know what's crazy is that I don't know anything about the guy or his politics or anything but I know that he obsessed with fighting right I know tolerance pong bent over there and yeah why men and all these guys I just met a NICTA tooth the other day mm-hmm and they went they went over there to Chechnya him and a Mendez brothers danger too yeah they had think the Mendez brothers had like a seminar on seminar I did like a preview of cheetah Vera and he was talking about in there like they did a jujitsu match in front of some old guard over there like it's crazy right like they flew him over there for that yeah well it's got a lot of money yeah oh hey I'm not even Fighter need sponsors didn't even give could be like some crazy Mercedes when he won I think I saw that on Instagram he got like a gift I think he gave him some crazy S Class comedian I do bah money now though you're always in Dubai listen I mean since this fight even in Dubai how many thoughts what's he doing over there speaking things like that I mean when you wanted the most faint I think he's like top 15 and most famous athletes now well for sure and definitely the most famous Muslim athlete yeah yes so I mean he the only UFC champion that's undefeated other than John Jones who should be undefined if it not for that one listen fucked up disqualification after spending time with could be being Dagestan like me and his father going into the mountains and thing like I just don't see nobody beating him I'm sorry what'd you throw at him you know way I just feel like just his pedigree of worry from it's nothing that's gonna break that guy it's not you can't what are you gonna do I just don't think it's nothing you can do after going to Dagestan and seeing how those people live and how that their code and their their values and how they live away what what was so convincing well just how strict the faith is over there right and they tie in everything they do to their faith it's sort of like how Ollie was like I'm not gonna lose things like that and I truly believe after seeing like just a camaraderie over there the gyms they train in the mountains everything that makes this guy is nothing in an octagon that someone is going to do like this gonna beat kebede like everything can happen a fluke can happen we see it all the time but I just feel like mentally there's nothing that's gonna break khabib like if I feel like if he was ever in a situation where he had to tap he wouldn't like you he would just have to put him to sleep cuz I just don't think that's possible like to beat him honestly feel like could be you can't lose I just don't see nobody beating them I just I've been in locker rooms of Fighters and you got a butterfly filling and things like that like when he fought Connor and I was in a locker room Kabhi was FaceTime and his people and dagestan laughing Xavier Mendes it's like let's get focused get focused they'll give focus khabib is not caring Wow Kibby just ready to go right when Tony Ferguson was fighting Pettis he like hit mates with Xavier and kabhi just looking up to the screen Xavier was like let's get focused like his focus could be you don't care man it's a different level he always said that's like his favorite thing this is a different level that's what I love about a man it's like people are obsessed with the fighter I like khabib as a person and that's the thing that I get out is an a-team you a fighter it's like just hanging out with this guy but like if you ever watched my series I never really talked about a guys fight coming up like if you ever watched an enemy fighter it's not about your opponent it's just about your life because I felt like when I created it I felt like these organizations wasn't promoting fighters all the way and now yeah they're gonna promote the top fighters and things like that but what about the guys that are 2 & 1 in the UFC not ranked like they in the UFC like they may get cut after a couple fights like what do they have left after that and I was just like let me create this series instead of a documentary and just continue to build this and follow these guys lives and that's all I really wanted to do it was no hidden incentive where I was like I'm gonna make millions of dollars off this I end up on the Joe Rogan podcast it was like I love following these fighters in telling stores because it's sort of like similar to my journey you know these guys are you what was the guy that just fought Darren win in Greenville Eric spicy or spicy or whatever his name was he tweeted like I had he just got they got fighting tonight you're right he was like I had to - 270 in my bank account yeah I've been there Joe so that's why I get the passion out of doing it because I've been there with these fighters up at this point in my life I've paid for fighters flights and hotels because they couldn't get a hotel like these fighters know that some of these fighters know that - where I'm able to help them and I'm funding this all on my own breaking myself so I'm to me I'm just thinking on myself like you doing this for a specific reason you're passionate about it and you want to tell these guys lives and I just run really wanted to offer another glimpse into fighters lost other than fight week and are you getting paid from the YouTube revenue yeah my account is moaning - not monotone eyes and verified yeah monitor monetized in a verified and depending on a month is it can be a good month it can be a bad it's surprising to me I haven't got a sponsor yet like as popular as the channel is but it is what it is you know probably who knows I mean shout-out to like people like eight men strong like you know that's where I invaders Desert yeah that's Ryan Bader shout out to Adam the owner of it and his brother like there was the first people to ever send me stuff like t-shirts I was just happy I was like damn I got some free gear right like man finally I remember seeing a shirts back when I first started what come on whose mom was learning stuff and you know companies like that you get money here and there from them but like to sustain this like member fight land remember to show fight land I heard they went out of business because some funding wasn't advice yeah something like that company because out they went out of business because of funding vice probably just decided to stop doing it listen Joe was right you travel but Vice is a billion-dollar company shrimp what war they leave fight land is a vice sure wasn't it well let's find out yeah pretty a pretty short fight land was vice if you flew to Phoenix for three days to do comedy and get a hotel and you know how expensive lighting like so imagine me finding this on my own if I want to go somewhere for three days well especially Dagestan yeah shit like that and where are you staying when your entire style I was staying with stated Kabir's family house oh wow yeah so I stayed they put me like above a store and he told me he gave me a key he was like brother lock this door at night brother Jesus Christ he was like don't go outside I still went outside did you yeah I go I just was roaming like walking around just filming stuff what's it like out in Dagestan when you're roaming the store they never really seen black people over there so I was like a little celebrity over there and you're a big one and they know I'm from I'm Wicca beep so I was cool I thought so they knew that yeah you know yeah it was chitlin do they speak English a couple people did a couple people did did they ask you questions yeah they asked me questions they you know they they obviously had already been with Kabir at that time you know I was that was passed the Conor McGregor Fiasco so right you know my channel get popular coz there's something like that right they just watch anything could be related could be you got some crazy fans and how many people live in Dagestan man I don't know Jamie pull that up I saw some of the videos of people celebrating when he want it was fucking crazy right it was streets they're honking their horns and when he was title or when you need connor would it be connor 2.9 million yeah okay cool so um so it's your your it's a city but it's essentially like yes in the mountains yes big the mountains are like right next to it or something yeah like so like when we went to his mountain village we had to drive like two hours to get there oh really yeah like we had to go on the board as a Chechnya I had to get another visa oh wow like just to get through that checkpoint I never forget like we got to the checkpoint and they like we had to all give them our stuff and then kabhi kabhi was like get out him ado was like get out the army guy with his gun and then I get out and I come around a car and kabhi was like get your camera brother right and then he was like they want to take a picture with you with the camera how about to do yeah I caught like a bad case of diarrhea while I was over there cuz I'll eat number meat I was trying to do Kido I was over there and listen the toilets are just a hole in the ground you have to squat yeah you got the squat and pull the string or whatever of gene so I remember like we was driving from his village at the that was like my last night there and I was always destroyed and we got to ours and we like stopped a couple of times they eat and pray and all that stuff like you know and I remember like I was suffering and khabib like filming me with his phone laughing look at his brother look at his brother he's about this shitty stuff and I remember getting back to the place where I was standing Dagestan oh my god I probably lost like eight pounds it was crazy man it was a crazy experience man it was a crazy experience in Dagestan that's life-changing changed my life how long were you there for nine days Wow it changed my life really yeah because when you in this type of industry everybody materialistic we all want nice things we want to live in nice places want to drive nice cars I do most people do want to live nice and comfortable and I saw just how happy these people was just living their lives like I went to his a village I went to his mountain village and I was in his City and I saw these people were just happy and maybe on on the outside they was happy and maybe they was dealing with other things that we don't know about but I saw family natal ittle bit of respect for their culture like obviously with Islam and things like that is so many different sects that makes it bad just like with Christianity and people in the Catholic community and the priests and everything and that's my experience with the Islamic community being around Kebede so that's the only thing nothing go off of and obviously everybody see Muhammad Ali and he praises and things like that but I had a newfound respect for just the simpleness of of that like a beep I thought honestly could be he was gonna retire out there you fall because I'll talk to him a little bit about that and cuz he don't want much what'd he say after the contract no no before the kind of fight before he get it he was just like what do you think about a me retiring after the counter fight I was like man you do what she wanted to do I can't tell you he was like I mean I'm having money what else do I need to do right because he obviously knew that was gonna be the biggest the biggest fight ever so I thought it'd make for that fight I don't know well remember they took his check right but obviously he got a lot of money for that yeah they gave him I think Conner has four million dollar check yeah and and khabib had a two million dollar check and then obviously they had to pay per view points right so I was like didn't wear my money yet I promoted two things not sure he should have definitely gotten paid for that listen you know what's funny is that somebody asked me alone feels like if if you got anything out of this whole thing what would you want I'd be like a camera let's get a new camera Sokka shoot some movies or something right that's literally the low expectations I had out of making a series mm-hmm right especially when it was a documentary I was just like man maybe I make this documentary put it on Netflix or Amazon for free about fighters and now looking back on it the stuff that I have captured on them hard drives I can sell a documentary for millions of dollars I think I got amazing footage I can I got the whole Connor thing that I got like that that tape is like 20 minutes nobody's ever seen it I have it no one's really seen the whole thing look I got Connor when he first ran down the tunnel I cuz I seen him from a distance I wouldn't have to UFC would be against you putting our or pro you putting that out because well I'll put it out on my channel now sniff it and then at the end of it when happened I was like watch the full episode on embed it right I gave them and they're just do right and then it literally told me like oh we give you credit I never got credit I was just hoping they put shot out the will anatomy of a fighter for helping us get this footage I never got that they should have either way you're getting it now yeah so here we are Manning yeah you know like going from the first day I walked in that gym and saying come on mine too filming him for two years in all the way to the title when you know I used to post videos of kimonos Mon on the channel he get 4000 views and people like why are you posting his bum I'm thinking to myself like these fans are crazy you can't pay attention that those are just it's already done even the fans it's hard it's troll the time it's a tiny amount of Lee is crazy because I love the MMA fans I'm close to a lot about that the last time you were here we were talking about the comments you can't read it you can't it'll drive you fucking crazy because the people that want to comment they want to fuck with you it's the smallest number that allowed us the most vocal and they have the shittiest lives no one with a good life wants to do that yeah no one no one was happy and healthy wants to fuck with you and say he's crazy when you put your time and effort into something like say for example I flew to Phoenix film shine and film Bader mmm-hmm and then you spend all these hours 10 hours editing something and then you put it on and then somebody like this that dude sucks it's like damn and if you appreciating what I'm doing are you just trolling you're talking to morons yeah I mean that you're you're reading the thoughts of morons you're reading the thoughts of limited minds that's all it is it's really that simple yeah it is nuts anybody thought to come tomorrow whose mom was a bum I knew whose mom was a murderer years ago I saw him fight years ago I want nobody wants to fight that I know I used to put your like I used to love taking snippets of your podcast your voice because you're just that narration voice and putting it with stuff and like you can be like oh that was a universe pulling us together but no I just was like this goes with this yeah like I like when you and siya bar together I love that because y'all able to bounce I could see his experience with the fight game and in your experience with the fight game y'all able to bounce debate and things like that and I'm like that's a good mix like a lot of people go in on a episode I did at the weigh-ins with Connor and khabib and it was like you and shop talking and that's just the narration shot of how I do film because that's what I love about document sports documentaries is narration mm-hmm and that's how I get it I get so many people just like oh I want to I'm trying to do the same thing you doing and I'm like don't try to be an animal fighter right like if I'm filming one fighter it's a thousand other fighters not just I wanna just do UFC I want to do Bellator I want to do one I want to do boxing that's why was I was trying to say earlier my goal I would love to do it anatomy of Deonte log I bet you could do it I bet you can try to get I had Andy Ruiz and only and they did so what happened was Micra she reached out to me that was like hey do you want to do and Ruiz I was like I'm thinking John Ruiz right so I'm like junior junior senior right and he was like no the god it replaced big baby Miller and that's one of my good friends big baby Miller and he was like yeah man he's fighting Joshua now he got a good chance I like I posted on my Instagram like a text message from him he was like man it would be a good opportunity because I think he can really beat Joshua and he did and I missed out see those are the moments like the Conor Dali thing it's key moments in film like this viral nation that you need to catch that's why I film everybody I found these guys that's not popular things like that because these guys may be the champions one day and I want to be like I was there at the beginning that's the that's the thrill you get out of it if anything right yeah and I I feeling so kudos I filmed the oohs miles I film the curbs I've been in locker rooms with the title winners I've been in there when volcán loss but you were telling me some great footage that you got that you wouldn't have gotten that story wouldn't got out about sir who doe about sir who dope coming back from the Olympic gold medal winning the Olympics and wrestling and then fucking living in the gym - to win the golden that's crazy crazy I never knew that that's the ecstasy I get out of filming these guys like you hear these little stories yeah and I was like you never talked about that right like you know he's running with the whole heel of the gold medal thing well he's doing some weird shit now he's like he's calling himself the king of cringe king of crime what is that about well because people was calling him cringy you know how they rake on Luke Rockhold he's like Triple C now yeah now Triple C he's running with he like a Mexican Kobe coveting well he better be careful what he is is a beast eeeh bestow his mind is just unstoppable the fact that Marlin fucked him up like that in that first round and was chewing his legs I mean I did not think and look Kayode it looks like he couldn't close the distance Marlin look calm and comfortable and super professional and then a flips wit of switch flipped and then the second round came around and so who does just walk it him down and closing the distance and then he gets him in the clinch and lands knees him like this is a movie that's Eric Albertson and Santino DeFranco and all those guys over there that's ready it has something to do those guys also Ludo you know when he lost your ass I did not know when he lost to DJ so who dough was lost he went on a whole world tour to find himself he went to Thailand he went to Brazil he was training everywhere after he loves after he lost it the first time and that's those are the stories right there like he felt like he needed to get better as a martial artist well he said I mean with DJ at the time it's arguable now who's the best it's like him or John right now here's that one Fc it's a wholly different ballgame but what DJ was was the most complete package we'd ever seen the most the the guy who you couldn't hit you could hit you he could wrestle you he could submit you he could strike with you he had incredible footwork and speed I mean DJ was just perfect and that night he just found that opening just fucking him up beneath the body I mean DJ man there was moments in DJ's career where I remember watching him and call him this fights mic god damn is dude special it's like something about what he's doing he's so far ahead of everybody else in the division so far I think I'm about to go up to Seattle or Kirkland the through Center yeah for one Fc concentrate on Matt Hume Matt Hume was a bad motherfucker oh my god he's got such a deep knowledge and understanding of the sport you ever see him fight nope Matt Hume stopped Pat Miletich back in the day he's so mad he he would he who did he submit Kenny Johnson he I forget who it was and one of those they used to have they had a professional submission grappling pay-per-view event at one point in time Frank Shamrock submitted Dan Henderson and Matt Hume was a fucking straight-up killer I mean he was a really really good world-class mixed martial artist back when nobody was he had excellent Muay Thai excellent submissions he was good at everything how was how's that Seattle MMA scene well I mean there's been great guys to come from like Josh Barnett and of course Mighty Mouse being the biggest one it's not as big as say like Miami like where you're at in South Florida that's that's the biggest yeah that was when I live in South Florida that was that I mean Blackzilians and American Top Team on one spot and then a plethora of world-class jujitsu around that area I mean and then also world-class boxing obviously mean that's where I mean what the fuck is his name Sugar Ray Leonard's trainer Muhammad Ali's trainer the old guy custom ah no no no no no the old guy who said to that cut no no you're blowing it son fuck is his name the old Italian guy I can't believe I can't remember his name this is embarrassing Sugar Ray Leonard's boxer trainer Angelo Dundee yeah Angelo Dundee you're blowing it kid yeah when he comes out and stops Tommy Hearns and then from yeah that was that was that was Miami Denver I'm not gonna be in LA long like la course not you're a gypsy man yeah so my whole thing is honestly Joe I need to I want to settle somewhere though what do you want to settle Denver so this is that this is always gonna ask you so these are the three cities I'm thinking of okay to settle for maybe a few years four years back to San Diego Denver and Seattle which one should I choose I would say San Diego or Denver I love Seattle but that went or that rainy season can suck my dick you can't do it it was job you crazy when it rains for seven weeks in a row you look out the window you look I gotta get the fuck out if there isn't not enough online-dating not be sitting in there swiping left right no it's just vitamin D man it just say it really is not good for you I love sandy X Andy Eggleston love it well I love sandy I live in a nice apartment complex now and the good thing about it is I can transfer they have a relocation program like if you want to transfer 30 miles away that you can do it for free so I can choose those cities oh so like I can just transfer it to them cities and I'm thinking like I gotta get out of downtown LA man that's gross gross it's not a real downtown it's not like downtown New York it's like the walking dead it right yes bro listen yes they're all the time it's gross I went into the other day and I was going to get like some quest bars and I seen like this dude in the aisle like and he and he was like what's up man and he had like a basket full of stuff and then I look at him again he's like opening up stuff eating it like you go to another hours somebody just roaming with a cart and these is all homeless people just putting stuff in carts and this didn't get kicked out by security and then you see them and check out on you like this is craziest every day downtown is insane it's infested with homeless people like in fact like you can't fix it like the only way to fix it was bad you'd have to take them arrest them put them in a plane and fly them somehow drop them off but that's what I heard they doing I heard they did that to LA like dropping people didn't we go over this we wind up and someone got sent to like Indiana yeah we we look this up and in fact they've been doing that forever sending people all around the country this whole flight paths of what they did with homeless people they just send homeless people and let someone else deal with it they need to drop them off in Denver's it's hard Denver getting bad too of course is getting bad without weed money the weed money and now mushroom money cuz now Denver decriminalized mushrooms prostitution next whoo probably cheaper ten days excited a man la boy stuff I don't I don't know I probably to spend a lot of money on first dates yeah I'm sure realistic because it sucks to be a man in dating because you got to impress well if you impress it does listen when before I started making money and having money dating was fun because she was broke and you can do smoothie dates and Starbucks dates and you know you're gonna spend five six bucks out of college now I'm 37 yeah that's you're too close to 40 to be doing that I know you can't do that anymore you got you got to take chicks to Palm Springs for the weekend things like that well they want to know I like that stuff now though sure take them to a nice dinner buy them nice don't fall any woman that wants a man that has a shit together yeah because for so long I didn't I do now I want to have some fun of course yeah yeah I ain't trying to complain no more but as far as like cities of the vibe I love the vibe of San Diego and I love the vibe of Denver I love those cities yeah I'm leaning towards back to San Diego because it's still close to like I just drove to Irvine other day I was like that was a simple job yeah as long as you do it early yeah he tried to do that shit at four o'clock in the afternoon you want to shoot yeah you will want to what vine improv I work out all the time dude when I have a seven o'clock show I leave here at fucking noon and I'm not playing games I leave here at noon I get there early I check in I have dinner I don't fuck around with that 4:00 p.m. traffic it's insane nuts it took me six hours to get down there once when you went to shop show when he had his special how early do no no no damn got a hotel just to put my shit in checked in checked out I didn't even stay there my daughter had an event the next day that I had to go to for school so I was said yeah I drove that back that night after the show after the second show that's a that's a easy drop though it's not bad yeah especially late late at night yeah you get a couple Red Bulls in New York yeah I got to LA quick once from when I lived in San Diego I'll use my boys truck I met this girl online in the middle of the night and just drove girl on the moon I know if I ever was going end up on the Joe Rogan podcast I thought it was gonna be for me writing a book about dating confessions of an online dater I swear I let you do that Maxim you don't need a book but just do a video about it do documentaries about how crazy I used to film girls and interview him and everything about dating like what sucks about dating and things like that online dating is only existed for like like edits mmm roars form 20 years right Ross form was 20 years ago that was like AOL that was you use a weirdo danda oh wow now everybody listen if you do tinder or bumble in LA you see in celebrities and everything on it I mean yes chicks like all these successful chicks on searching for love that's scary Justin why is it scary because you don't know who you really meet him like for a woman imagine me in a woman yeah yeah I was it was sucked to be a woman that's not gonna be weird a successful celebrity woman trying to meet dudes you want to hear this story and this is crazy so I met this famous online female trainer beautiful here in LA she's very popular I'm gonna say her name I met her on match.com and I got her Instagram and she we you know exchanged our instagrams or whatever so I read I looked at it looked at her or her Instagram and she was doing like you know content but on her phone like in her living room doing like squat jumps and things like that and I reached out to her like we set up a date we're gonna go hiking run you and do everything and I was like listen I I looked at your your your your Instagram page in your content I would love to be able to help you out and give you better content she lost it I don't need your help I don't need your help you look like you need to help yourself like I'm like I'm just telling you that I could help I'm like why like I am a filmmaker I could help you do some content like she thinking one she took it the wrong way like I'm probably trying to take advantage of her millions of followers and things like that I was I was like man I'm gonna be single forever but I think sometimes that's also there's a very limited communicating with people on in a text yeah did you take it the wrong way yeah yeah yeah you gotta kind of meet people like if you but I bet if you met her and you said hey you know you're you are beautiful you got a great body this videos are great and everything but I think I could make them even better she still would have took it the wrong way oh she was like in her 40 40s alpha female you know those alpha females that you can't some girls have been fucked over so many times they think everyone's gonna fuck them over it's like a dog's butt beatin you ever pick up a dog from the pound oh yeah you're like hey I love dogs come on I'm not gonna beat you it's nuts oh yeah I would probably think San Diego will be to move or Denver I like both of them man either I can't go wrong you can't go wrong well you can't go wrong and I'm a wise like San Diego has Alliance you know San Diego has a ton of great jujitsu shout out to my man boogie at tenth planet and then it's close to here yeah it's real close to here but then Denver is the fucking share we got a lot of jam Denver also has a really good vibe I'm gonna do see what the people in Denver a lot I like the people in San Diego too I would look I'd flip a coin if I had to move out no kids so San Diego that's it everybody that's how I'm gonna do I would be happy either one it's st. you can't go wrong and they're both a good-sized city you know I'm saying like not too crazy yeah like San Diego is a great size cities I'm not going out like I'm not I don't do clubs you know I'll go to a bar here and there because in your online dating right kissing away well I don't know I think in the early days I was in the clubs every day yeah that's a waste of time yes it yeah and it a lot of years I wasted just partying not trying to get my shit together so I feel like now when it's different when you you find a passion man and you get obsessed with it yeah and I'm obsessed with this Anatomy or a fire thing like I have a post in my phone that I was going to show you where it was a it was like August 22nd 2017 and I had 454 subscribers and I was like 46 to my first hundred and I was like listen it's not a lot but I appreciate all the supporters that I have so this is gonna be one of the biggest MMA documentary channels in the world and that was August 22nd 2017 when I first started the channel I couldn't even name an Anatomy fighter yet you have to wait till you get a hundred subscribers so like looking back on that journey in a sacrifice that I've made to like I went from South Florida to Vegas Vegas of Florida Florida to Vegas Vegas the Florida Florida to here and now here we are how many of you subscribers you have know how many Jimmy uh I think 238,000 beautiful not bad I have a little thing in the back from when we had a hundred thousand subscribers we got a little award yeah I got one too I was like silver creator 100,000 subscriber I was my only go with an enemy of fire I have a my friends have YouTube channels and I seen what they was doing and that was a goal like the Silver Creator award if you get a hundred thousand and I was like maybe I get it in two or three years that's what I thought like and I can just do this on the side and then once once I started getting some traction I was like let me ease back on weddings and I'm leaving guaranteed income and comfortability to put my time and effort into this because now I'm like I can't I got two hundred thousand people following I can't go back now right I got to continue to build this well it's gonna be giant man you're really talented and really shit and what I like about this podcast what I was hoping this podcast was gonna be as exactly it was I love to hear people's stories I love to eat that's one of the reasons why I like documentaries because I think we can all relate to moments in our lives where we're lost or what just didn't have it or it wasn't you know wasn't wasn't where we wanted it to be trying to figure out how fuck do I get it together how the fuck do I make it happen it's the real world it's like Instagram is fake like you make it look whatever you want but your communities well in LA exactly and that's one reason why I love doing this that that form of content because it's just like everybody listen one thing I've learned about the whole series is that everybody's not gonna like a certain fighter one fighter is not going to get a lot of views some people and not even care about that fighter because that's just the way momentum and popularity is but that's what I love it the most like somebody asked me the other day because I had posted a picture on my Instagram of the NBA Draft it was one player sitting by herself while I was interviewing Sion Williamson all the media and you know how it is in media day in the UFC everybody got they name or this guy was sitting by herself and nobody was trying to talk to him and I said yo if you ever in this position use this as motivation and I think like kymaro who's my poster like I've been there where nobody want to pay attention to you so somebody comment and was like would you rather film khabib or a regional LFA guy I was like the regional LFA guy I take pleasure in the connecting with people just like me I'm not popular it was that picture right there like nobody's paying attention to him and that's how those thanks it's that you just click no thanks in the pop-up ad that's essentially what they're saying about him yeah no thanks so that's that's how I feel even in the media circuit well what I do is how it is with everything yeah I mean I've been there as a comedian I've been there in the early days of podcasting you know it's it's how it is it's just life is a journey and what I love about your story is that people can relate to someone struggling and then figuring it out yeah and then it gives them hope like okay I'm struggling now but if I just make the right moves and put the right amount of effort and focus and dedication to something I can make something happen everybody can I really believe that and I love that it's one of my favorite things I'm a I'm a success junkie I love watching other people's success I'm a big fan of other that's the greatest a great yeah it's great at helping people yeah listen I've been in locker rooms when they lose and I'm in there when they they win and it's the same for me I feel bad for the other opponent like I people always ask me do you get any type of excitement out of film and gods win and not really I'm just telling the story you have to be like that like Kobe coveting tomorrow who's mine I would love to be neutral and film both for them and do a story on Kobe in that story on Guzman like people always get mad was like why don't you post about this fight I'm like I'm fighting against myself right I'm not I can't first of all again stop fucking comments they'll change perception so I've met people that have gone mad reading comments yes go crazy they think the world's out to get them I'm like hey you got like a hundred people that are talking shit to you and then you got a thousand million or whatever the fuck it is the lot I love you don't don't do this yeah don't do this but but I do wish I I get I can't wait till I get to a point where I can have the resources to go film a lot more content because I love doing this yeah like I would love to go to when you had Kalia Roundtree on and I had commented only on a comment on YouTube like I would love to do anatomy of Khalil in Thailand I'll hook it up I would love to just go over there to Thailand I'll kill you know Khalil no I never met he's amazing just go but I know damn buildings like he was doing crazy crazy but the the transformation that guys made as a fighter from when he went to Thailand he's back there now he's in Bangkok he's a beast man that Eric Anders fighter I was like holy shit Ares is a tough dude he's as tough as it heat it does one think Khalil said he never he winced I mean he's eaten leg kick after leg kick from a guy who kicks as hard as anybody I've ever seen that's crazy Khalil is so fast when I was watching throw those kicks I was like where who's this guy he was weird how did you turn into this guy like you see his earlier fights and you see this what he beat go gossip cope wasn't it book on sake not go Constantinian off right yeah he lost to Johnny Johnny Walker Johnny when he went and reinvented up self again Johnny caught him with an elbow in the clinch man he caught him with one of these these elbows in the clinch and he ko'd him and you know he would just said okay I have to really learn more time he's so fucking I'm going to tile I know I went to Thailand and I followed his Instagram journey you know I'm watching all his training footage and he just fell in love with Thailand and then he came back and I'm like this is motherfuckers right looking like Saget from Street Fighter but like a jacked muscular to one another I used to be a batboy too crazy that's crazy and the nicest guy yeah he could you get a nicer guy it's nuts to see that transformation like to see him go from like this god it was chubby and in this world-class fighter well just did that too but the difference between him and well this heart set to say right because the gokon sake fight was real quick he just cried in the left hand and kahlil's very fast and then see him getting KO by Johnny Walker but then to see I saw his other fights I've seen many fights of his but see that the transformation I'm like what the fuck the kicks man it was the kicks that he put it all together and he was fighting Thai style it's like he was one more the most representative of Muay Thai I had ever seen in MMA as he you know he just he just absorbed it man what's better than a Thai style kick box on a Dutch there's no better man the thing is like look at Ramon Decker's Ramon Decker's went over there and he fucked everybody up in Thailand and he was there sighs it's the athlete but it's also how they incorporated in well you know just look there's some great Thai fighters like who the fuck is forget how to say his name that just doom Bay just knocked him out big time Thai fighter we had like 200 Pro Taif i'ts he had somebody and do make caught him with a rotten glory caught him with a right hand the clinch and ko to him it's like everybody sty and Dumba is more of a kickboxer it's everybody it's it's the athlete but everybody style has merits yeah like there's merits to just being that wrestler who ground in pounds and doesn't throw many kicks there's merits to be in that jiu-jitsu guy that doesn't care that if they get taken down it's just like who are you though are you are you Demian Maia on the ground you know I mean if you're Demian Maia on the ground there's merits to that style yeah Amy and Maya his strangled a whole lot of world-class killers that never even got a punch off on it oh my god it was it yeah well Nathan fucked they fucked it in Maya Knobble Eva's the guy he knocked out in his last fight doom-doom Bates a beast well set your doom Bates an interesting guy man because he reinvented himself he was more of like a runner not I want to say a runner but more of a mover and he would win on points and he would but then he just the last few fights it was a couple fights ago two or three fights ago he fought I forget it Alec freaking out say the fuck his name city ty guys have those crazy names hi but I want to do I'm going to do some stuff what a glory to glory is amazing gory does not get the respect that it deserves now I'm a giant fan i watch all the glory yes that's what fascinates me about what I can do yeah cuz people just think is UFC nobodies anatomy of a fighter is for everybody anything yeah it's all of that said your doom babe before costly on that dude he's my fave numbe whoo yeah boxes man he flatlines everybody he's gonna there it is sit song p nueng that's it seong-chil satsang Penang say that real quick don't cha sing-songs go back to his a that so that guy that he fought Tom chai tom CH I had like I mean hundreds of fights I don't know how many fucking fights yeah total it was more than a hundred times lights and then a shit-ton look 136 wins yeah 175 fucking fight I'll take 39 losses if I've won 136 times yeah he fought a hundred and seventy five times that is insane so I mean he's got that Thai style we're doomed aids more of a kickboxer start a lot of times people say well they prefer the Thai style because the elbows and the clinch the knees but doom Bay flatlined Tim it's the athlete it's the way they incorporate their style competing against the other style and there's merits to kickboxing I prefer the Thai style because I think there's there's a real benefit to being really good at the clinch yeah to be and especially when it comes to MMA real good at the clinch the knees to the body the elbows in the clinch and kickboxing doesn't allow elbows or knees to the body but we've seen world-class kick boxers that have come on like like cro cop you had a tremendous success in MMA going from kickboxing into MMA I always wonder where like somebody like Ray Sefo name would do it's me prom in MMA like well look at mark hunting and Mark Hunt's had a tremendous run and Mark Hunt even Ray Sefo right yes he did yes he fought ray Sefo I mean when you go back to Mark Hunt mark hunt really when he won the k1 Grand Prix was probably when he's in his prime as an athlete and then he fought a lot of fights and pride so by the time we got him in the UFC I mean marks in his 40s now right and that thing is mark still is he retiring he just lost his last fight right who he loosed him Willis yes yes he lost her Willis yeah I think so I think he's retired uh I don't know but he's probably close you know I mean at a long long well not when I'm when I was living in Florida like my home gym is hard knocks 365 that's why I started that's Henry who I love that guy that's like my big brother man I love like a great trainer he needs a platform to tell his life story because it's crazy Henry office he just got back from Thailand he went over there he told me he's like I just got away from the game for a couple weeks and I came back refreshed hmm because you know he's Abby's like I wouldn't want to like get caught in an alley with Henry who dies a big fella - yeah hollers me I'm kick your damn Lee Nia that's why if I didn't piss them off a couple times he didn't kick me through the cage why I just complaining like complaining like egg who's manis people didn't pay me enough and he like quit the employee complaints like fell back I was like yeah I was like holding on to the case well my hoof is a bad man man you don't want to get on his bass he's a great tree here's a girl he a great guy and I'm happy I listen start his journey I've seen so many people say oh who has a great coast but he just can't coach a champion and just to see him grind and finally but he has champions he has long and one Fc - double champion yeah Michael Chandler didn't want to build a couple times how do you say on this first name I went in songs how you pronounce it I don't know um that's why I call him he's a beast man he's a B people are sleeping on one fighters and I think when you see guys like Eddie Alvarez go over there and get chaos and you see a lot of fighters go over there and have real to me Mighty Mouse had a real hard fight he did I want an easy fight I loved chachi - it's a date I love trot shoe as well but I it's a different world when you're not cutting weight it's a different world you know those advantages you have being big they don't exist anymore you're now fighting someone who's your size I think it's better how much if see hey I would love to go live and see a girl yeah and just you know just film one one Fc go maybe chachi chachi if you listen and if you if he hears this maybe you'd have you come down I'll talk to I talked to the executive producer of content they want me to do some stuff it is it's changing the landscape of MMA because it is literally larger than the UFC worldwide because of Asia millions of views a million millions and millions every imagine if I got the Asia market on Anatomy or fight I'm subscribed oh my god and then we'll the good thing is you wouldn't be able to read the contents yeah comments the comments would be all in Asian you'd be like I don't know great thank you thank you don't fucking read them it's tough man so it is it's it draws you in yeah you'll be well you get it like I had got addicted for a minute like the khabib effect and connar effect is real and you post a video and you get 100,000 views and within the four hours you like it's going to be like this all the time then you post you know shoutout to my god desmond green a video of him and it's insightful and it's talking about some stuff and you get 5,000 views yeah and it's kind of like that it's like a high right and it's like I got away from a dud that's reason why I was like you know what I started thinking about a lot of stuff in the past month when I was like man I just need to move somewhere live a normal life and film and I think I can go fly somewhere come back home live in Denver live in San Diego and just be away from popularity and materialism and and that's the thing it's like I just want to stick to building this however long it takes like I said if I look back on your channel and I see I can't imagine where this could be in six years yeah imagine where it could be ya know it can be gigantic especially when you think about the fact that you have so many different arts and and and just different disciplines to study Muay Thai kickboxing Dutch kickboxing or boxing jujitsu I mean there's so much you can study and so much you can watch and so much you can learn are you gonna train yourself people come on lose my told me I should go over to undisputed and or unbreakable unbreakable in a blazer why not and just throw some hands well just do something oh no I'll be fine you built for it chair get that long dusty shirts gonna make you look bad strong yeah well you obviously work out yeah yeah I'll work out every day yes every day but I kind of actually you know what I did I did I read a whole thing on runner's high yesterday because I was like I want to get back into running mm-hmm through endorphins yeah how much do you weigh 230 yeah that's the thing about running like I really think that a lot of people overdo it when their mother larger people in the beginning and I think you really should make sure you you get someone who shows a mile a day is fine and a couple miles a day yeah sure but make sure you don't run on concrete man no I treadmill yeah try not much swimmer dough huh you have it since I've been in LA but in Florida I swim every single day every day for now we use one of those life runner treadmills those ones you self propel mm-hmm Institute - yeah what is it called not life runner I made the wrong word they have them at the Institute yeah yeah Air Assault it's like an air assault the air assault bike the same company okay they make that treadmill it's the shit it's literally 13 something like 13% harder than regular running so it makes you better at regular running yeah that was cool yeah a salt air runner assault air runner yeah okay yeah I want to I want to get back into running yeah I'll show to you when we get done here best it's really good because you can you it's self-propelled you're you're pushing it rather than keep because with the treadmill all you're doing is like lifting your leg up and putting it down you're not really propelling yourself forward you know I'm saying like the the belts moving but this you have to make the belt move yeah and so when you're making the belt moved you're actually pushing with your legs and strengthens your legs up I prefer it I be I'd be afraid to do anything at my age worse I mean I'd be seeing these basketball players just tearing tearing achilles by this and stepping I'm thinking like yeah man that's tough yeah I won't want to get kicked on my left knee right now but I have like I study things that I film right mm-hmm and I'll just be like specially like Henry who file look at all his leg kicks when he teach and leg kicks I'm like if I ever get in the street fight I just need somebody to properly teach me how to kick in that leg I'm disabling whoever in my face that's the first thing I want to do is kick your legs I'll punch in your face I'm athletic enough to beat your ass but I'm just saying like the kick it's the wrestling that's gonna get you because most fights end up on the ground so you got to know what to do when you tussle own with some when you go to Ted's planet tonight just ask him to show you some shit yeah or choke with a choke with long arms are great for chokes great for chokes and Darcys and ornament ropes because look at John John my height sure like I've been around John I just think like you see John John's on TV and Dan you see him in person he like he alone motherfuckers long and he will fuck you up the best at using it no one's better at using distance ever than John he did a did you see every see the video he I don't do you know dr. boho tower is yes like when he let John kick him he did yeah he just let me eat I guess he liked why he just let him kick him in it and John kicked him in his leg and he just bought what I was just like I think he had a reach the number of subscribers on YouTube oh she's so photo excited to be crippled yeah a truc crazy yeah John is a beast I I met John a few times I haven't done that Anatomy at John John shit oh is this it yeah watch this it's crazy a big felt he's putting his weight on it - John is crazy oh boy he did it to another doctor - oh my god he's crippling doctors and he didn't even hit him full blast but you know how weak that leg can be yeah if you don't train that and strengthen how do you even strengthen that part of your leg you get used to getting kick there you're you develop all these weird veins - it's real strong here see Kevin Randleman 'he's leg after he fought pedro have around him in with the hair he had Benny have his hair blonde sometimes some fights you crazy blonde hair but he had big legs those jacks super jack but he fought Pedro his oh and Pedro his oh fucked his legs up so badiy these giant like veins like weird like broken veins all over his leg Randy go to around him - also from Pedro his oh I like Randy get all the years I've seen people kick legs Randy probably I mean Pedro his I probably kicked harder than anybody ever seen I remember I watched him at Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu in the 1990s he was kicking a heavy bag and I was just like what in the fuck his leg kicks were preposterous just Punk cuz it would just bend that fuckin bag in half and you just think about what he would do to your leg Pedro fuck the people up pedro rizzo was a fucking beast back in the day I've seen a lot of people get fucked up in a gym I just don't release it yeah it got a lot of footage that I can't ever embarrass people right and that's the thing like I appreciate all the fighters that have let me document they lost because they trusted me with the intimate parts of their lives like right I'm getting invited around these guys kids they Wobs like you just don't do that right so that's the respect level they've given me to where they trust me that I'm doing well with the story so yeah I appreciate all you take care of them yeah you have to hone it listen when I first used to come into the gym with hoof gnam at the black zillions I remember who was like who the fuck is you who are you right like what are you doing here right like you have to gain that like I get so many think like fans be like hey do you think I could be with you at a fight weekend I'm thinking like nah man you have to build your way to distrust this is these managers have to trust you like the gyms have to trust you these coaches have to trust you you know some people are real picky about what you film and you know maybe it's a one-week out to the fight they know a lot of people watching your channel now we can't release that's the how they was was so who helped when so who doe fault Marlon yeah I had released a snippet of the episode I was gonna release and it was like they was on opposite sides of the cage at the gym and it was like fight and then he came out exactly the way he was gonna come out where Marlon but I wasn't paying attention it was slow-motion he was just coming out so so who don't freaking out fight week he like bro did you post this yet I'm like no he's like man you got to take that down cuz that's exactly what I'm doing with Marlon and I was like what was he doing that was so unusual you know like soon as the fight start he was going to come out in a certain stance he was gonna come out in a certain stance like a look you know his little karate style yeah and then he was gonna actually do I don't know what it was but he was freaking out and I was just like that the thing about Marlon is Marlon is a giant 135 yeah I mean Marlon is so big I don't know how much weight he cuts but I know the californian won't let him fight 135 again because California has that rule where you can't hydrate more than I think it's 10% or so you can't blow back up you can't blow back up so he did blow back up in a fight in California said no more 135 for you cuz so it's very obvious that he's cutting a tremendous amount of weight he's huge he said like a comic book character yeah yes so I think that he cut way too much weight and I think that that that contributes to his demise in the second round cuz he couldn't take Henry out he just he knew his lock on what he needs yeah he's like this it's ten knees in a row what was ridiculous and he didn't he let him clinch with him like that in a way that you don't do unless you're tired and it just I think he could compromises himself I think there's two things going on one I think Henry has a force of will that very few few human beings can ever possibly understand I mean Henry has a self belief and and just in a stainless steel will that motherfucker just puts it on you and I think Marlin outclassed him in that first round but I don't think it's sustainable I don't think he can keep that pace with that dehydration level and with with what he's doing to his body to make 135 pounds I think he cripples so where does the division go now since Henry is out here's the problem if he goes to 145 right if Marlin goes to 145 then he doesn't maintain the same advantages that he has in cutting all that weight then he's the size of these guys okay so he goes to 140 but just think about guys like Calvin cater that can that flattened rind you know crack flat line yeah and he's tall and long and that shit is not gonna work on him the way it works on those 135 pound guys it's a different it's a different world you got Josie Aldo you know you got max Holloway who's walking around at 180 and get down the last 45 that's his teammate what sounds to be a beat yeah oh my god man so beat is a motherfucker shut that's a shower a monk oh he's amazing he they're gonna make a movie that guy they gonna make a movie of him I was a beat yeah his he got a crazy story yeah like shaolin monk type stuff sent him off as a kid type thing really yes they listened zabi I've never seen I like the beat he's filming him and training him his english getting better too it is good that's that's a good thing for him like I think he he's the next well man there's so many stars brewing in dagestan it's just so many of them over there or well that if they have that mentality and they're that tough I mean there's just that that breeds more people like that you know killers breed killers you look at like Jim's like aka right you know you've got Cain Velasquez Daniel Cormier age you know go down the line you know Luke Rockhold John Fitch and just Josh Koscheck how many fucking killers have come out of that Jim you got to see a cabina and play basketball in Dagestan when I was over there it's like one of my most popular videos where they they play basketball full game hours of basketball and D and train for two hours and they know dribbling but doesn't compete have fucked up knees what do you mean by no dribbling it's called Dagestan basketball just hold on to it like rugby basketball come on look at this looking at it's the craziest thing you just hold on yes yes no they trying to wrestle

that's the gym could be training right now that's it that floor yep right now that's crazy the fact look at you guys look the fact that they they play a different version of basketball yeah did you just get kayoed what happened there oh man is no chip at the end it is could be even like choke somebody out like it's really yeah crazy man a dating app and they run on the mats with their shoes on these motherfuckers are gonna get staff look look look look we could be what is happening here this is so ridiculous yeah it's like rugby basketball that's what I called it but they call it a different thing in dagestan and I found what do they call it it's something it's like Australian rules football right like Dagestan yes literally and I'll play I'll play with them and and I'm smart my knee was swelled for two days in Dagestan because they tackled hard it was killing me compete and look after after I was gonna dribble or just play store and everything but when I kept getting my knee started hurting Kabir was like brother you too big to be sorry [Laughter] twist uni yeah they was all arguing about picking me up because I member that when I dumped on Kabir I sent you that that the image of me dunking on his like he's trying to guard me yes they really wanted to pick me up then it was like are we getting him so I'm thinking is gonna be easy I'm gonna just hold the ball up and jump boy they was taking my knees out oh it was taking it easy on each other until they saw the black dude when they saw the black dude played it was like are we really not about that guy who actually had the potential to play profession eight and they go on crazy at this this is hilarious serious to skip ball that's fun look at the balls look at that every time I hit sticker yeah it's got no bounce look he dimed him duh well it looks like the floor is a regular bounce it is look how happy day is look at your dad like that with the fucking ball like this is motion so you see look push you out of bounds they do all that they did that to me a couple times but they run on that fucking man look at this here it is right here watch this look look look look look a bebang stop it so he's wrestling with this dude why is he doing that cuz to hold him down like in out a wrestling resin look Kabhi main stop it and they're doing it on the map look look look Coby he's a madman oh my god he's taking us back he's talking about the other tab it's crazy so they wrestle with all their plan boys yes they will tackle you down so there's no rules no rules that is hilarious look the guy tapped the ready and now he's got him in a guy already tapped oh man he's bring back memories but wait a minute he's so you look man people trying to get could be Botham yeah why is his teammate because because you free up another opponent so you can play but that long it could be thought jang hijae right there right there skyhook oh man that is crazy MMA fighters play basketball it's the worst thing is is not basketball this is something different I mean when you're not ever dribbling did you see the video Francis trying to act he paid homage to Zion Woodson and then he was out there shooting basketballs you just did it bro France is the worst he's not athlete but I'm sorry if you can't if you six-foot-five and can't dunk a basketball huh been well don't you remember when Mike Tyson was in his prime with the loss with overall watches he's got dedication to one thing yeah that's probably the first time we ever tried to do man and he will punch you a pinky and your soul to come out to a body it's so fucking hard when he had Alistar there's another kickboxer who made it big in MMA Alistair Overeem but when he but Alistair was there a real Alistair is very very well-rounded yes not just a kickboxer but K 1 Grand Prix champion you gotta call him a kickboxer but when he hit Alistair with that left hook I like Jesus Christ he said I saw the day I did a free fight they did a free fight UFC channel mhm and I just watched it over and over and over and I was like Danny was the follow-through punch yeah that's the scariest the scariest moment I ever I wouldn't say scariest but the most intimidating moment I ever have I was filming Francis eating a banana and he didn't like you didn't like you fell upon him I was in an elevator with him at who's mine we was in Pittsburgh when we did USC Pittsburgh when Rocco fought David back then and Frances came to support tomorrow so they going to do jujitsu in a little workout room and Frances is like talking I lose my opening in a banana and I'm like he put the bananas mad we start eating it and I'm filming he looked hey hey I slapped a camera away that's my boy though friends my boy but that's before I really know you tell me a meeting you maybe this you know time in with bananas and a mouth they might not like the banana in the tailpipe that was funny France isn't intimidating man he's terrifying when he clipped Cain Velasquez there's that uppercut it's not gonna uppercut left hook like a shovel hook look at this boom before right before that his swagger how he was he had the confidence bouncing his shoulders like he was ready to he believed he was the greatest in the world and that his sleep a fight changed his fucking trajectory around it really did change his life huh that's a really interesting fight because Steve babe was a real champion you know it was crazy I was in the room next to Frances in Boston and he dingo he never went to sleep and I had my door like so my room was right next to Frances and I had my door open because I was like it fighters come bomb I just catch them with a camera if your door open okay in the middle of night editing cuz that's you know during fight week you know how embed it releases they serious yeah I'm filming all of these fighters and then I'm going back up to my room and I'm editing but I'm already editing in my head that's how I'm able to get you know what program you premiere now premiere and you're just doing it just slapping it up as good as you can but see my method when I film is I'm already know when I'm gonna use okay so you making your cuts I know the opening shot I know everything are you writing all this stuff down no I keep it in my head just keep and people be like how can you edit and release it that fast it's like it's already done before I go to my room I just have to go up there and put it together music everything I'm able to just I don't know how I'm able to do it is just some natural I been doing for obviously you have a deeper yeah I have a deeper and I've developed the skill set to it's easy you know they always say oh well you put in 10,000 hours and some you become an expert you know I feel like I put in my 10,000 hours doing all types of different types of shoots to to survive and now this is my arena this is my big stage right but I remember that week Francis never went to sleep I would like bro go to sleep what are you doing with your door open trying to catch you you need me to come in sit on a bed and look at what I was editing cuz obviously I was you filming him as well and it was just funny like just those type of memories that's like what time was it that he wouldn't he never went to sleep all night well you know you get there Monday Tuesday right Saturday so it may be Wednesday and you still up at 3:00 in the morning cuz you fight late he know cuz think about it think about it the last fight is like what Tom 10 o'clock yeah 9 Clark well la time Boston Times midnight yeah midnight yes so he up cuz he can't go to sleep early because he got a fight and that's one thing I discovered about the fight game like dang that does make sense yeah you fightin at 11 p.m. yeah you want to keep yourself on that he's got to say so he's just walking around the hallways big-ass Francis in Boston it's crazy it's like looking back on that stuff and it's like man I've captured a lot of stuff already what's crazy is with him you watch him and then his next fight against Derrick Lewis and neither one of them threw anything Derrick had a fucked up back I really put a little like the Polly Polly Ann Artem fight hey nobody wanted to do anything so I was terrible oh my god I watched it the fact that Artem beat him in a boxing match it shouldn't have been even no contest but Polly's never had power he's never been in hands as brittle you know them hands is brittle yeah but he's also he's never been a guy that you just like keep you off Conor really beat the hell out of him I firmly believe it now you think so yeah I don't I don't like after watching that well also after watching Polly's examination of that fight afterwards you're like winner you thought you lost off you mean you thought you want a decision you tell you got a shit decision like you didn't do anything Conor is what you think kind of gonna do whatever he wants probably do a lot of coke you know what's crazy before I was kid and I before I ever he's gonna have some fun man I think if you if he finds a fight that's fun he's got a hundred million dollars in the bank if he finds a fight that's fun he's gonna do it but the problem with him is it mean they wanted him to do cowboy and there was some talk about him doing a cowboy fight but he wanted to be a main event the UFC wants main events to all be big time championship anything kind of do is big that's what I said but they think that somehow another having no championship title online I would love to spin a day in a life with Dana White well Justin gate let you do that you don't think it's a conflict of interest yeah cuz he's got their own thing that you have seen best sucks cuz I really want to do two anatomy at Dana White just hanging out with him for baby who knows my round he would help embed it and maybe it would help the Tuesday night contender series it would help pump that up air gal Barris has said the perfect thing he said why would the UFC be worried about you you like a lemonade stand in a coca-cola well I think that way but some people don't some people don't want to help other things get going but I'm promoting them report if you stop promoting them and just really concentrating of Bellator and the channels gigantic now because you did so much UFC contests true that's how people look at things well you know my first idea was to tell the UFC let me just film all the fighters y'all not gonna promote this fight week so embedded is ten other fighters letting Adam unify to get them give me a credential and let me just filming him all week so I'm around film these fighters that y'all never gonna post what did they say about that not interesting never nah I didn't get a not interested button oh no it's which is weird because I much love to the UFC because they give me a lot of access and I love every single person over there like the incline and high D D all those people I love them they treat me like knowing cousin they're great people I'm annoying cousin when I'm a fighter and that's the day I haven't been to a lot of fight weeks but it seems like people think I'll go to every fight weekend it's like I only go to ones I can afford or they make sense like if I had the funds I'd be at every fight week filming are you gonna be in Vegas for the John Jones Chagos sometime yeah because I'm nominated for award against you oh really for what the world MMA awards what's the best MMA programming what AM world MMA awards the GRE MMA show yep now you're on it so is that I know that's so weird that is so well I told you confessions of an online date it was don't work the way I thought I was gonna end up on well I hope you win I won a bunch of those meanie you never go is me you embed it Dana why skin' Tuesday can see contender series and in MMH our but I hope you win against me how about that that'd be a how to be I'll smoke weed if I did like I'm doing I'm done I understand you your reluctance to smoke weed I smoked weed maybe five six times until I was thirty years old like a handful of times ever like a couple times in high school you know a couple times afterwards at parties I get it I mean I get it the whole personality thing I when I when I was thirty years old that's when I started smoking like really started smoking weed and I don't think I don't think anybody should do anything if they have an obsessive personality and they're worried I'm not getting that's what it looked into it I mean I don't think you should drink on that but if you can handle it a little bit of weed I think opens up these doorways of creativity and I think that it's very valuable that's what cowboy told me cowboy tell me about mushrooms mushrooms mushrooms as well I think I think psychedelic drugs with their marijuana or mushrooms they're their tools and the way I've always described is like you could take a tool and you could build a house with it right you could take a hammer and you could build a beautiful deck or you could just hit yourself in the dick if you're fucking crazy you could you could abuse a tool but it doesn't mean the tool is bad it means the application is bad and you don't give a hammer to a two-year-old right you don't give a little kid weed and tell them to smoke it every day but I think for a grown adult it's good to participate in something that gives you an altered state of consciousness because it allows you to look at yourself in a fresh way and for someone who's always like trying to be self assessing and objective and always trying to analyze who you are and your thinking and your behavior I think something like marijuana is very important because it allows you to see yourself in this way that maybe you don't ordinarily do allows you to drop your blinders and get a glimpse of how other people see you yeah which is very hard to do it's very hard for especially people that you know you put up your barriers your defenses you have an ego it's hard for you to look at yourself to find the things that you're doing wrong so if you can't find the things that you're doing wrong it's very difficult to grow so a lot of people call that paranoia that effect that marijuana produces a smoke I don't like smoking pot man makes me paranoid for that paranoia I think is awareness and I think you you close those doors of awareness in order to get through your life but that the subconscious is always aware of these things the subconscious is always aware of these things that are fucking with you a marijuana just finds all the problems and just turns the lights on so if I moved to Denver I probably in a smoking weed everybody smile if you do it just a what about edible little edibles careful okay fuck you up I heard a cookie will destroy you I got some shine Rashad Evans that's like my big brother he always told me about the toad Oh five methoxy dimethyltryptamine yeah yeah that's that'll fuck you up - oh he's done that now so yeah you can go into another dimension or you literally can I might I might be the president United States in another dimension who knows well there's no United States and that other dimension there's no States there's no people there's souls don't like a well of souls that's great disembodied entities toad I remember when I kept what the hell is you talk about the toad the toad nobody gets it from a toad though they're really five methoxy dimethyltryptamine they get from usually from laboratories and so yes synthesized with a bunch of precursors but the the the other one and end dimethyltryptamine is the one we see the visuals it's all really yeah it's how long it lands 15 minutes unless you eat it if you eat it what if you did in the float tank you could do that you'd have to do it quick like you'd have to have you seen a photo tank you yeah memory oh that's right yeah um have you done it yet nope it got to God I've seen how today was online how expensive I seen some yeah a lot of by one by one we could always there's a the float lab they have a place in Westwood they have a place and Venice and then there's a giant place that opened up in Pasadena that uses all the float labs what was the name of that place again just float in that place has that that is the biggest float establishment on earth you do it for how long well last night I did two hours damn I like two hours yeah I like to just get in there and and find out what the fuck sigh I was when I was with cheeto varied other day when his teammates did it for like an hour and he was just like I didn't I didn't know where I was I sleep in a dream or your disembodied you know Charlamagne God he was on last week we were talking about it because he's doing this whole mental wellness retreat sort of Center he's like establishing these mental wellness centers he is yes he is because you know Charlamagne his new book shook one is all about him is oh hell his legs i his issues with anxiety and you know anything that allows you to relax and just just center yourself can help you with anxiety and and you know that's one of the things that he said about this the tank was that he's never felt stillness like that that's crazy yeah because you're not you're not feeling your body you know your body is just you try right now yeah he had a crazy life yeah you're that crazy life yeah he had a crazy life and you're also like I said to him about he's the last samurai in terms of radio radio is a dying industry he's the last guy I think to get famous off a radio yeah that's yeah Charlemagne a god is like I saw a little bit of it and I remember he said it he was literally he got fired at 31 he was 31 no jaw with a two-year-old and that's what people like that stuff is inspiring because yeah people be I wasn't unemployed it I was like 29 when I was lost and then I was turning 30 and that's when I got my shit together so to hear Charlemagne and God say I was 31 I had a kid no job like I think so many people in life are so obsessed with getting somewhere fast and I understand it takes time and just to see somebody like that be open enough to say like I was yeah at a low moment in my life like at my age now I used to think when I was 25 37 with young or old oldest fuck you young as hell you're not old at 37 no more yeah you never been he's just always thought if you're a healthy 37 yeah and we were kids our parents by 137 they're working 12 hours a day we fell 50 I felt a little I fell 50 that's I mean thank thank God to the Internet I mean because if it wasn't for the I wouldn't be able to put up these amazing video I would have to go work for one of these companies well it's also the internet allows you to get all this information that allows you to stay healthy you get you get a better understanding about diet nutrition mental health relaxation how important meditation is you know and I think one of the other things that Charlemagne did that's very important is he talked openly about anxiety and he's a famous cool guy he's like a famous guy known for his opinions known for being rash you heard him to say hey I've struggled I've had real mental struggles and mental health struggles I think that's that's a very fragile conversation in the black community mental mental health issues and anxiety and things like that people don't want to admit it right because oh we all but you know even tough it out yeah you want to feel brave and for me man I felt hopeless and defeat many times in my life sure me too and luckily for me out sometimes I say damn I don't have kids luckily you know I've been able to figure it out on my own without having a responsibility to take care of somebody right so I've been lucky in that sense where I haven't you know had a child a son a daughter and I was like and that's what it gives that gives me youth it feels like every day I wake up I'm like I can do what I want to do because only person I'm responsible for is me yeah and that gives me the freedom to be a gypsy I couldn't be a gypsy if I had it no nothing like that you have nah the lights but but you know what if you had a kid you just alter that life and you would have you take great comfort in the fact you can love someone deeply like a child it's a it's a crazy thing the love you have for children yes it changes people lost it changes like I see how you are who's mine when he had his daughter when he's carrying his daughter you know it was very easy man so hard for me not to cry so hard for me not to cry when people win and they they start thanking their mom or that you know the parents hug them or it's like when he was holding his daughter up I'm like oh jesus here comes hide it back that was quite listen man you know memmer when he got in trouble for like the 30 percent or people's going in on him cuz he was like I'm thirty percent I was thirty percent yeah like uh-uh the thing that I can say about being around these fighters I see all the injuries and everything and they people don't understand what they do in a fight well how about the fact that lose my wanted to that fight with a broken foot I know I see crazy I see that he had a broken foot when he fought Tyron motherfucking Woodley and he never stopped coming never stop moving for you had never been able to guess by any stretch of the imagination that he was injured yeah I did I did because I filmed it all you knew it I knew it I just can't release it you seen I'm saying I'm not gonna now after the fight I could say yeah he was injured right but I have that own so many fighters so who don't like well how about so who does ankle I know how crazy is that who knows ankle the week of the fight was giant black and blue completely fucked up where he couldn't walk and then he goes in there and fucks up Marlin Laura well took khabib Connor fight didn't he say he had like a Conor at somewhere always foot 2 or Kirby had a problem with his weight cut I heard did he I think so it was a bad way it was so big he's a mountain very how what is his diet like it's clean from what I see but he's had problems making weight in the past but that was 209 think about that how long ago that was yeah UFC 209 yeah that was the last time he ever had a problem but it's you know he had problems before that story I didn't know yeah I didn't even know could be bit 209 yeah that was when uh the first UFC event I ever went to does he have a nutritionist like in in dagestan does he have someone cooks for him I don't know but you eat with him yeah but that was Robin I was eating all meat and potatoes and ice at what everybody does he trained during Ramadan yes he did that was the whole Dagestan Chronicles people couldn't believe it he trained trained do so he trained trains during the day without eating without drinking water crazy why I'm talking about really hard to like though that dusty initial I want a time yeah I want to turn that whole series into a movie I understand kind of being able to work out like fasted workouts no but fucking no water like training Jesus Christ and playing that basketball right with no water no nothing that is so crazy that's what I said that's why I'm saying a mental toughness like an in when I've seen a faceoff with him and Dustin cuz Dustin I would love to document Dustin because he is a good guy I thought Dustin was huge when you just see him with everybody else and then when he did the face I would be even liked him could be tall it in him everything I'm thinking like man he's gonna have to keep that guy off him Kabhi was just such a good wrestler instead of her charts he's gonna grab him put him on the ground mount him like that dub dummy and smash him now I'm a not a fighter so I can't say it but I kind of feel like that's how I always call use mana black could be as soon as he grabbed you to fight over that's how I feel soon as he grabbed you it's over cuz you're not gonna get away from him and yeah I'm latched to you yeah so but that Demian Maia fight that referee saved is that I know I was in a blocker room like cuz never know you know just what you don't know because the world could have changed if that referee whoever the fuck he is I didn't want to know his name yes my if I see how he took the back yep that's what he does yeah gets lymangood that's what he does to everybody man and that referee that referee separated them and I was sick and Matt Serra went fucking crazy about it and I was always a little tough one but snot it's you don't do that understand fighting I said what you would what would happen he said I would have just held it there the whole time but you just never know well that's how he lost his first fight he lost first five again choked out I know you know you know this is something that people don't know so who's my got one fight that he's lost Kobe Covenant has one fight that he's lost that's what this I'm all about stories like the storyline so the only fight that Kobe Covington lost to was what Leon Edwards yes he chose him out right short notice fight that he took in the UFC and he was injured yet something fucked up that room so he lost via choke yeah lose mine beat Leon Edwards the guy whose mom lost to early on Kobe Covington beat so both of a losses are two people that that's just a weird storyline yeah but that's MMA math yeah I know it's but no I'm not comparing to understand the fact that they both got one loss and they supposedly hate each other and it's two people they've beat it is crazy how fighters careers just change they become a different person and whoever they are like four years ago you really can't compare them whoever they are now the Coby Covington thing is interesting because he really did beat the shit out of Demian Maia you know and you know he really did right haha fail dos Santos I don't know if Demian Maia was three rounds I feel like it was a main event you might be right three rounds three rounds because that was fact yeah yeah but Don's dos Anjos won two rounds right three to two did he think on the scores he took them down and everything yeah he did yeah not with tomorrow tomorrow it was brutal that level change that Kemal do that level like threatened to take down he will piece you up cuz Henry who's got his striking crazy and it's getting better yep all for sure well he did fantastic against Woodley yet Woodley in real trouble from striking yeah well it looks good in his comeback trails though to all these I like Willie man what is that he's doing Willie got mad etiquette Willie didn't want me to film on the week of the fight why just gamemanship Dean Thomas came over to me say Amen Oh Willie don't want you to film them it's done the distraction yeah I know I was mad I was I was kind of I wouldn't say mad I was butthurt because I like Willie I'm like come on man I've been filming you all week and then all of a sudden day before the fight he said he doesn't want anything there you know yeah yeah just wants a cut I mean he had so many distractions he released a fucking album with Wiz Khalifa you know he was a Tauron he was down rap videos he's yeah and he's doing this fucking TMZ Hollywood shit that he does it does a lot of shit but I like that he does a lot of shit because he's recognizing that he's going to have a time outside of fighting and yeah you gotta have up you gotta have a post line he's got a real opportunity to make something happen forever yeah I mean he's a smart guy inspirational God yeah a lot listen I have none but listen I love after the fight with you know Willie mom that was amazing I love I liked Woodley his team his my his his mom was talking with me and it was more both tearing up because like we were talking about him we played it well his mom just goes over and braces tomorrow and Kamara was crying and you know his mom was like she's coming for you baby coming for you you better be prepared for mama wooly look got tears in your eyes right now yeah listen that's the sport man the sport is this this this emotions and soul in this sport it's like it's not just the winning and losing it's like your life is on the line so imagine what I feel when I'm documenting you're right next to them because you know like say like a journalist right that gotta work for show day reporting they interviewing guys I'm in the gym with these guys every day yeah like I'm I'm literally in sweating in a gym with these guys go on with them to eat come on to stay tonight sleeping on a couch like I'm doing all of that stuff to be next to these guys to tell you know why you're doing that well because it's yours yeah this is all yours yes you're doing this you don't working for some fucking company we got some asshole producer who's telling you what to do it wouldn't be the same you wouldn't do it I window not only would you not do it you wouldn't be as motivated you wouldn't but more importantly it wouldn't be the singular vision that you get when you know that it's coming from one person yeah when you you know something's coming from one person you get this like you get a feeling like this is this is will Harris he's there he's filming this he's editing it he's putting it together he's putting it out here's the video that's a beautiful thing about the internet man this really is it's amazing it really is it doesn't exist in any other media there's nothing like that there's nothing like that ever in the history of the world if you wanted to put out something like you've done you needed a gang of people behind you needed a network you need reduction companies someone to choose you you know someone there's probably four other guys that wanted to do what you're doing five of the guys and a dozen everybody wants it and they have to pick you and these other guys would be trying to like fuck you up from behind and it happens yes it happens and that's what I listen I try to portray that message to every single person that messaged me this is not easy like it's a lot of sacrifice in this you have to be willing to put in years to do this I'm going on two years in August 14th will be full two years of committing to anatomy of a fight and I'm is it a baby stage to me like I could cause of what I know it can become yeah you know millions of subscribers are firmly firm them so to me I'm like you know what I'm not gonna stop no matter what I'm not gonna stop I want this to be the biggest thing ever I want a god it's not even in on a radar right now I want to discover him in him he become a heavyweight champion in a world or a UFC champion or Bellator champion and that's the thing that I get out of it all is the fact that I can just create what I want yes with whoever you know you know I thought about it does I mean I need to put more women on a channel women fighters and promote more women because I feel like they don't get promoted as well I want to get Amanda Nunez Ashley Yoder I was supposed to go with her and Dan Henderson and Temecula I wish I could have got them all but that's the type of like because it's the freedom to do it yes they don't have to pay me yeah I just go do it and make it and put it out there and hopefully somebody latches on and said we want to be a part of this this movement and an enemy among Valentina Shevchenko a nurse they are some piece I just want a filmer doing that little dance I know it's crazy right that fucking head kick on Jessica I look whoa I was supposed to go get her Eric makes it and her coach she was like I'll come down in Vegas and get Jessica that was a tough one I like Jessica I was you know she took it well though she took it well but she was severely outclassed that was a bad man up his levels levels well I don't think there's a level higher than Valentina there there's people on her level but there's no level higher that that's that was a little debatable match against Nunez the second one right yes like the one night yeah people say she should have won very very close fight but Nunez is a bigger girl Nunez is a legit 135 where she's not gonna make 125 you know and when she knocked out cyborg everybody was like what in the fuck she flatlined so I works and she's jump excuse me she's chomping at the bit to do it again listen she's like set it up again I'll do it again Ward it what do you think if cyborg left the UFC where does she go 1/2 C maybe but who's what fighters is over don't get some fighters or they'll find something there's some Muay Thai champion little fighter and did some she was not asked women I talked to sideboard she wants that fight back demanda noon that's why yes you want adventure she does it might happen since it was Ryan Rock'em Sock'em robot it was Rock'em Sock'em robots but only one person was rockin some Sam from her in yeah she was she was moving towards and Amanda was just doing the perfect thing to deal with that style I thought it was gonna be a harder fight I thought if a man who's gonna beat her is gonna be by decision oh really I really did I saw you were shocked I didn't think she's gonna Flatliner who never even cyborg always gets up she fought Jurina barge in in lion fight who's up you know world class top of the food chain Muay Thai fighter and she didn't have a single muy Thai fight and bars knocked her down twice and borders chasing her to the last second half of the Bell and she just seems so durable I just never thought we'd see on faceplant Amanda Nunez hits like she's got bricks in her gloves just caught she just drops those fucking and my nicest person in the world so you and everything she fought so nice and you know when when her and cyborg were talking on that shit you know she seemed like cool and calm and I just you wait just you wait she just knows mad she hits when she fucked up Ronda Rousey like that I was like good lord that was a fight where I remember the the run-up to that fight that was one the first fights that when WME bought the UFC and they were really promoting the shit out of Ronda Rousey Ronda was like walking around some big mansion looking at the TV and and they were gonna say this is the big comeback fight and I was like you guys should be paying attention to your first ever openly gay UFC champion who happens to be a fucking murderer happens to be a chick that merked miesha tate happens to be a chick that flatlines people she's probably one of the hardest punchers in the women's in any women's combat sport I mean he fuck man she hits fucking hard you you know you got to go back to Ann Wolf's one punch ko and boxing to see a woman will hit these beasts but you got to go to that to see a woman who it's that hard and Amanda loves to fight man you see she loves it she fucking loves it she feeds off of it and when they were setting that fight up and they weren't giving Amanda Nunez any credit you're promoting her at all I'm like you guys are crazy this is a bad fight for Ronda this is a bad fight because first of all that chicks a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt ronon's not gonna submit her and she's probably not gonna get a dominant position on her and when they're standing up on the feet this chick is gonna throw bricks and it's not a good place for Ronda yeah that was like it looked bad she's not gonna stumble in how she was stumbling she's out alone you know there was a lot wrong there a lot wrong their motivation wise a lot wrong there to go from the Holly home kayo today to that she'd have had a warm-up fighter I'm sure more so reason why boxing has warm-up fights what is the percentage do you give Holly Holm a chance against Nunez well Holly Holm is a world-class fighter you know you got to give her a chance get anybody if she survived against Germaine de Ronda mean knocked her down and Germaine de round to me is a legit world champion more time was that the fight what the lake the late after the past twice she got she got a point taken and she wouldn't want I think she won that fight I think she won anyway anyway she dropped her twice she dropped to his straight left and she dropped it with a question mark kick I thought she won that fight but fucking murderer man it's hard to it's hard to pick against imagine Holly shocked the world twice she could look she couldn't I liked her too she's an amazing perky hates the cameras does she she won't let me film her why she won't let nobody film are just distractions just don't like she don't like that's and that's one of the girls I would love to to do like you know cuz this is like fun for me sometime I would love you to get this person on be able to let the world get to know this fighter right like I get it from their perspective though because it is a distraction it's another thing another factor to consider yeah some people don't mind it like something I bet Henry so who dope robably likes it yeah in a way some some I've gotten away from going to fight week because it's kind of the same thing I've done in a lot so I like to just go way before a fight doctor mister stuff and and release it during the fight week what is it like at a bad motherfucker ranch McDonald Cowboys place I haven't been there yet I've only been to Jackson's oh okay ah listen I got to go there for like a week yeah and shilling and that's the place to go yeah they're all doing mushrooms jump a jet ski some fresh eggs eating stuff like that I would love to do that Cowboys is cowboy Dan one of them people like if you see his face you think he's mean like sometimes but he's the coolest dude I ever seen nice man he's so nice like that's crazy like when him and when him and Mike Perry fall I had access to Mike Perry that fight leak and I reached out to a Cowboys team and said I want to be neutral honest and film both of y'all that week in cowboy say yeah no problem so he let me hang with him I was with Perry after the fight they met they talked I had that little famous moment where they met and you know cowboy was like you lit the fire in me and repairs like what it's like you talking all that shit let the fire in me when he made that Instagram videos like I'm coming for you yeah all that stuff so that's probably wanted to if if people ask me what my favorite moment is it's probably the Mike Perry week because of just I had both of them and then I had the raw emotion of Mike Perry out that he lost in a locker room like where he he looked at thick he looked at the sky was like damn God you can let me out the first round like there's a bear but it was a funny guy man he is he's a start just start but he can do anything I feel like yeah I mean he's gonna get better and fighting is he gonna be in movies well he's gotten better since the move to Jackson's he really has he's got more but are you in banded went back where to fusion exhale and Florida he went back to his original team and the cowboy fight interesting yeah and wonder why I don't know but he's not at Jacksons anymore he's a fusion ex well I'm not aware of fusion I don't know you know if they have good trainers or anything that's where Jacare training okay yeah I like what they were doing for him though Jackson's I like how they were giving him a more Master man calculus yeah they give it a more calculated approach making them fight more intelligently more more of a game plan because he's always gonna be wild and he's always gonna have that power that Paul failed to fight yeah that was what but if I wanted to see that fight of Felder first of all felt there's a different weight class but if Felder didn't throw that spinning backfist and bounce it off his forehead and snap his arm in half you know they should run it back huh well I don't think Felder should be fighting 170 you know because I don't think Perry has a chance in hell making 155 now that Felder can teal versus Perry's ago that's a great advice and they hate each other I like that especially after till coming off getting knocked out by moms Vedado two losses in a row yeah so that's a great fight for two losses in a row but the big one the big one was Maas Vidal cuz miles without flatlined him that was a I thought that was a disrespectful the way the the they had set it up where the the bookies had set it up where tyron woodley was the underdog I was like you guys are out of your fog in Dallas I mean you're on E you're out of your fucking mind I don't know what hype you're buying into them we've never seen this guy on the ground we've never seen this guy with a guy like Woodley and like Woodley hits hard history hard he's so fast and wrestling wise I mean it's not even close I thought that was crazy I'm like yeah he beat cowboy yeah he looked great yeah he beat Wonder Boy but you know I mean it was a fight where he clipped and Wonder Boy with one really good shot you know he hit him with one really good shot and a good five rounds I wouldn't call him a hype train but I feel like the promotion's they did it with picot now he got two straight losses well you get excited about a god because a guy has something special and sometimes those guys that have something special they never like Uriah Hall never really became what everybody thought he was going to become we saw Uriah Hall in the Ultimate Fighter like holy shit this is the next Anderson Silva yeah look at this guy's wheel kicking people in the head he built like a Greek god he moves like a fucking gazelle he just had this perfect style like holy shit look at this guy but never quite became who we thought and then the Paulo Costa fight you seem to getting beaten down by Costa he was fucking him up there with the Japs yeah perhaps Costa can take it yeah I was just like em versus Yoel Romero good googly moogly is that a crazy fight that's here that's gonna be in California huh yeah whoa with Natan pennis that's the bottle about battle of the best bodies ever just yes he inspired me how you look like that still at 40 something you're hurt he's got the freak genetics man he talked about it on the podcast he's like whoa look Cuba everybody like that you're saying that everybody look like that it's just amazing genetics and then Costa well it's also like when you think about what Yoel has gone through that Cuban wrestling program man they they they just call everyone who's not an elite five-star super a plus athlete you ain't making it he was telling me that the the people that are the best they eat more they get better food and they eat more and they sleep in better places and they set it up who you're training with all these other people that want what you have so you're around them all the time have you seen that podcast it's amazing cuz that's what Joey was Joey has to translate with yo L did he speak some English yeah he speaks a little but you know he needs help and Joey would help him you know I never met him yo well now I haven't met him and he's a great guy yeah he's super friendly and he's man he does shit to people inside the arc you think he can get any of their money oh the 27 million from the supplement company he for people don't know what we're talking about he won a lawsuit against the supplement company just like we were talking about before with Sean O'Malley yeah they gave him tainted supplements and he 127 million dollars it's a big company see we we thought that it was a smaller company they would just go under this is a big fucking company and you know their company makes 100 million dollars a year and they they they owe him 27 can you settle out of a settle like the judgment was 27 million but could they be like oh we gave you 10 that's a good question I don't know how that works if they do you probably could take that and then sue them for the other 17 I think they're supposed to pay 27 million I just don't date I think they have to go back you should never fight again well maybe he wants to though he wants to be the champ you know he's got a legit shot I think he beat Whittaker sauce when I say I think he won a second one I think he won as anyone what about Rockhold going to like everybody I don't know man the way he smashed Rock holding that files look good Lord and he kissed them well Rock yeah history flatline Rocco was talking about as a shit but Rocco said it was like hitting someone was made out of steel you said he was so fucking on yeah Rocco told me that I've never felt the human like that in my life that super 5 star elite athlete that's what that is that is is elite as you get when that guy goes into the cage you see him move around his neck no Nick you go how the fuck is he 185 pounds dude I weigh 200 pounds how the fuck is your elder Merrill 185 pounds that's insane insane I've seen a side-by-side with him a khabib like when they were younger and I was just like man this dude is massive he's a babe is a bear yeah he's could be was thick as fuck yeah yo Wells on another level freaking like he a gargoyle mm-hmm he like built like a little gargoyle something like well he knocked up Chris Weidman with that flying nails like Jesus crap he's just he is this like slow these traps on you and explodes where do you feel like like these vets the sport is changing somewhat so now you're starting to see all these these vets try to figure it out like why I've been going to lie every way Luke I've been going wide heavy though really yeah he looks like Izzy's got like because obviously this is what Dana White's contender series all these fresh guys are starting to the sport is changing so fast it's like now these guys are starting to become the the Tito Ortiz the Chuck Liddell's of the now it's like this new fresh cuz thing about it it's like Jordan said is going all there's gonna be somebody better than me when Michael Jordan it's gonna be somebody way better than Jon Jones one day Wow I think about that the evolution of the sport well that's what we've seen right when you go back to the the old days the tank avid days and then you see what you see today I mean that's unrecognizable you're talking about 1993 to 2019 what is it going to be like in 2030 the Phil Baroni days oh my god I mean what we're gonna look at in 10-15 years from now it's probably just me you're seeing it now with the the Tuesday night contender series and with these guys coming out of one that you never even heard of before the Johnny walkers where you come yeah exactly that not so you can guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez like was a monster never heard of him before right there's so many guys coming up right now that no one's heard of that are just dedicated and driven and focused and they also have a higher benchmark you know they've seen the mighty Mouse's yeah they've seen these guys and that they they know that this is this is the level they're trying to achieve instead of you know looking back at the early days you know we're guys just weren't as complete as they are now that's correct do you think what is the Dana has said plenty of times there will never be a cross-promotion you think it's will it ever be pop would you like to see that yes I would one versus UFC champion look I'm the worst businessman of all time I'm not about protecting any brands they don't give a fuck I would be like yeah come on let's fight it's right let's all make money I don't care you know I'm the wrong guy for that like if I was the I would allow to make the UFC lose money I'd pay people more I'm you know I'm not the right guy for that job yeah and I think that I would have a lot more weight classes first of all I wouldn't have a jump between 85 and 205 that to me looks crazy like why don't you have 10 pounds every 10 pounds 165 is neat yes 165 is Kevin Lee would be easily well 55 65 75 85 all the way on up 95 205 215 220 there's more fight yes more fights more champions and I think it's the right way to do it also I feel like it's weird that we call it welterweight when it's 170 and now glory calls it welterweight at 170 - well what - wait like in the Sugar Ray Leonard Tommy Hearns days it's 147 that's walk away yeah because Mayweather was a welterweight champion that's what he foxing that's boxing that's the fuckin legitimate original name for that weight class is the boxing name they called it welterweight that's they called it middle mate they called it cruiserweight it was their names yeah so we've done is some weird thing where we just fuck you I'm gonna call it Walter way it's like you know I live on Brown Street yeah fuck you Brown streets over here now Huck we have to brown streets that's ridiculous yeah doesn't make any sense well I wouldn't they create 165 they should I don't know I don't like would would be the one my relationship with Dana White is we're very good friends and she loved the guy to death I've loved him forever he got me in a commentary if it wasn't for him I'd have never done it but I don't I don't do what he does I don't want that job you guys get it I don't agree with them on a lot of shit I don't agree with them on weight classes for sure I don't think I don't agree with them on some of the rules I don't there's a lot of shit I don't agree with yeah you know there's a lot of things I don't agree with in in the sport in general I'm changing my opinion though about bare-knuckle I you think that yeah you like me now no oh you don't know this isn't what for MMA I feel like people would get to cut up yeah I'm lolly barely guy hey you see his face yeah what did you see Chris leoben's face oh that was brutal the Chris doesn't pull up that picture from Chris leoben's thing today Dakota Cochrane opened up just a fuckin river on his head it's crazy I just feel like imagine seeing a woman in her face look good we've already seen him and we've seen girls in my time particularly look at that gash dude that is crazy I mean that looks like you fell off a motorcycle and hit a tree and these fans just want more blood well it's just the knuckles cut your face up so easy and elbows cut your face up as well and you can definitely look we've seen some horrific gashes inside the UFC but I think it's harder to hit someone with an elbow and cut them up like that it's like you're getting a lot of punches in you're not getting a lot of elbows not getting as many he can especially with ground-and-pound there's a real good argument for bare knuckle but when you watch these bare-knuckle fighters they're breaking their fucking hands almost every fight everybody's getting their hands broken artem loves it he's an animal yeah Artemis last night you know what's crazy you know they called him the goat and it's this funny trolling with it but he's a game opponent he even fought Michael Johnson toughest head tough fight for Michael he's tough look he the Russian hammer is a good man for that dude he's a hammer yeah look at Paul you go yeah and he said I got only hit clean once yeah he got hit clean a couple of times but the point is he didn't do shit that was bad I'm a fan of Paulie Malignaggi as a boxer you know and I wonder there's commentators he's very very very good as a commentator and I think he beat Adrien Broner I think when he fought Brona I think he appointed him but that's what those big-ass gloves he doesn't have a no disrespect it doesn't have a good body for the sport yeah he's not genetically gifted it's just not he's like he's got an awkward body like athletic Lee he is in an awkward way he's just really smart and really tough and he did the very best with what nature gave him yeah and he became world champion yeah he became a legitimate world champion and he knows so much about boxing but it's a different world when you know the owner bare knuckles like this proves that we have the best combat sport in the world I've been a fighter there's some Thai guys because our fighters beat a boxer yeah yeah but they don't it's just you can't say it's the best combat sport in the world because you can't let them elbow and kick and punch and knee it's like the thing about boxing right the sweet science this thing about it is if you only let a guy box and with boxing gloves you get to see some shit like when you see Floyd fight where guys are punching them and they can't fucking hit him he's right in front of them and he's moving away because his knowledge and understanding of what you can do with those two weapons is just off the charts he's got it focused like a goddamn laser beam and you just can't touch him he's better than anybody that's ever been in terms of like he's defensive like he gets hit less than anybody who's ever fought and had 50 wins there's nobody to get how many more fights did he have after he beat Canela that's a good question he fought Pacquiao after that yes he fought back you know you fought Berto he fought was it a home to fight these fight Tim Bradley would you Bradley fell he followed him on Donna right twice so that after no no I think Maidana fight was before that was one of the things that gave a lot of people that thought Cannell had a shock as Maidana cracked him in that first round remember yeah or not first round first fight round right before the bill yeah right before the bell and wobble the mold they stumbled yeah both of them were before after they were yeah it looks so that's what I'm saying Floyd has some fights yeah after so yeah oh that's right the Guerrero fight Canelo record was crazy giving me yeah look man Floyd is a motherfucker dude he's a motherfucker you might not like the style or the way he fights but the boxers that appreciate how difficult it is do what he does just he's a he's a bit new benchmark yeah he's a new benchmark in terms of how to get out of that sport with the getting the the very least amount of damage and fighting the most masterfully and he's really really changed the way Canelo fights you see Canelo against Danny Jacobs can I was using a lot of his share stuff I mean he's like that's how you do it man it'd be crazy when people like Oh Floyd should fight this version of Canelo is like that was way bigger yeah come on it's totally different yeah I was a legit middleweight now you know what the triple G Canelo trilogy reminds me of remember when a pack our fault who was it they knocked him out a blanket yeah one one no Marc Marquez they fought three times Pacquiao won twice Marquez flatline flatline I mean I was like damn what if triple G get his third chance and it happens because this is similar stories like he won he won twice everybody said Marquez beat him twice and then they finally won't fought again in any big yeah and Pacquiao still fighting duh yeah how is that puppy that I know that's a tough fight that's dangerous you can win it yeah he can win it he didn't just knock out his last appointment yeah yeah listen Pacquiao still good he's still good and after gets shoulder surgery you know I mean he's as good as he's ever been yeah I just hate that he keep using that excuse that he his shoulder was messed up again when he fought Floyd yeah it would have been interesting to see him a hundred percent healthy against Floyd but Floyd was smart with him it's like not yet not yet not yet not yet anywhere that people say he waited till he got old but Pacquiao sold it in Floyd I'm Floyd's older pakya yeah yeah yeah yeah boys older 2pac yeah but he did wait until Pacquiao got a little worn yeah um tree got knocked up are Marquez like okay yeah let's go it looks like now's the time it still wasn't close well is also you know Floyd is incredibly smart when it comes to promotion he's not gonna let anybody get 5050 with him hmm no no that's the whole Eddie heard shit though yeah that's what and then what can happen well that's shit it's crazy what did you hear about about him getting hurt before the fight I heard that he had a pen exoti attack yeah I heard it and I heard he got knocked out that's what I heard yeah we're talking about Anthony Joshua yes I'm saying yeah but for the people isn't it we heard that Eddie Hearn is the promoter of Anthony Joshua and what I had heard was he he got flatlined in training or dropped and hurt bad and training yeah and it was like leading up to the fight like very close to the fight whether a week or so out with Jimmy went well I heard that happened and then he went to Miami to finish the rest of his Kent after that really so that's what I think his dad was bitching about like Josh well I'm not 100% certain but his in the ring when he was getting into it and just like I told you he won right for the fight he was you know they were supposed to they was trying to reschedule the fight yeah they probably should have their problem when you get dropped like that cuz you see high like the punches you got hitting weight they don't seem like punches that would you also looked a little out of it out of it what's all that it's easy to say that the rounder yeah good and he's a bad motherfucker dude that guy throws combinations man Andy Ruiz is a bad motherfucker you know people just get confused and they look at that belly if you took all that fat away and you saw what was underneath it and he fought the same way but he weighed 220 you'd go wow he's got a receipt on Instagram videos I'm training how fast is this I'm like fast as fuck confusing listen when I when they told me to film him I think he might have had 20,000 subscribe on 20,000 followers and then in one night yeah like a million I'm like hey like and he seemed like a humble guy he keep like trying to promote Snickers Snickers like everyday Snickers Nick he want that sponsorship Snickers need to give my sponsors why he like Snickers he's a big boy he's a big boy lucky what do you think happens they're gonna do a rematch yeah and uh yesterday yesterday Ruiz jr. said i'ma beat him worse cuz I'm gonna be in better shape he can't box and I was like whoa he was Olympic gold medalist he can fire he can fight he can find him bugs I just well it sucks cuz I was gonna cover big baby Miller I think he's fucked if he fights Deonte I think Joshua just can't he can't hold up under that firepower no Deonte hits people and it's like he's got some fucking mortal kombat superpower in his glove it's crazy yeah he got that old slave genetics well he's got that Tommy Hearns frame twos I got giant Tommy Hearns where's all that leverage all that Shh all that torque he hit so goddamn hard when you look at a guy that has what does he have like 40 wins 39 chaos it's something like that 41 wins 40 chaos or something crazy well you know the only money didn't ko is as we talked about before was Tyson Fury but if you looked at the count if you had a real clock and you hit stop or you hit start when he went down instead of relying on the referee to go one two maybe Tyson would have gotten up because he would have known that it was eight when it was eight because the referee was saying eight it was already 10 you know it was like one two by the time he got to eight and nine and in Tison stood up ten had long been past so technically yeah but that was also the case with Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson you know yeah I talked to Mike Tyson knocked down Buster Douglas Buster Douglas did not get up by the count of 10 no on a real count of 10 an actual 10-second count but his obligation is to get up by the referees count not by a clock did she use a fucking clock why don't the use of goddamn clock early on I used to document Tyson's trainer Stacy McKinley mm-hmm after he got out of prison I was and he was I used to always bring that up with Holyfield in him like but he was down ten seconds I don't mean shit we don't know I can about that like they they don't use that as excuse like he was true because he could have gotten up eight or nine if they actually a real clock yeah it's not like he was out cold and he woke up at eight you know it's a he was he was just gathering his thoughts and trying to get his brain straight imagine if in MMA if they had stand-in eight why do the fuck doesn't boxing have a clock like would they have a clock when it counts the ring right the ring time sweetie around so soon is somebody fall have a fucking real clock that shows seven eight nuts you don't leave it up to the gods and a ref you look in the corner and say art set and you pick it up for me yeah the red meaning but shouldn't be the ref counting it should be like a voice like a digital voice one two three like so it's a hundred percent ten seconds yeah that's so crazy because one guy could have a fast count one guy gonna have a slow count that's doing I could have an envelope in his suit pocket in a locker room just make it a little bit slower so you just never know I looked this up when we were talking about this couple months ago supposedly that there the time official is supposed to start the count immediately and then the invert n ring referee picks it up once he's got that is what happened the problem is the referee does not do it to ten seconds right he doesn't do it to actual to an actual clock that's what happens when the guy goes down says go to a neutral corner and then he picks it up three four be off by two seconds easily yeah like of a guy celebrating and then he like he spent four seconds trying to get him towards corner you but that's on the guy that's on the guy that makes sense but you once the guy goes to neutral corner the fucking clock should be like a legitimate second clock yeah yeah that's crazy or you flatline people like Walter I don't get up yeah says it comes from a gentleman's rule so I don't know if it was supposed to be ten seconds yes so it's parking your horse in front of the fucking solution get out of here it's 2019 we got clocks bitch this is ridiculous it doesn't make any socks in this shady well boxing Shady's fuck one thing I like what glory does though they incorporate five judges these five genes I think the UFC should do that as well I think three judge is ridiculous when you see bad decisions it's a lot like I don't know who the lady Angela Hill just fought against I thought it was a bad decision and I looked at that I was like why don't they have five judges five judges here you know and have five judges who know what the fuck they're doing but you said it would even like they named 170 well - wait yeah what they want to do well boxing uses three judges - it's more the better it's not like it's expensive to have a lot of judges because memory nets that scorecard they gave to the draw - Canelo yes Tim Bradley nope yeah Tim Bradley all the one know Mayweather you can smell yes yeah that lady she'd vanished Indian she did it again right yeah she did it again with Tim Bradley and Manny Pacquiao yeah yeah when Tim Bradley beat Manny Pacquiao everybody was like what what even Bradley knew eating when FI no no he didn't win that fight but the Canelo one was ridiculous that was a great out of draw so that's one of those weird things where it's like all someone has to do was put a shitload of money on a majority decision so look you know that Floyd's not gonna knock Canelo out he doesn't really knock who's gonna win but he's gonna win put the money on a majority decision he's one person has to be dirty all you need is one person is dirty and you can win Millions boxing is so dirty it's so old you can't be dirty in UFC dough right really mmm the judging yeah I don't think I think the judging is incompetent I don't believe it I've never had any indication no one's ever said to me they think it's dirty I think it's incompetent incompetent there's a lot of incompetent judges but there's also we got state judges yeah it'd be weird with the refs sometimes I see I was like who's his arrest well like we were talking about with kymaro who's man and Demian Maia that's a ridiculous thing to separate those two that's ridiculous just let him play it out also you got a constrictor you've got a guy whose whole deal is to get you in a bad position and then he gets in you in a bad position he's working his way he's trying to work his way he's got one hook in he's got your back it was Tom it's time left it's time a break break break fucking break you break are you crazy fuck are you here for what are you here for you just won Rock'em Sock'em robots you go watch bare-knuckle boxing get out of here bitch I just re-watched the ask Robert I think they could have stopped it when he slammed on me he could have couldn't stopped it coulda stopped it when he was fuckin runners he could have stopped it but that was a lot of time left yep could I was in the locker room we're robbing when he came back could have stopped it but I I watched that with Herb Dean I had herb in here and we watched it and herb changed my mind because I was thinking that he wasn't out because you know it's like they got to run that back and in komarow was saying they got to run that back that that he was out over that he wasn't our arm dropped yeah but then I watched it with her but he's like this is not a normal way your arm drops like you're right you're right so he could have just been out for a second he was out for a second and then just woke back up yeah pop back up and the way aspirin said it is when herb started coming over drum he knew he was out herb started coming over to him he let up on the grip a little bit and that's what Robbie poverty consciousness yeah I believe Ben I believe Ben and I the arm that is you don't let your arm just drop like that I think he was out first so as soon as he picked his arm up he woke back up cuz he was like I think thumbs up Ben clamped on his head been squeezing his head the arm drops herb comes over look at him he thinks he's gonna stop the fight he lets up a little bit because he thinks he's already out and then he pops back up to life and then herb stops to fight Rob he's like what the fuck I think that's what that's one of the most confusing back-and-forth even during a fight I watched you and a nominee not he was no no he was yeah yeah I believe you right there well you're also looking through this cage right yeah it's over there what is happening he's out he's out he's up he's not out herb was in a bed ain't ya he was in the back he's the gold standard though yeah he's in troops the best yeah and he's so calm about how he handles things never emotional always logical you know Zoe we breaks things down he's the gold standard especially now that John McCarthy is not in it anymore yeah he's doing a great job at Bellator doe yeah I mean what bout ballot or he used to be there was like a clear difference between the UFC and Bellator not anymore man you know Raphael Lovato and Mousasi you see that yeah sorry man I love a fucking fight mask ring especially have to Mousasi a beat Rory MacDonald which Rory probably shouldn't have been fighting him at 185 pounds is the wrong way yes musashi is way bigger than him and Mousasi is beaten guys real top-flight guys at 205 yeah and then you know you got Malema who just knocked out Michael venom page rude oh no promotion on them and I was sitting there like man I wish I could have just got my hands on and told his gosh story yeah there's nobody new Lima the murderer bro he's a murderer his brother in the UFC right yep yeah yeah Diego but Douglas is as good as anybody alive at 170 pounds I really believe that crazy yeah I like man I like God champion and Scott Coker doing yep I do too I wish that they would do the same thing that one is doing with the weight cuts it's cut all that weight cut bullshit out just stop it that's not necessary Michael Shannon cut a lot of weight too yeah big boy so when he got hit heavy that's I always like one-eighth when I see him get hit like that I see how much weight these guys cut cuz I'm around it yeah and I'm like then he didn't really get hit like that he got hit on the temple dough right he got hit ball hit him hit ball hit him on the temples hard yeah they both hit hard it's one of those crazy games where you know whoever connects first and put the other guy out especially after Chandler knocked out his brother it was a big deal yeah that was a wolf double Cham use a lot of double champions now your honor started it yeah you got Bader he did a double champion you got pitbull yeah you got sued oh yeah dude Amanda noona noona yeah it's a lot yeah Connor obviously yeah Daniel Cormier Cormier yeah crazy it's crazy now he threatened in the beach I would say if because they gotta have to do if so who knows out for a year they gonna have to do it in a room at bantamweight yes so who you do al Jermaine and Peter Yan you could do that that's a good fight yeah that's a very good work where does Cody garbin fit in the picture that's a good question I think Cody has to win one just will get a fight yeah he got knocked out twice in a row Pedro yeah pedro muñoz and you know obviously the TJ Dillashaw one comes in a question now the TJ gets popped for EPO but what did he say on Chael Sonnen spine he had a good he had an explanation they took it because you're trying to make the way yeah must've been just so drained trying to make that wait you really do have like TJ - man I do - Oh sad I was supposed to film in a week before he lost it so who don't they me he was just like ah let's just do the next camp he looked like a goddamn skeleton going into that for sure when he all those pills was on the table yeah it was like 500 bottles yeah I was like why would you just to maintain his body keep it alive while he's just basically draining all the life out of it to make to 125 pounds he's owning up to it though yeah you know like that you got a face show truth sometimes he also had a really fucked up shoulders both shoulders are fucked up and he went up getting surgery and one of them he had the video he was fat lookin and with the moustache I was like what the hell is going on did he just go to get kidnapped by aliens and drop back off well when you lose that much weight your body wants to hold your body is essentially you went into starvation mode yeah your body wants to hold on to every fucking calorie it can it slows your metabolism down I just think you're doing a giant to service for the rest of your life with your body when you do that I think it's very unhealthy brutal cuts yeah take years off your life yeah that's what a lot of fighters say man is a Shan Soriano there's a hard knock 365 a member one whose mom was getting ready for the woody fight that's my favorite time to film during a fight because that's the true raw emotions isn't the weight cut yeah everything else is standard they got to do open workouts media it's boring stuff both that weight cut you see these people's souls and ooze mine in there Ben Askren they all in the PID all cutting weight together I'm just thinking this crazy and you've seen it the picture with a cowboy and Tony Ferguson when it was side-by-side cutting weight that's one neighbor that respect goes to the all-time high with the fighters because they all in there trying to yeah feed a families man is showing win money dude Tony Ferguson scares the fuck out of me that guy don't get tired he doesn't get tired could be perspective lights him looks like they got run through a fucking meat night a brick hands right bricks what the hell is he doing punching and got big-ass hands fire every day when he has big wide hands so many people been screaming for me to please do it an anatomy of Tony Ferguson he's so interesting - that's why situations worse like I got to see that how Ella no man is weird I'm in a weird position because like for example I like Connor but damn that relationship you got what Kirby was horrible I can't yeah I understand it just it sucks because your film the Connor team before I ever met Kabir I was on rowdy all these guys on the channel right yeah and now I'm team kabhi you know when you get invited to somebody's country be around a family eat the fool with their brothers that's sacred yeah like you got to respect that so I respect it Tony Fergus is the different one they talk shit but I would love to get Tony Ferguson on hashanah do you think that compromises your objectivity or do you think that's just the price that you pay to be that close I know I think this the price you pay but I hope I wish fighters will understand what I'm trying to do I think they do and they definitely will now yeah I'm trying to build a platform from all fighters I don't care if y'all fighting it get ugly you throw a dolly through a bus you talk about somebody's family and all this stuff I get that man I can't touch that yeah but when it comes to like somebody like Tony Ferguson versus kabhi I want to have the access to go with Tony and Eddie and film that and talk to them and get inside the mindset of who Tony is no one has really promoted Tony Ferguson I feel like I could do a amazing job spending a day or two with Tony Ferguson and talking about life and I think you could too but I don't know if Tony be Intuos into it Tony is a real rebel he's a very unit he may give you a little bit but not everything you want yeah - he doesn't want anybody in close with him he's got secrets - in terms of how he prepares and how he trains he he had one of my good friends document on his last fight in Vegas the one when he fought Pettis he filmed he'd document on the whole whole time so he had a camera crew with well I think after his last fight I think people are starting to understand the cowboy fight this guy is something truly special yeah everybody knew but if you look at his the last time I mean Luke Thomas had something on his Twitter documenting the last time how crazy it is if you look like who was champion last time Tony first I mean he's a monster his last loss was to Michael Johnson yeah how long ago was that oh I think it was 2013 that's crazy that Michael Johnson beat him he beat Dustin Poirier Michael Johnson Dustin Poirier at lightweight yep Kayode and Edson Barboza yep yep and his his tough losses was th e Hui he could have beat gates he he had him beat they're both back and forth I was in there could be fight and I really I mean you could that's debatable that he stung them but specially tagged and tagged him but it wasn't like I know let me hit him it's a fight yeah but could be mauled 'm you grabbed one when it was it just was just shows how good could be bit have to give up deserve this yeah give up that's when I was like who the hell you know I have to be champion but I didn't know who could be worse I was document Michael Johnson buddy Kemp I know he's telling them to give up why he's beating the fucker you know I deserve this right like Mike on the bottom and hit him back like under it's like I was thought about what he's beating the shit out of Conor let's talk now yeah knows let's talk boom he's just beat so you know I was backstage when he came back in the locker room yeah after the melee people have never seen that footage yet what was that like it was crazy I remember Cormier was like we'll turn the camera off because it was just too much going oh yeah I've never released it yet because out of respect of the courts so I asked I showed us a snippet yeah high budget I don't know I just like their eye we need him to fight again we need to get past all that nonce yeah trust me I can't wait to show the world one day how crazy that was listen well we just did three hours man whoa leave that look it's three ten o'clock Time Warp in this place this was everything I was hoping it was going to
