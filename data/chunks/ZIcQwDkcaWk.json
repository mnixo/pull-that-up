go three two one Lex handsome as ever thank you well dressed always feel like a slob when I'm around you do you dressed like that in real life or only when you do podcasts yeah so I have two outfits this and black shirt and jeans it's a slick outfit there's nothing nothing more classic than a dark suit with a white shirt and a black tie is that a black tyres at a dark blue black tie black tie black suit black tie it's armored yes makes me feel like focuses the mind mmm professional yeah I'm taking this seriously yes yes yes like you're you're fucking for real man yeah I know what's and shit yeah I got notes and shit but but given the suit like I like to get like dirty like I like to work in a car or whatever like yeah I don't want to I like I'd love to get in a fight in this this isn't like me trying to protect myself from the from the messiness of the real world I understand this is just looks good just makes you feel is it um flexible like you know they make clothes they're flex yeah you can move in at you move in it oh nice and I can I mean you showed me how you can choke me last time with the tie did you get a breakaway tie no I didn't but you know I kind of let you have that one because I think I can defend it pretty long well you're probably very good at defending jokes yeah no no front would like with the tie I don't have a system yet I'll have to talk to Jon Danaher they develop a tie all you have to do man is just take the back of the tie cut it put a little piece of velcro on each end you got the same time that's nap no but I think you going under the tie to try to start to choke mm-hmm actually I mean you're making yourself fall in there but like maybe ten arm bar or something like that like I think they're silly don't be so much well they listen if someone grabs ahold of your collar that's the same thing the Ezequiel chokes are deadly yeah but it's not over yeah if you sink it in mm-hm but that's so collars are a real problem right in jiu-jitsu yeah they're a real problem if someone gets deep on your collar like a nun with a suit it starts doing this man your not good not good collars are not good if you go deep if you get in deep yeah yeah well the problem with that is it's a handle it's worse than a collar cuz I'll get underneath that knot and I'll grab a hold up bitch and then it's all just twisting yeah but it's you have to you're right yeah I would have to get it I'd have to get it and you also they I have to hold on to this part because it can loosen naturally unless you're really good at like because it loosens doesn't yeah it loosens naturally this is a system to this I think you don't think I try to choke people it ties on as friends yeah I'm let me grab a hold that tie real quick what happens if I do this yeah no no not jiu-jitsu people and also it's probably a joke yeah yeah I was fighting for my life I think it'd be different sure you're a tough guy you are actually trained martial artists I mean I'm not saying it would be easy to grab your tie and choke you to death what I'm saying is it's one more area of vulnerability that doesn't need to exist but see I'm disagreeing with you and saying like if I was gonna fight to the death I would wear this suit okay cuz that would look good let me tell you something about CIA agents and Secret Service guys they were breakaway ties that's because they're not good martial artists oh that's not true there's a lot of those guys are savages are they a fuck yeah man belt no black belts man if you're a fucking if you're a Secret Service guy you're supposed to be protecting the president I guarantee you a bunch of those guys are savages I think they're smart enough to use guns that - yeah but they don't you know if they have to wear a tie a lot of people like to wear breakaway ties is that a fact mm-hmm I might be making this up right I think that's it bro no I know but it's it's a little bro fact but only like 10% I think let's Google breakaway ties for self defense because dude look I'm definitely a dummy right okay I think about the stuff too much but when I was driving limos I always felt super vulnerable when I underwear that tie it looks good though my one of my actually my first album my first real album that I ever did for Warner Brothers was in 1999 and I wore exactly that outfit or a black suit with a white shirt and a white and a black tie and it looked dope that's called I'm gonna be dead someday breakaway talk I stand up like a mm-hmm look at that breakaway tie Sun Lowepro breakaway tie whoa that's what I'm wearing let me explain you some come get some most people when they're vulnerable like say I'm afraid I'm gonna be picked on by bullies and had learned a martial art how to defend myself yes you when you felt vulnerable wearing a tie decided not to wear a tie as opposed to learn how to defend yourself while wearing a tie there must be a system I guarantee it or you could you could say that um you could defend yourself you had a dog collar around your neck too but I wouldn't recommend I would recommend smite I took my dog out once I had a pitbull and he bit my cat he grabbed holding my cat it's a terrible story I had a crazy dog when one of my dogs was a dog that I had gotten it was I was young and irresponsible in my 20s and I gotten this dog that was bred from a pig hunting dog in Hawaii and those dogs are hyper animal aggressive they're great with people he was great with people he loved people but everything that moved he was like locked in on he would spend his days in my yard chasing lizards his thing was to jump up on the wall a house and try to snatch lizards it was like a video game for him and my friend Eddie was terrified of this dog hey Bravo yeah and so Eddie would come over the house and Frank would just decide that he runs shit when Eddie's around because Eddie was so scared of him he'd blame em I think I'm gonna kill this cat so he just tried to kill my cat and I got ahold of him in time and I got my hand into his collar and I choked unconscious head like that yeah just behind yeah I'm from behind I just dug my hand under his collar and I twist it and I put him to sleep he went right out it's crazy yeah it works works on dogs yeah maybe from the boughs and thing for the back I was thinking from the front anywhere you can grab a dog collar if you get your hand in there if you're strong enough and you have good technique you know how to go knee on belly and then you twist it you can put a dog to sleep well you changing my mind see ya but I don't know I mean look obviously you're gonna be aware of that and you're gonna defend and you but it's a it's an area of vulnerability right nineteen ninety and pull up I'm gonna be dead someday that the cover of that because I'm literally dressed exactly like you on the cover or when actually doing the show I know I never warrant doing a show I think I just wore it for the cover almost ironically no I kind of like the way it looked there's you know there it is BAM it's hard to tell there because it's that one's orange and the other one's hot pink but I think the the shirt collars a little more open like like you don't give a damn well that was a long day and it was a long photoshoot we were drinking yeah it was a lot of legit there was a lot of stuff going on there but it was just to just I just I like that look it's good look by the way congratulations in the ten years oh thank you very much I don't think you've celebrated probably all I see is on Jamie's Instagram like a naked picture of Burke 10-year picture yeah we probably should do something it was December was officially 10 years so those two months ago kind of Chef some sort of a party or something I know you don't like to talk about it think about it but you've inspired millions very nice it's very it's a very nice little side effect but it's a it's a weird gig man you know and it's it's a it's a gig that became what it is slowly without me understanding what was happening while it was happening which makes it weirder and weirder and with it has come increasingly stronger levels of responsibility to where you know now I have to actually vet guests and think about what they're saying whereas before I would have someone on it they're crazy I let that crazy motherfucker on let's hear what he has to say and people would say a lot of crazy shit and then they would say oh you know you didn't push back or you had this person on and they said something you're responsible and I had no idea what they were gonna say there's a lot of people that have said some pretty outrageous things I had no idea that we're gonna say yeah I saw the like I started one of the things you described me to do is to start Podcast on artificial intelligence and I have Jack Dorsey as a guest coming up uh-huh and that's a good example of somebody you got like an insane amount of pushback yes because they were mad that I didn't talk to him about censorship but my take on it was it was certainly irresponsible on my part the first podcast because my take on it was I just want to see what it's like to be a guy that starts this thing and it becomes probably one of the most important conversation tools the world's ever known and also along the way becomes you know it becomes something we like right now it's weird like Twitter now is just this it's just 50% hot dumpster fire you know it's amazing inspiring snow like you get you can always find the dumpster fire in all kinds of conversations yes and the confusing thing to me about your conversation with Jack which I didn't look at the internet before I listened to it and I enjoyed it I was interesting I learned a lot from your first conversation Jack and like and then I looked at the internet that told me I'm supposed to hate that conversation and what I'm confused about is why why there's such like why is there such hatred thrown towards I also talked to the head of the YouTube a head of the YouTube algorithm search and discovery a lot of hate towards you to you know how to hate towards Twitter a lot towards Facebook and deservedly so there's some challenges and so on but they're doing like an incredible service and the algorithm they're trying to develop and control is really hard to develop and control yes sure so the push back that people get it's almost like they're ignored they're they're taking specific anecdotal pieces of evidence or look this person said this and it's it's not that problematic in our eyes but a day somehow got censored from the platform removed from the plan and they don't look at the bigger picture of how challenging the entirety of it is and how incredible first of all the incredible the platform is to have a conversation like a global conversation like this and hard it is to do to achieve the goal of having it sounds like cheesy but having like a healthy conversation a health the discourse because you want an algorithm and a platform that removes the assholes from the scene because it's a really difficult challenge because you want this is one person was really loud screaming the room light comes to the party you have a cool party a bunch of cool people some communists some right-wingers whatever it doesn't matter they can all disagree but they're not assholes there to have a like interesting debate conversation so on and then there's somebody that comes with like a and just starts screaming like one like slogan or something like that or is trying is trolling is completely sort of non genuine in their way of communication they're destroying the nature of the conversation and then of course that person if they get you know the bodyguards come in and say can you please leave the party sir then they get extremely that's exactly the kind of personality gets extremely upset mm-hmm and though sometimes they almost look for that so what you're supposed to do as a jack doors is a as a leader of that kind of platform it's a very good question and I really think that there's no real answer and it's one of the reasons why it's so frustrating you know if you just let people say whatever they want whenever they want to there's gonna be a lot of people that get turned off to that kind of a platform because you're gonna have a lot of people yelling out racial slurs ethnic slurs gender slurs homophobic slurs there's going to be a bunch of people that are trolling there's going to be a bunch of people that just say things to rile people up and that's all they do there's gonna be a bunch of people that just want a shit stirrer and they want a Docs people anyway so you got it then you have to set parameters like what are the parameters don't you can't Docs people you can't don't say racial slurs don't say ethnic slurs it's you're managing at scale and you're managing an insane amount of people but then there's legitimate criticism that they lean towards progressive people and liberal people and they they have woke Paul tics like for instance you can get banned from Twitter for life if you dead name someone Solex if you became a female and you change your name to Ally and I just said fuck you man you're Lex banned for life that's what is it dead naming that's dead naming like if you wanted to call Caitlyn Jenner if you want to call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce on Twitter you would get dead named there or you would be dead naming her and you would get banned for life a woman named Megan Murphy who is a turf do you know the turf is what do you think I don't know what a tariff is I'm sure you don't you two balls deep in science yeah turf is trans exclusionary radical feminists so trans exclusionary I don't have such a hard time with that word exclusionary right exclusion why does it sound wrong exclusionary sounds wrong so what does it mean to be exclusionary to trans what they she did okay turfs do not want trans people to be to have a say in women's issues I see they think that they are a different thing that there's women and women's issues and these feminists that have been female their whole life dealing with women's issues do not want trans people coming in and in many cases what you find is that trans people come in and then the conversation changes and it becomes about trans issues and they want these conversations to be able in in feminist movements it's complicated right she got banned from Twitter for life for saying a man is never a woman they made her take the tweet down so she took a screenshot of it took it down and then put this screenshot back up and then they banned it for life should she get been no no she shouldn't because biologically she's correct if there's an argument there if there's an argument a scientific argument a man is never a woman but can a man identify as a woman and should you respect him her then and treat them as a woman yes so yes so the question is whether I mean I I'm not too deep into thinking about these specific issues but the question is whether you should get banned for being an asshole you should banned for being for lying because I think lying is okay the truth whatever there's a lot of people lie on Twitter yeah I in sort of or insult you can insult people on Twitter as long as you're not specific about their gender see that the insult thing that's where it gets it's the party thing you have that asshole douchebag whatever term you want to use they show up to the party and then if a person shows up to the party and a lot of people leave because they're annoying or whatever yes that should be like we should do something to discourage that behavior that's a good point however let's let's paint a different picture of a party let's have a party where everyone says my pronouns are they them and zis ER and ja vu and then and then you come in you come on bro you're a guy and like no no I'm of a fucking cisgendered heteronormative piece of shit and then they want to kick you out of the party yeah now all you're saying is you're a guy band both of them no way man the been the person who's not open-minded or respectful for that you know well don't ban people here's the please no no no no not that yeah so of course it's been well documented by but by people now the reason we probably have the current president is yeah the people on the left of very also rude and disrespectful it's a small percentage of the people no very small this is part of the really slow on Twitter that they are on Twitter but it's also the small percentage when you it's so hard to have a group and call that group the left because the variables are so extreme there's so many different people that follow politics or that that espouse to certain belief systems that recognize themselves as left funny enough you're probably on the left yes I'm very much on the left yeah but I don't considered to be on the left because I'm a cage fighting commentator um you know American flag behind yeah I'm very bro ish I hunt I bow hunt which is even more bro ish right and I am unabashedly masculine and a man and a comedian yeah some comedian and I said and I make fun of everything including sacred cows like gender homosexuality heterosexuality my own kids my wife my mom everybody I make fun of everybody and if you take that stuff out of context and just publish a bunch of it it makes you look like a moron or it makes you look very an asshole that's you know what what is the left right what is the left in my mind the left when I was a child I always thought of the left because I grew up my parents were hippies all right my my stepdad was an architect and before that he was a computer programmer he has long hair until I was I think I was 20 years old when he cut his hair I mean long like down to his ass like a Native American nice and he you know they always he smoked pot when I was little I mean he I was always around hippies I lived in San Francisco from the time I was seven till I was 11 and I was always and and my family was very left-wing they were always Pro gay marriage they were print pro-gay rights Pro racial equality Pro just name it man Pro welfare Pro you know just the idea was open-mindedness education all these things are good and this is when war was bad and you know there was a lot of you know there's a lot of things that maybe they had that they had they had like very strong beliefs on that maybe they weren't entirely nuanced on as well when you find that about people on the left as much as you find that about people on the right but it's the radicals on both sides being there's nothing wrong with being conservative right there's nothing wrong with valuing hard work there's nothing wrong with someone whose values of fiscal frugality or someone who is you know you you have a conservative view on economics or on social policies you know and you you want less government there's nothing wrong with those things either that's when you get extreme like yeah the guest was amazing guess you had recently they converted a bunch of folks from the KKK Gerald Davis yeah Wow this is him right here this is a CD he's amazing he's an incredible human man but that kind of thinking I wish you saw more of that yeah it's sort of like not even if you're on the left to be to talk to people on the brightest instead of just shut him out that's the problem with this idea of kicking people out of a party you kick people out of the party guys like Darrell Davis never get to convert them there's been people from Twitter that have been converted you know Megan Phelps is a famous one she was a part of the Westboro Baptist Church her grandfather was Fred Phelps that fucking famous crazy asshole who was like super rude like who you know would make them take those signs that say God hates fags and and literally go to soldiers funerals and say that soldiers died because God is angry that people are homosexual so Megan was completely entrenched in this toxic ideology would are allowed her to escape that yes she met her husband on Twitter from arguing a thing back and forth and now she's out and now now and you if you talk to her you would never believe it and man and not that long ago either not that long ago she was in that church like six years ago it's kind of incredible that you can submit Gro that mindset so no matter I mean it's inspiring that you can hold him on instead of hatred and no yes escape it well she was indoctrinated into it from the time she was a child and you know for her it was the only life she knew right her family is in that and for her she just just I mean by whatever for whatever grace of the the grand universe plan she had enough open-mindedness to take into consideration some of these other things that people were saying that we have a problem today with canceled culture it's a real problem is they you just want to write people off well those people still exist it's basically a cultural form of euthanasia you just want to go out and whack everyone that doesn't agree with you but if you if you do that you whether it's eugenics or whatever whatever you want to call it you just eliminate everyone who's not the way that you like culturally eliminate them take them out of the conversation they still exist yeah they still exist so what happens and well then they're angry they're angry they left out of the conversation and and they don't grow and then you've written them off as a human being you said they're they're a hundred percent bad now if you had a spectrum of people in this world one hundred percent bad and a hundred percent good I mean there are some beautiful people that really are a hundred percent like my friend Justin Ren who runs fight for the Forgotten charity he's about as close to a hundred percent good as you can get I mean this beautiful person goes to the Congo and makes wells for the pygmies and gets malaria it's now his crate he's got some crazy parasite now that they don't even know what it is they can't recognize it he's been suffering for eight months now I think that's about as good as you can get right and then there's people you know you could it's a gray area when you start to drift away from the good like I have the same thing in my like that's the focus I have in the academic setting of science there's and that's that's the inspiration in your podcast that you you gave me is to talk outside the people that are sort of conventionally accepted by the scientific community like a little bit on the fringes yeah and the quote-unquote fringes so you have the same thing in machine learning and artificial intelligence there's people that are working on specific it's called deep learning these learning methodologies that are accepted you know there's conferences and we all kind of accept the problems we're working on and there's people a little bit on the fringes hmm there's people in neuroscience actually anybody thinking about working on what's called artificial general intelligence is already on the fringes you know if you even raise the question okay so how do we build human level intelligence that's a little bit of a taboo subject the consciousness is called the c-word for a while conscious really yeah well it's scientists oh I know I understand yeah but explain it to me like what what's the aversion what does everyone worried about does well no it's what are they worried about it's this culture of rolling your eyes the same the same way you might roll your eyes if somebody tells you the earth is flat mmm they sort of put all other things in that category as well it's like well that's okay whatever that's we so in case of consciousness we really don't understand very much at all what consciousnesses what the what the objective experience the fact that it feels like something to take in the world that it's not just raw sensory information being processed actually feels like to touch something to taste something to see something it's like incredible David Chalmers calls it the hard problem of consciousness why do we feel it okay but we don't have scientific physics engineering methods of studying consciousness so it immediately gets put into this bin that it's not a an okay thing like gear a little bit of crazy off the reservation I think somebody was Darryl Sannes slur I never even thought of that I didn't think of what that meant yeah so they already put in this bin of you're not a legitimate researcher and the same kind of you know and I think we're now in a in a culture which is great you know Eric Weinstein is good at this I'm hoping to be good at this you're good at this at allowing those people on the fringes in and saying what are your ideas exploring those yeah of course you have a greater and greater platform to where there is a line you don't want too far in the fringes yeah that's something I'm aware of now that I wasn't aware of say like three or four years ago and I used to have a lot of those I've had some people on that it would never have on again you know and and then I've had some people on that I've been criticized for having them on I'm like okay I see why you are upset but I think there's value in having conversations with people that are on the fringes there's people that are bad faith actors right they act in bad faith those are the ones you have to be careful of and sometimes you don't know who they are until you get to know them yeah and then you've already kind of opened the door like for some people for like the democratic the legitimate seven-year-old plus Democratic Party Tulsi Gabbard is on the fringe yeah right but I think you having her on as great is exploring you know she's one of the young minds exploring sort of the role of the United States in the foreign policy in the world militarily in terms of trade and so on so she's a excellent mine I don't think is on the fringe and saying I don't think she's on the fringe or any Sanders for many people still is on the fringe yeah and uh I think he gets misrepresented though yeah for sure one of the things that was tremendously beneficial for me is to sit down with him for hours and have a conversation yeah and you go oh you're a real person you're not this wacky guy yelling about billionaires well you know when you get these 90 second sound bites and these debates you don't get a chance to know who someone is yeah so I used to listen to this I I listened to a lot of radio on the left and the right to try to get like taken what what people are thinking about used to listen to this program I think is called that tom hartman program he's like a major lefty but he had this segment called brunch with Bernie and he would invite Bernie Sanders like every Friday something like that and just sort of the intellectual honesty and curiosity that Bernie exhibited was just fascinating sort of like as opposed to being a political thing that just repeats the same message over and over which actually what it kind of sounds like when you listen to him now publicly he is actually a thinking individual and somebody who's open to changing his mind but within that has just completely been consistent what people are terrified of is that he's going to raise taxes on successful people and ruin business yeah that's what people are worried about that in doing that it will crash the economy yes I don't know if they're right I don't even know if they're so first of all the people are using the word socialist see I'm saying he's a socialist do you really want socialism America is a great country because of our capitalist kind of thing from my perspective I think we already have a huge number of socialists well he's a democratic socialist democratic so it's a different perspective he just values workers the ideas he wants people to earn a living wage he wants people to not be indebted with a tremendous amount of student loan debt when you're just 21 years old and getting out of college he thinks it's insane and I agree with them he doesn't want people to be burdened in this insane way if you ever get and I agree with them let's improve the healthcare system I think as a community if we're looking at the United States as a community one of the things that you know look it's great to support business it's great to have a strong economy it's great to give business the confidence to take chances and a lot of people think Donald Trump does that it's also great to take care of our own and I don't think we do that enough I don't think we take care of our own enough in terms of we have the same problems in the same inner cities that we've had for a decade after decade after decade and there's no significant attempt to change that but meanwhile we do these nation-building projects and other countries and we have the interventionist foreign policy where we go in and invade these countries and try to prop up new new governments and try to support them and we spend insane amounts of money doing that and along the while we don't do anything to our inner cities that are the exact same fucked up places that they were in the 70s and in the 60s do you know do you know Michael Wood jr. is know he was on the podcast a couple times and he used to be a police officer in Baltimore yes I know him okay so I listen to that podcast I'm just horrible with names okay his his experience was first of all just he found a piece of paper that showed like a crime docket from the 1970s all the stuff like drugs crime robbery it was all the same issues in the same neighborhoods that he was patrolling in today and he was like holy shit and he realized like oh this is a quagmire and then he found out about the laws that were in place from way back in the day where you literally if you were an african-american you couldn't buy a home in certain areas they had what does that term is it redlined is that what the term is where they they designate certain areas where they literally won't sell homes to black people and he was becoming aware of this shit as he was a cop and you know in the beginning he was all gung-ho he was like oh I'm a cop you know I'm here to bust bad guys and do the right thing and then along the way he kind of recognized you're dealing with systemic racism redlining really yeah so yes so that hasn't been addressed it's all about I mean there's a million other things at home education yeah all those things I think Bernie Sanders when he talks about those things he he seems like a guy who really cares about education healthcare and people that live in poverty yeah I don't I don't know if he's gonna be able to do anything I don't know that's the main thing is like people say democratic socialists and so on is gonna he's going to make it slight move into whatever direction he's trying to advocate which in this case is more investment into the infrastructure and so on into our yeah at home but like you know he's just one human being just has to be a Congress that represents the people and if there's anything I think Congress is probably the most hated entity in all the universe like it you look at all the polls of what people like and hate like like rats are above the favorability ratings so Congress is really the broken system but Bernie won't be able to do much except take a little sort of the role the President as I see it is to one the terrifying one is to start wars and so this it's a very serious responsibility you have to take and the second is to inspire the population in terms of executive power of enacting laws there's not much power all you can all you can do is what our current president is doing sort of inspiring the on that in that case the Republicans in Congress to sort of work together to work on certain legislation so you can inspire the Congress and you can inspire the people but you don't have actual direct power so bernie is not going to turn america into a socialist you know Haven he's going to take a small step into maybe he probably fixing focusing on one aspect like health care or something like that like President Obama did and tried to make a little change and so so in that sense people that are genuine and have ideas like Andrew yang is another one he has like I number of ideas I know if you've seen like he thinks all cops should be purple belts and jujitsu I like it my go Andrew yeah there's a million other ideas well he's a genius I mean he's a brilliant guy and he's an entrepreneur so he comes at this stuff from a different angle yeah and all he's open minded like I yes I well I disagree with him on his evaluation of the state of artificial intelligence and automation in terms of its capabilities and having an impact on the economy you don't think it's gonna be as much of a deal as he thinks it is I am the timescale that he thinks it is but I also want to be careful sort of commenting on that because I think for him it's a tool to describe the concerns the suffering that people go through in terms of in terms of losing their job like the pain that people are feeling throughout the country it's a it's like a mechanism he uses to talk to people about the future in that you know there are people that are well off like the different tech companies that should also contribute to investing our community I mean the specifics I want to kind of sit back and relax a little bit it's like when you watch a sci-fi movie and the details are all really bad I want to just mention or disbelieve or whatever and enjoy the movie in the same way the stuff he says about AI he's not very knowledgeable body I in automation so it's a little it touches me a little bit the wrong way in turn we're not as far along the the transformative effects of artificial intelligence in terms of replacing humans in trucking autonomous vehicles something I know a couple things about is not going to be as you know I could speak relatively confidently the the revolution in autonomous vehicles would be more gradual than andrew is describing but that's okay there's a million other ideas and ubi nevertheless the universe of basic income was some kind of support structure that kind nevertheless could be a very good idea for people that lose their job for people to be mobile in terms of going for one type of job to another type of job so continually learning through our life it's just that artificial intelligence in this case I don't think will be the enemy it be there could be other things that are a little bit sort of neighbors of artificial intelligence which is sort of the software world eating up some of the mechanization of factors and so on you know maybe maybe the the fact that you know the kind of way that Tesla and Elon Musk are approaching the design and engineering of vehicles that are a little bit more software eccentric will change will sort of move some of the job from Detroit Michigan in terms of cars to the Silicon Valley unnecessary location wise but sort of a different type of person would need to be hired to work on cars a little bit more software engineering software centric versus the sort of hardcore mechanical engineers more sort of you know tradition called car guys you know gals right yeah so that there will be some job replacement so on but it's not this artificial intelligence trucks will completely replace your job and in the case of trucks you know that it's not there's a lot of complicated aspects about the impact of automation sort of trucking jobs there's actually a lot of need for jobs like there's not the truck that that job there's already people leaving that job sector it's a really difficult job it doesn't pay as well as it should it's really difficult to train people and so on so the the impact that he talks about in terms of AI is a little bit of exaggerated but like I said a million really good ideas he's open-minded so the in terms of I think the nice role of a president is to have ideas like the purple ball one they inspire people and inspire Congress to soon implement some of those ideas and be open minded and not take yourself seriously enough to think the you know all the right answers Andrew yang Bernie is like that although bernie is like 78 years old so yeah he's getting up there yeah look at president tulsi when he kicks the bucket you know what I didn't know well yeah that's so I think Hillary Clinton endorsed Bernie and Tulsi God for president reverse endorsement accidentally yeah well yeah I say it's just such a petty thing to say that no one likes Bernie I come on Lady this is you're in the twilight of your life I think she's really aware of the fact that if she says something like that people are gonna like Bernie more I think it's an endorsement I don't think she has any idea of that I think she's super insulated I don't I don't think she I think she thinks that she can actually hamstring him by saying something like that and she doesn't understand that it just makes people realize that the things that they say about her correct yeah the negative credit really you gave her credit for killing upstate I was joking I don't think she did I think somebody did it I don't know who it was maybe some scientist character maybe he's still alive it could be doesn't any Bravo thanks man Eddie Bravo thinks he's in like Dominican Republic somewhere eating bananas and drinking mai tais it's a conspiracy on a conspiracy yeah well Eddie's always like that he's ready levels deep he plays for DHS when it comes to conspiracy do you think that Andrew yang is off but ultimately will be correct in terms of the automation timeline do you think that maybe he doesn't know clearly as much as you know about automation and artificial intelligence but do you think that it's possible that you know I think he's looking at a time line I think he was thinking within the next 10 years millions and millions of jobs going to be replaced do you think that it's more like 20 years or 30 years it's still something exact concern so the time line of course nobody knows but I think the time line is much the time skills is more stretched out so 20-30 years and it will continue they'll be there'll be certain key revolutions and those revolutions it's a so it's an incorrect word to use but they'll be stretched out over time I think the autonomous vehicle revolution is something to achieve a scale of millions of vehicles that are fully autonomously navigating our streets I think is 20 30 years away mm-hmm and it won't be like all of a sudden you'll be gradual there'll be people like the former Google self-driving car way Moe company who's doing a lot of testing now incredible engineer I visited them for a day you'll be expending their efforts slowly they're doing also way more trucks autonomous trucking already deploying them in Texas I think and then of course Tesla whose this year gonna proach a million vehicles and they're trying to achieve full self-driving capability but that's gonna be gradual I just got a new update for the Tesla some new self-driving update it costs four grand and I was like what is it you know and then but I think it was high and I was looking at my phone when I was like hmm okay let's do it and so I got this update but I'm like what did I just pay for and I'm not even I don't even know if I'm gonna use it but I think it can change I think it does everything I think it changes lanes and yeah well okay so I'm not exactly sure what the update is but it's probably see if you can find out Jamie so it's probably the quote-unquote full self-driving you know very important um the safety person I guess I'm his podcast Tesla cannot drive itself fully autonomously you have to keep your eyes in the road oh I saw a guy sleeping on the internet and he was fun yeah well a car how cold I'll look into it was on CNN it was someone filmed the guy he was in his car passed out not just one it's bit there's been a few examples of that a people commuting on the way to work so out cold so some are for fun and fake but it's certainly a real thing that you don't sleep we do that with manual driven cars too I enjoy driving home in my Tesla from the comi store like 1 o'clock in the morning hitting that autopilot and I keep my hand on the wheel but it just it's an 11 keep your eyes on the road yes I'm not looking at my phone or anything stupid but it's just like oh do do you press that that double button yeah just hot it changes lanes oh it doesn't change lanes it stays in the lane it does it can change lanes but I think you have to prompt it like if if you want to like it there's an option for navigate on autopilot like it'll like take you everywhere you need to go but I think you need to step in at certain points yeah and you actually said now you can it can change lanes without you pressing that's what it is now yeah so you can do it automatically and they're doing hundreds of thousands I think they're tracking the number of automated lane change first of all incredible that this is possible there's hundreds of thousands of automated lane changes without human initiation happening right now on I mean to me is a sort of a robotics person it's just incredibly here it is from whole snack on Twitter it says Tesla's new update lets the car recognize traffic cones stop signs and stop lines trash cans and stoplights at their colors if you try to run a stop sign under autopilot the car emergency brakes and forces you to take over after right wow you can't run stops on so this isn't the out date you paid $4,000 for that's already that's part of that but I'm actually surprised to the force but it says Tesla's new update what's the time on this channel with the date December 24th okay for a more recent so this is this isn't the exact update the the the paid $4,000 for I think this is a general part of the full self-driving which is four thousand dollars and just to be clear again safety person it's not like it detects traffic lights but it doesn't stop at the traffic lights for you and maybe in this case it does emergency braking on the south side but it's not not gonna no it's not is not there you're not there don't trust it it's not there it's in fact this you know there's a lot of people including myself think it's work quite a few years away but it's also sort of also on the podcast just like you got just to talk to you all mosque meet him talk to him in person and realize that there's you know there's people in this world they can make the impossible happen you interviewed him as well yeah twice yeah tell me what was that experience like for you so you know there was it's quite incredible in the sense that he is a legit engineer and designer which is like a pleasure for me I've talked to a few CEOs talked to Eric Schmidt just the CEOs and they're a little bit more business oriented Elon is really really focused on the fundament like the first principles - like the physics level of the problems that are being solved whether that's SpaceX with the fundamentals of rocky reusable rockets and and you know going into deep space and colonizing Mars whether that's a neuro-link for the getting to the core the fundamentals of what it's like to have a computer communicate with the human brain and with Tesla on the battery side sort of saying he he throw away a lot of the conventional thinking about what's required to build first of all an appealing car electric car but also one that's has a long range that's something I don't know as much about but they're on the AI side just I mean he boldly said from scratch we can build the system ourselves in a matter of months now a couple of years that's able to drive autonomously and most people would laugh at that idea like the most roboticist said no from the DARPA challenges most of them know how hard this problem is he said no no we're going to we're not only gonna throw a lidar which is this laser based sensor we're gonna say cameras only and we're gonna use deep learning machine learning which is learning based system so it's a system that learns from scratch and we're going to teach it to drive from eight cameras and so on so just talking to somebody like that was the the the not the fact that he thinks like that I think it's just fun to talk to people like that I don't meet them off and let's say I don't know stop this bullshit of thinking that this task is impossible let's say why is it impossible is it really impossible well you find out when you start to think about most problems from first principles is that it's not actually impossible and then you have to think okay so how do we make it happen how do we create an infrastructure that allows you to learn from huge amounts of data so one of the most revolutionary things that Tesla is doing and hopefully other car companies will be doing is the over-the-air software updates just like the update that you got the fact that just like on your phone you can get updates over time means you can have a learning system a machine learning based system they can learn and then deploy the thing you learned over time and do that weekly that sounds like maybe but it's come nobody else is doing it and it's completely revolutionary see cars once you buy them they don't learn most cars Tessa learns that that's a huge thing forget about it I thought about all the stuff just the fact that you can update the software I think there's a revolutionary idea and then they're also doing everything else from scratch this is this first principles type of thinking the hardware so the the hardware in your car I don't know when you got the Tesla but it should be hardware version too but that Hardware performs what's called inference so it's already trained it's already learned it's thing and it's just taking in the raw sensory input and making decisions okay they built that hardware themselves from scratch again ballsy move now they're building what they're calling again he's such a troll but they're calling dojo is the the name of the the specialized hardware for training than you're on those for training the models what training is it's the learning side of it so they're building their own like supercomputer at Google has a TPU to improve the training tape you was this temporal tensor processing unit it's the same thing as the more general nvidia has graphics processing unit GPUs that all the Nerds all the people like me have been using on for machine learning to train you all networks it's what most also gamers use the video games right but they have they have this nice quality that you can train huge neural networks on them okay TPU is as a specialized hardware for training neural networks GPUs allow you to play video games and train your own networks TPU is clean some stuff up to make it more efficient energy efficient more efficient for the kinds of computation y'all know works need Google has them a bunch of other companies have them you know most most car companies would be like okay let me partner with somebody else to you from google to use their TP use or use invidious GPUs Tesla's building you from scratch so that kind of from scratch thinking is is incredible and the other two things I really listen where the like about Musk is the hard work we live in a culture like so many people like I often don't sleep I do crazy shit in terms of just focus stay up night sometimes and I often people recommend to me the you know balance is really important and taking a break is important you know that you rejuvenate yourself you return to with fresh ideas all those things are true sleep is important yet the people on the podcast tell you how important sleep is but what most people don't don't advise me is hard work is more important passion is more important than all of those things like that should come first and then sleep empowers it rest and powers at rejuvenation powers especially in engineering disciplines hard work is everything and he's sort of unapologetically about that it's not like a come come to us come work with us it'll be a friendly environment with free snacks it's like you're gonna work the hardest you've ever worked on whether you agree with him or not on the most important problems of your life okay I like that kind of thinking because it emphasizes the hard work the the other part it was in terms of meeting him in person I don't know if you got to interact with that off because when he was on mic with you he was very he was very kind of it was hard to bring it out of him yeah in person before that he was very jovial and friendly and Huggy he's great yeah and then once he got on the microphone I was like oh this is heavy lifting yeah bring this out of him so then we started drinking drinking and then oh yeah it helps a lot and then once the drinking you know then then I got to see who he is yeah that should I should have done that but no drinkin ya know the the thing that's really interesting is he's gone if you look at his biography like the kind of stress he's been under in terms of he's been at the brink of losing his his companies several times yes and he you know he lost a child and he just he's a that's the inspired me as it's that he can be a good dad while running so many companies because I guy I was often wonder about you know the kind of hours I pull on what I'm doing can I have a family can i really give up because I'd love to be a father and can I have a family can I be a good part like it's very very very very difficult if you're working 18 hours a day yes to give your kids at the time that they need but it's possible not not 18 oh there's always I believe in theirs in life day months maybe years that you have to do the 18 hours a day but not always it's time for right do the sprint sprint yeah and then establish everything and then sit back but the problem with a lot of guys like him is first of all it's very difficult to find a replacement for the way he thinks right so if he's if he's a CEO of these companies and he's the one who's the mastermind behind all these things and then he wants to step back finding a commensurate replacement is insanely difficult because most people who would be a potential replacement are already off doing their own shit and there's not many people like him I know that's the interesting that's actually the disappointing thing to me is that he's a his kind of thinking is a rarity I'm not yes I'm not sure why that is exactly well he's joke around about it but it I think there's a there's a spectrum of evolution and his mind is clearly way more advanced in my mind there's there's something going on in his mind in terms of his attraction to engineering issues solutions to global problems solutions to traffic problems pollution problems all the other things that he's the Internet he's trying to put he's trying to give the world Internet I mean he's got all these things going simultaneously and one of the things that I got out of him when I was talking to him was that he almost has a hard time containing these ideas that are just pouring out of his head like a raging river like he's trying to catch handfuls of water his raging river of ideas that's going through his head you know and when he described his childhood that he thought that everybody was like that and then as he got older he you know thought he was insane yeah I didn't I've I can relate to that I've I've I'm trying to learn how to talk but I have trouble talking because it's like a million ideas running in my head I get anything you say I'll immediately start there's these like weird tangent they go off and I want to start thinking about them is that true with a lot of people in your line of work and I think so I think that's kind of puzzle solving like that's one comfort is I'm just surprised that a CEO is able to continue being that kind of puzzle solver did you see that tweet that he made about his plans like he put a tweet up and I think it was 2006 and then it's he's essentially done all those things he's done all those things now the thing is most people I did so a lot of people love you know musk but there's a quite a large community of people that don't love him so much well that's always the case I don't know I don't anybody great I don't I don't know if that's always the case when is it not the case who does who accomplishes as many things as that guy does where everybody loves him it's a difficult I mean I'm not a historian I could say Steve Jobs a terrible example so many people hated that guy so many people hated that guy I have personal friends that are involved in technology that wouldn't use Apple products because he's such a twat sure they didn't want to have anything to do with him they knew people that were engineers under him they said it was horrible and mean and it just required so much would scream at people and insult them and you know he had these ideas in his head that he needed to get done and if you couldn't work the hours that you needed to do what he wanted to accomplish you know he would treat you like shit yeah you're right and I just wish the world was better I think because I like with all people like that like we Steve Jobs and with Elon Musk when he dies people will always you know you'll remember the greatness right yeah so that's that's how it seems to work it's just sad that you can't celebrate that currently but I do think there's one particular aspect of his personality that I also share that pisses people off really bad which is like you said he had a plan but he's laid down that plan he's promising things and he keeps being a year or two or three late right and that really I don't know if it actually angers people or if people that already don't like you use that as a thing to say why they don't like you but it's certainly a thing that people say a lot yeah and but I think that's an essential element of doing extremely difficult things is over-promising and trying to over-deliver that's the whole point right is to to say to make all the engineers around you believe that is doable in a year that's essential to do it in two years that's like that that kind of and truly believing it as it seems to be a century well didn't he have people pay full price for that roadster like you got on a list a time yeah yes so you paid a quarter of a million dollars for a car that's essentially vaporware yeah but the thing so I don't know there's a little bunch of financial people to get like mad at oh yeah oh yeah like there's investors you know it's like it's I think it's the most shorted stock in history yeah so that keeps kicking ass I don't confuses the fuck out of paper Oh to me the stock market is the most boring thing ever and people it's it's a it's a gambling yes and so you trying to say you're an expert in investing in the stock market that I blocked I removed those people from my life because they don't say anything any interesting ideas I said it but the you know when you're doing legitimate investment yes that's that's a really important services Society but if you're commenting on the fundamentals of engineering problems that real engineers are trying to solve that's not interesting to me the so it it that kind of stuff upsets I think financial folks but the beautiful thing is when you have people buy vaporware and you bring that vapor to reality that's the amazing thing yeah that you will definitely bring that roadster to reality if he doesn't die that roadster will happen yeah if he dies bail out now same with him that's the same of that insane cyber truck yeah there's our truck is fucking awesome I'm so ridiculous if he lives long enough you better believe there's humans being put on Mars whether it's him or he gets everybody else see that one I'm skeptical of just the type of people that are gonna want to go see you're not talking about the engineering problem no I think it's possible it's all tamale you know I mean it's look can we put people in space for sure we've definitely done it can we show things well some people think space is fake space is fake that's you ever Google hashtag space is fake I it's wonderful it's a testament to the education system in this country well I and that's a tiny little tangent I've gotten I joked about flat earth and space is fake a little bit almost like saying that's an interesting way to being open-minded and then I realized that's not something to joke about that there's a community of people that take it extremely seriously and then some of them thank me for acknowledging that the possibilities oh and then I said okay bless their little hearts okay this is not no little brains but I appreciated their open-mindedness but they should take introduction to physics MIT OpenCourseWare it provides courses on physics that should can a regular person just sign up for that yeah yeah it's open free so how does that work what do you have to do in order to take those courses it's all it's all made available online just go to MIT MIT org or is it W MIT OpenCourseWare is the website I mean most people and it's all on YouTube now oh that's beautiful it's all lectures they're like millions of views introductory lectures to physics mathematics statistics I have courses on the shadow six but in order to understand that the work has been done to recognize the fact that the earth is round what would you recommend right away classical mechanics with exponential focus experimental focus see none of those things are gonna do mechanics is gonna say but if you're a dingbat you're not gonna be able to absorb all that look up to look at a page for gravity I think mmm that's not gonna help either they say gravity's never been proven no one understands gravity correct there's no one who actually understands what gravity is we just know the effects of it it's actually magnetism yes for sure so you have to undertake the effort of proving the Wikipedia article for gravity wrong so we keep a dia bro what a terrible example Wikipedia sketchy it says I'm Brian Collins brother says I got celiac disease it's a bunch of shit that's not real how do you know you're not related I know okay I'm pretty sure [Laughter] my brother I don't know if it says it anymore put it in there again fuck it what capito is actually another distributor system that's incredible ly surprising to me that it works yeah it is right because even though there is a lot of misinformation in it and there's a lot of you know falsehoods there's a lot of really good information as well you know particularly about historical figures and interesting stuff you know if you want to find facts on things and on-site research science and technical topics so not not like nutrition science or things which there's a lot of debates on like physics and math and so on it's really good I mean it's really really good so it's community supported yeah by other physicists but moving back from fight earth can go back to why you think we're not going to be colonizing Mars oh I'm not saying ever I'm just saying the problem to me is the type of people that would want to do it because they can't return you know that's the the real issue with going to Mars that you can't return this you don't think there's a huge number of non crazy explorers in this world that want to die on Mars I had a whole bit about it I really believe that it's the the the fringe of the fringe that would be willing to die on Mars no I'll be willing to dying Mars really I stay here come on I like you don't go that no it's here's my take you like about me it's all temporary what's all temporary like life yeah it's temporary right you're gonna die someday sure it but if you decide to die on fucking Mars like bro you'll be sending me emails from Mars dude I fucked up I won't be such nonsense this is the thing you've your ear into the Native Americans you've been read yeah I've been following your work there I'm sad obsessed man I've been upset about World War two or one but you're like you're converting me to think of like to the to the both the warrior cultures and the suffering in that world the sufferings insane it's insane I'm this book on Black Elk man it details his life from he was a young boy when during Custer's last stand he was there when Custer was killed Black Elk yeah but the man the guy yeah what do you call that he's a habla Louis Lakota medicine man medicine man yeah and he just lived through the transition he lived through the transition of them battling with the u.s. soldiers to them being on the reservation and fucking insane poverty insane just did in dis the stories of people the illnesses and the deaths how many people's children died mal knew malnourished and starvation abuse and then how just how much they hated where they were living and how they were living on the reservation yeah it's horrific man it's horrific it's like it's hard to imagine it's hard to imagine when you're reading that this just happened you know I mean he's talking about the the really horrible parts at the end were in the early 1920s 1930s it's hard to imagine it's hard to imagine that this this tribe from 100 years prior in the 1820s were living wild and free and we're you know we're living the same way they had lived for hundreds of years and had this incredible relationship with the land and these incredible religion that they practiced where they worshipped the the the earth and the animals and the sky and they had all these concepts for the way you should live your life and how to guarantee prosperity and how to guarantee success and man it's just the had a fascinating culture I mean and it's gone it was wiped off the face of the map there was nothing like it anywhere else on earth there's no there was no culture anywhere on earth that was like the Native American culture in the 1600s 1700s 1800s and but in that period of time they had this spectacular way of life and there was often very cruel and very ruthless and they ward on each other like this this idea that Native Americans were living in peace and harmony with each other's nonsense yes I started I was listed listening while doing hills yes to keep my ass as listening to the empire of the summer moon fucking correct Magic III commented in your Instagram like saying something you know basically admiring the purity of that way of life yeah I got so much shit by people saying oh you think rape and murderers is pure and admirable so there's a certainly an aspect to their way of life which is sort of the Warrior Ethos right the Comanches in particular magic they were the most ruthless the most warlike that's all they did basically like that Genghis Khan the same kind of the same horses the innovators actually more innovators yeah and all they ate was meat as well I mean all day day was Buffalo I mean they they essentially rode with the Buffalo killed Buffalo hunted Buffalo and then raided other tribes and then until the white man came and then they started raiding the white man killing the white man but they were you know at war with white people for hundreds of years I mean they were the reason why the West was hard to settle I mean the sneaky shit I don't know if you've gotten to the point where they were giving people these big swaths of land in Oklahoma and they essentially set them up to be killed by the Comanche they will say hey go out here we'll give you sixteen hundred acres it's all yours and no like Oh terrific let's get our family and getting a wagon and no one let him know that the wildest motherfuckers that have ever lived on this continent were running that place and they would go there and just get slaughtered and one after another families were wiped out that people were kidnapped and that lady that I have on the wall outside Cynthia Ann Parker who was adopted by the Comanches she's her family was murdered in front of her when she was nine years old and she became the wife of a great Comanche chief and her son became the last Comanche chief Quanah Parker it's crazy that story it's the craziest story there's all these tribes that some are probably more warlike someone more pieces yes that that had a way of life here I don't know I don't want to romanticize too much you most people don't believe me but I'd really like that way of life that closeness to nature you said texting and from Mars or whatever I like I like you know I wouldn't choose it but I would be happier if I was forced into it it seems like a Connor intuitive notion but because I'm so weak I'm so soft like even running Hills yesterday I realize how soft I am well you work too much ya know behind a computer yeah a little fingers typing but you're also a black belt in jujitsu you also a martial artist you know me against the Comanche warrior good luck I think you know about the Comanche up they don't know how to fight for real if they had a weapon they'd kill you think you're just I know I I listen first of all they were pretty small they weren't very big people maybe a second of all they didn't know jujitsu dad the average person that doesn't know jujitsu you're gonna choke the fuck out of them that'd be fun actually to sort of go into different warring cultures they go in Ganga's Khan's times yeah without weapons to see what kind of combat styles a dad just send Francis and gah know he'd clean out the entire fuck I mean just send hos Gracie yeah sure pressing down on all generations will be yeah I'd be screwed interesting Yeah right it's just overwhelming but I think that if you had real jujitsu skills um you know what you know now today particularly because jujitsu has evolved so much I mean even the jujitsu of 2020 is so radically different from the jujitsu of you know 1990 it's radically different like almost unrecognizable in a lot of ways but clearly though the basics are still the most important and there are some of the Great's of all time who just operate with the basics whether it's hard your Gracie or Hicks and Gracie or you know there's a lot of great great jiu-jitsu players that just have those solid solid ribeiro you know solid basics that are just honed to a razor-sharp edge you know you know chrome Chrome Gracie he's got and I when I say basic it is a compliment I mean he you know arm bars triangles guillotines rear naked choke those types of things but perfected to a level that is they don't they don't participate in a lot of the more modern there's a lot of like crafty weird stuff that a lot of guys try today and some of the greats even the greats that participate in jiu-jitsu matches today and are effective at it don't don't really have that kind of style yeah I mean but crona's actually has some more creativity if you look at Roger Gracie that's like there's I don't I don't even know if he does foot locks like I think that my favorite thing to do is on YouTube just watch Roger Gracie matches like he looks like he's half asleep and he demolishes the greatest black belts in the world slowly by just like in a half-asleep way taking them down passing their guards going to mount and doing a choke yeah it's like the against I don't know buchecha I can against just the best well my instructor John Jacques Machado same thing man just his style is just solid basics of Jiu Jitsu and he has a saying that you more you know the less you use which is really interesting you mentioned Comanche warriors in the meet you know Congrats on the I saw the the died carnivore diet is yeah man here's something crazy I got off that diet for this weekend because it was I did the month and then once Saturday came around I said ate Italian food I had Girl Scout cookie and pasta and then yesterday I went to Disneyland so yesterday I went way way off the diet and I had ice cream and I ate all kinds of shitty food and I was getting back pains and knee pains and all these kind of weird pains that went away when I was on the diet now this is not a testament against plant-based diets cuz I was eating shit shitty food right and pot pasta you know which is a lot of you know bright hot stuff yeah yes spaghetti that stuff it causes inflammation it just does you know it just does sugar causes inflammation but it's interesting to have this great month where basically two weeks in after the diarrhea died off I had two solid weeks of no aches and pains and feeling great I was like this is wild this is really why I feel amazing look and then two days of eating shit and like my back hurts right now I'm sitting here my back is hurting my knee was hurting lot yesterday like all those weird aches come right back well it's uh there's a the nice thing about the Joe Rogan effect is that you trying to die and you're talking about keto a lot that's like become more socially acceptable to do because I've been eating keto or low-carb for many years and doing fasting like 24 or 48-hour fast mm-hmm and I always kind of keep him one low down but even this time like traveling like what I like to do when traveling is I'm kind of I'm trying to be given my current situation and not spend much money and so I go one of the best ways to go either carnivore or keto is to go to McDonald's and just order beef patties they'll sell you just be passionate ah he's a dollar fifty really fatty for a quarter pound yeah so you can you know like it's like usually what I use about two pounds of meat a day and that's what is it I don't know that's like 15 bucks so you've been doing this carnivore thing - mm-hmm how long you been doing it for off and on so I have two for the carnivore I've done since the first time you either your podcast to Jordan Peterson or that kind of thing I died in two but before then I've been doing Kido like my favorite meal is just like meat and I know some people hate cauliflower but cauliflower and or green beans just that's do you worry if people hate cauliflower why'd you have to make that distinction some people hate cauliflower I move out their hate and cauliflower who the fuck are those people that's a weird thing that I just said a bunch of people say Kyle first sucks recently so cookie right it doesn't suck you know what's good Buffalo cauliflower like buffalo wings buffalo sauce golf are fucking delicious what's that but that says sauce yeah no sauces is like you're giving in to your weakness and spices and you're given away no see like call up a blender taste I Timmy is better because you get to appreciate the the fundamentals of the food so I got okay so I don't know I just enjoy it do you salt meat salt yeah oh how do you do that when you don't appreciate the fundamentals of the meat yeah good point yeah you don't like you're playing chess do you like hot sauce hot sauce on everything yeah I do but I stay away from it like I I tried to listen food to me right now in my life is a source of energy not a source of pleasure but it can be both I unfortunately I'm not addicted to drugs I'm not addicted to many things but with food my mind I don't know how to moderate really so like anything pleasurable is a problem for me like cookies you put two cookies in front of me to like I don't know how to eat just one of them like it just doesn't my brain is terrible at it Lissa's girl caught a Girl Scout cookie season son yeah they changed the name of Samoas those are my favorite and now they have a new name they're like I think they're calling like Tagalongs or something like that what's that for a while I think really whether they change their separate things though I think is that am i talking about the wrong thing the ones that are like though they're chocolate on the bottom that's to have that coconut in them yeah yeah yeah yeah that doesn't sound like the words of a man who's stick to the carnivore diet oh I miss dick all right yeah I mean I'll have cheat days or cheap meals I should say tag along as the peanut butter oh that's right those are good so those are fucking good what is it what are the Samoans now what do they call them now they just changed they just changed to something new ever no what are you a robot I'm rushing to basically robot basically I ate six of those and I was feeling like shit Oh what it maybe this is just a very quick caramel delight is that what's called now well I think so just someone might have owned another company or whoever they were paying to me I was wondering if it was a racial issue that's what the question was was someone saying because it was racist this odd questions there's no the name of the cookies are owned by the two different companies who make them and they just you know it changed the name racial issue Wow cuz Samoa like someone might be like sensitive to having a cookie they're named after an island people I gave fuckface that's our Island not your cookie you know see that those cookies don't even sound good to me anymore what about American cheese it's not okay I cheated she American cheese I'm not okay American oh yeah what what like I stay with a Russian dog it's a cottage cheese well there's there's Swiss cheese there's American cheese and that's it right is there any other countries that are named specifically after the cheese named after the country I bet you it's not even just like french fries I bet you American cheese is not even American do you remember when there was freedom fries for a while people were trying to call fries freedom fries like post-911 cuz they were mad that France didn't want us going over to Iraq and then people who hate freedom banned it yeah freedom fries oh that's so dumb but the thing I really like actually like I think that's the thing that people don't often talk about is the focus like my life I think a lot of people do this is being able to focus for long periods of time and that's why I stuck with with Kido know those core things especially yes the focus is pretty tremendous well that's what I really got with the car the amount of my flatness of energy the lack of dips and valleys peaks and valleys it's amazing yeah it's great it's and the fast fast thing helps me to like Jack Dorsey doesn't only what's called Oh mad one meal a day yeah you could just say one meal a day this old mad stuff Jesus Christ yeah I'm uh I'm a hip reddit lingo guy I think I read it it's so mad oh okay no I don't know one meal a day but 20 you know 24-hour fast that that that's that's a careful weapon you have to play with at least for me like it for some it's weird it helps your mind really focus I can sit sometimes four five six hours a day like programming really thinking in like loose track of time and really focus but when you do so when you interact with other human beings you're kind of a little bit of an asshole I am sorry I mean when I went Oh in a in a way where it's it's funny but if there's something about a person that's full of crap you are more likely to point that out like when you're on keto or carnivore no it's a respective of diet keto carnivore whatever is the fasting oh the fasting fasting really so it's you're more irritable what is I I think it's irritable but you also see things more clearly it's so like I don't know I'll talk to my parents right or something like that when I'm more well-fed I'll be like just enjoy having fun with them and if I'm like fasted I'll be like why are you always judging me kind of thing right like you you you realize the thing the the aspects of the interaction which are problematic and you want to sort of highlight them I'm just sort of noticing it which is problematic when you're in a working environment especially sort of deliberating discussing with other engineers how to solve a problem I'm more likely especially you know would lead a team to say that somebody's a little bit full of shit when I'm fasting as opposed that makes sense being a little bit more kind and eloquent about expressing why they're full of shit I found myself feeling more aggressive and more inclined to use recreational insults when fasting or carnival carnivore what's the recreation I thought like come on fuckface fuckface you know like saying something like that someone or fill in the blank with whatever the rate of other words using academic paper the rate of fuckface goes up well just just in in casual conversation I'd find myself using fun insults but more of like would the intent of kindness behind like no I mean having fun even talking about people who aren't there just having fun but that that's also a function of being a comedian we do that to each other really bad yeah like when like I had a birthday my friends made me cake said happy birthday faggot it's like that kind of shit is just so a part of the culture of comedians like everybody calls everybody bitch everybody you know it's just yeah the fun which is awesome because this comedian culture is now at full-on war with the canceled culture and it's like it's like two armies of people who don't give a damn the people who give way too much of a damn well I have mixed feelings about all that stuff but I ultimately feel like the directions moving in the reason why it's happening is for good I think there's a lot of people that are complaining about things and they're trying to cancel people and all that stuff and it's you know ultimately some of its misguided but I think the ideas behind it like the the primary push like the gravity behind it is people want less racism less discrimination less less of a lot of things but then along the way you have hypocritical human behavior that gets involved in this and you have people that are you know deeply flawed themselves but pointing out minor flaws and other people and then they get exposed and they've feel horrible and for every person who participates in this cancel culture it's like the wave is coming back at you I mean it comes in and it comes out and if you go too far out on that fucking pier it's you gonna get you and this is part of it that we're learning and I think what what people are today like if you look at the just the if you look at humanity from like the 1930s whose Hardman people lived in a hard way it was ruthless if you've watched films from the 1900s early 1900s the first of all the domestic violence was so normal yeah like heroes in movies in the fifties and sixties just some active women in the face heroes smack their wives you know hit their kids as it was a different world and and people would look probably at our time today and say you know people openly ate meat meaning not or like I could see it not engineered not engineered meat right yeah sort of ate meat from factory farms mmm-hmm sort of as opposed to recreationally hunting it themselves and eating what they hunted or engineered meats allowed me yeah or you can get ethically raised food I mean there are there are a lot of ranchers like it's one of the things that butcher box does very well as they make sure that they have relationships with ranchers who have a commitment to ethically raised animals and ethically ethically killed animals and what that means is you know they don't participate in anything that has anything to do with factory farming no antibiotics no added hormones ever and that is possible I mean people have been eating animals from the beginning of time literally 97% of the world eats animals and this idea that the only way to do it is through factory farming I don't think that's correct and the only way you know I mean this the idea is if you eat meat you participate in factory farming and that's horrific I don't think that's true but I do think it is true when it comes to fast food for the most part and that's unfortunate and I think if they could I mean we need more transparency for sure when it comes to that stuff and that's one of the reasons why those ag-gag laws agricultural gag laws or people there's laws that prevent people from working in these factory farming situations to expose there's laws that prohibit them from exposing the horrors of these environments that's a real problem that's real issue that's clearly designed to protect that industry and allow them to commit these crimes yeah it's one of the things I'm a I'm conscious of my own hypocrisy in this I've I think deeply unfortunately love meat sort of like and I'm aware of the the the how unethical factory farming is yeah and so those two things I have to sit with and be conscious of I don't know it's a question like when did that happen when did the factory farming thing have you go back to the 1930s there was no factory farming it was just farming yeah sure I think there's probably incremental I sure wasn't in 1930s there wasn't already some mass so what is time for farming is scale but also sort of the suffering there's a certain line you start to cross mm-hmm where it just feels to us I mean yeah it's unclear which point it really becomes torture versus agricultural agriculture mm-hmm that's an interesting line and we're gonna yeah this is probably a good answer for that the real problem is food the birth of fast food is really probably where it short but it wears McDonald's McDonald's has probably started a hundred years ago I don't know I'm not sure when store um but at scale you know the the feeding of massive amounts of people that aren't growing anything that's the real issues the real issue is when you whether you're in New York City or Shanghai or Los Angeles large gigantic metropolitan areas that aren't growing anything they got to get a lot of food to those people if you have 20 million people like in Los Angeles 20 million people eat meat that's a lot of meat yeah you guys get them yeah I got to feed them oh those signs steps up I think lab engineer me just got interesting yeah it is interesting heavy how much have you paid attention to it not much I'm waiting like this is the horrible thing I'm very cognizant of it that I kind of don't allow my brain to think much about this whole space because I love meat I'm trying to save money I get it right so you eat those McDonald's founder pains you know so I and the life of a scientist right the scientist and especially now I've taken a leap that's a difficult leap so I'm still affiliated with MIT but I decided to leave my full-time position why do a start-up so I want to try to build try and trying to build the kind of thing I dreamed about we talked about the movie her I'm working that's been 80 90 percent of my day in fact me doing the podcast is trying to is not trying is already successful at giving me enough money for food and shelter tell people the name of the podcast so they can artificial-intelligence podcast Lex Friedman listen listen to uh was it you know musk Eric Weiss I was on there I talk Gary Kasparov Chomsky Sean Carroll Sean Carroll is brilliant he is brilliant what is it like talking to Chomsky he loves yeah well I talk most people say my voice is very boring and I talk slowly to those people I say go fuck yourself I love you I love you you're right I'm trying to actually it's very difficult to be to express thoughts like some hair struggles with us to to express thoughts with the kind of humor and eloquence that they are in your brain like to convert them as a comedian you're essentially a storyteller so you already you don't often you probably don't even acknowledge you don't even know how you did it you're like Roger Gracie you've probably developed this art of storytelling of being able to laugh and make other people laugh of like bouncing back and forth to me most of my life has been spent behind a book or computer thinking interesting thoughts but not connecting with other people and doing that dance of conversation so learning that dance while also thinking is really tough so with Chomsky was like a pleasure because we could all both be robots but but I think he's like 92 years old is he really yeah and the thing I'd loved the bottom so you know there's all that political stuff that I don't pay attention I mean he's he's a major sort of activist but he's also a linguist that thinks that language is at the core of everything of cognition so like it's at the bottom everything starts with language cognition the reasoning perception all of that is things built on top of language this is a brilliant sort of seminal research but 92 years old he still looked in my eyes and really listened and really thought and really sharp ideas came out I mean you do the same thing that was just people ask me like we meet Joe Rogan like you don't take yourself too seriously even with your celebrity with the popular the podcast that's a huge thing and with Chomsky what was really surprising to me is well he's pretty stubborn around his ideas and so on people criticize him he's so stubborn in his ways he didn't take himself too seriously like i sat there I'm just doing some kid talking to him he like really listened mmm like the stupid questions the interesting questions he really listened 92 years old to have that kind of curiosity that was I was like I'm so happy when I see that kind of thing yeah that's that's a wonderful example of a career academic who's still just concentrating on ideas ideas yeah I'm still thinking always you know cuz academics can be like really any other endeavor any other discipline you can get lazy right you see that in almost every walk of life there's certain people that rest on their laurels and especially when you become popular you get really good at explaining so you get like you do these talks you geez lectures you start saying the same thing over and over you know and you forget to listen like out of because of because of this podcast of the the artificial intelligence boxes but also Joe Rogan very two different groups of fans whom I both love you know people come up to me and start a conversation and I love it like the just like listening to them and they're you know I hope I never lose that I'm like younger than Chomsky I hope you stay that way it's nice of you have the time it's a problem if you're in the rush and someone wants to talk to you about something like very deep yes I've had those moments where someone says hey man I got to ask you and then they might do this is a long conversation I can't can't that's the version that's your burden actually I'm in a beautiful place which I don't think will last too long which is I'm not sufficiently famous to to work like though those things don't happen often and right - what can I can have that conversation right you have the luxury although let me say I got to hang out Bryan Callen over been a huge fan of on on New Year's Eve I got to watch the old man dance and this funny thing happened he's a celebrity yeah so we're hanging out and two times somebody came up to me and Bryan and they said wow it's Lex Friedman it's so good fucker mamie's so proud it's because it's a boss then yeah I think it's like nerds and whatever sure yeah that was funny though Blair's he's uh he's one of my I mean it was in credit like I I didn't know you guys were friends until it all came together in the podcast and so and I was a huge fan of his from like MADtv days he's one of my oldest friends yeah how'd you guys what's-what's met on MADtv I was a host one week and he was the he was you know one of the stars of show he's an awesome guy man I could really underappreciated person and he's a guy that because he acts so much and because he gets into that you know he's just always into that world he didn't put the same amount of time into doing his podcast his personal podcast is I think he should have because he's great at it you know he was one of the first people that I knew that interviewed Jordan Peterson and he's know that yeah he said a bunch of brilliant people on his podcast he's had a bunch of like really interesting intellectuals and scientists and think it's mixed mental arts or something like that yeah he's doing it with it with hunter his friend we stopped doing it with him he's uh he's an unusual guy Brian countess cuz he's silly but he's also brilliant yeah you can see that sort of Eric Weinstein has the same quality obviously from different worlds the silliness you can see through the silliness that there's an intelligent first of all a good human being there but also being but at the same time he's like the butt of every joke I appreciate that so much I love silly people yeah silly people are so much more fun the people that are like easily offended and easily upset like oh he's so exhausting silly people are the best I actually say I'd uh I played your theme song on guitar in Brian cows researching it like how do you play in a Joey theme song and brought there's a Bryan Callen sing yeah video uh like Joe Rogan shoulders for days yes yeah some silly song he made it I'm gonna I'm working on an ideal with I'm gonna try to figure out cuz I can play guitar and play the theme song and put up online he's gonna work together make an album you know we're gonna make it out like a Joe Rogan Thema he's gonna come up with some words on there what's the notes you got you got pages and pages of notes in front of you these are stuff that you really wanted to discuss yeah yeah well we talked about AI at all but let me at least Boston Dynamics may be interesting to talk about I don't think it was a fake video that I sent Jamie today these motherfuckers they keep getting me there's a new fake video it was the same one I think they someone's take another clip from it oh is it those guys have been making VFX videos on YouTube for 10 plus years they're really good at it it's so good people don't know that there's a YouTube channel where people I think it's a single YouTube channel that does like yeah visual effects like fake humanoid or hot dog robots that kind of resemble something like Boston Dynamics AX dude this is one easy stuff with guns yeah this one they gave the robot a gun and have pull it up Jamie what is the gentleman the corridor digital on YouTube is the guys that keep that make it quarter crew is the YouTube channel is fucking incredible that it's not real it looks so real and so the the robot they kick it they hit it with a hockey helmet or a hockey stick rather they're like long video they made a while ago they might have made a new one which was one out in desert but I think I had seen it before I see they trick you with the Boston Dynamics it's boss town and boss Thomas it looks so realistic but here's the thing we're not that far off from this thing no okay let's let's walk it back let's walk it back it it's not realistic and what way so let's see it's it looks human realistic so you can tell it's a human like a robotics person could tell it's a human because it's really difficult to do that kind of motion that kind of movement Oh like when it's getting shot well not the getting shit so there's a lot of movement it does for the purpose of comedy right like it actually is on purpose trying to look like a human for the comedic internet effect like getting a human that's getting pissed off and so on yeah those qualities are like another order I'm like this here where it's like oh come on so for terminator type of movements some of those are just comedic you know you don't need Terminator type robot right but they do have legitimate robots that can do backflips now and do so it's really the back players I guess for this is real this is all reals manipulation so all of these robots depending on what we're talking about here but those are remote-controlled and these are single demonstrations that they've perfected so they're it's really important to distinguish between the body of the robot and the brain of the robot so these bodies unlike anything else I'm like a Roomba unlike a drone who can also be very threatening the these bodies somehow we enter amorphize them and they terrify us I don't know what it is I met spot minion person that was one of the most transformative moments in my life really because I know how dumb it is but the experience of it like it's not even ahead it's supposed to be a hand but it looks like a head and it like looking up at me with that hand I felt like I was like I think it was magic it was like a it was like Frankenstein coming to life is this moment of creation and what I realize is my own brain sort of anthropomorphize in the same way you're like looking at these robots and you're thinking these things are terrifying you know like what's like you know in ten 20 years where are we gonna be you know that's our brain playing tricks on us because the key thing that's a threat to humanity or an exciting possibility for humanity's the intelligence that the robots the brains the mind and these robots have very very little intelligence so one of the in terms of being able to perceive and understand the world very importantly very importantly to be learn to learn about the world from scratch so the terrifying thing is you talked often like with this philosophical kind of notion that sam harris talks about sort of exponential improvement be able to become human level intelligence superhuman level intelligence in a matter of days become more intelligent than that that's all learning process that's being able to learn that's the key aspect we're in a very early days of that there's a there's an idea of you know Big Bang is a funny word for one of the most fundamental ideas in the nature of our universe same way self play is a term for I think one of the most important powerful ideas and artificial intelligence that that people are currently working on so self play I don't know if you're familiar with a company called deep mind and open AI google deepmind and a game I know you're a first-person shooter guy but Starcraft and dota 2 so last year these are what he called them real-time strategy I guess in people won millions of dollars in eSport competitions and so open AI separately had open AI 5 which took on dota 2 dota 2 is the computer game based on Warcraft 3 that's the most popular eSport game and then deep mine took on Starcraft with their alpha star system and the key amazing thing is they're similar to alphago and alpha 0 they learn to play go is the mechanism of self play that's the exciting mechanism that I think if we can figure out how to have an impact on more serious problems than gay we'll be transformative okay what is it it's learning from scratch in a competitive environment so thinking of you have two white belts so I'm going to teach it so you have you have two white balls training against each other and trying to figure out how to beat each other without ever having black belt supervision in structures and so on and slowly getting better that way coming up inventing new moves that way and eventually they get better and better by that competitive process that's the Machine playing itself with all human supervision the interesting thing is there's a lot of cases in which if you set up the competitive environment well enough for those two white belts they'll learn to be black belts they'll learn to be not only black balls they'll learn to be better than like exactly the kind of evolution that's happening at MMA right now if you put that in a digital space and speed it up you know a million fold it'll continue to improve let me pause here because this is one of the things that I think probably translates to AI as it does to jiu-jitsu you need more than one opponent like you can't have one input one person training with one person specifically and singularly you're not going to develop the type of game that you need to become a real black belt in jujitsu 100% exactly so that's part of the brilliance of this mechanism so imagine you didn't just have white belts you had a opportunity to generate a new random white belt like that like a fat big one little one right and all kinds of different one that aggressive one Bravo passive passive one and then and let them play and then it's what you find is like jiu-jitsu might be simpler than the general problem sort of different kind of like Starcraft and so on but there is sets of strategies in this giant space they're these complex hierarchical strategies like high-level strategies and then specifics of different moves that emerge some of which you didn't even realize it existed and that requires that you start with a huge amounts of random initial states like the the fat person the skinny person the aggressive person so on and then you also keep injecting randomness in the system so you discover new ideas so even when you reach purple belt you don't continue with those same people you start your own school you start like you start expanding to totally random new ideas and expanding this way and what you find out is there's totally surprising to human beings like in the game of chess or in the game of go in a game of StarCraft these this self play mechanism can do what sort of AI people have dreamed of which is be creative create totally new behaviors totally new strategies they're surprising to human experts that's why Gogh was so astounding to them right because it's such a complex game such a hard game and and it's able to well the first astounding thing is able to beat the world champion yeah the second astounding thing about both chess and go is it's able to create totally new ideas sort of I'm not good enough at chess or go to understand the newness of them but grandmasters talk about the way alpha alpha zero plays chess and they say there's a lot of brilliant interesting ideas they're like very counterintuitive ideas and that's such a and that's all the first breakthroughs didn't have as much self play they were trained on human experts but alpha 0 and alpha star and open AI 5 these systems are all fundamentally self-playing meaning no human supervision starting from scratch so no black ball instructor you just wrote and that means so they learning from scratch that's the that's exceptionally powerful use that that's a process from zero you can get the superhuman level intelligence in a particular task in a matter of days mmm that's that's super powerful super exciting super terrifying if that's kind of when you think about the challenges we don't know how to do that in the physical space in the space of robots there's something fundamentally different about being able to perceive to understand this environment to do common sense reasoning the thing we really take for granted is Arbor to reason about the physics of the world about the fact that things weigh things that you can stack things on top of each other the fact that some things are hard some things are saw some things are painful when you touch them all that like there seems to be a giant Wikipedia inside our brain of like common sense dumb logic that's very tough to build up that this yeah that's that's it it seems to be an exceptionally difficult learning problem that Boston Dynamics will have to solve in order to achieve even the same kind of physical movement behavior that we saw in those videos and then on top of that to have the ethical behavior the that not the ethical sort of the objective the complex strategy is involved in first following orders and then getting frustrated and then shooting everybody that's an exceptionally difficult thing to arrive at because ultimately these systems operate on set a set of objectives and what a lot of people that think about artificial general intelligence say the objectives we need to inject in these systems that they're trained on you need to have one uncertainty so they should always doubt themselves just like if you want to be a good black ball you should always be sort of always open-minded sort of relaxed always needing to learn techniques it's okay to get submitted so always always have a degree of uncertainty about your worldview the kind of thing we criticized Twitter outraged mobs for not having hmm so having uncertainty and the other thing is always have a place where there's should be human supervision and I think I just there's a I think we have good mechanisms for that in place that I think I'm very optimistic about where these kinds of learning systems can take us the exciting thing is Boston Danya or terrifying depending on whether you think I'm a trustworthy human being but Boston Dynamics is now opening up their platform so they're working with a few people I'm trying to make I'm quite busy these days I'll try to make time to make it happen to work with them to build stuff on top of the platform so that's I am referring to spot mini as a platform so this robot is this dumb it's like a Roomba it's a dumb mechanistic thing that can move for you but you can build you can add a brain on top of it so you can make it learn you can make it see the world and so on that's all extra that's not what Boston Dynamics offers so they want to work with people like me to to add that kind of capability and that's exciting because now you can have hundreds of people to start to add interesting learning capabilities and so I mean I mean have to retract my words about how far away we are mmm with the capabilities of these robots once you now open it up to the Internet so I was speaking to Boston Dynamics I think they're solving the really hard robotics problem but once you open it up to the huge world of researchers that are doing machine learning and doing computer vision and doing AI research the kind of capabilities that might add to these robots might surprises that's where people are concerned right the big leaps the big lead and then sort of just not being aware of the consequences of these big leaps and once you let the genie out of the bottle you can never put it back right the genie and the self play mechanism where you grow from zero to becoming world-class chess player that's that's the genie being out of the bottle did you see black mirror yeah black mirror you know that episode heavy metal with heavy metal very difficult to pull that off very so for now for now and and you had a you had a conversation with Nick Bostrom also talking with on the podcast yeah one of the things he mentioned is so I don't think he thinks about the stuff a lot I do about military applications mm-hmm I talked to folks that's one of the things people don't just like with me they kind of put to the side they don't want to think about military applications Brian I would be more worried about drones that I would be about robot dogs right because the kind of stuff is on the black mirror episode is really difficult to pull off to make a robot learn drums are kind of more impressive right because they they hover they can move through 3d space they have Hellfire missiles attached to them I mean there's a lot of crazy shit that they can absolutely do right now with drones and you're talking about large-scale drones but you can think of small scale drums and I think there's a I think there's also a black mayor episode with drones where they take over I haven't seen that one so there's a I think there's drones everywhere and they're kind of doing you know your basic friendly government surveillance mass surveillance kind of thing I think it's four I think they sell in the episode that is for a good cause we'll see what spoiler alerts but I think they like start killing everybody or duh wasn't there there has been research done on making artificial insects that have like little cameras inside of them that look like like a dragonfly or some some sort of bug and they fly around and they could film things and the thing that terrifies a lot of people is going more microscopic than that more like robots inside the body that help you cure diseases or cold mud are certain things even at the nano scale so basically creating viruses yeah a new viruses little tiny ones yeah and Dave if they learn they can be pretty dumb but on a mass scale Dom you don't have to be intelligent to destroy all of human civilization so so the real question about this artificial intelligence stuff that everybody seems to the ultimate end of the line the what Sam Harris is terrified of is it becoming sentient and it making its own decisions and deciding that we don't need people that's what everybody's really scared of right I I'm not sure if everybody's scared of it yeah they might be I think that's a story that's the most compelling the sexiest story that the philosopher side of a Sam Harris is very attracted to yeah I am also interested in that story but I think achieving sentient I think that requires also creating consciousness I think that crew there requires creating the kind of intelligence and cognition and reasoning abilities that's really really difficult I think will create dangerous software based systems before then they'll be I think we already have them the YouTube algorithm the Twitter the recommender systems of Twitter and Facebook and YouTube from everything I know having talked to those folks I mean worked on it the the challenging aspect there is they have the power to control minds the mass sort of what the mass population thinks and YouTube itself and Twitter itself don't have direct ability to control the algorithm exactly like the one they don't have a way to understand the algorithm and - they don't have a way to control it because but what I mean by control is control it in a way that leads to an aggregate a better civilization meaning like sort of the Steven Pinker or the better angels of our nature so it encouraged the better size of ourselves it's very difficult to control a single algorithm that recommends the the journey of millions of people through the space of the Internet it's very difficult to know that and I think that intelligence instilled in those algorithms will have a much more potentially either positive or detrimental effect than sentient killer robots I hope we get to sentient killer robots because that problem I think we can work with I'm I'm very optimistic about the positive aspects of approaching sentient of approaching general intelligence there's going to be a huge amount of benefit and I think there will be well there's a lot of Meccans that can protect against that going wrong just from knowing the we know how to control intelligence systems when they are sort of in a box when there are singular systems when they're distributed across millions of people and there's not a single control point that becomes really difficult hmm and that's that's the worry for me is the distributed nature of dumb algorithms on every single phone sort of sort of controlling the behavior adjusting the behavior adjusting the learning journey of different individuals so like to me the biggest worry and the most exciting thing is recommender systems what they're called a Twitter at Facebook at YouTube YouTube especially that one that one has just like I think you mentioned there's something special about videos in terms of educating and sometimes indoctrinated yeah and YouTube has the hardest time I mean they have such a difficult problem on their hands in terms of in terms of that recommendation because they don't this is a this is a machine learning problem but knowing the contents of tweets is much easier than knowing the contents of videos hmm like we our algorithms are really dumb in terms of being able to watch a video understand what's being talked about so all its look all YouTube is looking at is the title and the description and that's it mostly the title it's it's like basically keyword searching you know and it's looking at the at the clicking viewing behavior of the different people so like it figures out that the Flat Earth supporters enjoy these kinds of videos it forms a different kind of cluster and you know makes decisions based on that by the way it seems to make definitive decisions about you know it doesn't like Flat Earth youtube I think well YouTube in particular are they're trying to do something about the influx of conspiracy theory videos yeah and the indoctrination aspect of them that you know one of the things about videos is like say if someone makes a video and they make another very particular subject and they speak eloquently and articulately but they're wrong about everything they're saying they don't understand the science say if they're talking about artificial intelligence they're saying something about things that you are an expert in there they could without being checked without someone like you in the room that says that's not possible because of x y&z without that they can just keep talking so one of the things they do whether it's about Flat Earth or whether it's about dinosaurs being fake or nuclear bombs being fake they can just say these things and they do it with an excellent grasp of the English language right so they say it there very compelling and the way they speak they'll show you pictures and images and if you are not very educated and you understand that this is nonsense and if you're especially if you're not skeptical you can get roped in you can get roped in real easy and that's a problem and it's a problem with some of the people that work in these platforms their children get indoctrinated and they get angry their children get indoctrinated now what's interesting is they get indoctrinated also with right-wing ideology and then people get mad that they're indoctrinated but like ben shapiro videos so they'll get pissed off with that well but you're okay with left-wing right why because you're left-wing so then it becomes like okay what is a problem what's really a problem and what is just something that's opposed to your personal ideology and how who gets to make that distinction and that is where the arguments for the first amendment come into play like should these social media companies that have massive amounts of power and influence should they be held to the same standards as the First Amendment and should these platforms be treated as essentially a town hall like where anyone can speak and there's a you know a platform and there's a real problem that there's not that many of them this is a real problem the real problem is like Twitter is the place where people go to argue and talk about shit and then Twitter maybe as a competitor of Facebook but YouTube certainly doesn't have a competitor YouTube doesn't have any competitor I mean there's Vimeo there's a few other platforms but realistically it's YouTube you know YouTube it's a giant giant platform what is this alphabet reports YouTube ad revenue for the first time video service generated 15 point 1 billion in 2019 holy shit comparison I just looked up which ad revenue was supposedly around 500 to 600 million wow that's a big difference and what about facebook facebook is stupendously valuable probably way higher than that but this is the first by the way Facebook I don't think pays like YouTube paid for my McDonald's burgers yesterday yeah Facebook's not right Facebook is not in Twitter and Instagram I think I'm paying you like directly but there's a lot of calls to break up Facebook I'm not I mean I'm on Facebook but I'm not on it I don't use it I just it's just connected to my Instagram when I post something on Instagram ëcause to Facebook as well I don't I never go to face but I said Joe Rogan's Facebook group that's a dumpster fire of brilliant folks look at this Facebook's revenues amounted to 21 point eight billion dollars the fourth quarter Jesus Christ just the fourth quarter the majority of which were generated through advertising the company announced over 7 million active advertisers on Facebook during the third quarter of 2009 probably they'll also adds an Instagram that thing with YouTube is just YouTube not Google brought YouTube premium you know and to be fair so the cash they have they spend like Facebook AI research groups some of the most brilliant it's a huge group that's doing general open-ended research Google research Google brain google deepmind are doing open and research like they're not doing the ad stuff they're really trying to build its that's the cool thing about these companies having a lot of cash is they can bring some of the smartest people and let them work on whatever in case it comes up with a cool idea like autonomous vehicles with lame-o yeah it's like let's see if we can make this work let's throw some money at it even if it doesn't make any money in the next 5 10 20 years let's make it work that's the positive sort of side of having that kind of money yeah that makes sense that there is as long as they keep doing those kind of things the real concern though is that they're actually severely influencing the democratic process so it's that it's difficult I mean I certainly in Jack Dorsey Jack Dorsey in terms of the CEOs for interact where they think was one of the good guys yes I agree yeah hey I mean he's he wants a Wild West Twitter well he doesn't know he he wants he wants a good Twitter he's kind of thinking about Wild West but he wants his ideas have 202 Twitter one that's filtered and one that's like capture yeah anything goes yeah but I think he that the point is nobody knows what's what's the best kind of Twitter even having to Twitter's like do you really want the Wild West you want the First Amendment to say free speech free speech for everyone it's a difficult like the gray area there you're just talking about YouTube with certain people like saying that I'm an expert in AI mm-hmm or autonomous vehicles but I disagree with a lot of people those people make videos and maybe they don't have a PhD god forbid like are they not an expert either am i right I'm I'm actually personally sick of the academic sort of Cathedral thinking that just because you have a PhD and just you can be an expert like I'm not an expert I'm an idiot do you feel like that that line is getting more blurred with the access to like all those MIT courses that are online and did the extreme amount of data that's available to people that there are going to be a lot of people that even though they might not be classically trained they have a massive amount of information and have an open mind yeah like the best you know I love like I'd like I'd record a podcast right I do like what first of all shout out to Jamie for being incredible mastermind of audio production right what sir yeah yeah yeah but the reason I'm getting giving a shout out because I suck so badly I didn't have to do it I do it all myself and but I learned that I do it you know pretty good when you learn it yourself from scratch just like what you just saw with music and so on that lone guitar mm-hmm a scratch you can learn with the online materials they have now yeah you could become really good and the the journey you take is not the traditional conformist journey through that education process you take your own journey and when you have millions of people taking their own journey through that process there's gonna be brilliant people without a PhD without ever having gone to college right and they I mean it's difficult to know what to do with that especially about political questions like economists there's these you know Paul Krugman Nobel Prize winner economist Harvard economist you know there's supposed to be the holders of the truth of the fundamentals of our economy and one is there gonna be a crash what's good for the economy is the left the right what taxation system is good for the economy but nobody really knows say would like nutrition science psychology economics anything that involves humans it's a giant mess that expertise can come from anywhere right like like Rhonda Patrick I think she's pretty criticized for she's kind of young yeah and she's I would say you know she's incredibly knowledgeable as one of the world sort of experts but I think academia probably doesn't acknowledge her as an expert she's like young she recently got a PhD I don't I'm not even sure she you know like that there's that kind of hierarchy that people do she's been unjustly criticized by people who don't even know her actual credentials there was one guy who was criticizing her and saying well she's not a clinical researcher that's one of the things he was backing his criticism on like you know that's exactly what she is and she's been doing that for years like you don't know what the fuck you're talking about people get very touchy with her because she's young and also because she's incredibly brilliant like that lady she brings stacks and stacks and notes when she comes here she isn't even look at him she just rattles off all those studies off the top of her head she isn't a massive amount of data available and she's very unbiased in her perceptions of things like her she's all about what do the results say what have the studies proven what can we learn from those studies and what do we have to take into consideration when were we're assessing this data she's brilliant she's she's off the charts brilliant and people get fucking jealous and I've seen it I've seen it with weaker lazy Minds in academia that criticize her that had at least at one point in time had a larger platform and I think her platform is bigger now and I'm happy that I played a part in that I don't want to be a social justice warrior but I've have seen women being criticized more harshly yeah a lot of domains of science I think you're right yeah well you know and she's pretty too there's a lot of things wrong there you know for that too like good-looking beautiful guy funny yeah handsome no actually I get criticized as this guy's an idiot boring why can't he be more like Joe Rogan okay what else you got there uh what else denotes wise yeah my god I see about martial arts okay I gotta talk to you about well so I'm a huge fan of wrestling a huge man a huge fan of the Dagestan region yeah I have up getting a lot of shit for it posted dead you know Connor is gonna be cowboy before that happened I'm also a huge fan of the different styles of fighters in anime and I'm surprised how much it actually Connor gets even though he brought besides besides sort of all the all the mess that came with him he also brought an interesting style an interesting way of approaching fights and it's just I was thinking and also philosophizing about fighting which i think is is amazing and it clashes with the ideas of khabib to me like the khabib nurmagomedov it be so I posted that Connor would be cowboy and why didn't know Dan was gonna say was gonna say but tastes Maz Badal and I thought he could beat Maz at all and then the biggest fight ever 30,000 people in Moscow with against could be for real for me every match would be the greatest getting past moms with all and not easy and khabib getting past 20 Ferguson not easy yeah both of those fights and first of all Mazda all is now gonna fight us man which is very interesting is yeah that's July very very interesting fight Guzman is such a tank he's fucking terrifying they hate each other there's a lot of yeah certainly a lot of animosity and lot of shit talking but it's also the more that happens the better it is for both of them in terms of revenue generated it's a really interesting fight now let me tell you something when Maas Badal was at the Conner cowboy fight when they put the camera on him biggest pop from the crowd the biggest at all the people AHS like screaming people went nuts they saw him they like he was you know wearing that robe mm-hmm he's hilarious dude I mean he's right look he's a slow starter in terms of his career like being recognized for the kind of fighter that he is now and also being recognized publicly as like a superstar but his time has come he is here he is a fucking star when that camera went on him and the audience saw him that crowd went bananas the entire t-mobile arena just they went crazy yeah that'd be I mean yeah well this might be an epic fight but in terms of like the great I just think the maybe it's me there Mathis eyes notion like rocky for mm-hmm but Connor vs. khabib in Moscow I can just see it with like Putin and phaidor sitting there I'll sit next to him do you think they would do it in Moscow yeah 30,000 people if Connor went to Moscow man well good luck getting out if you win good luck getting out of there if you lose you know but I I so loved their khabib is so loved in Russia but they I think Russian people also love MMA generally there's a like the the fan the number of people that love fighting in Russia is huge and I I know it seems like on the internet khabib is like they love khabib and Connor's hated but I think ultimately they love her good what is uh what's kind of call it a good heel no no a good scrap I think he calls a good fight yeah yeah I think I think I'd be probably the biggest fight of all time and I think actually Conor has a shot like this what the I love khabib is probably my favorite fighter I love that style of fighting I'm like say ETF brothers that Frankie Edgar said mentioned to you about they're probably the boov isar say TF is the greatest freestyle wrestler of all time just epic his brother Adam has a match against was a good soldier of God what's his name Yoel Romero Romero at the 2000 Olympics in the finals y'all Romero looks like the mole like if you were to imagine that Arif the most terrifying opponent ever he's just like shredded ripped and then Adams ietf looks like I don't know dad bod very skinny like nerd and he just effortlessly like like destroys him really yeah with a trip like let me see that video 2000 Olympics Sydney finals Adam say T of first rows named Adam say TSI SI i t IE v vs yo romero you l Romero's fighting Israel at a son yeah in March I got this giant I can't yeah not too much of a nerd but well he definitely doesn't look as built as yo L and yo L is a freak yo L is probably the freakiest athlete I think I've ever seen personally in terms of his build like his small waist a hug that guy picked him up I was at the end of it there's a couple of moments where he take away scores points it was got him down here I guess he's up by four to one and I think once again he takes him down where I don't see just started off in the beginning so we could watch it there's a certain moment I mean there it goes just start it right there they're basically technicians yes for sure when you look at the Duggars tiny people I mean it's there's such emphasis on technique yeah everything else but also toughness it's like they don't they have both things like and this is one of the things that George st. Pierre told me about training in Russia excuse me training a Montreal what I'll take down right there fog a spectacular yeah oh my god it's amazing look at that yes it got I think those are like inert red boots you yeah you gari depe true covered his mouth what George st. Pierre told me about training with Russian nationals in Montreal he said they're so technical in that you get a lot of Americans that that are definitely technical but they emphasize being hard and tough and grueling training and teens and grinding butting heads and practice and he said whereas the Russian nationals are far more committed to drilling far more committed to the technical aspects of exchanges and and and and going through you know one one technique after the other chaining these techniques together understanding the paths also the one of the least to me one of the differences it could be similar to yellow Romero's actually philosophy but the philosophy of the Dagestani of the Russian people the Soviet Union is that recognition fame money all that stuff doesn't matter and even winning doesn't matter the purity of the art is what matters at least with a sigh ETF brothers is what they stood for well that's that's mirrors what khabib says about Conor that he doesn't want to rematch with him yeah he's like fuck that dude that's there I mean yeah he was a little bit more of the modern age I mean he has an Instagram and Twitter and so on right he's he and could be despite what he says also there's a little bit of trash-talking and you know he still plays the game a little bit to change his face yes that's my favorite send me location whatever changes face most people say especially when I'm on here is is basically if I'm if could be of did science that's that's my one of my favorite quotes he's ever said though I want to change his face change his face is terrifying it's terrifying because he can do it the cool thing is with Conor that doesn't affect him the the the confidence he has you know the confidence that Connor has is just incredible well that he wants to do it again well I know for a fact that Connor was going through a whole lot of shit before that fight and did not have the best training camp he did an amazing training camp for this like he really prepared head like he did for Connor or excuse me cowboy the the cowboy fight his coaches were saying he's never looked better that he just was on fire and so folk and so so accurate and and precise and training and that he was just on fire and that just seemed to be that all of the bullshit and the distractions and all the things that sort of come with being the kind of global superstar that Connor is he managed to figure out a way to get away from those and to just really concentrate on his craft and and pull everything to a championship level again and goddammit he looked like it against cowboy and to see the contrast of those two cultures I mean it is a rocky four type of situation that yeah the track because you better believe Conor McGregor will resume trash truck who knows he might not you might not you might not I mean he didn't in this fight with cowboy at all he didn't do any trash-talking I wonder if maybe he has learned and I wonder if you know his desire to beat khabib eclipses his desire to get inside of his head and play all the games it usually plays and the promotional game set ultimately probably won't be necessary but I think you know the UFC is trying to push for it right now they're pushing for right now a rematch with could be but they're ignoring Tony Ferguson in a lot of ways in my eyes and I'm like that is the boogeyman it's gonna be exciting it can go it didn't go anywhere mr. boogie man dude he doesn't get tired he doesn't get tired he slices everybody up he isn't like he's lost one fight in the you know X amount of years and that was cuz he had a broken arm the michael johnson broke his arm so when you think about what tony has been able to do to world-class fighters what he did to donald I mean he just smashed Donald's face he smashed Anthony Pettis he smashed he smashes everybody Tony Ferguson is the goddamn boogeyman he really is it doesn't get tired man and he's get taken down and for sure I think I'll do the his thing on him he's not scared to be taken down that's the difference between Tony and everyone else if he gets taken down he might let him take him down and just attack off of his back and elbow the shit out of him off of his back he's fucking dangerous off his back he's hard to control he scrambles very very well he also has fan plastic submissions and he catches them from everywhere I mean he catches triangle choke stars chokes his jars chokes are spectacular he's got one of the best Darth chokes in the sport and he's he's not scared oof could be you get submitted my god that would be crazy when he puts could be asleep look yeah do you remember when Dustin Poirier caught khabib in a guillotine yeah yeah he did it caught could be been a guillotine listen that is not what you want to be with Tony Ferguson you do not want to be in that position with Tony Fergus and that's a different kind of guillotine so did Dustin Poirier is primarily a striker clearly he has submission skills he's submitted guys before he submitted max Holloway Dustin Poirier is a bad motherfucker no doubt about it but when it comes to pure submission skills Tony Ferguson has an edge and you know he's a black belt in a tenth planet black belt he's a master of submissions and a great wrestler and a great scrambler and the thing about him that's so fucking terrifying is his cardio is all the things right it's the striking it's the the grappling it's the submission abilities was not gonna get tired he doesn't get tired and his mind is impenetrable his mind's impenetrable people are looking past that fight fine no not me man I I don't understand it but no was he's talking about you know look at everybody he's fought beat the fuck out of everybody that Edson Barboza Hafele dos Anjos yeah yeah I mean he smashes people and smashes people I mean it's crazy that I would I would say if I I would say it's probably could be the toughest fight I think it is as tough as fine and I do I think that's puts you know a lot of people put could be like in the close to the top 10 of all times oh he's in the top 10 of all time a mile away my eyes he's 28 no as a lightweight cares about the record you look at the people you've beat sometimes we idolize people for the perfection of the record too much dude the way he rag-dolled hoffa dos anjos the way he steamrolled like I mean he's beaten top-flight competition and made them look like they have no business being in there with them but I think if you beat Tony first I mean that yeah that's um that's racism that cements it yeah and people put him above like I don't know I think Hana deserves to be in that story in that in that top like 15 top 10 perhaps her house Josie Aldo yes like beating oh yeah I don't know why people look past like Josie Aldo or Eddie Alvarez oh yeah though the Eddie Alvarez fight was unbelievable like at least maybe I'm just biased in the sense that I thought there's no way that Conor beats Josie Aldo and then there's no way Conor beats Eddie ours moving up a weight class like I always thought he's gonna lose and it being surprised makes me like up Conor's ability in my head well he's phenomenal it's with Conor it seems to be a matter of how focused he is and who is he fighting and you know where is he at in his life he's just his life is so chaotic he's always filled with so many distractions I mean think about all the crazy shit he's done the throwing the throwing throwing the the dolly at the bus and just all the nutty shit he's done but it's nice that he seems to be still hungry to fight even though he probably has a lot of money in the bank well he certainly was hungry to fight cowboy I mean he looked fantastic in that fight um and again you know he's worth a couple hundred million dollars it's so it's just the pure love of the game that your love of the game and that's kind of the ethic that's the Warrior Ethos that could be becomes for him and that it's cool to see that mind if I nobody's ever said anything in Russian actually probably in the Joe Rogan podcast no I don't think so if you ever need a translator okay I'm your man no can I read a so say T I've just a few lines in Russian okay I'm sure so bro vice our site EF would read boris pasternak which is a famous Russian poet won a Nobel Prize before every match and he kind of captures that ethic so this is the poem I'll say it in Russian okay and then in English please okay drew Gilbert vamos lá do I do - I put Cepeda patch no para Gina at Bobby oddities Omni does not recharge he doesn't needi need okay yet post-its ELISA no bridge jovem Shiva Metallica Shiva Metallica the concern I know there's a bunch of Russian people that appreciate that the translation a bit crappy is very difficult to translate the Russian language but it's the others step by step we'll follow the living imprint of your feet but you yourself must not distinguish your victory from your defeat and never for a single moment betray your credo or pretend but be alive only this matters alive and burning to the end so this is the end of a poem that represents the fact that Fame that most of the poem says that same recognition money none of that matters the winning and losing none of that matters what matters is the purity of the art just giving yourself completely over to the art so like others will write your story others will tell whether you did good or bad others will inspire using your story but as the artist so in the case of Pasternak he's a poet writer and it did Road dr. Zhivago the is the art you should only think about the art and the purity of it and the love of it and so when you look at both I say I say T Evan the brothers in the whole Dagestan region they shunned Fame so I mean with the the thing that kabhi was thrust into this MMA world which is fundamentally I mean so really it's a popular sport it's an interesting it's an interesting thing I mentioned I think the last time I was on here the most terrifying human being you know investors when they like buy a penny stock seeing it's gonna blow up to me the most terrifying human being in the heavyweight division the the Russian tank I mentioned last time the saddle I of who now just continues destroying everybody and it looks like he's already won a gold medal one bunch of World Championships he's a heavyweight the heavyweights in that and UFC should be scared always it gonna fight MMA so the the heart thing spell his name and let's get a video so we can hear look at it it's serious Jamie's got yeah BAM it's think of I will never join MMA no classic that's not that's the MMA that's a that's part of the quote that's and that's not that's that's not so yeah I love saliva that's closer to where he was chasing he's still chasing the loves you so 2020 only Pixar how do you say the name how did you say his first name I just call him the Russian tank but it's Abdul Abdul Abdul Rashid said Alya okay but 23 24 years old and I think his tension is and he says he has a lot of close friends who are MMA fighters he loves watching it he feels a lot for them but it's not that what the very thing that this poem gets at he doesn't want he thinks that wrestling the pure sport of wrestling is all about courage skill like he describes in this way he thinks MMA also has to have this component of ashitaka showmanship yeah and he is he doesn't he doesn't like it but I think that MMA needs that guy to write like a heavyweight could be a heavyweight could be every Conner needs a khabib like every every showman needs a person who says showmanship sucks every Ally needs afraid to get Frazier right and I think but this guy is terrifying I think he would is he would do the same thing to the khabib division again humble technique is everything but just a strength wise is also mom and he is he really thinking about finding or no it's hard to say it's hard to say because again one of the greatest wrestlers of all time really focused on 2020 Olympics it's throwing punches here I think what's going to happen is once likely wins gold at this Olympics he's gonna he's gonna you know this this Titanic ship of a 23 24 year old ship is gonna start thinking and turning hmm maybe there is artistry maybe there is skill and courage in and mixed martial arts well there definitely is I mean he doesn't have to do trash-talking thing there's a lot of people that are very stoic that fight and they don't participate in any of that stuff you know and then there's people that thrive on that stuff I mean it's it's really up to you the UFC doesn't tell you have to talk trash you know I mean results are what matters right and it's not even trash that's interesting I think stories are interesting yeah that's why that's why people like like team sports are gonna follow what you watch the Superbowl yes no I didn't yeah went to Disneyland I wanted to talk to you about something that was at Disneyland what's that there's a new Star Wars ride yeah this crazy Star Wars ride and there's the you're it's a 20-minute ride I mean it's a crazy long ride and a lot of it you're in like a vehicle yes and the vehicle is all programmed by computers the the direction the vehicle the way the vehicle means it's very complex there's no tracks so you're riding around on this vehicle and the vehicle like that they're shooting at you the vehicle has to back up you go into this new door the vehicle knows how to go around a corner and what's that guy's name Darth Maul is trying to cut through the wall spoiler fucking this this new ride is amazing it's crazy how intricate and complicated it is and how far off the deep end Disneyland went to create this thing I mean it looks so crazy I mean you were like how much money this cost this is it right here so you're riding around in these things and stormtroopers are shooting at you and are there rails or no no oh there's no rails man everything is done by computer the computer tracks out the environment and knows where each one of these does go and by the way there's several cars moving at the same time so there's people in front of you tharon cars they get shot at and look at the fucking scale of this place so that's one of them giant four four-legged robot things that's in Star Wars so you're moving underneath them there's giant cannons that you have to move through it's in cries of the resistance it's trackless yeah so this represent eyes on the ground there's some yeah I think those lines in the ground just the wheels going the same way over and over and over sorry I just wanted to sort of commentate but that day they're probably not using the computer that's one so yeah I think it's probably lidar based it's I don't know what it's based on but it's some the computer is coordinating all of these different things at the same time you go through this room and you're seeing battles outside and you feel it you see the walls get hit like that like it's fucking crazy man it's it's amazing yeah I mean it's a right the line is bonkers so the robotics has close to this like the AI aspect of this is probably minimal look at that look at that like you're in this thing you move through this room and in the background you're watching these starships shooting at each other in the following time perfectly yeah it's crazy man yes it really could make this happen I mean these are people that are willing to probably invest hundreds of millions and yeah like in this so guaranteed so I think there's some like there's very minimal AI in this because AI creates uncertainty uncertainty is very undesirable in situations like this yes yeah I don't think there's any a I in it but there's some for sure there's some sort of automation some computer automation yeah but it's basic software it's like it's software I call this basic don't you dare don't you dare Lex it's Star Wars it's not even real Wow how are you there's reusable rockets being launched on a monthly basis and we're gonna call it as Mars for real that's real right that's more interesting for sure definitely but this is dope Mars while you know I'll be here playing fucking Disneyland rides and then I'll go home and sleep in a bed and breathe air fuck you'll be out there on Mars in the history books with no way I remember you I don't know books don't matter once you're dead yeah I mean it's nice that we have access to the history books and I praise the historians for sure but it's not I'm not interested in making history yeah I don't know actually what I said that because I don't care about the history books well I do the just the exciting it's one of the only frontiers that we can actually be exploring like we've explored well the depths of the ocean weapon exactly right yeah but the outer space that's like man that's that's like the most exciting one for engineering and science that we can explore in the mind like engine like we don't know shit about the mind and explain that with the neuroscience with AI mm-hmm just all of that the cot the cautious the all the other thing you talked about with Boston on the simulation yeah that's guidance um I wanted to talk to you about that too because you brought up boström what do you bastard I'm relies on I mean he was relying on theories in terms of like mathematical theories of probability to to say that he thinks it's more likely that we're in a simulation yes he has a the thing he's articulated I don't think he's come up with the idea of the simulation he just kind of really thought about it deeply he came up with a simulation argument which is these three categories he described to you possible outcomes I think the first one is we destroy ourselves before we ever create a simulation the second one is that we would lose interest in creating a simulation at some point and the third one is we're living in the simulation yeah what do you where do you lean I think - I think there's going to the three paths that he highlighted it makes it sound like it's so clear that it's just three but I think there's gonna be a huge amount of possibilities of the kinds of simulation like to me I keep asking you know to ask Elon Musk he's about the simulation wait he said what's on the other side what's outside the simulation yeah I think I asked what would you ask an AGI system he said what's outside the simulation is the question he believes in it hi or at least he entertains it as a troll the Elon Musk embodies like the best of the Twitter internet troll I mean and a brilliant engineer and designer in one it's like yeah it's like a quantum state that you can't quite figure out like what what's the coupling because I don't know if he's trolling but I'm the same way I love asking people out the simulation even though I get a little bit of hate from the scientific community but it pushes you get hate from the science your community about simulation because it's it's ridiculous notion if you think of it's like literally that because it's not a testable thing we don't know how to just like why are you talking about this why do you sit down with Elon Musk and talk about the simulation we when you're sitting with a world expert in particular aspects of rockets or robotics like I'm an expert what I came without you said that I'm not expert anything but I know but a few things about Thomas vehicles why don't you talk to him about that right why don't we talk about simulation well the thing is the simulation pushes you outside of the muck the messiness of everyday details of science and makes you ask big questions about like the nature of our reality hmm and I I like to think of it as like what how would we build a simulation like what would be a compelling enough virtual reality game that you want to stay there for all your your whole life that's a first step there that's useful to think about like what is our reality what what aspects of the are most interesting for us humans to be able to perceive with our limited perception cognitive abilities interpret and interact with and then a bigger question then is like how do you build a larger scale simulation that would be able to create that virtual reality game which i think is a possible future we're already creating virtual worlds for ourselves on Twitter and social networks and so on I really believe that virtual reality will enter will spend more and more of our lives in the next 50 a hundred years in virtual worlds and the simulation hypothesis assimilation discussion as part of that I think I think there's the question of what's outside simulation is really interesting that's the other way of because like what created us what started the whole thing it's the modern version of asking what the what is God what does God look like what you know it's it's asking what does the programmer look like I think that's a fascinating question but arguing that we're already living this situation I think you've got stuck on that little point mm-hmm I think it's not that there's a bit of a language barrier too there's like there's a technical yeah I think next legit it's funny it's funny nick is a legit philosopher so he's been fighting battles in the philosophy game like you've asked them does somebody disagree with him yeah on these hypotheses and there's a little bunch of philosophers disagree with him but including Sean Carroll on the philosophical level and a lot of the arguments are in philosophy and then I'm sort of technical and they are about language and about terms and so on but I think yeah it's very possible that we we live in a live in a simulation I think one of the this constructs of so physics theoretical physics with many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics as Sean's talk to you about reveals some interesting sort of fundamental building blocks of our reality there's something I don't think people have talked to you about which is like the coolest thing to me the most amazing thing that nobody can explain yeah things called cellular automata and there's a guy mathematician named John Conway who came up in the 70s with a thing called game of life and cellular automata are these two dimensional or one dimensional but game of life is two dimensional grid where every single little cell is really dumb and it behaves based on the cells next to it and it it's born when there's a fuse when there's like a certain number like three cells alive next to it and it dies otherwise so it's like a simple rule for birth and death and all it knows it's it's nearby surrounding in its own life and if you take that system with a really dumb rule and expanded in size arbitrary complexity emerges you can have touring machines so you can simulate perfect computers with that system and it can grow and all these behaviors grow like if you watch if people Google like a game of life and you can watch this extremely dumb simple system just grow arbitrary complexities and what you start to realize that from such incredibly simple building blocks that don't know anything about the around them you can build our entire universe you can build the kind of complexity as we see it less so like we think that God is like designing every little aspect or whatever of our world or a simulation hypothesis the simulation is designed by hand like I'm gonna craft these things what you realize is all you can all you need to do is just set some initial conditions set some really basic rules and allow the system to grow as long as it can grow arbitrarily just crazy stuff amazing stuff can happen from like from simplicity complexity can emerge and that for like if you study this a little bit closer just like watch it people can watch that a game of life on YouTube and think about what it's showing like for ten minutes it will blow your mind the fact that from simplicity arbitrary complexity beauty can emerge is like incredible so for the simulation the creator of the simulation is probably some 13 year old nerd living in like in his mom's basement it's probably just set some rules in this video game and press play and then arbitrary complexity can emerge it can have a Joe Rogan it can have an Elon Musk all the technologies that we've developed and probably millions of other alien species that are living throughout our universe so the yeah that to me the cellular automata reveals that the simulation is much easier to create than we might think and but there's a lot of variability and the kinds of simulations will create like I think the simulation hypothesis things like you know there's like one but I think there's were going to be a lot of varieties there's that there's that there's a lot of possible different rule sets there's about a lot of different physical mediums in which these simulation could be created it can be a completely virtual world the role of consciousness whether you make most people conscious or not whether most of them are philosophical zombies they're just like non player characters and it's just you or you have or is your mind simulated like the role of suffering so consciousness brings with it this idea of of basically you know subjective experience if the subjective experience comes the idea of pain and fear and so on the thing again my Russian romanticization of it but I think fear of death is essential scarcity is essential for community for life you know and that that's a nice feature of this little simulation we got going on that there could be a lot of different alternatives I think that could be less individualistic less less consciousness can be present in different kinds of forms so I see there's a lot more options than those three that he highlights and we can destroy ourselves in a lot of interesting ways the entire civilizations from AI to nuclear weapons to biological to all kinds of weapons so it's almost like whether it's a simulation or not is almost irrelevant the complexity of the existence and all of the various pushes and pulls that keep everything together they're they're almost operating like some grand plan whether they like it or not whether whether or not a grand plan exists all these different things are happening and everything is moving in a very specific direction right it's moving towards further complexity like I was having a conversation with a friend of mine last night where we were talking about phones and we were like you know like when are they are ever gonna look at a phone and say I think we're good we don't have to the camera works great signals great and call people you can text people let's just stop innovating right here and we're both laughing like it's never gonna happen but even though we admit like if you have an iPhone 11 or a pixel 4 is that we have yeah it works they work great but you don't really need anything better like in terms of the way our culture works you get so much done on these things you can Bank on them is okay if I'm drinking all your water's by the way yeah we have a lot of water yeah please that's very polite of you this the disk the existence itself whether or not there's a design to it it seems to operate in a matter that would indicate there's a design the design doesn't have to be real doesn't have to be a simulation it doesn't have to be a grand plan but it moves in this the same way as if it's a grand plan it's weird it's hard to put into words but there's a different force and a momentum like the evolutionary process the fact that life was created the fact that there was a kind of progress and also like just like with the Native Americans the the fact that suffering seems to be a constant story that was weaving in mmm-hmm like we would constantly progress but we seems to be like creating the other and torturing that there seems to be constant suffering and war and so on through this growth process and that seems to be the death is a huge part of that and and conflict conflict even social conflict like we were talking about social justice warriors and and that type of thing I think they almost have to exist it's almost like the world creates a space for them and people find a way to fill that space yeah the conflict by the way also I don't know if you ever know where you're kind of even though you were thrust into politics you know where of politics but there is the Iowa caucus going on today the first vote for the Democrats yeah Bernie's leading in the polls which is interesting but that's the that's the that's the fun little we got Americans have their own little conflict going on here oh there's always going to be conflict with all groups of people with everything I mean there's conflict in the comedy community I'm sure there's conflict in the AI and autonomous vehicle community there's this conflict I mean and and those things are critical you know you learn from conflict if everything was just simple and easy and there was no resistance whatsoever nothing would get done and also your own personal systems would never get tested I feel like every adversity of the experience is really a gift because on the other end of that adversity there's an opportunity for massive growth what was that thinking Grow Rich quote that Lovato Lovato said the other day every adversity carries the seed of an equivalent advantage I mean yeah just that yes yeah just a beautiful way to see it that that's a beautiful quote how to write it down I bought that book too I'm gonna get to that once I'm I'm worn out on Native Americans I got about seven other Native American books I've been so I like I mentioned doing the start up right it says since August and it's been it's been a bit of a torture like the self-doubt it's pretty hardcore because I know cuz I've been failing that stop like so I'm trying to build it spending most of my day programming and you're trying to build a her for a she whatever it is that she or her was it hurt her but no there's on that path there's particular thing because you want to create a business you wanted me right you know you have to create tools that people would you enjoy using on the path it's a long journey to create a companion that can form a deep friendship it seems so weird it's it seems everything seems weird until your life becomes better because of it mmm like flying cars seem weird oh yeah to me still in fact uber and Hind I just partnered they're still pushing this idea of flying cars electric veto I just feel like people are gonna slam into each other yeah unless they are autonomous and they have like magnets so they repel you know like they can't hit each other they get close they sure and what happens when they hit like to me the like what does an accident look like it fall on your head yeah you're hanging out in your house trying to watch you know black mirror or also hanging currently most accidents people can walk away from the cars today are incredible right and I don't know how you can walk away from a dryer crash good question a very good question it's probably won't yeah fuck that's scary yeah but any technology kind of seems awkward a weird you can you can be terrified of it or you can you know you can think it's weird until it until it takes over I mean none of us know what that would look like to have a closer connection with AI systems I don't know one of the things in this book that I'm in the middle of with I'm actually towards the end of this black health book as it details the invention of the automobile and the implementation of it so recent world change that was the other surprising thing about this book is it's so recent Razik really really recent yeah so during this time where Black Elk was a young boy sees Custer get killed takes his first scalp you know remembers the sound of the man gritting his teeth as he's cutting his hair off like cutting his scalp off and then later on in his life as he's an older man the the world goes from very few automobiles to most people have an automobile during his lifetime most travel is by automobile what does he what does he say about this world this this new world is know let's read the book because the mean he doesn't even know about this world he knows about the world of 1930s I believe he died in the late 30s just it's scary to be born not scary but I don't know what it would feel like to be born in this natural world to see the kind of suffering and the US military and then see the technology of the Industrial Revolution kind of propagate and be faced with that I don't know what that would feel like I don't know which world is better well the world represents progress is uh right right what is progress yeah what is prior I mean it's it progress seems to be inevitable complexity inevitable never-ending complexity and then there's this push towards that and I've always wondered if I mean Elon has the saying that human beings are the biological bootloader for AI and I've always thought that if you paid attention to the human beings desire for materialism like materialism seems to be like a constant throughout cultures people want things and when they have things they want better things they want newer things well that generates a consistent level of innovation inside that that civilization that culture people are gonna make better stuff because people going to want better stuff so they're gonna improve upon things well if you just scale that and you keep going and proving and proving what do you get to you will you get to something like artificial intelligence you get to something like you know some sort of some some sort of an event some sort of a thing where the world changes and I think technology will help us ride that wave I am optimist in that sense we've talked about much but I'm an optimist on your link I think there'll be a few exciting developments there so neural and brain computer interfaces I think it's really exciting possibility there that Nick Boston was - also skeptical about I'm more positive about increasing the bandwidth of our brain being able to communicate with the Internet with the information it doesn't necessarily need to be through brain computer interfaces but increasing that bandwidth to expand our ability of our mind to reason not not the expandability reason sorry - take the mechanism of our minds ability to reason and expand it with access to a lot of information mm-hmm and increase that bandwidth to be able to reason with facts just like we can look up stuff on Wikipedia now increasing the speed at which we can do that can I think fundamentally transform our ability to think do you think that that's ever going to be a wireless option cuz right now they have to drill holes in your head right right yeah I think I think this could be us there could be other interfaces I think yeah I think so but also like I said we're technology holes in your head sounds terrifying right now but it could be normal look ear piercing yeah well yeah hear piercings yeah I think but standard like hey did you get suited for neuro-link yet yeah Billy's only 13 he's not ready for neuro-link we're gonna wait until he's 16 he's like dad all my friends have it yeah come on dad yeah I want to get fitted and just like surgery you take knee surgeries and all surge except brain surgery and you take that for granted yeah for you you're like okay with it but on the brain it's yeah it's scary sketchy can i cuz I know you probably gotta go yeah we got last guy can I close it out with a poem what Dewar's I'm that guy okay because I've been doing the startup have been sufferings I'm reading a lot of Bukowski Oh Bukowski poems you get drunk when you read them of course some whiskey roll the dice vodka vodka is for friends and family oh when you buy yourself to whiskey no I don't need a man that's not drink by himself oh well this man doesn't but it's more like relaxed thinking drink is whiskey vodka is we're going crazy okay we're going going dark we're gonna raid and pillage roll the dice or go all the way by Charles Bukowski if you're going to try go all the way otherwise don't even start if you're going to try go all the way this could mean losing girlfriends wives relatives jobs and maybe your mind go all the way it could mean not eating for three or four days it could mean freezing and a park bench it can mean jail it can mean division mockery isolation isolation is the gift all the others are a test of your endurance how much you really want to do it and you'll do it despite rejection and the worst odds and it'll be better than anything you can imagine if you're going to try go all the way there's no other feeling like that you'll be alone with the gods and the nights will flame with fire do it do it all the way all the way you will ride life straight to perfect laughter it's the only good fight there is what's this thing fake it fake it for Instagram alright fake it for Instagram people on Instagram that watch it well no fake fake look up fake that was awesome appreciate your brother thank you very much for coming in here it's always pleasure we got to do it more often at 10 more years yes 10 more years bye everybody [Music]
