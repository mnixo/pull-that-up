the girag and experience this is the whole theory on my why kids should not should see gentle porn because gentle you know what I mean because I grew up like with like finding a Playboy magazine and then just batting off to it until I found another magazine that was you know kids today going straight to Internet they're gonna be fine Australian guys find their magazines in the woods as well yeah in the bush we find of incredible and I always used to think that some adults hidden it he but I look back at it noticed some other kid hid it there in the board of the simulation yes it was permanent yeah it's almost like he grew there you're supposed to find it I I ate it to that environment I master things like that I've got seven years old seven and I found this picture my my my mother was the only woman in the house I went through one of her magazines so we didn't have underwear catalog sitting around like a Victoria's Secret catalog or something that would have been good but we I found this picture in my mum's women's magazine it was just this naked tetanus this magazine never had a naked tit knit before right so I cut this picture I cut this picture I masturbated to this picture from about 7:00 till 10:00 this one tick right and I found her at 10:00 cuz I was watching the news it was a picture of a woman having a mammogram whoa yeah but I didn't know as a kid and I used to think because the other chick was in a machine being squeezed down I was like I was like that must be some sex machine amazing that kept your interest for so long yeah I saw the lingerie thing I the Sears catalog for my friends my mom's Sears catalog and I used to keep it I put it in my like books and I kite it in a book and they pull it out and look at it I didn't masturbate in shit I remember the lingerie you know like in the catalogs the old catalogs we used to have catalogs I remember there being the blackboard of video and then when I went to university I was like 22 or something like that they used to keep on sending me the catalogs because I bought a couple of videos years ago and I used to keep them and they were they were just like pictures of scenes from the movies that were Chinese I never bought anything but the catalogs once a month that was a big day three and I was broke you know I was fucking happy out of that I always used to kick my roommate one catalogue behind so he would get the new month's one after I got my new month's women it's funny that what you would want then to see naked girls to look at naked girls that people would deny that of you they'd say you're not ready for that yet I mean that's what it's all about it's about protecting kids but clearly you have these sexual crazy urges and everyone's just in denial about it nope you're only 16 you can't buy a Playboy like you can't even buy a Playboy when you're 16 you can't even just let me see a little titty I don't even need to see a gym can I just feel the leg but they put it in movie movies when you six things they're gonna come in Britain um well you have to find some page through the newspapers there's a topless girl yeah normal no always right yeah that's good what 16 year olds can't go to the movies that show tits tits is not talking like Porky's has a bit of chitin it is importance are wouldn't Porky's me I think back then it was oh well we're gonna strike em which is 16 enough oh yeah maybe that is all right yeah good schewe is that what it is mature is 16 are that as 18 there's 17 I think is our isn't it and nc-17 is for you no matter what you can't even go with an adult unless you're 17 my debt my father is so deprived of being able to see tits now because my mom was such a big hefty woman and he just he just really still like a horny sort of like my dad right so when we were kids if me and my two brothers were sitting watching let's say the movie labyrinth we were watching like a very innocent puppet related film all at once doing this family he'd be other than the house we'd all go oh look at those tits Wow within seconds my dad would just casually walk out and sit and watch the rest of the film with go all the way through the film then you go oh yeah come on watch the beginning in that film I missed what happened in the beginning control him you would try oh that's hilarious and you see you let him sit through the whole movie yeah yes if we don't golf and play and then he'd have to sit through the first 30 minutes again like oh that's fucking funny just in the heart because it was gonna come it's gotta happen see look you guys should have filmed that it would make a hilarious short film yeah let's explain it there the timecode search and we could still do it now you should do I could see it it's filmed the light of the TV is what's on him right little timecode in the bottom show him 10 minutes later 20 minutes later 30 minutes later look at this what could be hilarious if you explain it to the camera he found he found some porn magazines they were retaining this be found some porn magazines under what my mother fans of porn magazines out of my paid and she put them in the bin because that's like I don't you know you put him in the bin and then she didn't say anything to me she just let me off scot-free I don't she didn't like get angry or anything so I felt like I got away with my porn drawer was empty alright and I worked in news agencies I used to collect them from the bins at the back of the news agency cited piles and piles of suppose a paperboy right so I I was in my dad's workbench and I was hammering a nail down I look under the bench and there's all my porn magazines a little dog-eared and they're like lettuce leaf on him and stuff because what happened was my dad's gotta take he's gonna take the bins at the end of the driveway on a Wednesday right he opened the guards been sold at porn he recovered it all and took it off to his shed where he could masturbate so so I collected it all back up and I took it back to my drawer just cuz you know circle life right and my dad comes him in the living room he comes out and goes Jim you guys were you in my garage and I said all right oh my god yeah and you guys you know have those magazines no it neither you I was about 13 either you and he ah can I fall right there's a national moment where I start with my dad and I had a debate when I was 13
