hello freak bitches how much material do you think like I would say if you're gonna become a big-name stand-up comedian you're gonna have to put out a bunch of specials right so if you put out how many specials can you do on your life before you have to start talking about other shit probably four five four five specials you know a lot of stuff that I remember like it was so at the time like I can laugh at it now but back then it was pain so I didn't get on drugs like my sister did I didn't do my brother didn't got on drugs to deal with bullshit that we was going through I just stayed you know sober and thought these motherfucker was crazy so to get rid of the pain I just kept putting it in the back of my head I didn't want to remember it so when I became a comic all of this shit started rushing through my brain and I had the excellent sister bitches this world I just asked my sister other day my granddaddy ran a bootleg house so in this bootleg house I had a retarded uncle named uncle Cecil that was crippled but my granddaddy would buy him pussy on Friday but me and my sister would have to go in there with the prostitute and hold his legs back until he get his dick in before we could go outside and play so I called her up and I said is this shit real gonna hold his legs back cuz he's with cripple you know how when they need so he couldn't he couldn't get it in until we moved his fucking legs back I remember what I was like areum probably eight I was like okay sister put it in his fucking smile because he will retard ease I know it's so fucking up and I asked my brother I was like do y'all remember this shit I'm going crazy and I don't like call my brother last week and I said my mama used to had this theory she said when it when it rains and the sun is shining the devil was beating his wife you ever heard a us and she said we were rain and the lightning and the sunshine he called the beast cheese though she's my mom's like you should be the bitch cuz she don't believe in God talking about you crazy bitch I used to think they stole me Joe nobody could be before to this fucking crazy I am being distracted by how much I have to urinate oh the other day I was talking about I'm glad guys just started man I know but I was not prepared I had wine I drank a whole one of these good yeah stay out and I had a bunch of coffee this morning too but I was thinking yesterday this is related how much would you weigh if you never went to the bathroom you'd be dead how quickly it wouldn't take long what if we had evolved to just not ever have to like a baby after just a month would be bigger than the biggest human ever don't you think I need to do the math well it depends on would you need to consume like if your body was so efficient that you no longer needed your name like we kind of assumed that your body would need to urinate but why if your body needs water to stay alive like what is why are we assuming that it has to well it has to get rid of some waste that it doesn't want anymore well why could could we just turn that into more hair instead but why does it have to get rid of waste like isn't it possible that we can become so efficient that we no longer need to get rid of waste and we can just sort of exist by breathing right here all right completely just like self yeah we running to get to a certain size and once we get to a certain size we just you know whatever you evaporate off by walking around like that you have to take back in right I guess you know yeah cuz they they have you know robots that that just dissipate heat and they don't ever make a waste product your laptop doesn't create as much waste as a human but it's also not nearly as like complex right but in some ways it's more complex they've been able to make machines that can poop you put food in and then it's got bacteria in different pumps and reservoirs inside and it creates something that resembles completely and smells just like a human dump whoa yeah the first one I saw was done as a piece of art as artwork like an artist created this machine that could poop just like a human and now they do it they call it a robo gut inside like a medical thing because when people have GI problems a poop transplant is commonly used reintroduce the healthy bacteria and taking poop from someone else and giving it to the sick person shoving it up there is kind of like you know there's a lot of possibilities for rejection infection stuff like that I guess but the Robo gut can make just perfectly clean poop just look the kind that you want whoa yeah because some artificial poop put up inside of you to fix any imbalances that you have in your gut flora that's fast and that crazy you have like a poop farm of robot intestine right that are just and what do you feed them yeah do you feel like do burger runs for the Robo gets the Mindy it's gonna totally argue it's got to be totally organic it's gotta probably it's probably just like a paste or a liquid it's like baby food you wouldn't have to taste good the robots not gonna complain you know fuck that robot just eat it bitch yeah well you mean when jay-z went to Cuba oh my god and everyone the media was like oh look it does he know that that fucking che hated black people you're like what are you talking about like what is going on it was the weirdest in Che Guevara died like 1964 something weird Che Guevara died and he also went over there Golan fought like the revolution in Africa so it's like I don't know if that's really true but it's just so crazy he was the perfect guy though beyond t-shirt he just looked like such a great revolutionary I know people that wore a Che Guevara t-shirt that didn't know jack shit about remember there was that wave of Che Guevara support that happened like like a decade ago right nobody was really what they're talking about like you can look cool I have with a Che Guevara t-shirt on people had Che Guevara tattoos and it's like why what about Che right fucking and he would have hated it I mean like the fact that he's become this commercial figure it'd have been like he would have fucking hated that you know it's just funny that he's become this icon of like capital well it's a perfect example of these like surface enquiries like people just had no no like looking into it at all no trying to understand who he was or no like deeply about who he was yeah this is like a baby even though
