oh hello freak bitches do you have this desire to like keep upping the ante is that an issue um not really no just like ultimately I just like creating stuff and I like making videos and I like exploring places I like Heights I like jumping between stuff mmm and lat not like the natural progression for me is to get higher and things get bigger that's just how it is so it just happens but right but I'm not thinking about it I'm not thinking like I can't just release this so now I need to do something bigger like it's just there it's just natural so how do you go about making a video if you decide I'm gonna make a new video like what do you have a thought in your head like I need to get on the Eiffel Tower like what are you good you know what the Eiffel Tower was never never a plan I never thought let's go to Paris and do the Eiffel Tower did you do the Eiffel Tower Eiffel Tower so what happen do it if it's not a plan how'd you do it so I was in Denmark just travelling around with a bunch of friends and instead of getting in the minivan and driving all the way back to London I was like no I don't want to sit in a van for 15 hours let's just fly somewhere and continue this adventure so me and my friend flew to Paris and then the next day we ended up climbing down for tower do you think this kind of stuff was being done before people were videotaping it like was this must have been it must have been I feel like for certain people it's just a just in them to kind of explore places you shouldn't really explore and I think it's yeah well for you it seems like something that was fostered though right because you started off just doing the parkour stuff yeah and this became of it you know when I was a kid I was like I was a naughty little kid I was always not into things I shouldn't know it yeah yeah man now I'm just a big just a big version of what I was then Wow whoo some pretty cool videos if you look up on YouTube of like urban exploration or people are finding weird pathways and like oh shit look I'm 60 feet underground we made it and there's this shit that's been buried under here wonder why it's buried and look old electronic 750s and stuff like that Oh like under like uncovering the hatch and lost sort of for like that I find stuff like well that's that's very interesting to me but what up but I'm really most - fascinated by is this willingness to put your life in mortal danger and that how exciting this is for people to watch like what's the most viewed video that you have how many hits does it have I think just I have a four million that's what fucking people yeah this one's got a few million I think oh this is you you get a week up so we climbed it we went we just pushed it too far like we went up to the very top platform you've been to Paris no Vince the avatar so you can take the lift up right you can you can walk you take the stairs to the second platform that's the highest you can take the stairs - there is stairs to the top but they don't allow it because they're like weird and narrow and so you take the lift to the top and then there's like a door that's always manned by a security guard that is the door to that staircase and that's what we came up from the backside so we went up and for some reason we just had the urge to just go inside even though it's lit up even though there's cameras everywhere and we open that door I step in to the top platform and then I just hear this this walkie-talkie just go like wow like go crazy in French and I was like shit we've definitely been seen let's disappear so then we ran down we climbed out of the staircase and then on each on opposite corners of the tower in the main beams there's like kind of like a little pocket inside the beam that you can jump into it must be like two by two like sighs I barely fit into it right because I'm huge my friend is small so you just like disappeared into this hole and then we sat on opposite ends of the tower and hid and the lifts you start hearing lifts coming up you start hearing people running up and down the stairs you see torches everything's kicking off and we're hitting these little holes and they're searching for us and I'm just like hiding in this hole I'm like I've got one shoe off because it wouldn't fit in I've got my knee wrestling on my shoe I've lost all feeling in my leg because the blood circulation is gone my head sticking out the top and I forgot like my t-shirt of my head like a little ninja and there's people with torches going up and down looking for us so what do you a video on that little pocket you room ah it's not in this now I do have it's only on two sides of the tower which is strange but it's kind of similar to this gap here I see it's there see on the right it's in that corner there so yeah and it's like a foot apart by foot and a half I think I barely fit in so how long are did they wait so we're in the ruins is what's coming up right now yeah this is what it was starting to open up this was like as we sew this is like right we're here just before we got caught yeah so we tucked in this was just before we got caught so how did you get quite because the lifts start coming up because that the staff start coming up to work or to clean or something and they just saw us we're just like running around these beams and his lifts everywhere so what happens then so with all right so we're still in this hole and we sit in this hole for like two hours at least two hours where they're going up and down it goes quiet so I'll jump out the hole I have a look around I go and see Stevie Stephanie's like half asleep just chilling in the hole and then um come back to the hole I'm like yeah this seems like pretty clear now I think they must have thought that we jumped off with parachutes and we because they couldn't find us and then I was like yeah this seems pretty clear and then every single light on the tower the whole thing lights up and this isn't like the twinkly lights that they have on every hour at night this is like internal lights that are like this big like the whole fucking tower up so I jumped straight back in the hole I'm not sure what's going on and then lifts again people up and down the stairs again looking for us so it was sat in these holes again for ages and then and then it finally goes quiet but the lights are still on for a little while and then the whole thing just shuts down and that I think that was it so I jumped out I had to look around when they got Stevy and then it was ours again and then we were up there until like 9 a.m. I think it was how long was that how many hours 1 a.m. till 9 a.m. Wow so you were climbing around I think for eight five hours that's nuts yeah running on some little French chocolate bar which is really good oh that's how you eat so we had so you came down because you were hungry we came to actually got caught now and so you would have stayed there for the rest of the day the idea was to like wait till it opened and then get into a place where you could hide like near the second platform and then just drop into the second platform and just merge in with like the tourists but we didn't get that far that would have been kind so the plan was to wait for it to open and sneak out with the crowd just jump at the beam into the crowd disappear into the lift done so when you get caught then what happens so we got seen by like a big group of people in in one of the lifts and we're just like waving and they're like ah like angry looking people well like angry people and happy people they're like what thanks going on and then we were like above slightly above a maintenance platform where they have like lifts that take workers up and then so we had to climb down we met people on the the maintenance platform getting the lift there's like five of us like to me and steady and they're like few other people security just like private security for the tower and then we come down to like the basement lifts open it's just like a room full of policemen and we're like go see anything and what they do they technically film at bit I had to hide every single SD card and everything but I had on me how'd you do that three count of your boy no no it was an option that is the only option yeah I haven't had to do that yet but a condom you tied in a knot yeah put them in the condom put your finger up above that's right so how do you um hide the SD cards mean they must have went through your stuff with a fellow I had I thought they would but they didn't I don't know Paris they don't give a fuck the Trinity laid drink wine so I had chocolate had like a big 5d like a big DSLR and then I had I think two GoPros and so two Mike arrestees and one like CF card from that from the big one and I had like this bag that I had like little tiny pen pockets like really thin pockets right and I just stuffed the micro SD cards down there and I had like a little rip in the back padding of the bag so I just threw a CF card in the back of the bag and I just fell down and I just hoped and then when like we got to the police station they were like you have so many cameras on you clearly you've been filming and I was like no forgot the SD cards cameras died and they they believed it I had to surrender everything on my phone I am you had to surrender everything in your phone yeah so I had three cameras right so I was like I had three cameras and my phone so I'm gonna have to give something up to try and save the most valuable the most valuable footage so I was like they were like did you feel my sigh only filmed in my phone because my cameras died and I forgot my SD cards and then they went through like the footage on the phone and just made me DeLeo oh that's cool so that the footage in the phone was like a ruse the footage on the phone was like me in the in the little hole right filming talking to the camera and like filming the people looking as I was like this and I put my phone that's great Lee had something to give them yeah yeah so now then what happens how long do they detain you we were there for like eight hours so another eight hour hours so when you're eight hours up there climbing around how do you pee I pee off the edge of the town oh my god that's probably we get arrested you pissing on these French people is if letters and click on enough yeah I think by the time it gets the ground it's kind of a little spread out and we're not or it's a fucking raging river of piss right on some little old lady's head I'm seems like if you were you know I would just pee on the tower that way it dribbles down slowly and doesn't hit anybody in the head I mean if you sit on the Eiffel Tower and you need a pee there was no one below you because it's like 4:00 a.m. okay you'd pay off the edge maybe Peter no homo coz that's even ruder yeah I'm sorry Todd I know a person if I did pay on them maybe it's a romantic couple going for a walk maybe would have really worked out all sudden girl goes to light her cigarette and you piss right her head and she gets mad and the fucking evening ends poorly and they could have could have been a perfect relationship but you ruined it I killed it yeah so you come down and then another eight hours of detention yep and what are they do to you handcuffed us to a chair we just sat in the middle of this police station there's like cells behind us with people go crazy and like people bleeding from their eyeballs and we just sat there like people bleeding from their eyeballs from other crimes like nighttime fights and stuff like that and gene drunk people and we just sat there for ages and then we finally got taken into like separate rooms where we were questioned by some high up I had a woman he had a dude and we were both questioned for a couple hours and then we were back out handcuffed to the chairs again and then they took all of our stuff and they searched it and I was like what if they find it they're gonna be like okay you just told us that you film nothing and we've just found hours and hours of footage like what's the deal so I was like fuck please no cards yeah and then they finally brought the brought the bags back like must have been an hour they had them form and I thought they were going to go through everything but they brought it back I checked it and I was like story but cards are still here we just lost it we were so happy but the policemen just had no idea what we were doing yeah so do they kick you out of the country there no record no nothing at all so I had to go back in that room I had to sign a an agreement that said I promise I will not climb the Eiffel Tower for three years for three years that's it that was it yeah wait Adam right how come I only give you how come it ain't forever ever think he'll they must like it yeah you know what I was interviewing me loved it she did she was like you really shouldn't be doing this but how did you do this it's incredible like she loved it why he loved it yeah well I think once they realize that you're polite you're a gentleman you're a very nice guy you're just a thrill seeker this yeah it's not a threat to society yeah sky isn't a terrorist yeah so the second question she asked me was did you leave a bomb up there Oh God and I just laughed I was like what come on oh wow well that's something they have to take any consideration they have to actually trust you right if they let you go and turns out you did leave a bomb up there mmm then they have to like they would have to comb over the building with a fine-tooth comb no he's just say he's gonna be like yeah you know what I did I left the bomb up there no no one would write so they're really to trust you yeah fucking Europeans ridiculous ridiculous people three years fuck you either in jail forever it is America they put you right in Guantanamo Bay get in there get know they throw dogs in there with you [Music]
