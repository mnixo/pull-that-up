Lewis is rarely impressed very got impressed guy he's really impressed today yeah this is a fucking Disneyland for dudes up we're in here now fuck it we're in an airport hangar and there's just bow and arrows and dead animals and pool tables and BattleBots see I feel most men live lives that are very very suppressed sure and most men if they were left to their own devices and someone said yeah you do whatever you want in the building wait a minute I can just decide what to put in the building so whatever to put whatever in the building you do the exact same shit for archery setup that's yeah things that I wanted I wanted to make sure there was room for an indoor range that was when you're buying a place yes interesting conversation with a real-estate agent yeah a what I need at least 40 yards for that I said can i virtual hunt Dana is it [Laughter] that virtual hunt game is a very popular game the techno hunt thing yeah like that thing is it's so so addictive it's so addictive though and give you bad habits too you get a little punchy with your trigger I do like that they have some of the animations noting where the real life things of the deer were the elk they're looking at you really did give you a sad face like now can you do it can you do it yeah you can probably get it with other things too right like couldn't you get it with superheroes could you get it like you were that Archer dude from The Avengers and fucking those monsters are coming after children children can we upload everyone who bullied Lewis in the third grade kids that's the that's the same kids that's like when they give the pedophiles like little like underage fuck dolls to try to keep me from doing it for real so you just murdered kids with a bow and arrow you never do that yeah they're gonna give it to them now it's they're available in Asia you can buy some Cointreau BOTS I've heard you might jump up robots and not in this country I found out it's a weird moral thing though right like would you what would you rather have them fuck a little robot in their closet somewhere yeah first instinct is always like oh that's horrible but then you're like it's kind of like giving someone with anger issues a punching bag it's like you've they've got that thing whatever it is like how do you get it out yeah on that little sweet sweet beautiful punching bag the child fuck robots don't punch back meet in the middle you're like okay it's legal but you can't name it do you think you could fuck a real doll I mean you definitely could if you had to but would that be something you'd be interested in I think I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous this situation was just jerk off and think about things I thought we had as a sponsor I've had forever less light it's very utilitarian you're not confusing yourself she's a girl my dream I've had it forever I've never even thought about it I couldn't guess why I would want to use it seems weird it's weird it feels good though does it engulfs your whole dick yeah and you put it in warm water and you get it like to a temperature of a body it's real somehow or another there's like a portal like this tube is a portal to another woman in another dimension but all you can get out is her vagina okay just hold that's it feels real the name of this dimension is called awesome do you jerk off with a fleshlight order yet hold it and fuck it now you're naughty jerk off with it yeah you jerk me off with a flashlight yeah but that was for shiz that was on camera behind her green this interview on the podcast I swear you are a jerk no for the flashlight no whoa what's that about is that a fuck real oh that's a real doctor real dog they're getting pretty good man it will redhead though there's a documentary on Netflix about sex robots really have come far because there are people who fall in love with these sex robots and it looks like the fucking taxi driver johnny-on-the-spot from Total Recall it's like this is crazy like animatronic Chuckie Cheese bass player it's gonna get to a point where it can totally mimic you and he's gonna get to a point where it really is like Blade Runner is that what they are now that's the dude one I thought about buying a dude one to do jujitsu proportions are perfect because I have a dog it's just Bubba dummy the practice submissions on but it's super stiff it's like this but he bait you you basically could drill the moves but it's not the same as drilling it on an anatomically correct body if you had an anatomically correct body to practice jiu-jitsu on you get some fucking tight moves all right yeah but I can't wait till the day when you're around for robot fights na 0 interest there's nothing at stake if they live or die it doesn't matter the whole thing about fighting is that there's some horrible gigantic thing at stake you can fuck one though yeah watch him fight would you watch two robots fuck I would I would if there was like some sort of a program that they were running I would want to see like what the program was how they could yeah wouldn't be a jack material completely fascinating yeah they would probably talk to each other in numbers and they would both be dudes they would both beat it was one that they just made a fuck dollar right and this is this just happened there's videos of it the robots started speaking like a weird code to each other these were like fucking like straight-up fuck dolls Skynet dude and they would turn them on and then they started speaking and what seemed like a code and people were like freaking out about this oh I know what I'm talking about yeah they had these computers complete there were they were linked together and they started communicating to each other in a language that the coders didn't understand and they shut it off they're like what just simply to unplug no I think but I heard that my version of it that I just said might be the most spectacular version sounding but might not be accurate and that whether they might have gotten his like they might have got stuck in like a feedback loop and just been making gibberish right I heard that too so I don't know no one's confirmed way too fucking stupid to know who's right let's just hope it's that second one yeah sounds like a opening scene in Terminator yeah but at the same time the solution being like don't plug that in again man what the fuck are we gonna do like I had a podcast with Sam Harris about it and he is terrified of AI and he's far smarter than me yes whenever I talk to him but yet I go oh okay and he's terrifying terrified that's what freaks me out is when people way smarter than me are terrified about it like what's his name which way Mosca terrified Stephen Hawking Stephen I know no this is going bad and then you're like shit yeah sometimes they're too close to it yeah I feel like some people also get to you know bogged down to the details when you live your life very ignorantly like I do I have no fear of AI technology guys I'll be honest with you is a self-driving Tesla already killed somebody or uh yes we're self-driving taxi our she did something very reckless she walked right into traffic and she might have been homeless lady she might have been on drugs they're not they're not exactly sure I don't think the results of the autopsy route yeah but you've watched the video she basically just walks right in front of the car hmm like the cars going down the road so a person wouldn't make much difference maybe I don't know man I mean it was it's a hard to tell whether or not you'd be able to react well I guess the technology is does it have you know the the technology of stopping quick enough to not hit somebody yeah they want to make it safer right that's the idea yeah but I think it is right I think there's more human error when you're dealing with people drinking smoking weed paying attention to their cell phones I almost would rather just trust you know even if there's a few deaths per year there's way more deaths per year with you know movies just laid out the logic for why the robots are going black I trust and I trust them what's a black lady right I don't know it'll be fighters another video for just stopping perfectly for Tesla stops at olive stops approaches it turns out just through science it has like the same racism of like the 1890s where they're like we'll give the Italians a pass yeah the rest of you guys there's two different types of Mexicans is those Oscar De La Hoya masks Mexicans and then there's those other Mexicans that looked like Indian yeah yes where's my stash starts on the edge your lips where would it stop where would it go with them you know you know that's what the comment that's that's what Mexico is essentially right it was a combination of the Native Americans and Spanish right yeah and I think and and then the Spanish ones are like uh you know they're the ones who are like look down at like the locals but at this point they're all kind of mixed I think like they're still just a different shape that's a real to Canelo Alvarez yeah right fucking redhead yeah very bizarre-looking SEK is another one he's right out of Mexican do yeah yeah yeah crazy I never even think about that Louis yes he should have started playing that card a lot harder after the New York his first his apology letter should have been like well as a Mexican I believe he was born in Mexico I'm not sure about that he's either born in Mexico he definitely lived in Mexico really I would never have guessed that yeah my family lives in Mexico they retired to Mexico my parents did really wide to fucking chill out Jesse the body Ventura talks about Mexico a lot of reference lived there I've got a buddy mind it's got a place in Cabo and he loves it loves it it's okay cobbles a particularly douchey City like I went there to do a comedy festival and it's like straight up the worst people from like think about the worst like 40 year old couple from like your hometown that just like fake tan assholes a whore city like Florida but then they all go and meet up in one town so it's just like thousands of fucking awful people in hot-ass Mexico I don't get it I don't get any I don't understand if you smoke weed why you would go to the Caribbean and not just go to Jamaica every single time is Jamaica the spot dog thought of it it's he loves it I love it cool he's pushed it hard on purpose with dog he's being serious never been actually I was but it was just like a stop on the cruise and I didn't really gain screws yeah yeah yeah we have it was definitely do that we do our Comedy Festival every summer and we thought about doing it's funny the festival was influenced by the cruise because we did these cruises and the idea is you can't escape the you know the bands can't escape the hands they're on this cruise ship you're hanging out the whole fucking time so it's not like you're to a comedy festivals in ten different locations is you don't see a show right right skank fest is all one location it's a party you know two and a half days non-stop you're in one location so everybody's hanging out and we do it we're doing it this year at a place called Brooklyn Bazaar in and Greenpoint Brooklyn it's like a huge it's an old Polish catering hall that has like four different rooms we're gonna three different stages going on simultaneously it's my really and how did Ari Shaffir get the publicity scoop I believe he organized the festival he's a piece of shit that night he got the scoop on you yeah that motherfucker no I look I fucking love her to death but he crushes Podcast Bert's wife hated army still we were talking about all right before the podcast that all of our friends that got fuck you money ari said fuck you the hardest like he does what he wants to do it's amazing how it's fucking beautiful every day that I'm running around he's like you want you Indonesian food at a place somewhere yeah do an escape room in the middle of the day like he's like playful but I think it's like as kids we're all trying to grow up and you know make money and do what we do but I think the idea is we're all supposed to be playing this way I'm joking when I say this like a dude Disneyland but you come in here and you create an environment to play every day and that's like that success today right you'll get to do what you want to do every single day play with the toys you want to play with hanging out the people you want to play with and I think everyone thinks like when you don't have money you think when you get money yeah that's what I'll be like but then I've watched so many people who do get money and then they're like yeah but gotta have retirement money got to make sure I have this got to make sure I do that you know what I mean and that later artist lives the way you thought you would have before you had it yeah he's not he's not like flashy either like he won't even buy a new car that fuck you know pranks he's got a flip phone he's got like he's diction he's definitely a minimalist for sure but the flip phones a decision because he was like these fucking he sees he's he's a very smart guy he's looking around all these other people with their cell phones look at it himself and he's like oh that thing's just stealing your time and you're addicted to it you know everyone's a dick yeah I definitely am I'm definitely addicted to my phone but the bad thing is that aureole just text me a Google Bowl question what's the weather in Philly or something you're like alright this is he said he mixes it up between his friends so it doesn't get too annoying to any one person smart yeah as funny as if he has to listen to music he has to carry around like an extra-large iPad to hold his like headphones best to layer oh yeah that's hilarious yeah iPad in the back of his in the back of his pants like a fucking like a gun he like inspire he's I would have myself well I got a comedy club looking at it and Ari would literally come and take his hand and put it over the phone but dude what are you doing stop we hang out talk to us we're and it kind of inspired made me self-conscious around other people doing it and now every time I see people doing it I sort of judge them now yeah and it really is true I mean people live in their self on every single day and you lose the connection people are it sends a message like fuck you dude this person over here is more important than the person that's sitting right in front of me well it's just the phone this that light is addictive it's just addictive looking at the images it's like you know what happens when the little kid sees a TV you ever see that little kid walks into a TV and commercials going on the kids like this just staring at it because it fucks with the way you take in like visual information there's nothing like that in the wild there's nothing like a big-screen TV in the wild right like that image of Super Bowl on a big screen TV and HD and you like holy shit you're look at all the green leather all the guys running around smashing into each other it's intense you don't get that in a real life thing unless you're about to get eaten yeah take that serious yeah like we've evolved to like see that in treated this is a big cat running at you or something right yeah and that's what it is like but it's on your phone and you're watching YouTube videos like look at all that shit moving around my phone also also like the kill time of it too where is my check point out the other day if we if we ever sit down at a restaurant like don't take food to go and sit down mm-hmm how quickly I pull out like heart we're playing family feud so it's not even just a resent like pulling back into my phone but it's still part of like the let's do something right right does anybody have a topic no all right let's talk about let's just play family feud gives you you like give yourself a DD in a weird way yes you know you make it even worse I live in New York said we all do and like they started doing like little signs in the subway that lets you know how long it is before the subway is gonna come and that's pretty new when I first moved there in 2001 you were just going back dude I might be here for 30 minutes I might be here for two minutes who knows when the next subway is gonna come but now if a subway sign is broken I can't wait on that platform I forgot to get up and leave and get a taxi or whatever because I'll lose my mind just wondering when that cab is gonna come whereas before you would just chill out and wait yeah because you had you didn't have the option to so now IFIF you have that option to be on your foreigner all times distract yourself used to take a shit and you know the I said a bathroom reader was my favorite thing in the world it was a little fax like thousands of them in this fat book that you just was covered in shit stands every fucking fuck you out of the bathroom and it was called Uncle John's bathroom reader and it was just basically Snapple facts about everything in the world and they had like 20 editions and it was the coolest thing in the world but now you have your cell phone so you know in it right but how do you there's like certain shit you want to know that's going on the world so how do you check in on that do you just do it from a computer or like when you want to read the news like I don't know how do you get your news oh I get on the phone all the time and yeah and then I just tell these guys what they need to know yeah just get it straight from very few legit comics who is knowledgeable I mean you guys have this uh Dave's a very valuable resource when I'm very much so really Dave's he's like literally the only person that I know that actually reads the books puts in the time and it's kind of funny to say where would people get their news they don't really get their news they read the headline and then they act like they're getting their fucking news they're not putting in the time they're not reading the books and actually going and reading a real newspaper or reading you know they know that you know I didn't piss it what pisses me off about politics I feel like it's the only thing we're like if you don't like so if you don't know if Lewis doesn't watch basketball at all and Jay watches every single Sixers game again then there's like a thing coming up where you like something about a basketball game Lewis won't just like start arguing with you like naw naw naw they need to play this defense they need to go into a zone because you're like yeah I just I don't really know about that but for some reason with politics yeah no matter how much anybody's not read anything they don't know anything they have no problem just having a hard core strong opinion like oh you because I'll see you know about it right so when someone's like super argumentative about it like oh you're you not even informed ya which is most of the case with people that are really super aggressive about it it seems like I mean to when they were they have this thing where they were interviewing people at the fuckin March for life I think they called him the gun killer March I feel just now Wilma they were like all over Zinn a bunch of offering cities we saw it but it happened a bunch of different cities I know the big ones were in like DC I think there was one out here and like but there was this guy just interviewing people and he'd go around and ask them if they uh if they are for an assault weapons ban and they'd be like yes and then he'd go what's an assault weapon and it's amazing how many people just didn't know I'm not even whatever your take on an assault weapon ban is it's like how could you be for banning something that you can't even define and it's just seems but hold on a second yeah exactly like they know that this is what it does you know is it's a rifle that shoots people it's like a semi-automatic it's on a hunting gun it's a rifle that's designed to shoot people like in a military situation that's what it looks like so they're wrong I mean like they don't know what an ar-15 versus an air or whatever versus like what's legal with semi-automatic we don't know all the details but they do know that these are guns they kill people with okay sure fair enough but I feel like there's like a thing where they'll be like one for a ban on semi-automatic weapons like so you want to ban handguns soon they're like no we don't want to ban handguns it's just like if you're gonna protest read a book on it it's not just having a passive opinion you're like out marching no I think they wanna you know they want to move the ball down the field though and the more people that come out they have kids they race you know kids are in the fifth grade walking out of their classrooms they don't fucking know what they're talking about or what they're doing sometimes there's a girl with armpit hair you want to fuck pinions you mean that's true or Dirty Harry feels gross Harry tone but I mean but how many of these kids this is a big one how many these kids are against putting kids on psychotropic drugs you're putting kids on unnecessary psychiatric medications parents doped their kids up all the time because they don't want to deal with some hyperactive kid some kid has got some fucking power some energy he says I saw about South the walls I was in we were in Brea the other day right before the show we did and there was a kid I mean he the kid must have had autism or something or some extreme case of it but he was like you know he was having some sort of violent episode I'm assuming but it was just a dad like comas day just sitting on a corner with his kid with a kid facedown as a kids like screaming and shaking and kicking his arms and legs and then I was just holding the kid down and it was so hard to like I almost wanted to say something like I didn't know III know they don't ever really like tell you what to do like what's going on in that situation I kind of watched it for me because it looked like that he was abusing the kid for a second but then you kind of realized that for like oh this kid's gonna like hurt himself or whatever it was but that's like that's like a really really hard thing yeah I can I can accept more in the real extreme cases where kids are like so severe severe problems but it seems like they're just happy to like anyone's like hyperactive just this kind of loose thing it's not at all it's not a 1 or a 0 right it's like there's there's varying stages of issues that kids are gonna have and some kids are gonna need some kind of medication but they're definitely over prescribing definitely I knew my neighbour had a kid it's just a fucking kid and they put him on Ritalin yeah well the drug man yeah that's not yeah I give it a my five you snort it together it's this if people don't get enough attention or they don't have an outlet and they don't know what to do with themselves they get wacky it doesn't mean you need to give them drugs some some of these people have legitimate issues and they probably do need medication and some of these people just need to find something that's interesting in life yeah well I'm what you were saying before about like why don't these kids look into that stuff I think a lot of times it's just like people want the simple thing and you know you gotta actually there's a really difficult question to get into this stuff whereas if you're just like oh I'm against guns that's easy I think it's the same thing as when people are just offended it's like you don't really have to like read a lot you don't have to know a lot it's just easy to be right and you've got the answer yes people can just pick a side very easily and go cool everyone's already defined what's on that side so yeah I'm on that side look I did my work right and it's a simple being a parent a lot of parents are really lazy and you watch it happen when they get their kid and I Pat or I you know or you know put them in front of the computer that whole thing just happen with Elsa gate which was you know borderline hilarious that parents were getting trolled into their kids watching really fucked up like cartoons and shit yeah Elsa gate I forgot the name of it the name of it yeah that was crazy we've talked about that a bunch of times about the babies with the broken bottles over their head fucked up having the same thing would play out kids would get drunk whether they were a kid mice or kids ducks or they would get drunk a bottle would go flying through the air and hit the baby in the head and blood would be everywhere it was like a babies nightmare - those videos were so quiet Lynch the punishment for shitty parents who weren't watching you know their kids what they're putting on their TV because if you were just paying attention for a minute you I'm saying rent it you have to stop paying attention for a couple hours for a kid to get there so his only really shitty parents that we're dealing with that is that really truly its dude yeah there's no way to like land on that just by googling spider-man that wasn't the first thing that was coming up it was they would I think they were like pain to get in like a loop of certain videos like it was it really I was obsessed with it for like a week and I just couldn't stop going under that subreddit page and it was freaky dude regular porn spider-man ones and all these and I think they took some of them down but it's but then it gets to this place where you like okay are you taking it down because it's targeting children are you taking it down because you can't show cartoon babies getting hit in the head with bottles because if that's what you're saying boy there's a lot of fucking South Park's that you're not going to be able to show so yeah where's is the line because you think this is like creepy and he's luring kids in versus the just the active it was a funny you know Tim and Eric sketch shirt and a cartoon baby got hit in the head with a bottle you'd be like what the fuck these guys are nuts that's what you'd set but you wouldn't be like saying this has got to be removed off of you yeah it's the intention because you grab could easily say like oh well South Park is a cartoon so is that appealing to kids but I think to Louis's point that the solution isn't that this shit needs to be banned the solution is just like let parents know we always the solution yeah every single thing we talk about yeah Louis what was the other one we watched oh the father your father the two kids and it's really just creepy ish yeah do you happen all right so this guy's another like one of those like that the kids are watching that if you watch it for a second you're like this is all fucked I pulled it off it was a dad and his channel I'm sorry I figured the name of the channel but he had his two little girls who were probably seven and nine years old and they were doing like just kind of weird shit dude they're like eating chocolate bars and there'd be chocolate all over their face and you know they'd make weird sounds and they'd climb up like you know stairs and they'd show it from like behind their butt and it was very fucking pedophilia I don't even know it was the fucked up dude and this guy's channeled I take it out and the guys like doing interviews like not dude whatever we but also millions of subscribers to the channel making tons of money paying for house with this channel whoa and they shut the whole channel down and what did he say when they interviewed him I don't know I read something when it was just kind of like yeah we're trying to get our channel back and you know he was just like very innocent there was another thing the same I guess I'll fuck him on my own time but the same in when we were talking about this stuff there was moms they were regular like mom bloggers right and they bring like their daughter to Kmart right this is the channel by the way YouTube terminates toy freaks channel amid broader crackdown on disturbing kids content okay it is very like with Jay said it's a very David Lynch type vibe like you feel like you're in some nightmare world where everyone's just acting not the right human way they had 8.5 million subscribers it's a sick ass gold Plex that you have a monster top most 100 most viewed channels on YouTube that's incredible either I'll pacifiers in their mouth it dude it's fucking bizarre they somehow got to that level before can we watch some of this yeah I can't show it we can't show it on TV can we watch it is there a way we can not see it we're about to get rated you get what you figured out okay yeah don't but know what the problem is whenever we put something on YouTube that shouldn't be on YouTube we get flagged this it was like mommy bloggers and they would like have a video of them and their daughter going to like the supermarket and would be like 500 views yeah don't do it Jamie if they I was thinking of YouTube flags okay so no one else could see okay okay okay I'm sorry Louis what okay so yeah so then and then they do another the same mommy blogger would do one called bath time and she's like bathing her five-year-old and it's not anything like more than her like sitting in the bathtub but those videos were getting millions of views and then the mom would like disable the comments and turn off the thumbs up in the thumbs downs so they were just monetizing you know pedophiles jerking off to their daughters in the bathtub and it was this is just like a whole subculture that was happening on YouTube that was sort of just nobody was really talking about it and they kind of made it go away it wasn't even a big deal so this I'm watching this it's not disturbing at all it's just dumb they're just eating weird food you know and getting like whipped cream and ice cream and cake and nachos all together well here's what happens babies this is really targeted to her babies they like the colors so what happened like they see these flashing crazy colors them um packaging candy and cake and eating cake and two-year-olds love the shit they keep on clicking on it but pedophiles are also jerking off to these girls putting chocolate bananas in their mouth so that was sort of the issue so they got you know the the parents will subscribe to whatever because the kids they want to put their kid in front of a TV and have the TV babies at them but it was also another big part of the people who are watching this you see the comments and sometimes the comments were like encrypted and like in different languages and they were using code words now they're using that pizza gate yeah it's fucking crazy if you make a big complaint though about something you have to draw a conclusion to it really makes it seem like you're the person thinking that you're like come on you don't think that's hot exactly you wouldn't want to jerk off to this come on we're all jerking off to this there who didn't jerk off to that a cheeto with sour cream on it I'll jerk off to anybody eating that you're just in it for the food get these kids out of here you say what can and can't be on TV though or on video or on you know when do you say they're going to love this but I know right but whose day right because we vote we've all got this weird thing about free speech because if it wasn't for free speech we wouldn't be able to do anything wouldn't be able to do podcasts wouldn't be able to do comedy get in trouble for everything look it's very important to be able to express your ideas but what if those ideas are your what if you're a pedophile like what if what about that are you allowed to do pedophile anime like how it would where's the where's the line and why why are we able to draw that line you know I draw a dick right now when I will write here's a dick now if I say this is a four-year-old - dick okay there you go my crime well I wanted to say that four-year-olds got a big dick put a four-year-old pussy around it's a good question it's like I think the way it's working now is it's kind of whatever YouTube decides or Facebook decides because culturally we decide right yeah and like they'll have these kind of like vague policy guidelines but then you'll see some people violate it and it's not a problem but if it's a message that they don't like then that seems to be the one that gets taken off I just I don't know man it's hard III honestly I'm I would defend free speech toward anything like I don't care what you're saying unless you're like inciting violence just legally speaking I defend it like you got to be allowed to say anything even if it's like I want to fuck kids or something that's really disgusting like that as long as you're not actually fucking kids you're not doing anything what you gotta have look do you think you should always employ your free ability for free speech though like sometimes just don't you know there's lots of things you shouldn't say in the place is different that's not like a park you see here's thing I think in our lifetime there's gonna be words that are banned you're not gonna be able to say in public spaces like parks and shit like that yeah it's a parks yes Jaime to Google something what was that this story recently were they were talking about child brides somewhere in some country where they were trying to allow people to be married as young as 11 and that up until recently they could do that they could be married as young as 11 and it's a it's a state where's that is it is it a state no Sierra Leone is that what it is the article I just came up from yesterday yes that's it it's definitely what age is it see what I'm trying to say is like this this is obviously just actually there's actually another one for Missouri what's yeah two hours ago a bill to restrict child marriage in Missouri moves forward it says oh I didn't see that one child marriage in Missouri because people are fighting for it they're like yeah my baby should be able to get married at 12 years yeah yeah once you get married nobody's not having sex anymore so it's all the fucking parents idea it's not little kids clamoring to get married bill to restrict child marriage of Missouri moves forward whoa hold the 15-year old Wow the only state that requires only signature of one parent for a 15 year old to marry has made the state a popular destination for child brides the best child brought get away that's so very well in Missouri's defense that's the only time they've ever been referred to as a popular destination us know they're doing what they can to attract tourists yeah that's dark yeah that's dark those places we're like you know professions are like moss gathering and making some sort of SAP juice you don't um like you can't marry a 15 year old though they can marry each other I'd imagine it's a statutory rape you know there was a state where male to female the girl had to be 18 but mailed to mail the boy only had to be 13 whoa that's all it was one of a gap it was one of the states where they were populated pedophiles the Catholic Church was sending pedophiles kind of want to say it's New Mexico I think New Mexico had some super fucking squirrely laws hundreds of childhood brides in Arizona Wow hmm Arizona has child brides there's a bumfuck of every state I don't know how to Google this because I think that is one of those states why I say it's New Mexico but it might not have been where you the mail could be 18 or the mail could be 13 man Jaime's computers are going to have the most fucked up search history where can I find a 13 year old boy to marry how about what about male to female shouldn't that be different I have like boy-girl meaning like woman two 14 year old kid I do I think it's kind of different like it's like the the dogma of like there's no difference between the sexes or shit like that it is ridiculous and then like I don't I definitely don't think I'm not saying it's cool but when you hear about some hot chick teacher who is fucking her teenage students I definitely don't look at that the same way that I look at some dude who's fucking his teenage like that's just a more fucked up look at it as like she's a little bit more fucked up because I don't ever talk to women that are like Oh young dude that's what I'm into and you talk to every dude behind the scenes like oh yeah a 19 year old trick they'll be hot you know she's definitely fucked up but those women play very important roles in in taking young man's hand sexuality it's not like I got molested by a 21 year old when I was 13 she was hot and it was great period dick she made out with me like the whole deal like I didn't I couldn't get a hard-on I was uh in full panic what was making out with this lady what was she babysitting you know she lived down the street nice nice person she please a softball with us and fucked a bunch of us well she was 21 and the thing is man she was pretty it was weird she was fucked when she was a kid I think could be it's always passed down from a new generation she know you probably right you know whatever that for she's very nice she's very for the kid she was a fun person like she was fun to be around we all we all liked her but she fucked everybody so I just know I didn't I didn't know she just just grabbed my dick like I said I couldn't even get it up I panicked but I didn't I mean they didn't even know what getting it up was like I think she was the first person ever kissed you can come back around to her though later to see where you stop telling the moved we moved we Mountain wound up moving to the next year and I went to high school in a different part of town I was already jerking off for years at that point said literally jerking off from when I was like nine or teddy bears and like my pillows is that the same as jerking off no cos I thank you then I would use my hand I was like ten and I remember I remember the transition of not coming anything to when I actually shot a liquid and it was like I graduated in masturbation yeah you know because I had watch porn at that point but it's like an eighth grade graduation it's not the real graduate and of like you know we're trying to make him feel good about himself so it didn't Derk off until after I'd had sex no yeah really I didn't start jerking off until after I had sex and have no idea why either somewhere between 15 and 16 it might have been 16 it might have been 15 I'm not sure then you were like I want to feel this again I don't have time to find out you know everything is like I when I started jerking off I went oh like this is what's going on like I'm a junkie like my body is like like completely addicted to the idea of girls right you're 17 years old or whatever the fucker was 15 years old your your body is just like girls girls but if you jerk off it's like oh they're just it's just people need for coming like then you'd like them based on their merits therefore I realized that literally when I was like 16 years old if I just jerked off like the what I was willing to tolerate was so much less we will do when you go we tell her at the sex robots before and if we kind of got off on if pedophile should be able to fuck I mean you kind of think about that do they have that built up pedophile full balls walking around dude just seeing kids and we just given up on them there's no way to fix that I think they're diseased I think there's like a sickness I don't know if you could like I don't forget fix them I think chemical castration sure like that that's like crazy yeah I don't know I mean I I don't know but the like there are people that have this inclination that would never act on it ethics and morals they want to fuck anybody up which is also crazy it's like Wow okay so it's like we have a nuclear suitcase you just walking around neighborhoods just ready to detonate buildings and we just trust that he's never gonna use it right it's a weird thing to want or if you can get like a weird viewed on video game like you're hunting video game and just all up a building with a suitcase once in a while but here's the thing like if he doesn't do anything he's not a criminal like if he has this thing and he fights this demon every day and he successfully slays it every day who are we to come in and say you shouldn't have these thoughts no if anything I look at that is probably it's somebody who was like abused as a child it's had a horrible life and isn't harming anybody else you almost kind of her like honestly it's chemical castration wolves we gotta find the Dexter of terrorists terrorists who only terrorizes terrorists and then you can leap to another city like constantly what a crazy sickness that you can implant in someone's mind that if you can molest them they will want to molest others vampires yeah yeah I mean really is it really is like a vampire thing do not invite a pedophile into your home dude it probably is where it comes from right like stealing your joy sucking the life out of your family lesson I was what's your kid just being violent in general I think it's like that I think most people who are like like not violent in like the criminal sense not in like you know being like in martial arts or something like that but like people who like you know assault and kill and shit like that it's like I think 99% of the time they were fucking beaten as a child yeah but those guys can go play a video game where they shoot people in the fucking head and they get off on that and pedophiles don't have that same type of outlet right those guys have yeah isn't it I'm sorry isn't it's we look at pedophiles as almost being worse than murder Yeah right like somebody wants to commit murder we understand it kind of is worse than murder and we're like I had a five-year-old tell you right now dude like you know yeah is it worse than somebody killing him it's it's no making him like if someone just killed like if someone has I'm so sexy it's like who is making me sexy place into one of those beauty pageants never been to a little tiny kids what videos and Duncan we're in Dallas once and we're going we were working at the Addison improv and while we're in Dallas in our hotel they had this childhood beauty pageant it was the craziest shit you've ever seen in your life I'm talking about like five year olds with full makeup and like dresses but they're dressed like a woman with high heels they're walking around in high heels these little tiny kids I mean high fucking heels like come fuck-me pumps like it's grazie looking at them and you're you're looking at these like super dolled up and that's essentially the job in a ramsey story right and when when jonbenet ramsey were they did an autopsy on her they found out that she had been sexually active yes and she was what seven or something calluses on her lungs she when they bailed her was something like seven killed her some say it was the dad some say it was someone else brother the brother he said that stories were shit he's like you guys are monsters my sister was fucking killed and you're blaming me and I didn't do a goddamn thing well he should really be upset at God because if this doesn't work a guy who fucked and killed his sister does he yeah he's odd sure poor bastard imagine growing up your whole life knowing that someone fucked and killed your sister yeah he's got crazy big ah yeah no it's not a master jealous to because they give her more attention all time it's like Marshall Marshall Marshall at the end yeah my favorite my favorite theory is the brother did it by accident and the payers tried to cover it up but that's just my favorite documentary answer they connected the handwriting they were trying to connect the handwriting of the ransom note or whatever the fuck it was the one whatever note was left behind there was a note left behind yeah and they said it was really similar to the mother's handwriting but they could I don't think it they made a conclusive decision about that but that's like what if you have normal handwriting somebody else has normal and running and they kill your kid and now people think you killed your kid because you're right normal yeah how like you got to defend the fact that you like put a little curve on the end of your or is that handwriting shit I mean is it that is it that good things find a handwriting expert that if you pay them enough they'll say that it's not sure that's all like well shit guys and whoever you get but there's got to be some science behind it there must be looped if you ever like to analyze it I've seen like on documentaries in like how they analyze it's like they loop it that way the same way it's all at the same angles but they will they will use that in courts right but I don't think it's like substantial evidence it's like polygraphs like there's some science to it but it's not like you can't get convicted off that I would believe anybody that passed the polygraph test I think you'd see it up on the screen up there there's a jonbenét Ramsey John Ramsey's ransom note and Patty Ramsey and you watch how she writes and you watch how patty Patsy Patsy Ramsey writes and you're like oh yeah this she didn't even try to hide it well I mean she writes the same way the ages are the same if you look on the end of the age yeah well look at the size of the A's and the C's they're very very uniform in size from hers to the ransom note but very different than John's like it's uh it's a like it's her handwriting like now I see it she others have those works well shelved it it looks I mean it really really looks like she wrote that note so they want the Patsy Ramsey ransom note in the middle is with the one where she said look it's not my handwriting right is that when they're saying yes they made her write the Branson look I don't write like that started yeah they said here's some words we'd like you to write them out and she wrote them out pretty much exactly the same way I mean she'd even try to hide it crazy yeah that's crazy now I get it okay so then I mean I'm sure if we had an expert in here that he'd explained this is there some sort of a science behind it yeah that house I lived in Boulder nine fucking years ago and that house is still for sale oh yeah can't sell it it's a nice house they can't tell that how I use the name of the street like Trent Reznor Marilyn Manson don't want to buy it did he like rock stars are like really weird like a senator people that want to like have something like that no nobody wants to buy a house where a kid was killed good enough deal how how expensive is it it's a good deal not a great deal I know you imagine a crazy fuck like you're on steep in the middle of the show you see like things behind you ghosts you know that's the thing about the Comedy Store podcasts down that basement like down bait that paid millions of people when killed in that basement fucking for you that was like Bugsy Siegel's place no Siros nightclub so like for sure if you're gonna kill somebody you kill him in the basement right yeah how many guys do you think they killed in that basement Bugsy Siegel with a nightclub on Sunset for sure a gang of people got probably a bunch of people killed as it since it's been the Comedy Store well there's probably been well we know there's one that was murder took place in the base patio oh the front pass yeah yeah that was house on my way there that night that was crazy yeah great alibi Joe I was on my way I was on my way there me and Luis go there holding a newspaper in a car near streets are the many miles away Louis J Gomez just get it right for the press release yeah yeah I whenever some reason the documentary comes out about an old thing that I've heard a thousand things about I'll still watch him again I've got way deep into Charles Manson again but I was the same Chuck Manson was people have bought those houses for sure yeah it's the house is sold over and over I'm telling you right now it's true they haven't marketed that fucking house the right way because they could get some weirdo to buy it Amityville Horror house though is bullshit nothing ever really happened there right it depends on your documentary you want me to be right the whole thing's fake yeah I think probably all fake I think it's kind of bullshit I think they just sort of concocted it for that movie I want to see that movie I'll scared out of my fucking mind yeah I was thinking oh my god these people they bought this house and it's haunted fuck man that sucks what if that was us but then you react then you found out what based on true events means yeah cuz like this I heard a weird creak in the middle of the night and like bees came out of your toilet [Laughter] the bees came out the wall started bleeding I grew up so poor that like just the idea of buying a house I was watching those movies I was like I don't know what do you want to say guys I'm renting one Section eight I would fucking deal with the ghosts tell me something yeah I know right were you scared of a few ghosts would have ghost ever done it never killed anybody fucking ghost killed them no one's ever died from a ghost yeah it's always like they moved a toy car like across a table or something with that get past that and people I had my mom my roommate back when I was like 21 my buddy jimmy detillo me and him got a Ouija board once we said all right we're gonna find out this is bullshit and he's like you're not gonna move it right and I go I'm not gonna move it I go you're not gonna move he goes I'm not gonna move that fucking thing because we're to find out this is bullshit and we sat around for like an hour 45 minutes of this fucking stupid Ouija board ask any questions it wasn't even budget it wasn't even budget at the end of it my friend Jaime folds everything up stuffs it in the garbage bag goes I'm taking this piece of shit out to the trash right now I mean people convince themselves of everything you know let's start moving that thing like oh my god it's going to the a I can't believe in the end and the DS it's telling us something Andy from beyond the grave fake martial arts where they're using ass fucking knock you down do you think you people that that prey on them are predators do you think like the people who go I'm talking to you it's - that's the problem they're a pieces of shit they're both theirs you have pieces of shit that some of them are just con artists some of them are idiots who are as fooled by it as what they're teaching there's a lobby that's Sylvia Browne wasn't she the one that told the girls they found in Cleveland like told what her parents like she's moved on to a better place now and right yeah like not looking for your daughter was dead and she was in a fucking ass that's crazy you know she made them stop looking whoever does that then religion though so I you know I guess it they're the person that's doing that on a dumb fucking stage more personal yeah listened you are basically you're you're projecting these ancient stories right that's what you're doing you're giving lessons in these ancient stories but when you're actually doing it to a single person that seems way worse right yeah it's very focused and also religion people get there are good intentions sometimes the people doing it doesn't follow tradition and stuff or you grow up that way and you just kind of like but I mean no that's like that that's that's predatory someone make money might explain like the worst possible thing about their life in terms of is it truth they're both equally probably you know like bullshit but one is directly targeting and fucking with somebody and religions also probably killed millions and millions and millions of people and you know these people are just fucking duping a few idiots out of there duping a lot of its but those idiots deserve to be duped I mean look wounded antelopes should not go to the waterhole that's just how it goes you get Jack everything is an antelope analogy you Jo dumbass always were supposed to get taken out did you uh did you watch the documentary an honest liar about the amazing Randi yes go pick apart those like televangelist like interrupt their frequency and expose their tricks well he's one of those that and a uri geller he just tried to end him Frankel Steve Martin that's the entire plot no it's all based off of it so they try to intercept that signal but he did it with a lot of things uri geller or the bending spoons guy made him go away for about twenty years well he's got this million dollar challenge and I believe look up the Randi challenge it's to show him any evidence of any sort of telekinetic powers or psychic abilities any measurable psychic abilities and you can win a million bucks this is nobody can share shit well he did he did he did a study I believe a Princeton University gave him all this money to have these guys come and he he just brought he hired three other magicians and it was to have them come sit there for days and try to figure out how to do this crazy telekinetic thing and then they ended up doing it and there was a big press conference and he was like they're all magicians there's no telekinesis goes he just showed there was a trick they all did and they like the guy if you get a lot of guys some of those guys are fucking incredible well I did that show with Joe Rogan questions everything we did an episode on psychics and we got this guy named Banacek and he's a Vegas magician he's a wizard dude he does all the spoon bending shit in front of you and you know what it is man I mean he didn't explain it to me I had to go and google it it's not really the same metal it's some metal that if you just heat it up by moving your hands back and forth it just bends I used to want to be a magician as a kid I really did and there's if you take it like a cheap enough spoon and you literally just you could bend it like a few times and it'll just look straight that's one of the tricks you'll just use your finger and you make it melt away this is a very specific kind of metal they can do this too it's like you know blue minam's like super weak right like in some some forms not like car frame forms but in some forms will not alloys but aluminum it's like it scratches easier it's like there's metals that are like well or let I was thinking of lead scratch is easier it's like it's it's the kind of metal that's pliable you can bite into a gold coin right you can actually see teeth marks that's what people knew that gold was real this shit you just rub your fingers and it just droops it just gives in I spent like you met this remarkably well for microphone leader since podcast that would have never happened in a million years screaming as you're going to the faggot for this this is church Sunday for us laughter you faggots first okay no I'm just thinking you imagine like prescience how much people got freaked out by people who like new magic or new like some type of sleight of hand like that when you can't you can't go back oh there's a different type of metal that you can burn them just like those people didn't know how to ask you questions that are leading you into telling them the answers right those those techniques to that you know I talked to Penn Jillette about that one snooze explaining to me how when someone talks to you they get you to give them the answer and then they say the answer and it makes them look like a wizard but they're just they've gone through these patterns so many times I mean how many people have problems with their dad how many people have a brother that died how many people you know they like there's someone missing who is it owes my brother yes I see I see and this is not a good thing though he died the cars yes I see yeah I see that he loves you and he misses you and he's very sad that he didn't get to say goodbye requests with chronic he doesn't and then he comes home dude she knew about my brother if she was psychic she'd tell you about some shit that hasn't happened yeah she's telling you about some shit you already know cuz you're a dumbass and you're playing checkers with a ladies plant chest my friend who I stay with when I'm out here has a very good friend who's a psychic medium he's a very nice guy but she she really wants to believe in him so much and I'm farmable you know what he did the way he does is an entertaining thing and she's like you don't believe it at all I go here's why I don't believe it if you have fucking powers and then also like you know you go to Target cuz you need shampoo I don't know it seems like it would be a burden to live with the gift of magic powers yeah and then you just like oh yeah I'll swing by McDonald's I'm a little hungry for a snack it all stems from us walking around going wouldn't it be much easier if I knew exactly what was gonna happen and knew who these people who's good news/bad wouldn't that be better yeah everybody has that feeling but nobody has those abilities so you go on knowledge and instincts and life experience and you compile it all together and some people are really good at it and some people suck at it and the people that suck at it they go to someone else for advice and one of the ways they go to advice that lady with a neon sign psychic oh look at the palm she must be a magician is you I say in New York City he'll walk down the street there's a psychic there's a window of storefront yeah and yes you're like a lot of them how are you affording the fucking rent here hey get a bunch of suckers and the one thing about suckers is if they're good if you have a good connection with that sucker that sucker wants to come back next week yeah the stalker wants to keep coming to you like you we have to discuss this can you be here Thursday no problem and then this fucking dork he's all excited about Thursday on Thursday the madam is going and this fucking dude should have gotten taken out by a hyena by a mission that clipped his ankles drag diminishes and then I would have jumped out of nowhere and mauled this fucking asshole because he didn't listen to anybody but no survive in this nerfed up world yes nature had an answer this guy but then the one smart guy who was supposed to survive invented some shit and then told everyone else about it and now these guys have that invention you like an old bit of yours were you touched on this I really fucking love that joke where you're like uh when you realize there's no such thing as adults yeah like everyone else it was a real moment with me he's like because people but that's what it is is that none of us really know what the fuck's going on we all liked to comfort ourselves by thinking we know what's going on and then if someone else can convince you they kind of know what's going on it's like we look for that like we're like oh thank god I found someone now now I know what's going on but we're all full of shit most people are followers that's what yes psychics like we look at coyotes they take out the dummies they just take they get into the the system they find cracks they expose weakness and dummies hanging out with dummies right you know it's like the referral business in a second-- world oh and everybody wants to think that they have the person yeah oh my god she is amazing she knows so much about sex first of all when I knew her when I walked in the room she touched both my shoulders and I knew her for my whole life convinced themselves that this fucking crazy bitch that they keep paying money to yeah isn't just lying to them that's right because it's not just that you're being conned it's like you're the accomplice in the con want the time so you're you're calling yourself all those kung-fu videos those guys want to be conned by this touch for you to if you're working with this master problem Dave I always make the sidekick to Oda Mae brown and I just pretend my ex-wife is dead what's that one you remember from our ghost Oda Mae brown pretended to be Patrick Swayze and me made out with Demi Moore we'll be with they sure like leaning in and then it turned into Patrick Swayze hmm which was weak shit don't realistically Whoopi Goldberg is fucking French in our movie today however go about that Whoopi Goldberg now yeah I'm too heavy it would just be all checks Patrick Swayze's a check - that's the reboot guys play Rosa Rousey is Sam and goes yeah they could remake that movie probably well one day they definitely could they gonna make anything it's to do with some shitty ones coming up soon I'm trying to remember what they are but there's some real like it's too soon transformers for my liking I'm like a few more of those please yeah they really was gonna it was so cool the first one when they made that truck turn into that fucking robot it was the coolest thing making some money they're making some money they fucking shit ton of money it's like when the fast the furious 89 came out you know you're like what how many of they have movie they said like I've never watched more than 14 minutes of these movies I have no idea Joe your Vin Diesel talked about the movies with like the reverence where he's like we made a multicultural movie that showed races working together to get along like dude it's just about like bikini it's Maxim magazine man it's fast cars and bikini tips made one point 163 billion dollars oh my god and the budget was 250 million dollars Wow so they made three quarters of mil solid what is the budget on it's not even fuckin crazy all right it's cars driving fast you got Ludacris you must have a lot of special effects budget that's it's expensive you want to launch cars through the air the stuff that they do is fucking insane I mean I don't know how much of it's CGI and how much of it they're really doing with cars but as a person who loves muscle cars it hurts my heart watching those cars get fucking launched through the air what so many of these they only made so many 1969 Chargers right they're destroying them to do so hazard how many fucking Chargers did they wreck for The Dukes of Hazzard launching them across a bridge landing them nosed down you see the car Bend hello about my low noticed and they kill like 15 my lows so funny that movie the do you member the movie my law notice yes okay I saw it though hug nose pop little orange cat fucking great flick did yeah I don't think it holds up the amount of bugs and kittens that died during the making this film you have to watch it because otherwise they died in vain they took the like it was another movie that was made in like Japan or China or somewhere in Asia and they didn't give a fuck there was no walls and like how you treated cats and dogs in that country they don't care how you treated humans back there so there's like a fuss scene where the the dog is fighting off a bear and this beer I mean they must have just went through 30 pugs with this bear scene alone but there's no confirmed numbers of deaths but there was like a bunch of when you watch the movie you're like you're like oh man how did they get that dog to fight with that bear it's like well we lost like 300 dogs that's how we did it Jesus Christ really it's they fucking out a bunch of there's a scene where he's in the water like eight of them right there how many dogs died we looked it up one time I forget it's a lot I know Dudley Moore narrated at though heat in that scene oh Jesus Christ that is so crazy holy shit I'm looking at a Elks head behind you do you have much more value that elk has than a puppy why we put so much more value on a puppy's life versus that Elks Lodge cute privilege but like you'll swap the shit out of mosquito yeah about humor swap mosquitos yeah that's a good point I don't kill plants which are living right and that's I only care about humans and dogs they don't like peanut butter off your dead cats - hmm I do enjoy cats I'm like I never liked cats but then my girlfriend brought her mom's cat to live with us for a little bit and I got attached that fucking cat fiancee kind of animals I love them in the wild I love them and I just love them in their environment I think it's look it is a weird thing that we've gotten totally accustomed to so you could just get out of this studio right now you could drive 15 20 minutes over Topanga Canyon get out of your car walk 300 yards into the woods and you're just living with animals eatin animals you are basically in another dimension there's eagles and there's not too many eagles but a lot of hawks that fly around they're just constantly looking for some shit - Jack and if you're there at the right time you can see it happened you can see a coyote snatch a rabbit or you know different animals just constantly looking for something else to eat it's right there yeah we're so removed from it like if you wanna be like will you put yourself out there and that's a big difference between New York and LA like la is like this city where there's like beautiful nature within it New York's like just the city and then you got to leave to go to any beauty right so it's almost like you can be but I mean just the fact that we just go you go to a grocery store and my relationship with animals is like there's a steak let me pick it up and buy it and it's not none of the like oh this came from yeah fuckin killing a cow you ever go to Malibu yeah once there's places in Malibu that are like branches like their bow bow is really long I think it's something like 30-something miles of coast and along the way like up in the hill there's like alpaca farms and shit like that and that shit you could just get in your car and then boom you're in LA and then get in your car boom you're in the alpaca farm that nature you're describing those scares the ships turbo no they're gonna show the dog tethered no this is the movie this is from the movie but this is they're actually having that bear kill that dog yeah that is so crazy well in the movie the bear the dog fights off the bear I know that's so crazy that they allowed this crazy zoom like you're just like oh man they must have had the best animal trainers like nope they just we threw a dog versus a belt oh yeah that's so crazy yeah imagine what the the fucking pugs looked like to after bears just ripping apart my buddy John John Dudley saw a bear I saw a grizzly bear kill a moose with one SWAT he said he had never seen anything like it that it was he was looking through his by nose and he saw this bear SWAT this moose in the back I just broke its back and the moves just goes down a moose moose are so big huge they're so big man and said this grizzly just fuckin swatted it and they saw it happen and that they're so powerful that's swatting it in the back broke its back and the thing went down and then he's just ripping it apart one of my favorite pranks to play on my friends is I send them a video and I I say watch watch this nation he's got a moose by the neck just dragging it through the woods those fucking animals dude you want everyone's looking for monsters there's a goddamn monster that thing just killed a moose a badger dragged it the woods hey hey bear I want to favor cranks to plant people is I send them an email and I say check out this video of this deer beating up this bear and then it's there's a famous video of a bear just killing a deer in a backyard like in the deers making the most awful horrible sound you live an entire life and Luis goes the deer makes a comeback wait for it as they wait for it and just gets people to watch the video fish watch this deer being mauled alive with the most horrible sound and then I just let it go that's all Frank I was hoping there was like a dude's dick somewhere in there to be fair most of Louis's pranks do have a dude's day hang on somewhere but this one is just bare on deer yeah that's how it goes bears are different than other animals in that they eat a lot of shit they eat a lot of berries eat a lot of plants and they also eat animals whatever there's a hold of so they don't kill the animal first they're also real sturdy they're they're not like a cat like cats are really powerful but if cats are like more flexible and pliable a bears more of a just a fucking machine or bears more of like like cats are like hoist grecia bears Dan Henderson yeah he's just coming in there throwing overhand right maybe even patting people on the back Melvin Manhoef just a powerhouse yeah there's a hairy gay guy no no that's a different kind of bear bear oh oh nature bears you guys hate nature bears oh yeah trouble with Dan Henderson and that's more like Brock because I run with Frank Mir described rock on top of him he was like it was like a car that was slowly push it off like you know imagine what bears on yours like sitting there like dude it's got my shoulder blade and it's just gnawing at my shoulder blade and I'm I know I'm gonna die nothing you could do holy fuck do you think you were the adrenaline kicking where you wouldn't feel the pain or do you think would be the most horrible fucking you definitely wouldn't feel it you would feel it it would hurt but you would be so terrified of death and you'd be so overwhelmed with all these fucking neural chemicals to be flying through your synapses you'd be out of your mind you'd feel like the pressure that's happening you you there would be so much adrenaline you'd be in another dimension before you knew it yeah that's that seems like the worst way to die there's a guy who got a bit real bad and came back and had a video he did a selfie and talked about what happened he was just walking hiking down a trail scouting and he came across a and her cubs which is the worst scenario yeah a male grizzly doesn't really unless he's really old and it's really late in the season usually they'll just get the fuck away from you but the females will fuck you up and this female fucked him up and tore his scalp right off of his skull and he had it like packed down with a baseball hat like try to try to hold it in place and his arms snapped and he had big bite marks in his arm but this guy was like a Montana dude like you know Montana tough so he's like well vitals are intact see oh my god hacked down his head the grizzly with two Cubs you could barely see but the right side of his ear his head is basically ripped apart I'll save my watch though he put the hat on to make himself like oh my Christ fuck yeah bitch never got my daddy's watch drove himself to the hospital after walking three miles to his car that's a fucking man I'll be damned if I'm not gonna get the gosh-darn best Facebook live video out of this does it literally aw look at the size of the hole is oh my god motherfuck he's smiling in the picture she's a fucking Montana dude they're different humans do you remember the one the bear with the karate suit guy he just fucking knocks out the lady specials you have a joke about that he remembers that he's the mayor tears this bitch apart it's horrible and the other guy with the karate uniforms traffic decided out of nowhere yes sure he just decided out of nowhere that he was gonna fuck that lady up most bubbles there was no down and nobody feels bad because you put a fucking party hat on that bear yeah what you're trying to do man that ain't working yeah that's simple as simple as that I'm scared of animals do it now that I've kid to like I'm here it is this is the video I'm karate I have karate and sits down oh this is fine the size of the thing like look at the power in it when it grabs her launch imagine how terrified she must have been and everyone slapping it bitch slapping it the host is he moved in there why would the host get in there are you crazy that is Russian is that good to go that guy has to be rushed and look at the power and his fucking guillotine he's almost got the bear he's almost got the bear out Jesus Christ this is so crazy and the bear still holding on to that person yeah yes fucking that person I'm also not even the hardest day of her life in Russia oh my god she means she must have got fucked up by that bear dude I mean really fucked up the bear didn't use great technique to get out of the guillotine buddy just kind of powered out yeah the only thing I saved her life is that that bear had a muzzle on I love that he looks at her like she said something offensive bones you can't predict and that's a brown bear that's similar to a grizzly bear probably the Russian version of a brown bear they depth big-ass bears over there yeah fuck that dude fuck bears dude I saw a real grizzly bear in the wild and them wasn't that far away there was like 30 40 yards and looked me in the eyes and I remember thinking whoa that's a different look he went oh shit that's Joe it wasn't even a big one it was only like a 6-foot tall grizzly which is not a big grizzly but it looked at me it looked it did look through you like what am I gonna do I'm gonna eat you what am i doing just say this is safe if the brains calculated do you have a weapon on you or you have two shotguns and two bows and arrows but still that probably take a while two shots in one bow and arrow I got shot on my yes we were yeah yes it would take a while yeah it's not it's not that easy it's a big animal even a six-foot one is probably probably 300 pounds I mean it's a big animal but it's the way they look at you that's different I got I've seen black bears in the wild they look at you like what are you what's going on over here what's happening Grizzlies look right through you they look right through you it's a weird look it's a weird like dead look like there's no fear of you at all hmm what do I do here they're just trying to figure out whether or not you're a meal you're just wandering imagine being a 300 pound animal that just has to wander around looking for shit to eat welcome to life a big Jay oakerson this is a fucking crazy bear look you see this thing government-run because it will eat you hungry imagine no stores looking for hunters and slipping people at limps yeah so what just like well we um I was with my friend Jen she's the guide and she smacked a fucking tree with this stick she picked up the stick and cracked his fucking tree and screamed and I screamed and we cocked our shotguns and that thing took off yeah fuck bitch ass bear shit we saw a couple of them so one of them we think on the side of the road it's gotta be terrify me with the weapons you're like it's sort of on still you know you don't know how many are out there and you have them out there you know the Dave they've seen ones way bigger than the ones I've seen well what about people to say this they're like it's always like the Peter people that are like well yeah if you think you're a real man how about this we'll give you a knife and you go out there and then you try to hunt a bear I always feel like even if you had gun it's gonna not be that easy to just go and fucking kill a bear but you know why all these people say that shit is because they don't understand what a bear really is like in their head they feel like a bear is like some mystical creature who lives in the forest who should be left alone the problem is you can't just leave them alone because they're so powerful and they're so hungry and they eat so much that if there's nothing that keeps them in check they're gonna just run rampant and destroy all the deer and the moose and all those other things you like to look at as well they're gonna kill all of you they are to kill 50% of them or you can kill them well you're also like you want to keep the populations healthy like it's it's very tricky and humans are supposed to play a part in this I mean there's we don't like to think we play a part in it because we can communicate we discuss things and we rationalize we have culture and those are all those things are all correct but we've always kept predators in check because when they start killing us that means oh we have to do something now and then we kill them that's always been the case with villages and jaguars and people who live in towns and wolves it's always been the case there is a food chain we're a part of it we just have insulated ourselves from it with cities so thoroughly that we've forgot about this connection so all these people that are pita people a good percentage of them are living in cities you're you're you're talking about a culture that you don't understand talking about a world they you idol idealize and when you say like we kept the Predators in check like not nearly as well as we do now we always tried to do it and then after thousands of years of this struggle where we fucking got the upper hand and started dominating it now it's easy to sit in the city and be like you know you read your kids these books about nature and it's like the Frog made friends with the squirrel and everything is just nice and nature where the assholes like people are the assholes because we pollute and we do this and it's like no you know it's the real fucking asshole is the state of nature where your fucking kid gets ripped apart by a fucking predator that's like so real that's that's the shit you don't want it where's that fucking lullaby the answer is man I think the answer is comes in the middle that people have to realize like the real problem on the side of people that eat meat and people that don't that think pita people ridiculous is factory farming that's what's against us the the most horrific evidence is not in pedis side i mean in terms of like something that you know they're accused of the most horrific evidence by far is coming out of these factory farms like if you had a pic like which side if you look at the two of them like which side makes more sense well the the the peta side banks way more sense than the fucking factory farm people both are extremists you see those videos words like Auschwitz of cows numbers in other forms yeah it's horrific so I think the the if the meat eating population doesn't accept the fact that this is it's not just it should be impossible it should be impossible for a civilized healthy person to accept this as a reality for those animals so the PETA people are right about that they just but the idea that you shouldn't be able to eat any animals like mmm I don't agree because what are you gonna do with all these animals and the best way in terms of like health the best way to live is eating mammals anoles eating animals and vegetables together seems to be the best way to exist seems to be when you look at all these objective scientific studies that talk about nutrients and plants versus nutrients and animal products wood leans very heavily towards a diet that's rich in both of those there's almost no people in the world that are fat that eat meat vegetables and fruit just reasonable here do I mean vegetables or fruits that's the six foot son of a bitch is coming right in I'm gonna stick on a tree guys don't ya know but you're right and then it's also like there's some weird shit that happens to you when they go in those fucking vegan soy diets like Jamie kill Steen started eating meat again and he's fucking making sense again finally well he also tasted the wrath of his improper inclinations me improper meaning he wasn't being honest he went along with his ideology because he was terrified of the repercussions of being against the stream and you know he saw like would you have talked about Jamie a hundred times on this podcast now after we did a podcast together because he's a way more normal person now he's way more rational like when he was in that world he was frantic checking his Twitter constantly like constantly arguing with people calling people out on being a bigot or a racist it's like you're always trying to get street cred for calling people out you're always constantly checking your phone to see what horrible shit they said back to you and whether or not that stings you're always in a battle and that you almost get addicted to that I quit I literally stopped using Facebook like six months ago I was deleted because it was a lot of that I don't really publicly battle as much on Twitter with dummies but on Facebook I was really getting into it with people for stupid shit and I was just like now that I don't do that at all like just that weird nasty whatever vile feeling that that gives you that you live in and you get addicted to you want to go back to it it just feels so much better and Jamie was definitely a victim of that but now you talk to him because I had lunch with him before he even came back we talked we had lunch in LA and he almost seemed broken dude he seemed like he definitely seemed like he was beaten down and had been through some real fun shit industry I think being a social justice warrior is like exhausting yeah you have to be looking the bearing is exhausting period aside if you give a fuck that much it's pretty no I mean it really is like when people get angry about you know something like like calming people get angry about comedy it's so like wow you've had that you've already through so many layers of things to actually be angry about and then some other things you shouldn't be angry about to get to comedy they're almost always not successful or not as successful as they think they should be almost always no one who's successful complaints about comedy no one who's successful is pissed off that Kevin Hart has a fucking fifty million dollar mansion right now it's great absolutely right people that aren't doing well and I think and I'm just kind of on a similar note I think no one who's been through real shit in their life gives a fuck about microaggressions like it's like a privileged thing and and you don't have anything going on that you actually are taking this as like a major issue you know what it also is it's evidence that you're in competition with that person and unnecessarily so and that you are deeming them to be unworthy of their success so you get angry you know you're lashing out and it's entirely because you feel like it's a race and you're so far behind the race like fukuko fukuko hard or whatever it is it's like whoever the fuck of the person is that's way ahead of you right instead of just looking at it for what it is wow that guy works hard successful at all in comedy you go oh this is a really fucking fair thing either way like whether you have a you know the guys have millions and millions of dollars that's great but if you're successful in comedy yeah but if you're a guy coming up is like you know that's easy I mean how many times when you're around guys were just starting out where they talk crazy shit on some headliner they work with yeah man it could even follow me bro I got called on it by Keith Robinson Keith Robinson I've called him the shit talk another comic or say that I like a guy some Booker had called and said he liked me on the show and he kept talking about me another comic that he liked this guy's not a comedy anymore but he kept acknowledging there's a call just you and that guy were my two favorites I like you two both and eventually I was like hey man yeah isn't that guys terrible I was like you keep saying it's in the same thing it's so way and I called my friend Keith Robinson it's like brag not brag business funny he kept saying I did this for a young comedy and he's like dude don't ever fucking do that I think it's not your job to you thinks not your job take money out of someone's pocket yeah or just like slouched and you know whatever it goes if they suck that much you know people find out well maybe they'll get better or whatever you like but it's not your job to like cut somebody else off the knees and I was I took that soda off shit I was I was a real asshole doing that you get caught for two you get caught up in what you think is a competition but you knew and all the other people that are trying to make it but there's a nice point when you get to at least where you're you're not miserably broke all the time or you're in some at least path or Lane of where you want to go it's nice to be it does change your appreciation for comedy it brings it back again it brings it back you just like somebody if you like somebody who's funny who's way younger than you yeah you can like somebody who's funny who's passing you you can I mean it doesn't matter you can just like well that was the thing why them not me why them not me I want you like laughing at like guitar acts well I think when we all came up in New York there's like rats would you dumb fucking hack you shit and I'm watching you the other way watching Reagan and watch Jeremiah and just laughing your dick off could you let go after a little while ago it's not about it's not about your ego it's about what's gonna tickle you there's not about the there's no thought in it we've had this conversation a lot and I said I think what New York lacks that la embraces much more is the silly yeah even you know I mean there's just there's not enough like silly in the organ feel like everyone's if you do something silly or even pull out a guitar for whatever he's onstage I think there's not even a chance of like maybe wait this might be like a unique or yeah guitar just go th people will like I watch Sebastian Maniscalco in Vegas and do it I like I watch in that hour I don't know Sebastian at all but watching him for that hour this is like a year ago was the most I learned in comedy in a really really long time he's so physical and like what he does with his body and his eyes like he's making eye contact with almost everybody in the audience and I was like holy shit dude he and he's got to really use that space and I feel like in New York if anybody was that physical people would be like what's this guy fucking doing you know Colin Quinn was saying this Adam that just for laughs in 2013 he gave the like keynote you know have to pee so bad I'm sorry guys talk dude you're gonna come back and this shows gonna be off the fucking rail lead

it's not boring if you were fucking dying a thirst you got to think if you were in a desert and you're just like barely hanging on your lips are cracked and bleeding your skin is sore with sun blisters all over and just wandering and you just see fucking one of those Fiji waters in a bucket of ice one of those giant ones the nicest ones I've got some emergency can I keep cool later my go back see what I had kool-aid like a couple of weeks ago for the first time in fucking 20 years as I'm shit when's the last time I had kool-aid before that but I was out of this barbecue place and it was so good I had to go with the kool-aid was a great fuck that sort of racist for a drink to offer on a barbecue place no it was a black owned business yeah serious about it is it Fresno you gotta be careful cuz you seen the menu we go do you guys have kool-aid music yeah my first drink it's like you know all that other bullshit like Pepsi and root beer if you're really interested if you want kool-aid you want to do this shit right you need oxtails might as well have kool-aid kool-aid guy and I was poor we were always like a shitty ice-t like scoopable sugar yes tea into the flavored makes no sense to me just cold you have garbage in this tea iced tea I drink unsweetened iced tea all the time I hate it it's like vegetable water I spend some phytonutrients in it apparently I'd rather drink water in disguise yeah they realized two waters good man maybe just drink a little sparkling water mix it up and get a little fucking Pellegrino in your system we have the syrup in it there no I can't do that the ledge that would set so fucks you up yeah just brought water or whiskey either yeah what's a cheap I was ever in my entire life dude I was drinking diet coke like a motherfucker I had abs and I'm sure my body on the inside is a goddamn nightmare but I was drinking like an insane amount of diet soda it was a problem really that wasn't how to hydrate they say that shit fucks you up in so many different ways and one of the ways does is that all those chemicals in there are fucking terrible for your gut flora like even sugars bad for your gut flora if you drink regular coke but apparently if you drink diet coke my gut flora is pretty dope though so you say I'm always suspicious of people were bro it looks in your eyes she's windows on side in front of his house and everything it's always the guy who's bragging the most you got some farty gas gut flora what the fuck is gut flora you don't know what that is for real are you kidding yeah you know your your stomach has living organisms oh my I'm sorry don't anklet you guys fucking know a gut flora do it it's a show dad please the floors yes right yes my pronouncing might be Laura its actual life-forms there's more ecoli in your gut than they've ever been people ever that's always your gut your gut son we are we are we're a ecosystem every human being is an ecosystem we're not a one thing like you cannot exist without the bacteria in your system without what's on your skin protecting you from other invading bacteria we're in a sea of life-forms that are floating through the air and we can't that's why you get sick if you touch things and you touch your face you're literally taking life forms into your body that want to go to war with your immune system somewhere like deep there when you're getting just like a rash there's just like some dude arguing with his chick or he's like get off my back already and leaving in the new idea Rasch that's where this they had a fucking gang fight with Oh your face became as it that's where cancer got this for the longest time that's where cancer comes from you put shit in your body that's not supposed to be there and when they what's-his-name said he got mouth cancer for being out comes in get it from her well he said that he got it from eating alone first of all he said he didn't really say that and that people have distorted what he originally said well cause he was talking like this it would be like the first guy ever imagine if it was Michael Douglas was the first guy ever to get mouth cancer from eating pussy be like whoa I think there's a real thing dude but it's it's the best reason to give for having mouth cancer like how'd you get that mouth badass was eating tons of like a motherfucker remember that in Travis trailer I sucked it right out of that pussy she squirted cancer all over my face ha in in the mouth like right down the hatch like a carnival clown mouth there once every six weeks go grind off what's in there guts always play quarters Oh shot in this thing I got an 11 at home crawling off the walls this bitch is crazy and she's hot as the Sun so I'm going back to work no because without warning wanted to get to specific this particular cancer is called caused by HPV which actually comes from cunnilingus other things yeah but he took it back so don't worry if stress caused my son's income what Oh stress caused by my son's incarceration didn't help trigger it but yeah it's a sexually transmitted disease it causes cancer yeah interesting I'm telling you dude H but you're not supposed to put our dicks and our president mouth your mouth shut your mouth fun killer that form talk every time I'm sixty-nining with my chick I'm like we're just fucking giving each other kids right now and it makes me a little bit harder if you didn't have like cancer dr. Ruston talks you like this smoking gonna be like Lewis if you're gonna keep eating pussy I can't see you anymore that's probably exactly what it's gonna be one day I just Peck kissed or clicked the whole time that's a good move see the thing is now they have a vaccine so now you get that HPV vaccine you never have to worry about good to go yeah young yep gook dudes and girls oh man it's a vaccine but it come it's a risky one it's like there's some side effects and some people have had you know depending on your biology some people are pretty extreme side effects apparently like people have gotten really sick from that HPV vaccine that happens with almost all the vaccines though certain people get really sick yeah I mean this is the problem with this whole anti-vaxxer not they don't understand the nuanced details of like what it means to take an entire population of 300 million people and try to figure out a vaccine that's going to protect them from disease it's not going to work on everybody there's gonna be people that don't jive with it there's gonna be people that are allergic to some of the stuff that's in it it's going to be people that have weird biological reactions these are the outliers and like you have to be willing to accept a certain amount of outliers unfortunately if you want to protect people from polio and and all these different fucking crazy diseases that they really got a good grip on measles up until recently measles they had it locked down nobody was getting measles anymore but all these fucking hippies decided not to vaccinate their kids and now measles are coming back because they're worried about autism but at the same time dads are getting older and older he's 54 year old dudes are having babies and you're like hey man like this this is this is way more of your problem than probably most vaccinations statistically old sperm makes yeah kids with left hands but to vaccinations have fuck people up too it's like both things are true like vaccinations are very important numbers though are good you know and but there's also been like I mean there's been like real extensive research to disprove the idea that the vaccinations are the reason for the yeah but I can understand in just like a human instinctual way imagine you have a baby you get your baby vaccinated there's nothing goes more against your instincts than to give your baby to a stranger and let them Rick you like everything in you is telling you this is a bad idea and then your kids sick over the next year I think it's very easy just psychologically to be like well that's what fucking happened when I gave them to that guy you fucking prick though my son is in the morning the next day and all you want to do with that pussy squeeze squeeze squeeze even with my sons fucking head you can't help but you more you got to squeeze it tight ramp head hanging out they came back the next day they're like are we take him now and I mean I I mean I had fucking hung out with him we use my son I loved him at that point so much for taking a strip club alright and my chicken also implanted in my mind all these babies circumcision videos where she made me watch and it's a fluffer dude yeah all right it's terrible it's a yeah it's a barbaric practice that people only do because it was done to them and because you feel like it's a part of tradition I agree they have these bullshit stories about HIV toast shut up HIV they did that they did a study in Africa where they took like a few hundred people in like a fucking straight up place in Africa where it was like one out of every four people had AIDS and they proved that circumcising them was stopping the transmission of AIDS because there's not as many breaks in the foreskin so it's not as easy to transmit the disease but we're talking about a third world country without cleaning their bodies we don't live in that same type of poverty or or fucked up like disease yeah it's if you look at any of the justifications for circumcision they're all super weak none of them actually you know they'll say these things words like well you can't get cancer in your foreskin or something like that you're like yeah and if you just lopped off chicks breasts they can't get breast cancer but we're still not going to just preemptively be like let's just fucking start castrating people it changes the sensitivity of your dick your dick supposed to be slippery at the top meanwhile you pull that foreskin away just dries like an old piece of gum supposed to be like that we would literally change what dicks feel like when they go into people's bodies it is gross when you describe an uncircumcised dick as self-lubricating yeah that's how they got the business done back in the day it is uh but that's the way my dick hangs soft I could I would hate having foreskin I think you'd get over it just that would you rather that or no deck that or no deck for get NuForce came back with no dick of course yeah right so just let it go to extreme ends the rainbow take it back I don't know if I can go back now and just say all right what I just take my fo Genie came out the gayest Genie and it's just about yours they're pretty specific wishes let's see what's up you want to know is he cut again if your crazy asshole well they also do it at least then it would be your decision reconstructive surgery they have for it their whole shit I've seen what they do they take clothes pins they pull your dick apart stretch the skin out around your dick and it becomes kind of like a foreskin foreskin like instead of like being one piece of meat it's like a double piece of mango sweets killers closeted to try to make himself taller another grosser shit about foreskin is accentuated by the fact that it's a double it's essentially like the whole skin of the dick has to go over the top of the deck yeah it's outrageous yeah they didn't tell her bullshit about that they're so into it but here's the thing we should do and congratulations to you for doing that don't circumcise your kids anymore it's crazy gotta stop something really weird and fucked up it's dangerous it's not a hundred percent dangerous but it might be one out of a thousand kids get some sort of an infection and they could lose their dick that happens yeah and then they do that's a regular thing that we know when it happens they fuck up their dicks the circumcision they get the infection and then they say alright we'll make it up a baby with no dick and it'd be a boy or we can sexual sexually reassign it to be a girl and kids find out years later that they were born a boy and that's why that happened there's actually a famous case there's a famous case about that where they did a botched circumcision the kids penis was removed and then they decided to give him a sexual reassignment and everyone was fuckin terrified of it it didn't work the kid became massively massively depressed and then one of committing suicide as an adult and just just felt robbed of reality you know by what by some crazy stupid avoidable ritual are you gonna cut baby dicks cuz you think it looks better and and in the best case scenario even when all that shit doesn't happen you're torturing a baby yeah I mean how else could you describe the idea are not using novocaine not like you're not but if anyone if you ever had a surgery like that they were like oh we're just gonna put some local I mean like no one does so bad oh so sensitive you don't even know what pain is your little tiny one-day-old person what something's cutting your dick already like what kind of a world have I been fucking I mean does to you in that moment where you're like we don't know the type of psychological damage that that causes in that moment there's a real intense pain there in the world they want their mom they want to be held me as their mom's breasts they want to be feeding with their mom they want the love right now that's what they're supposed to get and you take them and you fucking mutilate them who knows what type of switch you turn on in that fucking baby's head in that moment yeah you make Jewish people they're like one of the first people to be circumcised like that it's like if Jewish people you always assume we're circumcised right yeah yeah why is that it's just part of its it's but there's no one really knows any reason we're always trying to save a little you know the most horrific you ever watch the circumcision rituals they do in Africa yeah I've seen a few of them oh my god there's a video of this dude just standing there standing there balls house naked and the guy comes over grabs his dick grabs us with one swipe of the blade shoot takes off the foreskin pulls on his dick and slices away and Yanks it off and the guy stands there completely stone-faced doesn't react and that's like part of the rich well Xena white Wilson so you want to be an old bread fighter his dick is bleeding and he's just standing he's not looking at it and it's not a good circumcision cut either it's totally fuck it's like peeling an orange right you're never gonna get a straight line poor guys dick it's it's shows if you see that Jamie do you know the video that's oh there's also the saved in my there's the Jewish ceremony where the rabbit isn't the rabbi like suck blood yes dick yeah like every it's not that every Jew doesn't do that but there's just your baby sick a dick sucking call Persian I brought this up three years ago on the show and I only person doing any research on our show I may seem like I'm the dumbest one but I promise you right now you're almost prepared dumbest one I'm the one doing the research I brought this up and everyone looking like I'm an asshole and I swear to god rabbis are out there sucking baby's dicks yeah and you guys were videos of them justifying it crazy thing because they had to there was some serious problems with it oddly enough because of herpes yeah because their babies were getting herpes and dying from herpes from rabbis sucking their dick after they performed this circumcision and apparently in some versions of Judaism it's it's a part of the ritual and that this guy was explaining it and like in in Yiddish and he was explaining all the different things that what's important that the the rabbi or the who have the mo al performs this thing he'd said it like two teeth see he had like a word for it the Bulls he's a nice old word for sucking baby dicks you just cut I mean it's so the only in religion do you think you have a YouTube video where you're dressed like a wizard talking about sucking baby dicks that you just cut in well this is the part of our tradition but do you think it's is taking an argument like you're not just in some fucking like like dress and like making it like say some song you're actually going like well this is what I have to have you seen do you think it's definitely sinister no it's retard always or is it just like it's fucking stupid I don't they're stuck in it and someone did it to him and someone did it to his dad and they feel like they're a part of this clan it's fucking and you feel like if you were to give a that you're giving up on your dad your family everything you lie so you got to just blindly believe that this is what you did progress it retards progress it is the it literally is retarded like in that sense like forget about the derogatory term used for people it's a retarded idea it retards logic you're cutting a baby dick and sucking on it then you're making a youtube video saying well but when we thought the world was flat this is how we do it we still do it this way and we like to cut it make with my mouth it's different than sucking cut baby yeah it's crazy that someone can sit around and justify doing some shit to a baby's dick just because they've always done it but I think you have Jackie Mason do it like I mean if it's any better to cut it and not suck it like at least maybe it feels better for the kid yeah honestly if you're just going to the kid blowjob point you would definitely want somebody to suck your dick after you got a cut but how what kind of a person just sucks baby dicks all the time like how many baby took an average rabbi that's done this or Moe L what is it immoral boil boil more is Moe L so like a shoe company or something that's close to em oh well but these how many baby dicks in a lifetime in a strong career 35-year career working for the synagogue how many baby dicks have you said you go to college numbers then you go to college and Arizona or anything he's gonna write could you man she's gonna fight like a Nazi and Nuremberg knows I was following orders I just was a website and like you just see like it just scrolled and you know that bar on the right side the dot was really tiny she knew there's a lot of rolling to do that's all the baby dicks he sucked over the years I kept an albumin well those are gone he told me who's the best check out my edge show us that son of a bitch longer check how's that on lines and on YouTube cause you suck at and it's there's blood everywhere there's they cut it there's blood everywhere and the baby screaming and the guy sucks the baby's dick congratulations you're an idiot I'm sorry for sick though this is one of those things that because it's a part of a religion people get mad if you take it down people get mad if you shit on it but you this is one of the cool if you there's no clear indication that your religion has gone completely off the track that if you're cutting baby dicks and then sucking them anybody in the right mind outside of that religion saying we're gonna do two Charlie thinking about cutting baby dicks and sucking them what you got the empty guy and the CIA yeah here's what's fucked up that's on YouTube yeah well yeah there's a lot of Jewish people that are watching their families babies getting their dicks cut and then such but then there's also a whole sect of pedophile vampires that are watching that and just beating off to it all day long dude some fuckin guy taught his dog to Heil Hitler and he's looking at jail time but you could suck a baby's dick on YouTube it's your fuckin video up yes wanna suck baby dicks but I want to go to jail hmm I'll become a rabbi if you get that down showing there's a bunch of Santos fetch there's hundreds of them hundreds of guys sucking baby dicks well it's 2018 this is not a Jewish religion we're not living in the barbarian times but today's people are cutting and sucking baby dicks how about genital female meant general mutilation for a much Zach for two please say that anymore man it's March oh wait it's a female as of April it's off anti unit elation month what is the month is it a female empowerment month what is it is it one of those now it's a Hispanic month Hispanic Heritage Month there was a there was a National Woman's Day right mm-hmm every year I'm not saying shit I'm definitely not gonna say anything just it's naughty yeah you don't need to say anything it for all of us Women's History Month must inspire Saturday March 31st we're celebrating so this is Women's History Month hmm the fucked up thing is Black History Month the shortest month yes that was definitely some passive-aggressive races yet percent hundred percent do you have an extra bone the reclamation history harder each what he feels like at what point in time is that gonna end like how how long in the future would it be before we didn't have Black History Month like we're not gonna have like Moore's History Month for people yeah right yeah I'm saying black people are gonna go extinct at a certain point and we won't have to I think all people are gonna go extinct at a certain point I pretty I bet it's probably within a thousand years I just I think so I hope you don't theme our months like fucking frat parties that's for two I just think like what point in time we're gonna not care I mean what if you if there's a way like let's just imagine is it even humanly possible to engineer the education of human beings to the point where there's no more racism doesn't exist anymore no more sexism no more homophobia I mean surely we were tribes and we gravitate toward people that look like us and we're comfortable with I remember and kindergarten sure this is 1987 we were allowed to just choose our tables like they didn't make you you know sit we're you know assigned seats or whatever and I remember all the white kitchen staff with the white kids and the black kids out of the black kids and Hispanic it says with the Hispanic kids and I'm half white and I was raised by white people and you see little Puerto Rican May just plopped in the middle of this white table and all these little kids prop like what the fuck is this kid doing here but it was very much like everyone's segregated like racially and was very nice but you're a kid I'm talking about as a grown adult who's already examined the world don't you think it's possible to people to get to the point where they don't do that anymore let's let it go I think individuals can but the idea that in terms of large demographic groups there won't be any in-group preference and there won't be any maybe I'm not like closed off to it but it seems like a real tough goal I agree with you a hundred percent but I'm more I'm more leaning towards that now than ever before because of the internet because I think people are accelerating accelerating and what they understand about what's going on in the world it's just it's way more deep like for you've talked to average twenty year old today and they're just way more knowledgeable than I was when I was 20 but stunningly so like even if they believe ridiculous shit they yeah they have the information I mean cuz it's like if I like for me to have I wouldn't know half that should I know if I grew up you know decades before I did I wasn't gonna go to the library every fuck it was like yeah yeah it's like I was gonna put that in but when it's all right in front of you it's like alright well I guess I can spend 2 to 5 a.m. but I think like we're going towards that it seems like the sharing of information is sort of making us move away from that it seems is like it's making us more erratic and more kind of crazy you know I feel like we don't know how to like you know people don't know how to quickly share an idea and deal with people reacting to that idea as fast as it's happening and I think it's creating a like I people like that are you know we were speak of friends who were like like disowning each other on Facebook and publicly been like fuck you dude if you believe this I don't ever want to talk to you again you're like dude whoa where I'm supposed to talk about some of this yeah I thought whatever happened like water cooler conversation you weren't supposed to talk about politics or religion or any of this stuff you're kind of supposed to just lead each other's lives and and and sort of like live with each other and you know yeah well I remember thinking about this when the the thing with chick-fil-a which by the way is delicious but when they make things yes solid my sandwich but when they when they were like against gay marriage and people like boycotting chick-fil-a and you're just kind of like well what what is the president that you're setting here like if I pull up to a gas station and I go to like get like a snack do I have to go like so where do you stand on the Iraq war where do you stand on this isn't the point that we all can kind of get along even if we have wild it's called a sheiks way not dude fillet yeah but we would like to spend our money wisely nuts the ideas that people are voting with their dollars right I get that but it's almost like now we can have all that knowledge and and like I get your point but it can work toward us being inclusive or it can work toward us being like well no I'm not gonna fuck with anybody who doesn't meet XYZ briefs which isn't necessarily great no because it's not necessarily there's something beautiful about like the market where like I'm a Jew but I can like you know get a cab in New York from a Muslim and I'm just like oh I'm going up here and then he drops me off and he's like have a good night god bless and I'm like thank you and we give each other such a melting pot though yeah it's it's so different than la la everybody's in their own car they go to their own building it was insulated in New York you're forced to walk with people get in the train with people everybody's all together yeah subway 9:00 a.m. at and you know 34th Street you have a million people and begin a one small area where it's like one person's a homeless person this is a multi-millionaire supermodel actor from every different area life and they're all squished together in LA you got to go to the party to hang out with that model or act or to interact with them really in any way you know you don't have a lot of examples outside of actor and model SuperMario using that in home construction workers you never found like just like a cashier or like everybody's living the dream does that feel I fill the bottles if you guys weren't taking uber back if you guys are gonna stay and hang out keep so I have to go I have to go do bonfire I have to go to Sirius x7 what time you gonna be there I have to be there like like 2:40 oh you're okay dude yeah yeah okay come on fire that's a Dan Soder show I love that show on the set on the satellite radio well we can either keep going for a little bit and talk mad shit about Jay I'd love that that'd be fun he'll be fine all right oh you just wrap this up I did I can keep going all day i podcast I got a lot of shit about Jay to talk facilitating this absolutely man you get that far together I love you brother in a prick all week sorry though that was poor etiquette I liked his half hair red better my buddy Jim did you get them release time make sure I don't have any boys car that's I like how you rockin the old school chain with the keys it's not connected to a wallet let it go it's not connected anything no I like it it's just a fashion accessory no wallet it's got a chain Jay marched to the beat of his own drum living in a grease moving those fucking dudes the leg would wear those like 1950s type clothes like roll the cuffs up with their jeans wear those old-school shoes yeah there's something sometimes I get a little like you just kind of wish you lived one life in every generation I don't want to just experience that a little bit and know what that's about oh my god it must been amazing the 60s would have been so cool just like one like it like like the first the counterculture movement first happened and like music was just awesome and like the late sixties like that was just like a cool time to be like but I have fat thighs so I could never wear the pants that were available for men at the time you could wear em bro just gonna kind of plead it out that was tougher to do in the 70s 60s before the internet you couldn't find your specific very what's up with people that want to go back to those era so bad they get those really bad tattoos you know those like Ed Hardy looking tattoos like a bomber classic yeah yeah like what the fuck are you drawing on yourself this like some of those are so bad but it's like purposely bad artwork that's supposed to mimic a time period but it's like your body's not a museum though okay if you want to mimic that time period you should get a fucking picture put on the wall pirate ship on your ass I've been a stylist like before any of that time period like we're just like you'll see the pictures from like the 50s or something where it's just like at the dudes were suits the girls at these dresses like I was like I'd like to experience that for a little bit just wearing a suit and a top hat flipping a corridor my only fucking six foot four and a hundred and twenty pounds yeah this Jack Jack Johnson fight on video from like it was like the early 1900s and everyone in the audience had us one of those hats those gentleman hats that they would wear they all wore the same hat everybody had a hat on like everybody every guy in the audience there's thousands of people there all those dress-up hats on Oh Jack Johnson's gotta find a Negro out there look at all the hats the same hat everybody's got the same hat on even today it's like accessorizing for a dude is like the best look you throw them like a watch and like a nice like hat and like just little things they make it puts a dude together like a check you want as little shit honor as possible you wanted to be always close to naked as possible but we don't give a shit about accessories none of that stuff but a woman when they look at us and they see like a watch too like all this guy's name is Justin Louis J gomez likes fucking dudes who wear a lot of jewelry if I'm gonna fuck a man who's got accessorize very well gotta have a torch rewatch stop I'm continuing to tell the world accessorizing now mange can leave will keep this magic going so what's hot that's a good point what is hard to do with a watch what I'm saying sure Jay calls me letter is like hey have the rest of the show go go we all just started sucking each other's dicks and earrings shit scarves in the 1950s tattoos Roller Girls roller derby girls I think people that get those tad that style like oh I wanna you know this old style tattoo it's a lack of creativity they just want to fit into a certain type of thing they want to look like a type of person with that tattoo they saw another dude at one point they were like I want to look like that guy and then it is so it's the same sort like you're saying it's the same thing as the hats basically it's the same thing it's just trying to look like the next guy you're just trying to like fit into the fuckin thing it's like whether it's a suit and a hat it's just a fucking oh no now I'll get a tattoo now I'll get this you see that with a lot of people there's a lot of people in LA New York you see that a lot where someone's got like a crazy different look you know but you're like but you were just trying to fit into that oh yeah but it's all the same thing man you're just in high school and I was nominated we're not goth but I was borderline goth in high school how many borderline goth it's like goth kids it didn't really accept me he's on the spectrum eyeliner the world but the goth kids won't really like again there were those my crew okay but yeah you wanted to just be a part of something and everyone was like oh that guy's so unique or weird but I just looked like a hundred other kids at the mall that shopped at Hot Topic that's a big problem with young people wanting to be a part of something you know listening to Sam Harris podcast with Christian P Collini he was a white power guy who was recruited into these white nationalists when he was like 14 that podcast detailing these horrific fucking events that this guy went through and horrific violence against black people he just got sucked into being in a group when he was 14 and here he is now in his 40s years after leaving super open and honest about and talking about it you're like wow and it makes you realize like this smart guy that you're hearing talking at 40 could have been that guy at 14 that got sucked into the group like it's not no it isn't really not even whether or not you're smart it's whether or not you have life experience and where you or you know the path you go down because this luck dude I'm saying right now you are just a product of your environment oh you could turn left when you should have turned right one day and then your whole fucking life is a whole different thing you know I died some fucked up shit as a teenager that it's like it just I happen to land here but I could have easily just been in jail or been a criminal or legitimately like you know hurt people and I couldn't done a much different path well that's the crazy thing when people like kind of a like they have so much like hatred towards someone else for having a different view than them or being in a different situation you're like do you just understand you were like two little circumstances away from being mad yeah I see that a lot with people and I'm on the side of like gun rights like I'm not for gun control but the people who are like really shitty to these teenage kids who are like becoming famous and you're like dude if you were a fucking teenager and you could have just been on the fucking news and everyone's praising you because you take this position we'd all fucking do that just the exact same thing yesterday I was talking about one of these NRA guys that was mocking these kids I'm Mike you're out of your fucking mind if anybody should be talking about we got to do something it's kids that got shot at sure mrs. de gallo they have the floor no I they're supposed to have the floor I mean they just got shot at they lost their friends and they are standing up and maybe they're not informed about a lot of issues maybe they don't know what a semi-automatic or an ar-15 is maybe they don't know those those details but they know that no one's doing shit and people keep getting shot yeah bad ass cuz they survived like like they got lucky neon ones yeah they just fucking moron the right place talking about that Maryland one and we like you don't talk about the positive ones yes but you know because I tell the story so more or less in Maryland there was there was a school shooting or a kid came into school with a gun but they had an armed security guard he took him out nobody got military training guy got rid of them quick and that's what NRA advocates are saying like hey this is a good thing we should we should have someone who's an armed and ready responder at the school to prevent this kind of shit from happening and there's a lot of veterans that would take that job happily and you would have your kids 100% safe and people like no that's not the solution the solution is take the guns away I don't like the idea of armed security at school I don't like I don't like the idea of arming teachers but it's like to just dismiss that and be like no gun controls the only reasonable measure I think is is naive but just to the point like you were saying before I have no problem people being like hey CNN shouldn't just be putting these kids on without having someone to rebut it or they shouldn't be putting this on and just hey but to actually go at the kid and be like oh this kids fucking you know just milking this experience like yeah whatever any of us would do a thing like you know I don't have a horse in the race I don't really give a shit I don't really shoot guns and I know when I shot guns it's just been really fun there's no part of me that like I think I would swallow a little more of people that like we're really you know big gun advocates would just kind of admit that like dude it's pretty awesome we want to blow shit up it's fucking great you know but you get this other sort of thing where I just think that you should have people that are really trained really responsible and we should have specific measures in place in order and I know we do have that but maybe we should look at it and push that line back even a little bit more because yeah you're right even in the example of the dude you know taking out that kid in that school I don't necessarily have an issue with having an armed security guard at the school to protect children but I kind of have an issue with somebody who you know MIT you don't know when his girlfriend broke up with him and when this dude went bad shit right so even when you have to give people psychological exams like when do they go crazy went through a moment where somebody snaps and now they're fucking crazy yeah I actually I'm completely against gun control of just about any kind yeah I actually think when people a lot of times Republicans will go it's not about gun control it's about mental health I think that's even more of a cop-out because you're like what the fuck are you even saying by that like what do you that you know lots of when you say mental health it's like there's lots of people who suffer from like anxiety depression and like all these things it doesn't mean they're a risk to others like what are you actually gonna say like I'm for unfettered gun rights but everyone has to have like a psychological exam and it's as if there's some way that we can predict who's gonna shoot up a fucking school and the truth of the matter is it's really fucking tough it definitely is but what you're saying isn't entirely correct because it is absolutely about mental health and you have to be fucking crazy to be a school shooter sure yeah and most of these people are on some sort of psychiatric medicine there's a giant percentage of them so it is in in fact a mental health issue because there aren't literally on most of them like the vast percentage of them are on mental medication so the question is whether or not it's the mental health medication that's causing them to do this shit or whether or not they were already crazy and that medication was just trying to treat this disease and they got ahold of guns and that's the promise to guns yeah so maybe I didn't say that like precisely enough because I agree with everything you just said I'm just making the point that the idea that it's like oh all we know is that there's this category of people who have mental health issues they shouldn't be allowed to get guns is way too broad but you know I actually I think again like you mentioned earlier it's like dude they'll say these anyone who's real fucked up nowadays like there's a lot of mental health issues a lot and is in school they're gonna put them on drugs they put anyone who's borderline on drugs so the really fucked up kids are on like a cocktail of drugs and they'll admit with a lot of these like antidepressants antipsychotics that they can cause suicidal tendencies some of you will even say they cause homicidal tendencies so I think it's pretty reasonable that maybe in some very small percentage of them they cause you to just fucking wanna go or they push you at least in the direction of wanting to go to shoot up a bunch of people to relief relieve you of the feeling of consequences there's that they disassociate you from whatever you're experiencing that's that's one of the most disconcerting things about the idea that if someone has homicidal thoughts but they're keeping them at bay and then they take some pill that's saying hey fuck it let's do this well you're not exercising the whatever the the mental processes of not killing people on your own you need this thing to do it and then you don't have your medical one day I heard you talk about this the other day was kind of interesting I forget who was on maybe was Metzger or somebody but you were talking about people that tea was very calm cool and collected episode was weird the best the best advertisement for caveman nature you could have possibly had that man the Maryland school shooter was killed by his own bullet not the school resources shot himself in the head when the guy was coming after him okay but still kind of a similar moral of the story shoot himself in this and this is definitely not the same story the story was that this arm guy took him out yes that's what that's what I heard as well that's what I had heard like I'd heard a deceptive version of it then because I heard that this guy engaged in a firefight with this kid and killed him instantly yeah that's why I read like six different articles that said that yeah yeah okay so that maybe that's incorrect there's too many things to pay attention to as a shot hit the shooter's gun witness in his hand his shot hit the shooter's gun before how did the shooter shot himself yeah yeah so he shot himself with a gun that got shot I says the officers the officer shot struck Rollins gun which was in the teens hand the Sheriff's Office said nevertheless his quick action confronting Rollins just three minutes after the teen shot two students has been credited with bringing the incident to occur so the guy did shoot the kid killed him so he he shot him and then when the after the guy shot him he just shot himself while he still could it's the praise came even when it was unclear which shot killed the teen he definitely seems like he shot him I mean he was in the fire he really was in a firefight with this fucking guy look I think there's not a single answer to any of this I think it is yeah again a mental health issue I think you're not gonna nobody's gonna come up with a law that's gonna figure it all this shit out I just I don't live I joked about it before but I kind of live my life and a sort of ignorance is bliss state with this type of shit I mean I don't know I I have to guess my kids not gonna be shot to death in a school one day knock on wood right I know and it's a horrible horrible thing but the reality is I don't know if these people that are soaps with everything and just they're making it their lives I almost feel like they're kind of missing the point you know if I have my kid isn't gonna be out at a rally holding a sign I'm not spending my days doing that with him I'm spending my days creating memories with him and just trying to spend my life having a good life and I'm not really politicizing anything with my five year old well well there's people that feel like they want to do something they want to change they don't want this to happen again and if you lost your kid you'd probably feel that way too yeah oh yeah I mean there's there's there's way too many of these things it's way too many of them so we got to figure out what it is I think the real issue resolved relies rather it lies here's one one giant part of the problem everybody's looking at the final piece of the puzzle the final piece of the puzzle it all comes together is the school shooting what gets someone to that position how do they get to that you got to go to step one not to step 10 if step 10 is a school shooting you got it you got to figure out how do we get less people to go from step one to step two how do we keep more people happy as young people how do we give more people support how do we give more people therapy or exercise or recreation or friendship or community guidance or whatever the fuck we're doing we'll reaaly innate people to the point where they literally want to go and shoot everybody else it's like the the physical equivalent of like flipping over a game when you're losing yeah no I I think yeah that's a great analogy by the way I think that's exactly what it is it's like oh this world is so bad for me well fuck everybody fuck that nice teacher I've thought I completely agree with what you're saying and I think maybe the silver lining and this like the best thing that could come out of this and it has nothing to do with the law is just that kids in high school will fucking think twice before they're brutally ostracizing some other kid yes you're like hey watch out that kid might be the one who fucking whoa that's maybe next thing dude people that kids think they're invincible they're not thinking about that I remember when I you know Columbine was so such a big news story I was guy was in high school I believe at the time I was sure yeah as your birthday actually is my birthday to hear it's real fucked up and dude it was fucking it was such a big deal I had never seen anything like that before this is before 9/11 9/11 was the next big big thing but the you know it happened so often now that because of the internet I almost feel like people are also desensitized to like how crazy it was because Columbine dude it was bizarre watching the images of the news of the people of running out of that school it was like haunting and I remember watching it and my mom made this point and shoot my mom's a fucking drug addict lunatic but she had these weird little moments in her life when she said some crazy shit and she was like yeah she's like you know I yeah maybe they shouldn't fucked with those kids she's in a weird way and I was like oh damn I'm really good at defending these like but she just kind of it wasn't defending the act of people getting killed but it was sort of looking at the route with which is what you're saying and and she you know she's kind of made that point it can always stuck with me well I think even more than like which I get the point but even more than other kids bullying them the truth is if you want to get at the root you want to be like hey parents fucking love your kids and give them a really good childhood but it's like how do you actually make that happen there's an average local natural inclination that animals have to pick on the weaker ones it's a terrible natural inclination that human beings have to avoid because chickens do it I have chickens my chickens fuck with the smaller chickens and the the less aggressive chickens they fuck them up they have a pecking order you know I've seen it with dogs with one dog that comes the alpha the pack takes over dominates the other dogs is a natural thing it's natural it's natural in every single animal community and its natural with people but we're smart and we understand the consequence of that and you got to give those kids a reason to not do that you know but there's also the problem with like if you're going to school with LeBron James okay Inc like standing next to this fucking giant super athlete you're like shit kind of bullshit genetic roll the dice that I again this motherfucker got all aces he's got five aces like seven feet tall he weighs 300 pounds he moves like a Panthers to win and that's I love that analogy specifically because it's so stupid I have a tattoo of my arm and it's just a two seven offsuit I'm on a poker player but it's bet the analogy is like take it off take that tattoo man it's such do such a bad clown oh you no idea dude it's the worst have you thought about doing anything about it yeah I have one cover up I have one this is Lou dog my first one ever old boy yeah nobody even call me Lou dog they just did sarcastically after I got I was 18 I was I need a tattoo what can I get and my mind could only go to Lou dog that is one of the douchiest thing a human being can do is give themselves a decide I mean I'm not talking about like a pro wrestler I mean for fighters it's pretty commonplace for the average person my friends call me nobody it wasn't good fat arms with fat kids right is it Lou talking really small cuz I did only afford a $60 tattoo a little petite Lou dog and then below it it wasn't even the full thing that could connect around my arm it was just a little bit of tribal just like a sliver like a 2-inch sliver of tribal when I was a kid in high school most of the guys that were doing tattoos weren't good artists there was a few good artists you would find them in magazines and shit and he'd have to travel to like Connecticut to get a tattoo done yeah like there was it was weird it wasn't like it is now like now the artists are going from art school right into tattooing and you're getting these amazing pieces I mean it's that I've never seen tattoos like today in my life I saw one the other day some guy had Michael Jordan tattooed looked like a leg or an arm I couldn't tell what it was but it's like they took a photograph and just wrapped it around this guy's leg it's insane yeah now you go on the internet you can actually see all the Lord just compare it and pick and choose and they're just way more artists and way

never know yeah I just got it it's kind of funny I guess it's funny yeah kind of funny yeah what is this Russian prison Prison tattoos yeah the books about on the pretty dope well there's one phaidor million-acre his brother fair Fodor's brother Alex Alexander Emelianenko he's got a bunch of crazy Russian tattoos on his body and he had mob tattoos on his chest on his right in front of his delts and he got him both redone and switched over he's fucking Jack now he said a million a girl Jack really yeah because they were never really Jack Alexander Emelianenko recent muscles picture he just

scary you know yeah he's super jacked that's a good picture but there's a better picture of him like facing head-on where you go holy shit like he's like legitimate nice on it whatever but you get the point that's what he used to look yeah used to look like a bear used to have like I can't come a little bit of that right here yeah he's got like a little bit of that that great thing so he's yeah cuz they the part of the charm of the Emelianenko's was that they were almost kind of like just looked by that like we don't even give a fuck we're just tough Russians we don't care yeah he got a hold of that fuck and you saw a shit look at his left in his right go back to a picture look at those tattoos on his pack on his right in his left side like you see him there those that's when they were a

my back I'm skeleton holding baby baby a sword do it now do it and a bat it is mama for baby kill skeleton yeah and this bats of the moon in the bats in the moon and the bats fly what does that mean well it's I don't think it's American I think that's Russian words right so who knows what it says yeah yeah man that Russian language is a trip to look at man when you see Russian type down you like what you guys how long you been doing this like how cold you came up with God with us it says its Third Reich shit whoa God with us is a phrase commonly used in Harald hurry heraldry in Prussia from 1701 and later okay for Prussia first so this has its roots in Prussia yeah okay the German military during the period span in the German Empire 1871 to 1918 so it was World War one and then the Third Reich 1933 to 45 so it was in the first to write songs it was just the third but the most important thing is that the origins are Prussia right and so he's very nationalistic I'm sure yeah I still can't be you got to be stuck dude today's day and age you know we all know the the swastika it has other meanings before the Germans took over but you can't get a swastika tattoo of Nora but it's a good one short cry of the Swedish army see it's uh in 1631 that was done it was saying got mint on mittens by sabaton during the First Battle of Britain field in 1631 God with us with the war that's British the Swedish army as the last time Sweden was picking Wars with anybody so this is probably like some Russian gang shit is what we're missing like God is with us meaning God is with the Russian gang members and we're just jumped into conclusions because the Nazis liked it too yeah and we're also like in America like Nazis are such a symbol of like evil shit I don't know exactly in his culture in Russia where they're from if that's like fuckin you know Hitler is this you know the the Antichrist that we can't make him out to be the Nazis didn't get along very well they also had their own guy they had Stalin just starving people yeah yeah and he was responsible for one more deaths and he was responsible for their deaths yeah hey John people yeah meat well Hitler killed a lot of Russians too everybody killed Russian yeah that Russians gave it fucked up man that's why they're so Hardy that's why they're so dangerous is like fighters those are the survivors man so you got some cream of the crop genetics over in Russia so nobody in fucking in like a hundred year period Russia not because you know like America was in two world wars but it wasn't here it was like we went it we sent our boys to go fight over there Russia had two world wars their country straight-up collapsed twice yeah they had the the Bolshevik Revolution and then the collapse of the of the Soviet Union and then they had like just genocide all dictatorship in between that yeah it was just a bad time to be Russian well they've gone through a whole bunch of those in the past when you go look at Russian history like what is the fuck we went to the Genghis Khan exhibit at the Reagan Library out here and you get to see how much of Russia they captured and how much of like I didn't know that Genghis Khan had the biggest empire ever like they literally owned all of Eurasia and he was fucking like 40% of the people and everybody I mean that dude there's some insane number of people that are genetically related to him in Asia like insane yeah uh-huh I think he would like they would do this shit where they would like send like fuck it's been a while since I read about this but like they would like send it like when they were gonna conquer like a village they'd like send in like a note it's basically kind of like well look just give up all your shit right now and you'll be okay and then some of the villages would be like no we're not giving up all our shame anyway and they just come in yeah and then they do that just like send a fucking message like even people who agreed to it there it's like brutal brutal shit if you listen to Dan Carlin's Wrath of the Khans man though if your regular listening to this podcast I apologize for the next couple of minutes it's the greatest fucking podcast series ever it's all about Genghis Khan I had no idea I knew he's a bad guy but it's like my knowledge of Genghis Khan was similar to my current knowledge of Alexander the Great it's like I heard he was gay killed a lot of people I don't really know yeah yeah yeah it's in modern Afghanistan that's that area I don't know jack shit about Alexander the Great and that was the my same thing with Genghis Khan and he was a bad guy conquered a lot of people you know owned the world for a while but Dan Carlin's five part series is so goddamn good that you just get you just you just really get a really accurate sense of how insane life was back then about what these fucking people did there's one story about the chorus me and Shaw who sent an envoy to Jin China and along the way they saw in the distance what they thought was a snow-covered mountain but as they got closer they realized it was a pile of bones they had killed everyone in the city they killed a million people and stacked them up and these people were they had abandoned the road because the road was so overrun with bodies that had rotten and decayed that people getting sick and dying because there were so many bodies that abandoned the road associate with anything anyone cares about today and this goes for myself too like anyone who's into like issues or politics it's like you should always just keep in mind we have it so fucking good oh good we have it so good compared to what now everybody's had but that's what progress is all about we want it so good we want it better we want it better we want it better we want and no no this no that no violence no sexism no racism no nothing yeah what a better and better and better and better we're gonna well now we got some ground people are getting more and more excited about gaining more new ground yeah but it's like we're never gonna have it be perfect so I almost like why though because that's that the concept of their never being any sort of racism sexism or sexism or you know somebody's always going to perceive something as being right so it's gonna it's the onus is almost on the the quote-unquote victim sometimes to take the step back and go like okay I'm not a victim right now I'm a brown person dude if I want to call racism I can do it every single day in my life if I really want to okay and I feel like we're never gonna have that because it's very addictive to be a victim it's very addictive to feel like you were wronged in some way and it's also very addictive to look for reasons for it that aren't really necessarily your fault you know Dinah's a very like I'm helping the world yeah bad idea it people feel like they're doing something good and you'll never convince them that they no matter how ridiculous they might be you'll never convince them overriding my biggest beep and I agree with you I agree with you too though I think there's that's like how progress happens you have to keep wanting to make it better and better yeah my biggest problem would say like the like left-wing you know activist of today is that it's like they'll just go it's almost like they want to burn it down yeah because it's not perfect I think okay just appreciate how the steps that we've come and let's go the next step but don't burn it down cuz it could be a lot worse with way we hold on to ideas and beliefs it takes several generations for real progress to occur the problem right now is there's so much technological progress that's aiding the physical progress the progress is taking place far faster than they can handle it's almost like we're going downhill in the snow and you're like wow Jesus like you're in a car and you're driving downhill in the snow is like you kind of can hit the brakes but are they really gonna work you're ahead of yourself yeah yeah you don't have full control and I think as a human species that's the currently the state we're at we're where people are trying to force things down people and we're trying to force change and change normally takes a long-ass time to really settle in and it's happening so quick we can't really keep up with it yeah like you know we didn't have the same way to communicate you can get an idea across the world instantly the same way so I think that people are reacting to that and they don't know how to really deal with it you know they don't have a they're not to share an idea with somebody that might not agree the same with what we do cuz you trough yourself in your the supermarket dude whoever's you know I'm standing next to online we get along we're cool no matter what our backgrounds are what we believe we're just coexisting yeah well that's like this should I was saying before about chick-fil-a versus other businesses well just I'm sure there's some guy who just believes shit that I find horrifying but I'm just like hey let me go to water let me get it done it's like you don't even think about that shit it's like yeah we all we do exist in this world we like come together and do all this shit all the time but then you can kind of like pretend online that you have this like we were worlds apart and I would never do business with this the problem is communicating online it's a shitty way of communicating yeah people should have conversations in front of each other where they look each other and you could work through stuff because you have an opportunity to be wrong find out why your own think about it process it as opposed to editing your opinion down and go and here it is this is a very specific perfect version where it's not even really what your opinion is it's just how people are gonna perceive it's a game you're playing a word game yes the word give you playing board sports and trying to win you know and this this is a real problem with people that aren't good at communicating one-on-one because that's really the most valuable form of communication use two people in front of each other you're like well I'm gonna write you an email because I didn't really talk to you about this then you get this crazy email accusing you of all sorts of shit you know you're reading the tone differently you could calm up hey man what the fuck is this email like this is nonsense like this shit didn't happen then you get together and have a conversation about it like let's talk personal person Jay we just got the thing one time I don't know what it was that we just said we've been like fucking brothers for like you know a decade and a half almost right we're like real close friends which guys do a thing like where I wrote him a long emails ago I'm gonna write it in form of an email and then he's taking the tone like very wrong so then he writes me back an email kind of shitty and now we're like in a fucking fight and the reality was it was just trying to communicate like Road dates or something it was so stupid you're like one conversation away from getting the whole thing and just leaving it out to text messages emails so much is left to interpretation and depending upon how you're receiving that if you're in a good mood I guess he's just busy no big deal he's a good guy he'll get back to me down place like I'm some other fucker it's always call you and you don't want to talk to me don't talk to me I'll be okay yeah I don't want to hear this bitch-ass shit like people people get angry if you're busy like oh my god it's always on your terms no no I'm busy I'm all you're saying it's on their terms so much of that has to do with like your fucking let like if you're in a fight and you don't have the job you want to have and you know and then some guy doesn't return your it's like fuck him man he's doing this but if everything's going good like hey bro I know you're on that backcountry hike but I really appreciate you getting into cell phone service I need to work out this stuff with Michelle man she's fucking freaking me out I'm a it might be it bro I hope you were there when I needed you bro and you weren't the father anymore yeah yes I did I call I momma caller I have fat thumbs I fuck it if I text you and I'm angry I'm gonna start I'm gonna end a friendship with you cuz I'll be so frustrated with my fat thumbs texting shittily I can't believe Luis just called me a fag boy text this week it's week it's just not a good phone it's good like hey here's your dress see you tomorrow yes it's good for that kind of shit but that's all it's all it's good for it's not good for Express I mean it's good for fun to say shitty things to each other if you know for a fact sure they're you real good friends yes you're right it's like Twitter or something like that is good for like you know it's good for like hey if you want to check out something cool go to WWE on but it's not good for like let me explain to you my take on taxation or even worse your take on a person yeah the thing about your take on a person it's you you're allowed to have your obviously let's say some politician or what-have-you you're absolutely rely to have your opinion on them but you're not really talking to them like if you really do know them we are you we just sit like there's always a limitation if looking at someone from afar right and if you could sit down in front of someone some politician do you agree with her disagree with and then have a conversation with them then you would find out who the fuck they really are then you'd find out who the fuck you really are in respect to this argument and that makes sense but you can't do that there's not enough people there's no way there's no way that everybody who has an idea about anybody else can be with them but we have to respect that gap like if you like sports guys are the worst at it the worst when they talk about a certain player being lazy or a certain fighter being a pussy like what in what are you going on about you're talking about a professional cage fighter and you're calling them up pussy but I've read that shit all day I read it all the time and it's that thing where you would say that if you were in front of them you would never say that in front of them i weirdly think that like as a fan you sort of you're buying the right to express that opinion in a weird way though not that they're a pussy but like fan like when people get mad at people booing at UFC events I'm going like I don't know they're kind of buying that experience you know and I can't hate on them if they want to express themselves that way um you know it's sort of sort of a thing I mean look I got very humbled doing the podcast with Michael Bisping because I was doing radio on Sirius XM for a while and talking about MMA like I fucking knew anything and ever started gonna show up this big and then I was like oh I don't know shit I'm not even gonna pretend like I know shit and I'm it's so I'm so much better at it now I'm not trying to fit into this fucking like mold or whatever but yeah I think that from a fan's perspective I don't really get mad at them when they start talking shit or start to like it's kind of like part of experience you know yeah no I mean I get it but you shouldn't shouldn't be disrespectful to people for no reason like that like there's there's a lot of guys that get into it just because it's like they feel like they're behind a wall naked lot bombs it's a pussy move it's weird it's not it's not healthy for you don't worry it's like if you go to an event and there's two guys getting in a cage fucking fight in here to start booing them just seems to me it's like dude I mean come on man they're fucking to entertain you guys getting in there and and putting it all on the line like yeah they have a right to million years but the same time I kind of understand it's almost like well they should be able to pull your comedy shows too then yeah but I'll tell you I'll tell you you know what I'll tell you why not because they're not I don't believe that at a comedy show if they're booing you during your set they're completely taking out the experience for everybody else and I feel like at a live sporting event it's just not the same thing they're not they're not getting in the fighters head I mean maybe they are a little bit yeah but I you know I talked to Mike about this you know he says people boo me they fucking love my bank vault he's a different type of person that is what it's a champion he's got a different kind of mental strength he can you he doesn't give a fuck and I can plow through everything and that's why he became a champion I mean he's like one of the most mentally strong guys to ever fight in MMA because he's a guy that when he started out he was good he was very good he won The Ultimate Fighter season two and was a good fighter but willed himself a position of being a champion and you know was knocked out was stopped was beaten had his momentum stopped restarted right back up again with the same or better enthusiasm every time yeah and deep into his 30s did it all clean no steroids no allegations no bullshit just worked hard and was tough as fuck and won the fucking middleweight title that's a different type of mind dude I know I know he lost two in a row but the fact that he went out there and had a fight that I thought he was gonna win until GSP caught him with that left I thought he was gonna win the fight and then loses to GSP for the title in the biggest middleweight fight probably ever and then just goes I want to fight Kevin gas lemon to week Calvin Kelvin so yeah like you go like Jesus man it's such a fucking straight up realize dude logic he's like he's like get me you know I already did a training camp one I'll get two paychecks it was a rough fight though I don't think it was a smart that jury look George st. Pierre you know he took four years off and everything nobody still one of the greatest if not the greatest of all time and you saw that in that fight yeah I don't think he was I mean Michael cut him he caught him with those elbows particularly from the bottom but you know George st. Pierre's he's a special guy he really is a special athlete people were really under estimating how great George st. Pierre was he's a guy who beat every person that was ever put in front of him the the losses that he had avenged so beautifully George CPR is a monster and you know I think that everyone including myself you know really didn't think he was gonna be able to come back with that long of a layoff and compete the way that you know you said it yourself Mike was just mentally pushing himself for getting better and better Michael Bisping today destroys Michael Bisping a younger Michael Bisping seven years ago that's crazy is an old man now yeah maybe it's it's entirely possible I mean the fighting is such a crazy proposition that even with like elite guys like even when someone won a fight like if you made them fight again would they win 100% of time I don't think they would not at all so there's there's things and weird events that can change your fortune in a fight I said that McDonald and steep a I think if in Ghana and Ghana could beat him a few times if they ten times he can not come out ten times steep eight definitely doesn't win all ten no it was definitely a few that are gone it was tough for sure if they have a rematch see the thing about like wood wood do you have to restart it with a time machine where there's no memory whatsoever by experiencing each other because you know you get you understand patterns that's why it's weird when you see guys fight training partners it's like there's guys that just know each other so well that when they get in there they've already established a pattern one guys always bullied the other guy in training one guys beat the other guy up you could see it when they actually fight yeah well actually and the other thing just as we're saying this I go George st. Pierre is the greatest ever in case for if you have to make a case I don't think there's a stronger case for anyone than for George yes he beat everyone whoever he ever faced he had two losses that were Matt Hughes and Matt Serra right and came back and destroyed them in the rematches Matt Matt Hughes twice and Matt Serra just came back and beat him in the written third rubber match never happened right then after retiring comes back and wins a championship a division up not just that but for yes Michael Bisping and chokes him unconscious with a rear naked choke that was one of the tightest most cinched up rear naked choke so I've ever seen anybody perform ever I mean he he had it like a jujitsu guy it was like a lot of MMA guys they have a harder time getting those gloves fully locked into position like there's a difference between there's this mmm there's an a rear naked choke with the palm is touching the back of the head which a lot of people opt for because you don't have to make as much space for the arm you can get back there you can grab that head but the real way to do it is like this the real way to do it is a karate chop where you go to the back of the neck with a karate chop and once you have that in place then there's just crazy leverage and it just squeezes the fuck out of someone's neck when someone really gets one of those locked in and that's what George did and the way he did it was like as tight and sweet and four-star black belt alright good show do you ever seen goddammit it's hard to listen to you describe it so beautifully that's another thing I didn't I never gave a shit at all the same way like me and Michael Bisping at this point to become friends to where it's like you start to fucking care about these guys it's all you imagine being a family member you imagine having somebody like your blood is in there you know being a fan of somebody is one thing but then you know somebody and that was it was hard to watch shops one of my best friends and I had to do commentary on some of his fights you know it was a real hard time it's real hard last couple fights in particular was very hard for me very hard to like I have to be as equally enthusiastic about him getting hit as I am about him hitting someone now and I know the guy very well show your ass this shirt my shirt for sure I even said like everybody knew that was really good friends with them it was you know we had done a bunch of podcast together but I was also the what I mean to retiring because I was look I know what's going on like and you know I've seen this with other people and I'm not friends with them and it's not my position to tell people to stop and I don't know them that well you'd have to know someone real well to know where their heads at you know but that's a sport where proof see like if you're booing a basketball game maybe I got I guess like there's something that's so much more intense about a fight especially like there's smart booze like when someone does something illegal or someone does something or someone does something that's fucked up there's smart booze but then there's booze where guys were just like facing each other and they're cancelling each other out like you're watching a really high level thing what these guys are trying to solve what do I have to do to connect on this guy's fucking brain stem and knock his lights out but the UFC is marketing toward these casual fans who are basketball fans at football fans who aren't really the people who are hardcore who appreciate the martial arts side of it what these guys are putting into it do you think so I think they're just marketing I don't think they're marketing towards any specific fan they're not marketing towards people don't understand yeah but I think that's the almost the same thing because they're just trying to get a mass audience and the majority of people aren't people who really makes you say that though what makes you say they're trying like what are they doing specifically what I feel like when we put together you know fights that don't necessarily make sense in terms of rankings when they put the interim belts on on fights where don't really need to be there you just know it's a marketing move because I think a title on a poster will probably sell that many more text that's a good point it definitely juices it up when you have an interim title something like a marketing dude is going like oh yeah we saw this many more paper visions as a title and don't know the dance between interim title or regular title a lot of the casuals don't know the difference between Michael Bisping or fuck endorse ap yeah look I'm with you is that a bar I I almost feel conflicted because I have this part of me that's like a purist that's like no it should be just like whoever number one is versus the champion and we should never fuck around at the same time if they were just like oh you know we just set up Nick Diaz vs Conor McGregor I'd be like that's the greatest thing that's a man and I don't care if Cubs won 72 fights in America I'm flying a hundred out of a hundred times on the phone where he's fighting who he's fighting it's just fun and it's exciting but let's get real I think there was something really pure and what's beautiful about MMA is that it's always gonna kind of figure itself out it is the greatest sport because it's a greater sport anything could happen any given Sunday it's inherently built the marketing is sort of built in already right so you can you can create a pecking order you can create rankings and I think you can kind of just say hey the pieces are gonna fall where they're gonna fall and it's always gonna be super exciting and you see with the way they handle Conor or certain guys they definitely they through that to the side and I think har is a great example of it as well why they don't really care though like I fuck it did go do Mayweather they had it for a little while they were part of the promotion millions of dollars off that thing everybody made a fuckload of money I mean Mayweather made hundreds of millions Connor made a hundred million I don't know what the UFC made everybody got fucking crazy paid and then they started Zuffa boxing and now there are they're offering Joshua and they're offering five hundred men I'm a crazy contract apparently that might be bullshit I don't know haven't asked anybody if that's real but I'm not surprised they realize there's a lot of money in promoting fights whether it's promoting MMA you know Dana has a big background in boxing you know his son actually just had an amateur boxing fight I saw that in his Instagram yeah fuck Daniel loves boxing I always loved it so it's not unusual that they decide go into it but with Connor it was like one of those things where you like yeah that's what you're supposed to do if Mayweather really wants to fight Connor and Connors never had a professional fight he make a hundred million bucks let's see let's see let's see who buys it but i'm sanna the MMA purist were what's best for the sport of MMA that's not necessarily the best move and no it's not bad move it doesn't hurt it at all because first of all it shows you that in the specialties that there are people that have skills and techniques and abilities that just far exceed the very best MMA fighters and you saw that with Conor Floyd Floyd just fucked him up he just fucked him up but Conor caught him a little bit he tagged him in the beginning and you can say that Floyd wasn't going full-tilt and he probably wasn't I would say definitely wasn't he was definitely trying to wear him out and get him tired because he knew that he relied on kinetic energy for the first round or two but he still got clipped with a shot he did want to get clipped with sure you know I think Floyd wanted to see what Conor was doing and he would spent the first few rounds like kind of taking in data and like seeing like okay what are you doing here what weird shit are you trying but still I was like I did not think Conor was gonna do that good I thought it would be over within three or four rounds and Mayweather would knock him out and he would just out class I mean the fact that it went ten and that even landed some shots I was pushing out a fight itself that's like it's not bad for as a purist I'm saying it's almost like it's the way they're sort of letting Conor run the show I just kind of feel like the UFC sort of always built this brand UFC it's the you know it's a coca-cola of MMA and I feel like Conor has basically become bigger or at the very least as big as the UFC and he doesn't he doesn't give a shit eat wheat he tweeted out the other day I'm the boss when he was promoting the videogame like they did him up with Dana White is one of the characters but I just feel like that wasn't necessarily the best thing for mixed martial arts as a sport I almost feel like the what they were doing what hasn't heard it at all yeah I think I think it made it bigger I mean it's like dude what Conor created was like a thing that's like it's just that really hard dude even when when he fought a Marcus Bremen was his first fight in the UFC and I remember already sit there was like an energy in the crowd about Conor fight and shoot I don't even know who this guy was and you're like why is this like such a big thing and that every fight was just a bigger and bigger and bigger thing and then he would create this thing we're like Dustin Poirier is like biggest fight ever is against Conor McGregor and Dustin had way more big fights than him but still the big deal was that you're fighting this guy like he just he would cry just that it was the result so he put mark yeah yeah yeah he starched Dustin Poirier in the first round he slept Josie aldo in 13 seconds lazy it was all real accomplishments why him fighting Floyd Mayweather it was interesting mm-hmm because he was so exceptional as a striker but do you think that this I give the UFC so much credit with building Conor Conor McGregor because he wouldn't have been able to do that anywhere else at the UFC is such a big brand that he could have been a Bellator fighter and become a you know a worldwide name the way he is now probably not if it's which is weird the Bellator is a stupid name they need to accept the Regency boxing time for Regency boxing on HBO what is this nonsense why would you call Regency boxing Bellator MMA just call it MMA it's fuckin MMA that's what it is just like when you watch HBO boxing it's on HBO and it's box right that's good that the UFC is sort of built this brand around it because I think you have see but for the sport in itself because in boxing even you know you don't really know the difference between any of the title or the the organization's or the titles you don't really WBC the well they know who the big guys are they know Anthony Joshua they know is Klitschko forever you know everybody knows about Deontay Wilder now house is a few guys but there's a couple other champions that are out there they like who who's this guy yeah well that guy the guy you've never heard of has like six belt championship there's Intercontinental Championships everybody gets belts it's like ugly loss to boxing titles now fucking big old the UFC nailed it with that belt belt champion belt yeah two of them you know sweats my other fucking belt I wanna be the champ champ is going to his arms look and it's it's there's no sport like it there's nothing like it nothing's gonna hurt it as long as it's as long as people are interested like as long as people enjoy it as much as I enjoy it as much as I enjoy watching it so much as I enjoy calling it as long as that's gonna be the case always gonna be kids coming up like this Sean O'Malley kid that wild motherfucker that kid yeah we said once like Instagram it's just all him smoking weed he's a fucking savage she's out there just doing bong hits kick up people in the face don't afro I love it I love that guy he's an animal and that fucking kid is like this is this new breed there's this new guy they love it so much and when they're doing it they love it so much and they're so good and they're gonna be better next generation they're just gonna keep getting better and better and better and that's what Conner did as well as he opened up that window because everyone's gonna get paid a lot more money now that dude that there's so much did you see people talking about hundreds of millions of dollars at stake it's like everyone's going huh okay that sugar Sean O'Malley could be a fucking multi multimillionaire in a couple years I'm not bullshitting that kid could be huge and that's just off the CBD oil company he's a wild man he's a fucking wild man to the wave fights was he gaming he's going them gaming chairs but he's good man and the thing about him is he's like super creative what does that think down that's go to the left hand side and scroll down to that video him working out what is he doing there what is he doing here he does a lot of weird crazy shit what though yeah like he's practicing and he doesn't have 360 take down to the back control like this I mean he might not ever do that in real life but he might hit that all the time see he does that high kick believe the spin so that's for the guard pass that's very confusing cuz a lot of times guys dive straight in and guys who are good especially the half guard wind up wrapping them up real quick but he does a spin around it I wonder if he could me if the way he hits that if he does that over and over and over again I bet he can do that in a fight well that's a cool thing about now it's like an we watch it with like I think Anthony Pettis was that first like holy fuck moment with the you know the last WEC event ever the the jumping kick or whatever but you get guys that are so athletic now that and now there's so much money in the sport guys that might have went into like you know football or basketball now we're looking at MMA as an option where she's kind of weren't getting that years ago so there's super athletes talking about that dude how interesting these guys gonna get I was wonder about that like are they ever gonna get too dangerous where they're gonna have to alter the rules because there's two athletic they can do it cause too much damage they're not gonna be much different than the best the best now like a Francis and Ghana or steepy Miocic or you know the tyron woodley will you look at a guy like tyron woodley that is about as explosive as a man who can step on a scale at 170 pounds for a brief amount of time can get yeah and as good as they get the competition kind of gets better Tuesday yeah tyron woodley fought people from UFC to you'd be like this should be a league fight 60 people in a row from FC ten Tywin is only 170 mean he wouldn't be but if they had 70 fighters Frye once you got into Don Frye Don Frye was a big fella yeah but Don Frye so quick he's very he might just land a knockout shot before I could do anything Don Frye could also take a tremendous punch with Don Frye in front of each other and hilarious the fucking man's mad on the podcast no I have not loved you though he was a boss and he's a great personality discipline it we hadn't caught a few times animal he doesn't give a fuck he's hilarious and he paid the price physically for that career you know he's had some serious health consequences like real neck injuries and for that reason his body just got beat the fuck up like he had real neck and back problems you know from all those punches and takedowns and neck cranks and all that shit you know he was there the early early early days to know this is the one look he gets hit with a knee and they get it a close play land on each other it's crazy dude but this is why we got an MMA this is fucking crazy I mean look at these guys I mean it doesn't seem real it literally doesn't seem real that they could just stand and wail on each other and talking on his face is just a swollen mess after this Don fries caught on the forehead it was fucking crazy but Don fry he was one of the first guys to figure out a way to shut down we were talking about the other day with Pat Miletich shut down Brazilian Jujitsu guys like this look look at his fucking mount like he was a real good wrestler and he had a very good top game and he also was a good boxer too and just a fucking stud just a stud and just took his time in the world either you know he first when he first fought in the UFC I believe he was only 200 pounds and he fought a guy who was like three something and fucked him up in like six seconds yeah he fought some big overweight guy and he cracked him with a jab and dropped him with a jab it just beat him yeah real quick I think he beat everyone until he ran into Mark Coleman mmm literally how me and Dave Smith became friends we were roommates and we sort of renting UFC like I thought we got into UFC yeah best of knockout videos together smoking blunts drinking heineken yeah who's back days yeah you know his weird is that we got into it and like right around the time that we were getting into UFC the Ultimate Fighter dropped so it was almost like we got into it at the same time that the country got into it like we got into it a few months earlier and then all this other thing no one gave a shit about was just like blowing up yeah we got to do during season one so much that season two the home fire was coming out we're like dude this is it season two Ultima fire this fucking nuts fights on TV let's do it and there wasn't a fight in the first episode of season two we were furious we almost broke our TV that's funny but it was also like a perfect storm of like people getting interested in it and then having that Ultimate Fighter reality show back in the days where people you know I still watched reality shows back then now you can't even fucking hold a gun to my head and get me to watch a reality show unless they're trying to survive in Alaska I got like five of those saved those shows like life below zero that's my jam dude I love that show but out there finding salmon shit to eat and just chopping down trees try to stay alive that that I could maybe get into but I will say I think there's something interesting about the post reality show world like we got over reality shows but like we're never the same like you never quite go back to like even just like in like what you do with this show versus a radio show like you're not like hello ladies and gentlemen we don't want any of that now we just want like an honest conversation I feel like in entertainment in general you want something that it just seems it's not um as showy it's more just like what real life would be yeah that's that's what people want for sure you know I mean and the thing about it is it's like it's led to a guy who was a reality star was the president that's as weird as it gets yeah I mean that that is a reality star president he's not a politician just a businessman god on a TV show was a big-time celebrity and now he won a popularity contest so he's the runner of the country you know an advertisement for just fucking motivation I don't what you want to say like he just said I want that or just an advertisement for how much fucking Donald Trump is I've never I used to have to really argue with lefties about how democracy's a flawed system but now you just look at it you're like now so how about that now he's your leader awesome if you have four people and they're all equally intelligent yeah that's right I'll get together and figure something out rationally but when you get to a place where you can't even communicate with those people anymore cuz there's 300 million of you and you're scattered across a continent but you're all supposed to be on some same team voting over like really important issues that you probably don't even know anything about like what you're talking about earlier about assault weapons or fracking you bring up anything to certain people offshore drilling what what are we doing the other didn't even know if we're supposed to be for or against fracking I have no idea you definitely shouldn't be for it I don't think it's I think it's proven that it's safe long term because there's getting to get into water supplies to causing earthquakes there's a lot of real real consequence there's definitely a lot of problems there's also definitely a lot of wealth oh gee that was like energy very positive things but I and negative sure the problem is everybody wants to discount the negative or discount the positive and that's no one agrees that it's actually a cost-benefit ratio but the comments like what you were saying before we're like with four people democracy works but I think a lot of it is like okay so if we get into a fucking thing like let's say we're in a car crash and one of the people in the car or our car breaks down rather and one of the people in the car is a mechanic we don't sit here and go like well let's vote for who gets to do this you just go well you're a mechanic three of us are out in the fucking you know woods hunting elk me and Lewis don't go like well I think we should do it this way you've done this most of the time just pure voting yes isn't how you get to something you defer to experts yes and when you just have this voting thing where it's like well we'll all just cast a vote the dumb people the same as the smart people the educated the same as the uneducated you end up with a fucking this competition to just say bullshit gets anyone up well I'm gonna make America great again well Donald Trump empowers the worst elements of our society like this is all fucking retarded I gotta pee again I can't believe this yeah should we end it or should we keep going we're at three hours all right we should end it if two of the three of us need a pick listen I'm so excited that we did this we got to do this more often gonna be in LA again next time you invite us on all right we do
