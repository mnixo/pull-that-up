Oh things fall off those pieces of shit yeah they get too fancy already whoops sorry cheers sir thank you my pleasure my pleasure hmm don't know we were talking about the different kinds of comedians that they really are like meme comedians they're they're comedians they have a special skill set it's a different thing yeah but they have a special skill set in fact one of my closest friends bearded humor he's like I would say if he was a stand-up comic he would probably be in my top five in terms of creativity in terms of talking about things in a moment and just all out funny you know the skill set for stand-up Nana used to be I started 25 years ago used to be the only way you proved yourself as a person with any type of comedic integrity was on stage standing flat-footed in front of an audience that you probably don't want you to be funny or no have have no idea to be funny but these mean these many people in Photoshop especially because our tension is so quick and so drawn to social media people you know people are as excited about stand-up as they used to be and now it's excited about what's going to be the newest thing was comedic what's gonna be the hottest photo the Photoshop wants me to have his image well that's the easiest to get right it's easier to get it on your phone you get those images those photo shops and the memes that are funny that hit you immediately but I think right now I mean especially when you go to the store don't you think there's like more people interested in stand-up now than ever yeah but it's so weird in a tricky place now people are interested in it but people are so they're more critical to stand-up now more than ever used to be a time when you could just say what you wanted and people say that person was outspoken outraged but they were themselves but now you tell one joke one blogger one troller die sex your jokes and preach your jokes don't do the set up the callback don't do the tag and next thing you know you're yeah but I think with a lot of events that happen today they're happening now comedies gonna start taking a shift back to people honest voices I think so too I think there's a direct backlash to like political correct thinking and the the type of policing that you're seeing you see I mean yep I understand police and stuff in the Catholic Church the police is stuff in a regular Church but you go to a comedy club to police you are in the wrong place and nine times out of ten people that go to a comedy show they'll walk out in protests their mindset was to protest before they even went there they're just waiting for the trigger word just like well I'm never in there leave well it's a way to get a lot of attention you know being outraged it's something especially if you kind of have a point like if you could you could articulate that point it's a great way to get attention with you know the trollers and the people yeah I mean there's a giant market for that like if you think of like if you're a comic and you're a famous comic and you're outspoken you know and someone could take your bit and take it apart like they've done with Chapelle learn any times right both Chappell owns it so much he owns it I was just with him you I've never seen a guy that flips our sets over like he just write another five-minute bit that's weird right but I think good thing is now I've watched some of his new stuff and things he's doing now he's going to lead to charge for comedians having a voice I did show him at the store recently and at the end of he said comedians now more than ever you need to grab your balls because it's our job to talk about the things that are bad in his world yeah and we are the best people for it well it's the last line of free speech it's the last real line of free speech because you don't have a real boss right like when you go on stage it's no one's no one gives you a single word of direction right you know that's that's a very unusual place to be in in terms of entertainment and it's something that reaches especially with someone like Dave millions and millions and millions of people every time he does a Netflix special every time somebody does anything that's film it's gonna hit millions of people you know I have no one telling you what to do no one no one giving you try to tell you what to do you you resisted any did you do what you want to do he's a real comic he's real but you have that I've been following for what I've been a comic store for years I'm always in the cut and I've seen you do some material like how the fuck does he get away with this because he fucking owns it and I really believe when I'm saying in a lot of ways like in other things it's obvious that I don't really believe it what I'm saying because I think it's funny for us as much as people although I need that lift I think for comedians is therapeutic for us too yeah there's a hundred percent can you imagine the situation you have argument with your wife or somebody and you can't go onstage that night just to talk about how pissed off she made you yeah oh yeah so as much as people get stuff out of us when you come to a show we get now our psychiatric exam right on the spot you're also like you could complain about some shit right you can complain about someone saying something or something how or you could turn it into a bit and you can get hundreds of people just dying laughing all right I've had some I had some conflicts online one of them with a bunch of vegans they're awfully so you interface so much every once well you just want to punch the troll face just read the comments that's the problems occasionally you read the comments like holy shit like people just want you dead because you know anyway I had this whole thing in my act about uh chasing down the hashtag vegan cat somebody wrote some mean shit to me and this hashtag vegan cat was like what the fuck is that I went through there's a whole community of people feeding their cats vegetables and but but in doing this and like tracking this down and shape and like it makes you realize like okay I got to write a bit about this cuz I could just get mad easily right so yeah it writes itself I could just get mad and be upset that someone's being mean to me or gonna turn this shit into fuel or you could just go fucker just destroy the whole vegan community it's not the feet it's nothing wrong with vegan systems every other group I don't really know too many vegans that aren't assholes brother I know some vegans aren't assholes I don't know rich role he's a great guy my friend Joseph he's a great guy Neal Brennan he's a vegan he's an asshole oh man real gritty is a motherfucking prick man people to turn into s when a tassel is embodying him yeah the especially people are glasses cuz they were they have like million different frames that's when you had the next level to be an S so when you switch your glasses up but Neal Brennan is a vegan ease one of those I don't think vegans should be allowed to go to a barbecue and complain they complain they all come to a fuckin barbecue they got their patties they upset if you can cook and meat on a grill that was designed to cook dead animals yeah that's what they get up and they get upset so all vegans are assholes I'm sorry it's not all of them but I see what you saying all the ones that I know because when they make them but they make the transition they can't just become vegans they got a they just gotta let you know I'm vegan now they can't wait so you say dinner is it vegan options it's vegan vegan they just can't do it they got to make an announcement I think I'll let everybody know that I'm a vegan now and I'm an asshole they think they're saving the world and the worst is a vegan that always gets colds yo whenever I see Neal bring a coffin how's that bigger life cause you fuckin flew habitats motherfuck I always say there's the Ian Edwards I'm like dude you look tired you look exhausted I take pictures of Ian every time we fly together and he falls asleep I take pictures of me and just say there be 12 in your diet get a steak in your motherfucking day he said he would eat meat but he would only eat elk that I killed he said he would eat some some elk meat so I'm gonna cook him some elk meat we're gonna we should film it it probably like bounced around like super person like he's been eating nothing but lentils for the last 20 years elk how do where does one go to even shoot a help Utah Colorado has a lot of them there's some yeah how do you transport is there a loss can you transport your kill or you have to break it down wherever where you kill it you you have to have first of all you have a tag and then when you when you have a tag you're allowed to get a certain kind of animal so say if it's like you have a buck deer tag that means you can kill a male deer and then once you kill it then you break it down and you either bring it to a butcher shop and they turn it into cuts for you or you could do it yourself and wrap it up but you have to have a tag you have to register that you kill that animal and you have to keep that that was that with you that paperwork with you so if you transport the the meat across state lines and some game warden pulled you over and said you have a deer in your car and you just reducer he's got to see that you have the paperwork for it I want to sell races at all but I don't know a black person that could tell that story if you just told about killing butchering up yeah transporting a date in yeah that's what you have to do that's how you do it you got to put them on ice I mean you have to you have an obligation to try to save the meat you know you wouldn't you have an animal and it's down you want to get it into like a packaged form as quick as possible you want to break it down sometimes just dude sometimes people hang things they hang things and they're drugged that's just from the cold - so you mentioned we're hanging on I think about Jesse some whole bunch of people back in one interview crazy story interesting such a mess it's a mess and I think was really awful about it because his story is it was like good and bad of it do good of it was when people thought that he was violated and he was a victim of a hate crime it wasn't just gay people there was a Russian to support him it was like thug dudes you know I'm saying it was like some real motherfuckers day I was like I mean I saw exhibit make a comment it was a community of people away from the LBG community that thought it was really fucked up yeah and that's that was the beauty of the incident because it kind of brought people together and but the fun thing about it was just a lot and it's so fucking unfortunate it's so unfortunate somebody would play on people's emotions yeah for or to benefit themselves it's it's awful well there's a certain narcissism that exists in show business that I think you and I both know very well you know we've all seen it and thankfully the people that seem to be the best for whatever reason they have the some of the best handles on it like Dave doesn't show any of that right but there's some people that do and that narcissism is weird that that wanting it to be all about them and they'll do sneaky shit like fake an attack like that's that's a symptom of that same kind of thinking it just it just got desperate and when in some crazy way it was awful for some reason because you have people like when I first went down you have people that normally people did you look at okay that's my friend or whoever you started having SIA dies and that's just it's just it's so messed up and a thing also has messed up as much as people wrote for him when they thought that it was an injustice everything nobody's really talked about it nobody's addressed they're like you know this is our movement these are things that we're trying to progress toward but this was isolated incident and just say how awful it was yeah you know the beautiful thing is that people way more tolerant than they ever have been before they're also beautiful things attack didn't happen right so I don't have to think of one more atrocious thing that people have done to another person for no reason right so that's good and it's also good that you get to see where that kind of stuff heads where you're always looking to be a victim to the point where you realize there's like some sort of currency in being a victim so people fake being a victim right so they can get all this fucking attention it's good for us it's good for us to see because you see that now next time a story comes around it's just a live fishy it's like the boy cried wolf and that's what's unfortunate about it because anytime someone says that they were a victim of such heinous crime like that you want to believe them you want to believe them the minute they said you know this incident it makes you start second-guessing and that's another thing that was awful about the whole thing and all the smoke he's getting right now and he deserve because I've been turn his ass up on Instagram yeah on everything he deserves everybody knows he deserves it everybody knows he deserves it all right I read a story once about this dude who said that he punished his daughter by making her sit in the backyard by a tree then he went out there an hour later and she was gone and the suspect that Coyotes got her and I remember thinking that story going man that just does not sound real that does not sound real it just seems weird yeah he's got left a baby in the backyard and coyotes got it like real was like a newt like a like I'm not walking or anything like well he left the baby like to punish the baby like a two-year-old left it in the yeah well it turns out he really didn't do that the kid died and he had stuffed it in some drainage ditch somewhere so this I don't remember how the kid died what was the reason for it but it was one of those stories where you hear the story like Jesus it doesn't sound real sometimes stories don't sound real yeah no the next thing we're gonna be second-guessing everything yeah I hope not but when it first went down I thought it was a I thought it was a situation where Lee Daniels and and Jesse sat down in the writers room and Lee Daniels Lee anybody got any ideas for any new episodes it's just I got one nobody's gonna believe it look I'm gonna be hungry shit I'm gonna go to Subway to get a 12-inch foot long and Lee Daniels like I believe that way through the whole story and lee daniel said if nobody's gonna believe it Jesse got upset and told the totally Dennis we'll see I'm gonna shoot it myself and he walked itself into that that whole scenario and it's just awesome that's entirely possible that's what it sounds like it sound like now you're gonna say now anybody that was a fan of Empire which I know a lot of people that's listening were being very sarcastic when I say that they're gonna be like second-guess the storyline of so many dough shows the storylines of everybody who ever said today were done wrong with anything you the awful thing about this is now people will be ready and quick to just second-guess anything that you say yeah that's that's a fact until we can read each other's minds till we could find out for sure that's gonna change the whole game get reasonable is mine yeah definitely gonna lemonade a lot of street fights most of them I mean you talk about your your imminent dangerous senses are gonna be one up 100% if you read somebody's mind yeah yeah I don't know if I want to do that I do I like my secrets I'm all-in I like having secrets too but I like going all-in I think all-in I think I think it's just inevitable we were talking about it in the last podcast about there's something they're gonna be able to shoot in your neck What did he say the way described it something like an injection that will take over sort of well it's what the way it interacts with your brain cells thread yeah thread itself in your brain cells so literally like heaven I think we're gonna have built-in Wi-Fi internet systems where we're connected to each other's heads so this will people request was like a study they want to try out on people or you can just go to your doctor and say shoot me with the brain shit I think eventually it's gonna be shoot me with the brain shit first you got to get it on a clinical trial who is close to no brain cells and that's when we tried but what does that movie there was a movie where a dude got shot and they put some chip in his back upgrade upgrade yeah and it did that to him it turned to be he'll I got access to all the information he knew martial arts you knew how to move and everything was happening like it was a basically like a supercomputer inside of a person that can do everything other intelligence is right down the line if they're talking about this shit shooting it into your brain we're gonna share a network we're all gonna be on a network there's going to be a lot of white people join in that effort because black people don't flop with needles bro no say that but how many how many athletes are on steroids yeah but that's a different that's a different animal I'm talking about the average black Dino that's limb Brownsville or okay Oh watch this all I do I got this new brain should reject it through a needle fuck you up shit that's hilarious and that's probably true I mean how many people are gonna try that look who's gonna be the earliest adopters getting a shot in your neck that lets you read everybody's mind and then what are you gonna do is interested it's gonna fuck our job up man because like half of what we do is say shocking shit that people know is kind of true but you can't believe you're saying it did you have people not the old winter the subway Joe coming up if you could do that that'd be the ultimate fucking joke later right there oh yeah two guys walking a bar you don't get anything through nets yeah no I think I think I have to pass on it keep it bro yeah it's gonna be weird when would you get it like you wouldn't would you want to be the first comedian to have it oh you almost want to be a fool who doesn't have it if you want to be a comedian yeah yeah I want to watch other motherfuckers do it first yeah oh but the problem is they're gonna fucking take over like finances like instantly they're good as soon as they upload their brain they're like I'll just get all this money I'm gonna figure out a way to get all this fucking money and then by the time you shoot it into your head they've already got the system locked down but see that's you have different level of people that you hang out with because they'll be like how do you get the money but my life will be like yo we got this brace you how are we gonna get some ass off of this dog you can get it if you read a broad ma you get all I ask you all of it yeah you would know but then it wouldn't be fun like half the fun is not known if somebody likes you right you don't know what's gonna happen it's just gonna work out was that movie with Mel Gibson or you can he could read women's minds well what women want and everyone remade it right now it's coming out really I've seen the billboard that's a lair Roger Henson and Tracy Morgan that's hilarious Tracy Morgan I had a conversation with Mel Gibson the other day on the phone it was one of the weirdest things in my life I'm just happy to know I have friends they're gonna say that so you have a lot of sisters as my friends get you you know how you kill a elk all right let's do between a bucket so so you got trigger one time and then is like Oh in a count yeah so I'm gonna phone Mel Gibson the other day I was too far with ray-ray the other day well I'd rather be on the throw with Ray Ray not it's not bad to talk to Mel Gibson it's just it's like okay he's a regular he's a dude he's a guy he's Mel Gibson he's no Gibson but you know like fucking for real like you're talking to me like for real it's a real conversation with Mel guess yeah that would be that would be very interested and that's never run into him he's a super nice guy he did a podcast to talk about the stem cell doctor that helped his dad oh yeah he came on for Doctor Riordan he's this guy in Dallas that treats people down in Panama's got this radical stem-cell therapy that you can't get in America and it fixed Mel Gibson's dad was 92 and he was in a wheelchair and now he's a hundred he's walking around he's issue with stem cell situation in America's I don't hear too much the last time and I'm not probably as knowledge as you are but wasn't Christopher Reeve trying to UM promote stick more stem-cell research I'm sure he was yeah he had that spinal cord injury from the horse horse accident he was doing those horse jumps yeah eating dead babies like at the stem cell they're the best they're also pushing the boundaries like they're the ones out there that are promoting like ridiculous preposterous comedy that's completely offensive but brilliant that's one of the things that when we were doing the Chappelle show the one of things I appreciate more than anything about this show was how it brought people of all races backgrounds together to do the thing that we all should have in common and that's to laugh and also to not push the button but touch on racial stuff without having an angry undertone and that's what's so fucked up about America now whenever you talk about race it feels like one side somebody has to tend be tense yeah you don't say it's never like a comfortable state it's never like and I know things are intense but we we have to be able to laugh first once you get people to laugh you can talk about whatever you want and then even if a person is not in agreement or have the same thoughts at the end of day you should be able to respect that person and I think those same people should be able to share laughs yeah and there was a fun silly non aggressive quality to the way you guys put together sketches that got the point across and everybody laughs everybody laughing Joe to this to this day when I travel I do my audiences it's interesting because of course you would think I'm gonna draw a certain audience because I'm black you know which I am and I do but it's weird I could go to places and it's straight up like Dave call them the muddy boot motherfuckers you don't say it like the muddy boot motherfuckers the muddy booth - job they got John Deere right you know say they know all that elk shit you talkin me you know dude John Deere errs know all that shit they probably call it right now say no Joe I figured got that wrong you gotta cut the heart from you know you gotta go left to right you know and I've noticed I have those people and that I have hood people but it's just interest when you can look out and this is what that show did when you can look on the audience and you say you have all of America there it was the best sketch comedy show in the history of television I think I think in living color is very very very overlooked people forget how goddamn making and groundbreaking and we write both of them like is wherever I go people always they always bring it up as a big put in my career but I was like I don't know about every 10 years or 15 years it comes a time where the audience wants something different yeah they shit water down yeah same way when in living color same way with Def Con - Jim came out you know you didn't see a lot of black stand-ups on TV but they had this underground circuit that was bubbling that was bubbling and it was it was the right time when they pulled out the right time and Living Color comes around it's the right time yeah Dave Chappelle show comes around so right time to rich a partial even though that only lasted three or four episode it was the right time and it caught on at the right time yeah in terms of like groundbreaking sketch comedy shows though like that that that KKK bit where he had the the rough line let me tell you something do you understand in the history of sketch nobody has premiered a sketch show and came off so hardcore the first night this was just as hard as it comes when they ended that shit when when we asked why why after all these years would you so so he was like because she's a nigger lover I was like that was one of them that was one of joints I'm like wake up everybody homo sleep it and I know from that moment that this show was gonna be on the next level yeah well was he was free there was so many when we did funny thing a lot of things I used to do I was a warm-up comedian for Chappelle's Show so whenever you saw a Chappelle's Show episode and if you noticed that whenever I came on-screen and I'm not being cocky people would go nuts they play oh shit and the reason was because I was a guide to one of the audience before Dave came out so I knew if I go gut the room out at the beginning people don't people don't even dated nobody knew I was anything if I ripped that at the beginning and then when they see me on the screen it's gonna be like it's gonna be big you know worse yeah and and and that show man it was just like there was just a lot of things to happen and show people like the Rick James sketch the day we played that during the wrap arounds man that should hit so hard I was like this shit is crazy crazy funny thing people know is that Comedy Central did not like that sketch here's this funny yes it caught me said you didn't think Charlie Murphy was funny in it and I watched we ran as shit just to let you know the directional people think I wasn't shit six times and every time man every time you heard Dave say I'm Rick James bitch it was gut said it was gut said yo what did the five figures say to the face where's Lance I had a sketch was getting kids suspended in school right he was a school take teachers what the five figures I say I'm Rick James bitch all right Tom you're suspended for a week you and Dave Chappelle go to the fucking timeout room it's one of the most iconic sketches of all time how wrong was Comedy Central I mean not just a little wrong a lot all the way wrong all the way wrong like almost like suicidal it's like hmm but then it goes to shows like it goes showed you know how you have a vision with something you see it yeah everybody may not see it well that's the problem with working with executives - right it's like their vision is different than your vision they'd like to shape you in a certain way and you know and I know Dave ran into problems with them wanting them to change language so they could get more sponsors yeah I think I think that that was an issue and to be quite honest I don't know exactly what happened everything is speculation you never talked to him I never talked to him buddy because the reason why I never talk to him about it cuz I didn't need to talk to him about it you know saying um that show was great for me it was a great great platform for me and then it was more important my friendship and how he felt away from that was more important then so why'd you leave wrong where'd you go yeah the first time I saw him like as long as you okay cuz it'll be scary for anybody one of your closest friends somebody you work with all of a sudden just goes to another country you don't hear from them you know yeah but when I first saw him after that like I was excited and I was just like you know where whatever it was we had a moment we made history and people go on people going to do other things and just keep it moving well that show was really people always say Daniel if it wasn't for the Chappelle show this and that jebel show gave me a platform for people to see what I've been doing for years and you know you see talents in the club now you see a muffin as good as shit good at shit but will they get the right platform for the world to see them you know saying and that's kind of separate you see one person go from one level to the next level who has the right platform to showcase a talent and that show did that for me and with that said I gave that show everything every time I had a second on camera every time like if you look at two and a half years on this show if you had an editor breakdown how many times I spoke it will probably be a total of four minutes I'll get a word here I get a phrase here but I told myself whenever they turn that motherfuckin camera I'm going for it like even if I'm not talking I'm gonna make my body so expressive that your eyeball draws - with remember Neil told me one time he said because always I always get a mic cuz I'll come up with a line is something to throw in and we were doing a Rick James sketch and I didn't have a mic I was a yellow Sam and Neil said you're not gonna get a mic bro I said I might I might I was like I might say something he was like you're not gonna say anything I was like fuck so I told myself when he smacks this motherfucker because if you look at that same when he smacks my I said what I was like a like a Washington Square Park mine I pushed that I said what fuck I made my face he didn't give me a mic but I said what the fuck with my face and I always as people always as mothers showing every young actors and stuff like that you talk to me what do you need to have like with anything the best thing to do is figure out a way to get on a set you get on a set you do back now you learn you get opportunities you got to be around it you got to get the skill set but when it's time to show up you got to show up you have to show up let's talk a lot of Sh I want to do this out there and then when they say action love I'm saying ready to show up and every time I fucking say action in situation you got to show up well you have a great ability to express yourself on stage and on TV some people feel uncomfortable they just like to be cool while they're telling the jokes like some people have that style like your style is big you know III appreciate you know you ever see Jim Breuer yeah I saw Jim Breuer like the first time I saw him we were really young jebra yeah we're really young and my manager Jason Steinberg says was the time I said what's up know when I first saw Breuer he's so physical and I remember think I remember you get tired watching you know I remember Jim Breuer like basta comedy club days yes yeah I mean where you I mean that's why we mention his name I was like yeah which is Jim Breuer are we speaking of that's Georgia today our dad jim breuer today i mean he's still real energetic but I'm telling you when I tell you I used to I saw him in his super Prime he was a murderer and he was he destroyed she strongly like shudder like like who's gonna do anything after that you know who dude i ate shit following him once but one of the worst bombings in my entire career i was headlining jim was middle and we were working together we did you know millon is a prime spot to fuck somebody up that surprised by 25 we had a good MC - so the emcee was like got the crowd really popping the middle came on and Jim just rip the place apart right you have ten apart and I was scared and I had a blown-out ACL at the time and I was wearing cavalry cheese I was wearing like sexy pants pause with these stupid pants and people wore in the eighties man like they were tight at the top and they flared out a little unlike almost like a little bit they're pathetic that thought I believe I ever owned them but they were in style I had that that's what I look like oh look at that bro seriously he's not sure Noel can um oh no you're not I think mine were probably jeans how the jeans ones like that like see the far left in the blue right there BAM yeah mine so that's terrible that's how can I wear those and they have a straight face and then I had like some nice dress up shirt on and I just ate plates of shit but it made me rethink my whole act because it was it was so such a humiliating bombing yeah because I knew that the audience was right I wasn't being funny I was like about it those are the moments that make you 100% and like now I see a comedy like I go to some clubs but fuck is trying to do the lineup kind of soft like well we can't put that person in front of that person because they won't be able to follow blah blah blah but it should be a point like when I when I started like the baddest motherfuckers in the game they went on stage yeah and if you was a new jack coming up how are you gonna have a defining moment in comedy you got to go behind somebody anybody can do it if you got a hot room everybody's doing good but put that shit behind where you got him off of there like a bill burr comes in a room yeah it just goes and fucks it up blinds it stand up yeah we did I did a tour iam bill and it's so interesting because I know they have one of those podcast with the famous have you ever had to come behind a destroyer I forget the podcaster does it but crystal if he ever had to come behind a story of coming behind someone did just the malls going on after them yeah I think Chris D'Elia I saw Chris little once he said me in it but when we were doing Chappell shaft of Chappelle's Show after second year special we weren't really making a lot of money on special because the show still hadn't been proven you know how something you got a if you got a contract you got a contract that's it it's just so happened at cottages this show blew up before the contract was over but I don't mean nobody's gonna renegotiate so we had this popularity but we weren't making money and um I came with the idea that doing a tour called a I'm rich bitch tour and at the time at the time Charlie was like anywhere he goes at the time bill burr was um a headliner probably at the time in be rooms you don't say and there's no disrespect to him but he was going to come up but when you saw bill you knew this my flow is going to be next you know he was going he was gonna pop it but we still wasn't getting no cash Charlie I never told jokes and I was like how to fuck you around all these communities you never get on stage so I used to bully him you know he tough as motherfucker rest in peace but I was like yeah you so tough motherfucker but not with a microphone in your hand and I bullied him so much that he finally went on stage and Charlie with the toy was Charlie with MC and all we needed him to do was 10 or 15 minutes at a time me and Charlie outside of day with two people on the show bill Bert had a couple of sketches but bill bird didn't pop off of the show and I and I was like but if we're gonna do this let's have a fire show you know me don't we could put that money week in the middle I said let's get my show that they won't ever forget and Charlie used to come out to ten or fifteen minutes and I tell people that I was like who's the toughest person to follow but Charlie we go through ten 15 minutes and Bill Berg will come do 20 to 25 and then I can't behind bill not one night for a year a whole year and bill burns the type of act you have no days off you have no all any of that any any little inkling of being off usually yeah I like the show but the white dude was funny as a mother you know and he you know you could tell that time that bill bird was gonna be a star weather would have been movies a television but as a stand-up you know he was when a pound for pound one adult was to do it in that toy went awful fucking yeah we had a blast yeah Bill's brilliant I got to work with Charlie for we did this Maxim tour we did like 22 dates yeah me and him and John Heffron we traveled all over the place was it when Charlie was starting to do it was he kind of like two years in he was two years in at the time and you know people Joe people understand how tough it is to start as a comedian as a famous person as as a comedian that you're basing your open mic er just selling out all across the country yeah and not only that but you're Eddie Murphy's brother yeah so you got a fight past all of that shit creating your own identity you know I'm saying like I could not imagine like the Tahiti project yeah but he Eddie Murphy right Eddie Murphy and that's one of the things that when Charlie passed that I really appreciated about what the Chappelle's Show did for him because when he passed away nobody said Eddie Murphy's brother died right everybody's like Charlie Murphy's passed away so he had his true identity and that was Charlie Murphy yeah and that was one of his bits you know the you know is it does it piss you off of people yellow van and you know I'm just happy to not call me Eddie Murphy's brother anymore that's funny that was what that was a joke that addressed it yeah and he and and he found his self he got better yeah he got better it didn't he carved his own lane he called Giselle he carved his only dude I was with Maurice Smith used to be the UFC heavyweight champion and Ivan salivary was a guy I've fought in the middleweight division the you have seen a couple other professional fighters at a table with Charlie Murphy and Charley's explaining how none of these motherfuckers know how to do a Chicago Ridge hand some karate shit he was big one of conscious but it is like Charlie Murphy's holding court standing up all these UFC fighters just standing back and Charlie Murphy was talking about Ridge Hannah is a tiger and he know exactly we saw it all right yeah he knew how to fight for sure he knew martial arts bad you know he was um he was big into it years of France he used to be on and his bodyguard when Eddie was like right at the height of his stuff but um Charlie was like martial arts but everything that he said it was the truth you know but you you didn't feel like always do this line everything he said it was true and one of the most genuine people you want to meet me yeah just a dope guy yeah his karate lineage like he has some sort of a connection to some of my friends I'd have to ask them to but he was like a legit martial artist - I saw one video of him in a martial arts contest in and it was I don't know well I don't know I always tell my was like yo you knocked a fourteen-year-old right I don't know how he I don't know if it was a weight or whatever it was and I was like yo that was a fucking kid you just knocked he was like yo anybody in the Rinka fucking get it he was yo he was like putting kids in with him I don't know he'd never I saw the video he'd never wanted me to talk about whatever I used to bust his balls about I could tell being around him did he legitimately knew how to fight yeah the way he carries himself that's Cal he just looked like that but he was the one of the nicest guys man he was so fun to be around like did not knowing him at all and then traveled with him for 22 days we had so much fun man oh man stories all just laugh-in it silly and super friendly and all you wanted to do was man just have a have a good time you know and laugh you know that's all shit shit to me and was so happy to be able to do stand-up that was a big thing for him yeah that he could do stand-up and and travel always tell him I tell him all the time I said I've got birthed your career dude like I bullied him into that's hilarious but he did it but you could tell you could tell and I've been around him and I've been around us you could tell he was growing up he was the guy that always had the center of attention yeah you could just tell him yeah you could tell he knows how to hold a story as he doesn't that was a hard one man when he wouldn't he passed I was like I didn't know he was sick I had no idea you know it's interesting that you say that because I had to continue to do shows do radio interviews and stuff and the thing that people kept saying was he was so young he was so young and he was young but um I don't believe that we're all going to live to be 80 90 yeah 100 you know the only thing we all guarantee when we're born we have our boring date we have that - in the middle and then we have the end and it comes down to what the fuck do you do with your - yeah how how hard did you live what did you go for what Despard you what motivates you what did you do with that - who the fuck gives a fuck about living to a hundred and you don't have a passport you haven't been outside of your block you haven't been out you have never been in an airplane what are you doing to your life and I know Charlie from the point of being in the Navy to being with his brother sent his brother reach certain height of success being interesting about it interested in the business but you know kind of India but never really major mark and then you get a platform that you become and get your identity and shit that's the dopest shit yes it's a one of the best kind of success stories because it doesn't happen automatically it's that Frank Sinatra and I did it my way yeah and it's like you know people say what they want to say but he put the work in that I remember when I'm I think the movie idea called Norbit right and it came from a joke Charlie had just start over that movie and I guess I think him and dad was talking whatever and dance you know how that could be Papa bar could be movie and my father Charlie come and say yo man gets moved here I said what you've learned which about do you say I'm about to go lock myself in a hotel for 30 days and write this motherfucker movie they already gave me the money you know I'm saying I'm talking about I'm not talking about somebody I've been writing this movie for six months or whatever it's like I'm about to go block everything off and write this shit and no matter what anybody want to say about how good the movie was what the critics say anybody in this business if you can do something where it goes from a thought and it goes to paper and you can execute it how many motherfuckers can do that they don't do that people talk shit all the motherfucking time but then you say how many you got any can yo I'm write movies give me a script oh hold on hold on I'm almost 30 pages in you don't say yeah let me tell you that story I was a lot of that going on yeah I got it I got a great idea all right what is it I remember I was this was Chappelle's Show was poppin and Ludacris gave me a lesson out of nowhere I saw him in the airport and I was on ashy Larry ha I was a rich bitch man so I'm like this is rappers like we're even right so new recruits come air power yo Luda right you say what's up Ashley I said I said yo can the motherfucker get in the movie or something do you just answer my fucking again homie I like it a muffin get a movie or something and he looked at me Joe it was so cold he looked at me right in my face he said we looking for people with ideas and I looked him like well I have none right so I guess this is this conversation and it did when I'm telling you it was a lesson how the fuck you want extra somebody for something and you don't got shit to give them well here just a lot of guys in the beginning think that's how you do it that's naughty good when I was on HBO's two wires before they told me what time you said yo D can you give me the number to the wire I think I could do that shit this motherfucker thought that there was like a hotline from anybody from the streets you ever thought about being an actor you don't want to put those 10 years of getting rejected just call this number and we'll put you under way you know what gets me about acting knows when someone who's never acted before it goes in there and kills it you know like people who are like athletes in particular like rappers have done it like a lot of people have done it but some people singers lot of some people I believe that you have natural talents yeah I think some people have natural talents that person like you have a person is trained you have people that just are natural and if you think about it acting is just it's a plan make-believe so is just claim who play make-believe better is it a person that is it a person that for 12 years they've been studying in they went to the school or is it my father they got that one story that one character they can nail right or is it the case of there's some people that will do stand-up comedy for 30 years and they're never gonna be that funny or Dave could do it for a year and and kill you like Chappelle yeah oh yeah he's got that do this but Abdi no I'm saying like yeah there's some people that there is this a whole different animal and the reason why I say that you're a great comic how cuz I'm a so great coming you I consider you great comment I appreciate it and with that sit like out we do have egos like as much people talk about somebody and your smile you're like I'm great to a motherfucker but and I was like and I one day I was watching Dave on stage and I'm like what makes this motherfucker great and I think in my opinion what makes it great is like it's not too often that we have or opportunity to have a Muhammad Ali moment and when I say that me in a moment where you got to throw everything on the table this your integrity your moral beliefs what do I want to stand doing what do I want to stand for and that's how some people get it attached of course Muhammad Ali was the greatest but it wasn't just in the boxing ring what made him great is what he stood for and I think when I look at they shouldn't look at a stand-up and I look at his career and I say what made him great and as and as a person just in a belief it's going to give you their unfiltered truth and they own it and don't compromise and don't back down to anything well he understands what's important about stand-up especially the type of stand-up that he does he has a voice full freedom yep that's how you you I've heard you say shit on stage I'm like that way but must can fight that motherfucker got some suplex or something Hinata hit you like you know like in a certain part of your neck and your whole shit is fucked up you know but those are people only I told me I was started Tony Hinchcliffe yeah yeah yeah he was doing this joke about what's the card mother fucking pedophile dude Oh Jared from Subway another one he's a big actor big-time actor Spacey Crawford the bar dude Kevin Spacey yeah man Tony oh my god that bit is crazy that that bit and you know it for me that bit is so dope out like this I'm about to throw up ya know it's like this he won't stop yes he's owning it and I told him and it was just like I said I don't know there's a movement but I felt like I was recruited to four gang right yeah I saw him in the hall I was like yeah me enough Dave Chappelle was just talking about the brand of comedy that you have don't like state state truth yeah as as much as people fucking with us you know what you just say this one say that again it's a handful of muffles understated they're gonna stay to their truth and they're gonna be rewarded for that shit because the other shit is just bullshit man kind of I tell you what how the fuck is somebody gonna tell you what you think is funny as a comedian and you know you don't even know if you think it's funny while you're doing it on stage you're trying to make it funny so there's a lot of stuff that people hear maybe they only hear what no it's funny you know that's funny just don't know where the funny is sometimes you don't know what it is the rhythm of it because yeah I know you I don't know what your writing process is but what's yours mine is like it's a it's regular conversation like I have conversations with friends all day it's talking about pop I mean topical stuff and it's like you know people with such humors like you see the funny side anything like to digest it smiley it should help Cosby the smaller whatever the fuck whenever it is to all that shit you think something funny so I never try to sit down like I'm gonna write this perfect joke is usually something that comes in a casual conversation and it's those moments you know you tell somebody you like oh that's funny usually that's where I start my writing yeah if something connects with me like that and I just go and and book and believe in it and just force that shit door yeah once you get on that stage with that idea and you're you're in that moment and you have just like remember you know everybody understands the first time you're trying a new bit that's one of the weirdest moments ever everybody I'll take a chair that's one thing I'll say about you the times I've watched you that I call them pussy comics you know my folks just do a set like yo I'm fuck somebody after this shit right I'm just gonna stand outside of here could set good set good set then you got the muffins like no that was a thought from last week I got some more shit to talk about I got some moisture telling you and you push those do that shit you could go to sleep and you wake up and you can Indesit we know it works motherfucker oh no here comes my closer I'm saved my closer you really want to test about fucking nuts over with your punk-ass closer motherfucker hmm Oh what's your closer yeah and we'll see how much strip them other motherfuckin flip that shit up yeah come on fucker I call him the poop yes Proops but they they got scared and then they got better they got an act and then they got scared again never got rid of that act then they can't stand for the right motherfucker be in a room yeah I can't stab of like this oh that's what you did bruh guess what I'm doing imma flip a whole new set on your mother ass maybe I wanted to do a set maybe I'll just build some shit from this one motherfucker right here right not not a riff like your parents so tight but pull something from him and just turn this into a whole shit yeah and didn't that hard drive starts coming because you know we got millions of jokes that we never use they just get stored on our yeah like this people I just is that your first time would you come over there 15 years ago but the moment was now yeah yeah it's gonna go now you know yeah and that's it i'ma tell you I've been doing it for 25 years and after 25 years I can honestly say I feel like I get better every year me too I think the same thing that's somebody that's a Epirus yeah yeah me too and I think that a good sets and bad sets when you're working on new stuff but I think overall when I'm done after two years each two years is better than the two years before what I'm ready to film yeah I think that's what it's all about it's more if you're not out there if you're not all do create an intimate area where it's all to like that I'm great do another special who are you doing it for here's the tricky part I'm not on that might be on Netflix radar but I don't have a deal with them but I'm gonna not by myself but Dave Chappelle has gave me a verbal commitment that he's gonna produce my night special so with that said I don't have a home but I'm pretty sure the level I've been operating with my standard you know when you ready you know I'm saying it's like I just know it bro I just known I think the energy that I bring to a special right now and then the energy that he would bring to produced it for me it would just fucking blow up and this is not something like I'm not calling Dave up every day like dude you gotta do my special every time I work with him he was like you gotta let me do your special I'm like let's go motherfucker yeah so I feel good about that I don't I don't I'm not sanded and I in this place I'm in that place first thing I want to do is drop I put an hour of material that when it plays it could change my life I've been seeing you at the store man you're locked in you can tell you can tell you're doing a lot of sets yo yo yo I'm I want reps yeah what do you do Brock came first stay home forever EPS can ever never catch a motherfucker off god yeah I sometimes I'll do four sets in a night in LA I did I did and I was so proud of myself I got six sets in in the night in LA and I was so fucking happy because that's a normal night in New York yeah but in LA you got a plan that shit yeah you got a hit you got a hit sunset it's gotta be like boom I'm out but you feel like you feel like you just can do whatever you want cuz then you know if you starting off with something new on that first one you got four more the town of night is over you got that motherfucker yeah it's when you're doing reps the same night to when you hit that third set it's almost like you're in this weird flow state where there's no resistance between you and the ideas the material just comes out so loose and then you know the thing you do is it is one thing to have a joke anybody can not anybody write a joke and that's why you see some of this you could you just tell it dear good writer but it's nothing there's no performance of it you know saying there's no performance it brings you back to Brewer but Brewer wasn't just like funny writing he would get physically stretch his neck out man he would be shit man I'm telling you the Boston Comedy Club years ago Barry cats ran and owned it at the time and that was the premier showcase yeah so great that was it was running neck-and-neck with the economy seller Congress seller had the longest legs you know it's a tortoise in here yeah been forever but this spot and it was Jim Breuer it was on John and a brown boy Johnny yeah yeah yeah those two guys what is it and round boy something fat Johnny and round boy yeah they would demolish yeah yep one of the some idea and then you had a motherfucker seventy-year-old a round guy shelbs one of them driving around guys they all dad's now yeah but I'll get the name that was a time where comedy was on fire and Jim Breuer would demolish it James Moore you said demolish it it was a great spot it was one of those real small clubs like what did that see probably a hundred twenty-five hundred 30 but it was like it was old commie club by brick wall yeah tightness you know I'm saying that it reminds you of like red Johnny in the round guy right yeah red Johnny look at Jon Stewart look at those guys they were on TV they were a team they got on a pants we I don't know no my mum or pathetic you know who I used to follow at The Comedy Store that that also changed my life Martin Lawrence in the 90s before God you came out in the nineties Martin used to be the guy who had to go on after him it's he used to always stick me on after mark and I know he was an animal that I'm gonna tell you the first time I saw Martin Lawrence and it was kind of maybe interested in comedy I was in DC I was laying up in a bed with this chick and it spilled HP you know right yeah so boy Louis came out there they was like lady I give enough for Martin laws and he says look like two big ass is skinny motherfucker all his energy and this motherfucker open line he said give it up for a brother making money the right way he said will you make him money the right way you could tell your lady shit like shut the fuck you could tell your lady shall I shut the fuck up people's like woo woo woo and then he said he said after they said and shit shut up - he said she'll be like you so crazy like who has come on son the first sentence you like like boom yeah and he ripped this yes and if you was fucking with that shit that it was like it was everything Martin it was a good time he was going on stage with leather jumpsuits on and I was going on after him it was devastating well you know you already you've got to make it or made it if you going on with leather jumpsuits and you hit in comic well it was just people were getting up in droves by the time I would go on stage everybody just wanted out that was then that was and this is what I'll say the year was that 94 that was that was when that would that's when specials were really special right there was that many of them that was that's when it was it wasn't that many of the Union when HBO was it yeah a trio was it and that was one of those specials where like and as I'm saying with the next one I do you never complain stuff like that but the energy I want to have is energy and it's like this is going to change my life that was the energy and that's what you so crazy you could just fill it I can imagine when he was done with that everybody can live like this you know your life is about to change you know like yeah a Bernie Mac yeah with iron skillet you motherfuckers all-time classic that you know story behind it know the story behind it it was just comic from DC na butch burns but Brian was the DC legend right he was a senior guys all of us in DC Tony woods and and a little Joe rector he was he was he was just saying you got so a deaf champ nobody really knew what Def Jam is gonna be it was just a new show so butch burns had a set and he didn't do well he bombed like throwing chicken bones I'm not saying his cousin's black Ortiz I'm just saying they were store bottles on the stage they booed the shit out of this dude Martin couldn't contain the audience Martin couldn't do anything it was just one of the things you ever seen a room is so fucked up that can't anybody do anything and only thing you're saying stuff okay just let me go on so butch burns career was dead he's leaving going up backstage and he's talked to Bernie Mac Bernie Mac sit and listen and hold your head up he said the sun's not shining on you today but does shine on you again just hold your head up you'll be all right and next on deck was Bernie Mac with the audience that was uncontrollable Martin couldn't do anything it was just like this nigga you all right it was what a moment and and that's where the phrase I ain't scared of you motherfuckers came from that wasn't in his set it was a real motherfucking comic figuring out what he's gonna do in his moment and let me hear this let me hear this give me some volume in the beginning but now this is after her motherfuckers career was buried this is a Bernie Mac he came out of here before that and I think he thought he was dressed - oh yeah like a Steve Harvey suit on so he wanted appeal to youth a little bit more that's why you got a graffiti thing and he's backstage saying like this could change my career nothing my father's career it's over and this is a real community this first line out the motherfucking box I scared of you motherfuckers I'm coming from the foolishness and New York get dem in yo motherfucker women look good y'all like a bigger than eggs sounds look good I love sex I love keyboard yeah we're getting kicked off YouTube if we keep playing first yeah you know well Stan he called back man just now you see the emotion of it yeah it was like a guarantee the energy he wanted to have to rip was there but the story the back story it being in that moment and at the end of the day who gonna be prepared for those moments yo right motherfuckers that bill for that shit no more you gotta do raps you got to do rest they not built for it they got a motherfucking excuse for everything you ever go to a motherfucker room and they beat up my house the crowd motherfucker fuck the crowd how are you oh it was a crowd lave know you were lame bruh in a day job it's out motherfucking jobs I was going hard in the paint no I'm just saying it's our fucking job you're right and I've heard you in your podcast talk about no excuses and I feel like the things you say about noise yeah it's easy to make excuse but in the day it's an excuse yeah you got two excuses you got a good excuse and you got a bag school you know what you can have an explanation for failure with no excuse what do you mean we'd talk about how you failed and why you failed don't have an excuse but go I fucked up I came out I was flat I didn't come yeah I know what it was I fucked up and don't and don't use it like I say this girl sucked that's the wrong way to live at any time you at all say how were they no I never seen it how are you yeah because guess what we don't know what's gonna happen bro we don't know if that motherfucker in the front row is thinking about a funeral yeah yeah we don't know that but it's our job to like you know kind of going back to you said earlier in a sense we do we read people's minds through their body you can tell you can watch show you black bones she was so upset because I said you can just look at what you know you know the posture you know everything and then we feed off of that but who's gonna be fuckin ready for that and there's so many of these motherfuckers then atern I'm not going off but it just yeah yeah it's just frustrating when you see motherfuckers out here making excuses well it's not good for everybody that's around them that's also part of the problem see when a guy like you is around me or you know a guy like Tony Hinchcliffe or people who are just going forward who live in the comedy life like you're writing you're always writing new material that's it empowering I want to be around you I want to talk yeah be around a little fuck the talk buck you know be around motherfuckers they got more ball material than they got real mature yeah you know mumbles gotta oh don't you do I did my bomb set and they're waiting to just one job don't work be like all and didn't slide it to their bombers shit they bomb set don't have no bomb material who the fuck writes material to bomb in yo in case they throw tomatoes I got the old tomato bit my uncle grew tomatoes back that's why that's not gonna hurt me yeah go hard I go oh yeah it's a ridiculous idea to have a set that you do in the audience is shitty I mean you well you do you know we got you got search it if something come your way you can bounce up but I'm somebody's mother was actually right yeah let's relax like have in the event that I bomb is gonna go that way but then they're bombing bits and I and I just like I'm a person that just loves doing it love getting better I tell people all the time if you like any of the things that I've done where there was hbo's two-wire Chapelle show and other stuff if you come see me do stand-up you'll become a complete fan because like you said earlier that's the one thing that we control we don't have to have audition for that shit we don't have the motherfucker get tested for it you know I'm saying like oh I made it to the test that we don't have to fucking we don't have to pitch it and you know it's a good thing and they say fuck you anyway you can't fuck with us with it it's like that's what we are the executive producer to producer we the the line producer we everything and you can't do it it's us in a motherfucking mic and at the end of the day no matter what success I feel Joe we get with this whatever level I mean your biggest shit you you hit it you know where this TV or movies nothing is gonna ever be able to take away from you being a flat mother flat-footed motherfuckers they can stand in audience and you've built your stand-up name enough where for the most part of rest of your life you'll be able to create a good living off of your name off of doing stand-up Hollywood don't have to call yeah that's that's big to but if you respect what it is that you have a relationship with those people you have to write for them you have to work on your stuff you have to be diligent you have to be you have to have an ethic about it yeah you don't want to rip anybody off you want them to see a great show you want to do your best you want do your best I feel bit and it's so we're you know how we are I could do it I could do a show comedy clubs like 500 people 498 motherfuckers I'm destroy and is to motherfuckas not filling me and I need to get their undivided tits like I don't even hear the laughter I'm like you don't fucking like me no let's talk about it you know is the worst at that Nick DiPaolo well he'll go at 1% so bad one Percy someone like this the whole rest of the audience is dying it's someone's given in the stink I was like what's your fucking problem yeah you can't you just like that and it's like and you and you won't stop into that person doesn't have a problem with a or a leaf yeah that's a weird thing man I'm just got undivided attention you get committed to wanting everybody to love you you can't that's impossible there's also people that will fuck with you for extra attention yeah you know they want you to look at them their arms crossed because they need attention did that the same people that protest shit or it doesn't really necessarily make sense they spend so much time and effort that's where things let me it's it's so funny you said about protest because last couple years Connie has been interested there's a lot of people then are fans of Donald Trump a lot of people that aren't fans of Donald Trump and I think it's Patti for you to be upset with anybody because they chose to vote forever they chose to vote for I think a stupid shit but I will say this past election was interesting in the sense that a lot of people were upset black people were upset the last election women were upset gay people were upset but white people were really upset like white people were the angriest and white people did not protest they voted black people is like black lives matter white people's like we'll see about that in the morning and whenever you hear someone says we'll see about it in the morning it's going to be some change it's going to be some change in my comedy I don't think Conor should be a place where people exercise anger or be angry how so in what way they don't like being mad like when Donald Trump first got elected you know personally like it was very interesting and that's seen a lot of comics they could just go up there and be like fuck Donald Trump and just right you know you could find a way to say fuck Donald Trump or anybody but it doesn't have to be fueled with any anger yeah you don't say it doesn't have to be fueled like fuck you'd be like this fuck him okay why why do you say that why do you say fuck and then now the reason but I just don't think that people should be angry about how do you feel about it's just I think it's for that when politics make people angry it's pop it's contrary to what you're saying was great about Chapelle show that the comedy came without being angry right but it made great points but even anybody on both sides could laugh at it yeah yeah the thing about Trump that's it's interesting it's like the job shouldn't exist the job of what president yes shouldn't exist it's a ridiculous idea to have 300 million people under the guidance of one that's insane and that listens that one wins in a popularity contest that's insane right it's fucking insane it doesn't make sense it was it was a great idea back when there were pilgrims it was a small colony and they just came over on a boat forget it forget about the rest that shit there's too many humans right so when you let a guy like that like try to be President no you're not gonna be happy no one's gonna be happy but you're not gonna be happy if anybody wins it's it's it's untenable look at Obama Obama aged like how many years in eight years yeah you looked at age 20 laws it's like - Ted Danson effect once chairs got canceled who the fuck is that you're the first time you saw Ted Danson I'm not talking about years after chairs like after Fred you like goddamn stop dyeing his hair yeah yeah yeah man is there something about Trump before that that people enjoyed he was in a lot of rap lyrics meant he was like the alt people would probably still be him if he was a rappers too right now it'd be different he's still be popular people wrapped the bottom like that lifestyle but if thing was big to this Matos the thing was because you thought you knew a person you thought you knew him but even when he got elected I think a lot of people thought they knew him right they thought they knew him they thought the image like you're gonna be the billion guy billion dollar playboy guy forever but you thought you knew him but then when you got to know him you start to think well maybe I didn't know him when you got to see him as president yeah yeah I don't think and the evenness and even as much as even how he got elected people upset about it but I think a lot of people somebody like did you know what maybe all of that shit was just to get elected maybe that energy was to get elected and if that was the case that he mastered it he'd mask how to get connected with his base he Manson met he mastered how to get not everybody to fuck with you but just the right amount of people yeah he looked at numbers he wasn't about them it was a popularity contest but it's also new like these people I got a hit any any figure that out well there's like at some point Joe people were like hi okay it's over now let's see who you really are and I think it's so many examples of when you felt like he could have showed people example example that he saw everybody right opposed to Joe's just his base right and I think that's what getting people a lot of what but make people frustrated he gives an impression that you know I only care about these people that elected me you won right but you have responsibility to everybody and it's just don't have that fill and even though my social media I don't go hard I keep it kind of neutral but I said something and somebody said well the last time I checked Darnell the economy was doing well and I said you can't confuse the economy with humanity and that's the thing and that's what that's what people don't feel good about you can toute all the numbers you could talk all the numbers you want black unemployment all the numbers all the numbers but how do people feel you know I'm saying they represented they don't feel don't they don't feel represented don't they don't feel like I could rock either way bruh Democrat Republican I make enough money where a lot of the views of Republicans like yo that's right up my house again you don't say but at the same time it's the it's the it may not sound right to a lot of people but it's the human factor of it you know saying like you want to feel good Brian he wanted you you you want so many people don't know the economy is doing well because they don't feel good right you don't say you want to celebrate you want to cheer you want to feel good about it and that's the whole thing anything I believe when Obama ran like his campaign was changed Donald Trump would make America great again either one of them could have ran off each other's campaign slogan do you know after Bush Obama could have said make America great again and it would Electrify database the same exchange true they said the same fuckin thing that would be the great thing for Obama right after birth and I'm gonna tell you the one thing that kind of I don't insulting or or get people have said it's like you keep pushing a narrative make America great again make America great again you keep pushing it as if America was so fucked up before you took office and that's not the case right like when when when Obama took it from Bush he was making America great again you talking about a shit show and the thing that people if we're however you took it respect it or not it was never nothing laced with egg it was never it wasn't no yo you see this mess Bush left me it was never like ah this motherfucker it was never no mention do you see that new movie about Bush do you see it I didn't see it either what's it called Jimmy is it out of ight the one with Vice yes vice yeah but Dick Cheney and George Bush oh you whatever think about the movie ball get shot in the face because that's the only thing I would see well the the thing about Bush and Cheney is like that movie kind of makes it seem like Cheney was the guy pulling the strings and Bush was just like simple happy-go-lucky guy who they just roped into being president because he was the son of a president that's that far-fetched though it's not far-fetched at all that it's not at all not even remotely I think I actually agree with it but I think about Bush now I don't think about him in a negative way but I think about Cheney in a negative way really yeah yeah yeah I think about I think about Halliburton I think about all the the rebuilding of the places that we blew up like all the crazy dick trying to come from no-bid contracts that are worth billions of dollars to me you know it's just she said it about the bush because if I had I know it may sound crazy if I had to have a pic of who I wanted to be the Republican candidate it was on the Republican side was on I like Jeb Bush I didn't really get to know him at all that's it there was something that I don't know that I don't know too much but I just I just thought did he he was like kind of like mama's boy I think he probably out of all the kids I probably think that he probably was the one that thought a little outside of what their normal I think he was a successful businessman Latino chick if I'm not mistaken I don't know I just I don't know but but Bush I mean Trump fucked them up with just nicknames like you want to lay down ya know like Jeb wanted to lay down I really do I felt truck put all of motherfucks J's like hey you were saving to you got your nickname yeah yeah once you got lion yeah like a rap artist ya know it was a smart thing he did that no one's ever done before nobody there's a lot of things and even like even when I'm even when Obama got elected do you know what he got Obama elected was fuckin on Facebook and $5 contributions $5 donations he was when he was when Obama was running that he was the first person to use Facebook the way he did really oh man they have so many every goddamn day it was Obama X he wouldn't act for like millions he was just like like a dude in the hood yo let me hold fire on us right like how we get an email hey this is Morocco Obama yo let me hold $10 right and I guess and I was like yeah go $10 and then a week later he x4 fucking $20 and then he whacks 410 again and then he got so bad then he Michelle would send me an email but he just he'd nickeled and dimed america and that's what supported his campaign and in fact that he was at right at the turn of a form of media that you can use to your advantage he was the Facebook guy he reached me but the Facebook Donald Trump is doing the same thing through Twitter I can reach people why does he tweet so much why does he tweet so much every day cuz he knows motherfuckers would rather pick up a phone and retreat didn't read a newspaper 100% fuckin all I need is headlines yeah way more people reading tweets versus newspapers write every stunned like if you could get seed that exact engagement in a good article in The New York Times on the front page first is one of Donald Trump's tweets like you know the only two people that motherfuckers are just waiting for their tweets come on Donald Trump to Kanye West yeah those are two most interested tweet people Calle West could just say grapefruit juice and fuck up all of the media to next day what do you think he meant do you think he maybe was hungry or he was thirsty Kanye just tweeted grapefruit juice one of the most one of the most interested tweeters out there yeah you wait for a Kanye West tweet well he's got a free way of expressing himself like he has an unfiltered way of expressing so and a lot of people people have mixed feelings about it yeah that's abuse I know black community is a little stressed out right now well because of his Trump thing but you know what I don't know how much of that it is - there's two things one Obama called my jackass back away on you that's stung a little bit yeah you know and then Obama when Obama's gone Trump takes office Trump is willing to let him talk Trump Trump old charm him and here's the thing Joe with that said like when I do white clothes black clubs whatever do all type of clubs but the thing is you you you first off Kanye West has a voice not too many as much as black people on the throat Allen oh no we don't have too many voices that everybody is waiting here weather whatever comes out he has a voice I believe that Kanye West is trying to say something I just don't know what the fuck he's trying to say because I'm not fluent and easy easy I think he's trying to say something but if there was some type of interpreter you know this would be a dope Chapelle show was right now there'll be a dope ass skin Kayne way says something Dave Chappelle is his conscious interpreter that would be hilarious did Dave yells up you know what I think and this not only talked to him once on the phone but what I think from studying him and pay attention because we're supposed to eventually do a podcast one day yeah is I think he's uh he's thinks different he does he connects dots different and that's one of the reasons why he's so prolific with music that's what I'm trying I'm making that and that's the point I'm saying about not speaking easy but here's some people did think like that they don't know how to get it out it's like this to speak you like my father you know how hard that was for the black community here fuck you can sell them a plane all you want but what you're saying you'd like my father it didn't black people sit back like could you please explain that so we think then did this was funny to me they kind of said yeah you're like like father figure to me like when I was younger I thought he was career hit me would do horrific you know father and shootout a drive-by and this will fuck me up brah he said yeah when I was younger my parents separated at a young age first off you had parents you already winning motherfucker none of my niggas my mother and my father okay okay come on for his money in pairs basically my parents separate I mean they were married that's two wins you up to before you even get to and they separate it in mom move down the street you still got to see your fucking father so that was a little troubling but the whole thing is I'm pretty sure at some point Kanye West will be able to speak a language that everybody can understand until then it's only half full of people to speak and understand it and also right but here's my problem with all this and I've been thinking about this a lot they want to medicate him right yeah look how effective he is just stop just stop and think about culturally effective in terms of the music that he makes it people love yeah his voice yeah he creates clothes okay he's married his conversation and dialogue too he does his wife makes hundreds of millions of dollars they're insanely wealthy insanely successful if you want to talk about overall success they're together they have children they're super wealthy he produces incredible art that's loved worldwide and they want to medicate him just stop and think about how effective but I want to medicate what they want to medicate him to operate at what level exactly I think about how effective he is and yet they wanted one medication off off when he's off medication he said himself ease is most creative stop and think about how creative he's been how successfully is how well received yeah happy and all these other elements in his life but yet they want him to act the way they want him to act and to take the head off you know I mean whatever bra you can say well - fuck you what the black Pete wasn't mad cause he wore a hat it was mad cuz it wasn't a fitted for a new era if that was a new era they would have been more accepting of it man we just know what that sign it's red and white now that but that's a problem anything with red with white letters showing it's not you know I'm telling you it's like when I see is so funny man whenever I see a red head I'm like oh like I'm immediately but I did a show upstate New York it was is why do came up to me I have to show and he didn't have what looked like I'm making America great and hit he had I make America great again it and it looked like he had the original one you know Boston fan do you like you only bit of saying great before like he probably sold the hashtag to the table but here's the thing Joe this month I had to had on this shit and I at the end of the show he was one of the dudes that was continued to laughing the most you know and I went up to him and I was like you I got to get a picture with you and I took the picture it was a video I was like yeah motherfucker y'all see his head and he started laughing and we had a good moment it wasn't no I wasn't angry him I'm not gonna let think it's hard to get away from it but think what Kanye would they had he likes the idea of how it gets people flustered you know Terry in a lot of ways best was triggered right yeah one of them was yeah um excuse me it's alright yeah no but I'm say is like triggered like even and I when I when a guy had the head on and I was talking to I heard in the side he was like this oh he's triggered and I wasn't I wasn't reading about it when I was tricked what I would've been triggered by is how you make me feel with that hat no period period you know you can come at me like you could come at me with the head on with some fucked-up energy and I could fill it but the energy he gave me was like I notice may sound crazy was like yo you're funny mother fuck with the hat on you're like okay I didn't get the fuck right because I couldn't let him I couldn't let him right make me feel like if that's what his intent was he's gonna make me feel uncomfortable I couldn't do it he think he was trying to make you feel god I think he's really that's who he was I think that's what he was I think that's what it was but I know that my fuck would laugh like a motherfucker so at a comedy club that's all you can ask for so you could what since all you want yeah that's how you can want yeah now you got the right perspective man looking at all the right way I love it man it's like at the end of the day you got good people and you got bad people and it's who do you choose to be yeah you want to be on the good side of the best and it's easy man it's it's I know it sound corny Rodney King said can we all just kill on we all could get along if my fuckers just remove the hate yeah well you know who I always look at it we can get along the three of us in this room there are no problems so when we people expand out what goes wrong like what something goes wrong when you get to like three million what is it three million it was just humans as people expand out you get a couple of people together and most people could be fine together most people the vast majority it's when you get to large numbers it gets fucked up it gets fucked up it's almost like people are supposed to live in small towns you know with a bunch of cool be like small town with a bunch of assholes would suck towns with all how about if we lived in a small town with all comedians right now I would be a if I live in a small town right now I would be a grandfather you think so 100% what are you doing small towns you think again fucker babies yeah but I mean a small town a community let me say filled with comedians we worked it would be a lot of murders y'all comedians will actually kill each other man I can't even like I can't it's only a certain amount communes I could be around at one time cuz dynastar gets you know these motherfuckers jockeying for the best job there's some other like but there's some that lay back in there laughs and snipers was a good sniper this night but they got their breathing pattern right yeah they know when you pull that trigger you're supposed to shock you it was like you every time yeah they don't throw any loose bombs none of that shit the thing yeah that's a good way that's a very personal fucker grunts to go out there yeah I was military for four years we really yeah we n yeah I was a word I was a cop in the military really nobody believes I was a worst cop ever I made one arrest in four years and I was cuz a girl came through the gate she had some big titties and I decided that I needed to pull her over but I was the worst fucking cop and I had to get out of military cuz I used to hear this phrase all the time airman Rollins your blatant disregard for established military policy shows a lack of military bearing and integrity I did hear that I was like these mother was gonna gonna kick me out F was four years I was cop station to kun-sun career station and bowling and UI Co Tong sang Yoon SEO noona hey go they got Tokyo so Wow um four years military three years to two years in Korea two years at Boeing Air Force Base and I got out and just randomly went to a comedy club became a heckler I was asshole I just got his comedy club everywhere is he to fuck with the comedian's where was it commie connection the green belt it was like the black comedy club in DC this was a time of when Martin Lawrence's on fired FG everything was popping in and they had on black comedy clubs it would be a it would be a pizza shop they'll just turn okay now and it's a comedy club Monique had a club that she made turn from a restaurant to a comedy club just because she got more business on a weekend as a comedy club in restaurant and it took it over and I used to go head to the comedian's and I I was such a good heckler that people used to come to the show to hear me echo they would be at the door like yo is that asshole do gonna be here tonight and that was me the club owner dared me to go on stage because they want shut me up Joe I was so cocky after four weeks of heckling I tried to make a deal with the club owner come on I do I swear I know I'm telling you I said I know I've increased business by 30% we didn't start working on the door there he looked about what the fuck are you talk about anybody to tell you the story and I want to be shut up they asked me to go on stage and I went on stage and the first time I went on I've murdered the shit and I knew that I wasn't gonna be doing anything else with my life but doing it I just knew him it was just like all like how did it feel it felt great do you remember it I remember if he watches in your mind I remember it because I talked so much shit to this point anything about it was but the room of the energy the energy of the room was there because there was a lot of people that came they saw me they were like like when you go-go it you should you know they were like you should try you should try so the first time I went out people were excited about it they didn't know what to expect and I've wrote all these jokes I'm like I got I got 30 minutes I was like I was so cocky we said open mic you know of Mike Bliss is like 30 people and I would be like 10 on the list and they would keep bumping me and I thought they were just trying to save me the headline I didn't think they were just trying to give me the shittiest spot but half the club came to see me so they would stay there and that first time I went on I had all these jokes I planned I was going to do and when I went on stage I drew a complete blank I don't remember shit and then I went what I knew best I started fucking some minor audience I got a laugh I did I did my material and I've I didn't know what the light was they gave me the light and I was like oh I gotta go like you know like means just make the last joke right and I got off abruptly they us I said I gotta go and people started booing the host went up and it was I know Daniel he doesn't know he's new was his first time he don't know what to like me he'll be David's like he'll be back and I'm I was there almost every Wednesday for eight months and then I moved to knit I moved to New York at six months Wow said ahmadiya where'd you go first club was yeah I live either one Brooklyn Brooklyn you know it was a bet that's what I loves but Brooke it was interested me because I didn't go from from DC to like mainstream white clothes I was doing still to get over a shit and a lot of times I couldn't get spots so I would go to a I will go to poetry open mics cuz actually just be so dull the water was shifting the wave wave and I've liked it everybody went break for the shit right and then I will go do jokes when I couldn't do count because I would do that so I started making a name for myself and never looked back it was dope New York is a great place to get your chops up what year do you enter New York it had to be probably like 95 pray like 95 yeah I had already moved I'd gone I left in 94 to come to LA oh yeah when did you get out here I got out here like seven years ago maybe eight years ago and it was because my message was different because I wasn't getting a lot of road work and I was like well fuck I'm not giving our road work I might as well try to get more film and television stuff to move out to LA and they want to move around here I um started getting more personal appearances so basically I moved to LA and became a road comic and I wasn't mad at it because after you tone it for a while you just wanted where the fucking I could make money doing this shit you know saying I just the road is the road you know I mean if it's Hollywood its Hollywood but who was gonna pay me some money and it was the road and it took now like I do 40 weekends a year but with me having a a young kid now I'm trying to focus more in film and television and get some more stable shit cuz I'm getting a little you know skin burn I hate to say this cuz I've said it too many times be she should have a podcast I've heard it do that started a thousand podcasts I need to start yours I'm with it

from your iPhone or whatever phone you use you put a little microphone in the bottom of it do I do it and another reason why because I always want to talk yeah I'm sure fun I get it but you've been in the game for a while nine years damn almost ten but you were you can see yourself pioneer know there's people before me for sure I was just one of the early adopters I'd say a early adopter but it was early established Adam Curie had one I think he's he invented the name podcast and then Adam Carolla went from radio to podcast and that's when I was like oh oh wait a minute was he a radio personality before he was doing the man show yeah no no he did the man show and they did well he was a radio personality first they did the man show and I think he did radio during the same time as Loveline yeah during the same time and then after that he had a big-time syndicated morning radio show and I did his radio show a couple times and then when he left his radio show and went to podcasts he got this professional studio built and everything and I went to visit him and I was like whoa and I remember walking around the place going look at this shit got a wolf and not a wolf from here from London yo what is that a point what is that what is that call right there that's an elk elk yeah one of the people that um that um that make that what are the cause of profession taxidermy but telling when they put like the fake when the hairs are over at the fake eyeballs and check is that yours that's mine yeah that's actual real skull damn that's what they call European mount when they

the way he feeds himself because he's still gonna have a base the base is my half was like the motherfuckers belied it fucking I woulda did the same thing oh that's not a good group of people you said is that it might not be a good group of people the way you think it but for him it's a group of people right it's gonna be still some people that want to hear his side of the story everybody's not everybody's not like dismissive of them right itself people still hold on to like well maybe some people that just gonna you know like I refuse to believe it right point-blank well he's still denying it he's saying they're lying yes the latest thing but you know I don't know maybe on it doesn't look good I don't know don't do this was in the down on darling I think something else was going on breath I think something did I think he was I think he was possibly paying them for something else would it be not just thank you guys I don't know yeah yeah yeah if she's sorry it's so fucked up bruh because you have like it's so fucked live up my older brother is gay and like with that situation it kind of rung home to me cuz that when it first was pronounced like this I was the fuck some I would try to violate my brother would disrespect my brother I know how it honors I'll be ready to go so I had and that's what's so fun about oh shit he has so many people there was Ryan for him for different reasons man and it's like really selfish for you to not give a fuck about how you gonna hurt people you know maybe he didn't realize how bad it would go wrong maybe my bra come on gates what you said when you're when you're saying throwing fucking bleach on me mag you trying to you trying to trick her motherfuck yeah cheng'er fuck for Albus I didn't say he was a gay Tupac he said that ain't no killer but don't push me revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting well he didn't say the pussy that's hilarious he said that he was too gay he already had his movie in his head that sorry I fought back I'm the gay to PI here we had his hashtag you probably bought the white website Tracy I don't want to stop this podcast but I gotta pee so bad I did two podcast in a row so talk to Jamie for just two minutes yeah yeah yeah I'll be right back so bad I'm mad at you go right there yes look just know you know you la it's like this is this an indica sativa there is some extra spice in there too there's a little extra like I think it's called butter butter that's like wax what yeah it's a little bit it you can't really tell it to be honest with you that's our white boy just half the ear you'll be okay how many people still come up to you about the wire I know that obviously Chappelle's Show but no different about the people who come up to me why I did identify by themselves as instant intellects yeah you don't say like people in else they'll they'll it's almost like they're cocky like I know you wanna put on a couple other things but you know I really love you from the wire that was a dope experience did you ever watch HBO's the corner I started I started I think I got I feel like it was six episodes and I watched it I was a net okay I played a heroin addict and that and um a lot of people don't know people are offense if you were a fan of the Y you definitely been a fan of the corner because so many of the actors came back to you after I watched the wire I wanted more and more content like that and so I went back and tried to watch it but I just I actually enjoyed rewatching the wire more I watch I like to show and I was supposed to my character was supposed to UM build up more but the Baltimore Tourism Board was upset that every time someone goes shooting bald somebody depicted as a a drug-infested pretty much what it is so that's why they went from the if you noticed the shift in the writing they went from the towers to the docks like how to Friday we get to the docks go that's because they didn't just want to be in the hood like that but David Simon he was a he was like yo I liked you you know what you did so they brought me back for the last for the last season I've tried to get Joe to watch it but it's it's like it's ten years old now so it's right back into an old show yeah but it's so good so many people people like they were like definitely wire fanatics and when they brought me back to last season I was nervous because HBO - last season any sean HBO - writers get vindictive and they do nasty shit to the characters like the last season the odds it was dudes getting raped on Caza went even on odds there was like dude I'm on Nickelodeon I'm just trying to get to the bathroom it but they was right to me I didn't get raped the last season and it was fun I got it I know I gotta settle down and choose it for a run yeah get in and it's still at sea you just gotta watch it because it's so good his character comes up at like the best time and he's not - spoiler alert it but like the follow the money starts with him and like that's a you know that my role would have been like if they didn't switch to tone if they would have kept it in the towers my shivers because I was the connection between the streets and the politics I know I could have blown a carrot I'll and when I first got busted when I was in the room I was trying to I was gonna rob the mansion and we'll tell you - he said what's your name I said my name is um day-day my name is day day but they mostly call me um Damian right and then he said my name is Daniel and they mostly call me lieutenant and this is after I had already said how old robbed a whole career because I thought he was a driver with me and that character should have been all Landen but so so it was a good opportunity there was another cool platform it was though I cannot say whatever happens in my career I was on two shows they'll go down in television history the wires yeah I believe you about the wire I mean everybody said it I just I never settled down and watched it but for sure the Chappelle show is the greatest sketch comedy it's it's one number one in number two is like that and in living color and you could pick your spot depending upon when you grew up and what it meant to you because for a lot of people in living color to because it was on Fox you didn't have to have cable to get it it was on Fox wouldn't have to have cable Fox no Fox was regular TV right but then it was like it was new to because it was for the most part of all black cast all black cast yes dancers it was Jennifer Lopez everybody was making money again ass when I was up I don't live the ways I think it was a Shawn was a DJ how many think he knew how to DJ but Keenan had that fucking vision man yeah he had that vision who's like I know seasons that go oh no probably six didn't really go that man yeah it was dumb that was the show every comedian hoped that they would every year they would come around say they're looking for new people for a liver color in every city was like just busting doors down and trying to get audition Wow I remember Washington for the first time I was at a pool hall and like Yonkers New York and I looked up at the screen me and a buddy of mine my friend John Tobin we're playing pool and we're watching this Charles like what in the fuck do we do with no lips when fire marshal bill came out was like God the fuck John Kerry was I was an animal man he was again like like once you saw him you just start laughing yeah he was an animal I mean how many times what do we have now homey the clown clown home we don't play that girls were always good Paul Mooney um wrote the home in Concord really yeah did he yep that's hilarious it was groundbreaking it was Wanda Wow but look at that funny right let's talk about um know before career that motherfuck Jamie flower go for that - Oscar that motherfucker could do anything did he do anything and sing yeah we've talked about it before he's got that weird he's got that weird ability to do anything like when Mike Tyson was talking about Jamie playing him you know he was he apparently is Oh kill him he's gonna kill it it's gonna kill him he could do anything he can swing he's got great stories man I'm on the podcast a great great stone he's just a good guy any time I've ran into any time I've talked to him he's always been a really cool do a good doom yeah he's very friendly last time I saw was at a gas station he's got some crazy fucking truck some weird thing I was like what is that I never even saw one of those before I don't know what it is I think you got a whole bunch of what you've never seen before as you know like what is it oh that was it something new some new custom-made weird fucking truck right looks like something from the future does he drive it or just he was driving it yeah yeah he was yeah good dude he never do I think he's doing more stand-up again our he's doing more stand-up but you know how do you that's a tough thing to do too probably to get that level as an International a list superstar to still have the passion to do stand-up right you gotta want it you don't want to do it for some strange reason motherfuckers peers in your group no I still got it motherfucker you know who did who did you see that thing it was about maybe a year or so ago right when Bill Cosby was in the heat of all his trouble where Eddie Murphy did some stand-up on a dais like in front of a platform that was for it was an award he got at the Kennedy Center it was some type of cultural show I can't remember exactly name of it but I remember I think Dave was a part of that too that was a big deal but the what got me was how good he was I had a goddamn he's good he's a community you know even though he's not using the stage platform you know he sits around or is like oh shit yeah that would be funny of course you know I mean he had this whole routine about them taking Bill Cosby's Doctorate degree away from him he had this whole bit about it when he was doing a Bill Cosby impression why he's doing it man I'm telling you man because the timing was that wasn't so good to see him do it to you that's what I'm thinking his is it was so powerful I was like god damn we missed out on years of this year yeah you like what would he talk about he's like probably close to being a great night you can't play a little bit I don't know maybe it's only a minute long just give me a little bit just give me a little bit okay so here goes bill has one of these it says the young make bill give his back you know when she did the trophy dude I'm telling you when you watch him do this this routine you go oh my god he's still got it it's like a motherfucking Murphy I know but he hasn't done any stand-up in forever and it was like he's been doing it every day yeah but you got a look at him when he came on like certain people to just Naturals bro but it's so sad that he hasn't been doing it man when you stop and think go from raw you know delirious to raw to nothing for all these years and he might be if he's not but I wouldn't say nothing international movie star you know but not you mean for sure nothing his terms of his do it standing that's all I mean yeah of course man he's an international movie star but he could have been one of the greatest of all time if he isn't already I mean he is already did you have my top ten you got to kind of put Eddie Murphy in there of course but he could be number one ever yeah if he just kept doing it but he made his money it would just be interesting but he made his market nobody was fucking doing it like we got big names and stuff now but Eddie Murphy was just like everybody was talking about him like his special job the next day everybody was quoting lines from it I was I watched it with my friend Jimmy and with a bunch of his friends and we were probably like eighteen or something like that like maybe raw 1718 delirious so--but I remember we were just like everyone was stunned like we were just everyone was sitting back on the couch going that was a crowd of boys Clay had energy yeah Dice Clay head I was like what you said when specials were really specialty it wasn't very many of them it was a couple of them Indian whoever that person was you you knew you were gonna see them on TV or somewhere fried the next two years easy dude I found out about Kennison from a girl that worked the front desk at a health club that it worked out I used to work at this novel say what the fuck was he doing to me I worked at this Nautilus plus and Revere uh was a Revere Massachusetts like this Fitness place now that wasn't Nautilus past that was that was above fucking goddamn a Boston Athletic Club in South Boston that's where it was anyway there's a girl worked the front desk she goes I saw this comedian last night you got a fucking see him was the most amazing comedian he did this joke about gay people fucking dead people yo no I don't know that but just sentence is 20 years old what's that death sentence of 20 years just said he did his bit about gay people fuck us all so yeah motherfuck couldn't even probably try to think about saying that on stage now bride it'd be a rough road but the way he said it the way Kinnison said it you know yeah yeah I went and got it on VHS after that to watch it it was no but she was lying on her stomach in the parking lot to pretend to be a dead body because what had happened was he's homosexual McInnis had bit these homosexual necrophiliacs were paying money to have a little bit of time undisturbed at the freshest male corpse so Kenneth said lies down on stage and he's going you imagine that undisturbed he's lying down on stage he's like wow I can't believe this I guess I'm gonna go to heaven now and be with Jesus and never end never so I'm watching this girl who's like this volleyball players big athletic girl deficit she's got her body down on the ground and she's yelling out oh don't read the back she's like life keeps fucking in the ass even after you're dead it never ends and I was laughing so hard funny at what she was saying I went out and got the VHS tape did it meet just that did you did you did you like blown away I was blown away I couldn't believe it yeah energy man is a different kind of comedy yeah it didn't like you think he was really loud but then he was loud but he was saying shit just like that bit you know how your prey has to be to even think of that shit do you know he shared something with Roseanne Barr brain injury really brain injury personality changing brain injury both of em ours both of them were hit by cuz that's how it happened both of them yeah same thing I mean don't hit your kid with a car and hope they turn out to be a community you don't think you're funny with roseanne she was in a mental institute for nine months you know and with Kinnison they said there was an abrupt change between who he was and who he became he got hit by that car and then from then on he was this wild reckless don't give a fuck guy in this ranting raging preacher but it turned out to be good for him oh yeah the dark side the docs artists and from Roseanne that's good for her too you know and then you might be done now we haven't heard how was that show don't have spin-off is it doing good I don't think it's doing that good I think it's dropping off Roseanne is in my opinion like having a person with a broken leg and expecting them to kept keep up on a hike she's got a she's got brain issues she's heavily medicated and you know adderall and marijuana and all these different things there's a lot of shit that's fucking with her head you know and they they kind of knew that when they were making that show I really think they did I really think they knew that but they'll roll the dice yeah but it's also one of those things were like there's lovable parts about that show because of the fact that she's kind of loony you know and she's self-admittedly loony and self-admitted yeah it's right man the most interested person is a train wreck it's true the most a person to watch somebody you think you could probably do better or smarter dinner is also that we'd like when successful people have a giant major flaw like a brain injury with it makes them ramble about shit no brainer yes okay here comes a new look the needle comes out of shit like well for Kinnison like Kinnison was it he was a groundbreaking comedian like when I remember seeing him and obviously I was only like 18 or 19 at the time but I remember seeing him being like oh I didn't even know that this was comedy I didn't know you could play that it was a totally different yeah he didn't give a shit he did a show where he would call up heat out of a phone he would ask some guy in the audience if your heart was ever broken by a girl and the guy would say me what happened tell me what happened but and he goes well she fucked my friend she left me he's like goddammit give me this bitch's number I mean we get on the stage hey hey Marcy yeah I'm here your ex-boyfriend Tom this is Sam fuck if Katie said that we're gonna fall it would scream at this Layton they had her over speaker she's like what his telephone it was chaos oh man I would love to see that man if I saw that working I was working as a security guard a great wood Center for the Performing Arts oh I got to see it while I paid for it there once I got to see it yeah I got to see him live three times I didn't see the special but I saw him perform like at the Comedy Store or something no no no is it a big-ass amphitheater if you imagine how it felt to see don't work the o.r oh my god you know motherfuckers might be out in the hallway and shit trying to peek in yeah that roasts are getting tight as a motherfucker he was so powerful and funny-looking you know like everything about him the beret and the fucking homily I don't say this set the standards but it was like everybody wanted me the loud loud fat guy with the crazy hair yeah there was a little bit of that after that he opened up a door for something that people loved they loved there's something about him that was like you knew that he was like genetically fucked you know it wasn't it wasn't a good specimen of manhood but he was angry and smart and confident and fucking atrocious and he would talk about all that and he make it you know as a part of the fact that it was physically vulnerable was part of what what made him funny and he was just off the chain yeah with the fine things about he had some hilarious bits about being married about the devil coming up to when you're married up oh you've been married oh no this is gonna be scary for you I go here's where we torch this song he had this shit where he's like he goes look at my face look at my face oh he goes I've been married twice and you can't even try what his jokes without doing his voice now you can tie so you can do Seinfeld and you kind of hear somebody do they voice even yell a little bit like all right calm down Simkins exactly yeah he had some he had some groundbreaking shit where you you watch it you it was old like you were on a ride like all the sudden there was this new thing going on was this I started my life I don't think so no I don't think so do a toilet shut up he would have they banned him from a lot of things by the time he got to a certain stage in his comedy career there was certain certain subjects and certainly his bit about AIDS it was so he goes everybody says aids shouldn't make fun of eight Sam it's communicable disease he'll straight people get it to you dance and I remember hearing that going whoa whoa fuck you it's not our dance I'm like oh my god and there was certain bits like that where people like Cott offense yeah right now it would be like comedy police yeah everywhere I mean so much of his bits were punching down it was an argument that I got in with a guy who wrote a book on comedy and he was telling me that comedy always has to punch up and I said no it doesn't that's crazy I go Sam Kinison had one of the greatest bits of all time two of the greatest bits of all time one there was a dude who's getting fucked in the ass after he was dead that nominated it made that one of all times but go ahead and then the other one was the bit about watching someone oh this one burnt a loss of last year and the other one was a bit about us watching a commercial - will you please donate money to feed the starving children in Africa and he's saying it just occurred to us you know like there wouldn't be world hunger a few people would move where the food is this horrible fucking joke and there's a source punching down of all time he's making fun of starving children and it's so good it's just an observation I call an observation hit and he's like he goes hey we got deserts in America - we just don't live in him asshole he goes don't send him food send him your walls I'm something like me he's gonna take you where the food is and that's all I need to do is simple he had a joke where he was saying he's literally saying see that see that it's fucking sad no it's gonna be 100 years from now fucking sad your kids can't wait to take you where the food is and you were crying and it was the most ruthless and wrong thing that anybody could ever say you're talking about starving children and it was a you can mount your town you can make it all work we can make it all work yes you can he was hunt you down with earthquake like effects you know what a punch I probably killed it at the end with a punch it was unbelievably funny and it was one of the most punch down things you could ever do he's making fun of starving babies I think it could be done you can make fun of anything it's just you know yet we have to know two things one it's not really happening the way you're saying it because you're just joking and it's comedy and it's observation yeah it's an observation yeah somebody said Daniel can a job be too soon and I don't think it a joke could be too soon but it never gave me too so for funny observation and observation that we say we can go we could go to a fucking funeral and being that mother falling inside laughing like crazy yeah and everybody going to tumblr we'll see you in heaven when you go to heaven assuming that everybody's gonna go to heaven one of the one of the best lines one of the best one-liners I ever heard was from Dave Foley I was on Newsradio with Dave Foley and after Phil Hartman gotten murdered by his wife and then his wife committed suicide yeah he was up for an Emmy and her heart was yeah so we all went you know and we all put on suits and shit and went to the Emmys and he did with the dude from Frasier won and Dave Foley turns to look at her it goes what the fucks you have to do to win one of those things in the moment our murdered friend just lost at the end east and he turns to us he goes what the fuck does he have to do to win and me and Steven Roode were falling down in our chairs were like no you didn't that's fuckin funny there's no there's no too soon there's just not funny but I'm not always gonna be it's gonna be too late because the minute you're saying it's too soon somebody exactly fuck it exactly it's when you think about it that's what he has to go down I'd this way I have this bit about that dude who was visiting that uncontacted tribe and trying to convert him to Jesus and they shot him up with arrows it was a internet thing and it's a story that's on the news and I made sure I made fun of it that day the moment I read it I started writing tonight tonight right now right now I called up Adam about you you gotta hook it up dude yo I'm feel that I feel that way sometimes man it's like fuck it I'm going for it sometimes you just have to jump on something man if it doesn't make my stomach Rumble a little bit a little uncomfortable yeah it's it's like it's funny but it's not like you know it's not your gut funny I want my gut to be happy you don't want one thing that I think we should really say is we should really thank all the real comedy club fans that are still coming out and one of the things that we're not getting with guys like you and me perform wild people we perform before the comedy clubs when I can't a lot of pushback man we're getting a lot of good crowds man it is love great crowds and they want to it was a great house they want to hear that fucking voice man want to hear that crazy shit I did anything like like with me like out it's weird because like I'll do show I'll do like an improv saying and clearing some shit have a sold-out show and I'm still club I dabble a little theaters and that's one with a group of people whatever and I was like how many people follow me on social media and it's like out of a room about 500 it'll be like four people and I'm like wow that's fucked up but the thing is this show is still sold out you know so it's not followers I really believe I have real fans you know like people that whether it's through Instagram doesn't have to be there but they noticed do didn't want to see them and also best shit the crowd that comes out to see you for sure 100% you know is one thing and I can't take anything grant is one thing to like go up like at a night at the Comedy Store where you know it's gonna be a million comics you know it's gonna be ready in a stage you know you got it and this is another thing and you perform it but it's another thing knowing when the people that are there are there just to see you yeah you know when they make a weekend of it you know that's dope it is it is it's a great responsibility too right yeah but you married to it much but but when it's when it's like your only option for the most part that's all I do now mm-hmm you know so it's good yeah but it's you're like you're in control your own destiny man I just think the only thing you're missing is the podcast I think your podcast will be

microphone and a friend or you know another comedian or whatever so do you think it's important to engage with other people or can you do it bill burr does it entirely on his own and some racing Ari Shaffir does some of the best shit he ever does on his own ari has these like long introductions he'll have a podcast is two hours but his introduction as an hour and it's just already talking shit and it's some of my favorite stuff that he does Julie it does by himself to delete and fee oh yeah Theo knows about himself yes a lot of people do them by themselves you know I need to do what I really need to doing well you you're really funny with other people I mean if you could probably be just as funny by yourself but you're really you're funny do to interact with you know like I think you and another person would be great and you know you could just have a friend that's also a comedian the two you just start you don't have to have guests you just be talking shit about things that

why not man yeah I'm doing a hundred percent that's been calling me I know let me help you I'm with it all right I mean how I'll turn that down you can't we're in she would say we look like the black-and-white version of each other thank you I don't know what I don't even know what to say about that but it does look like you're light-skinned me that's hilarious I got a best funniest I guarantee you I have way more Neanderthal I've 50% more Neanderthals in the a motherfucker I mean that's not as hard as it seems you have a rifle but you still gotta focus yeah four rifle you do but for a bow and arrow that's when you really have to focus but it's just immediately here like a buncha slimfast yeah um but it's an honest way to get me you know I think like it's all you know like there's an honest way to earn you jokes there's an honest way to do stand-up there's an honest way to get meat I don't think everybody should do it you shouldn't have to should not do it what a lot of people wouldn't if you told the average person all right you want chicken and just show him like six hens alive and it was like you went chicken there you go yeah that motherfucking chicken with rock before motherfuck was able to skin it and do whatever they do to it but that's just how we're being raised it's a denial issue it's not a reality issue because the reality is we're still eating animals like crazy the denial is no one's killing them there's like a tiny tiny tiny tiny time I do your dirty work exactly so because someone's doing your dirty work you don't think it's dirty but every business when this is not this is the shit to get vegans caught out there yeah this conversation will turn them up to a vegan a little bit yeah there's some dis look there's some there's a reason why so many people accept veganism is because there's a lot of really good points with ability the biggest point is less animal cruelty you don't see animals suffer I don't want to see animal stuff you know but you know what I don't hear you you were absolutely right but I don't hear people push that side of it as much as the the dietary habits of it yeah you know my side I hear like it's charities in this but you don't hear about no it's more about the animals you know what it really is there's two things it's it really is all about the animals for a lot of them and they're really right that it's better than the standard American diet the eating vegan food and healthy vegetable food all the time as long as you do it correctly it's way better than standard American diet that's also like fish is good for you it just is it's good piece of salmon piece of salmon is good for you wild salmon that shit's really good for you teen is good for you it is good for you this idea that it's not good for you is kind of crazy like meat is good for you the real problem is sugar and bullshit and when the guys got that sorted out with the vegan diet and some people have it sorted out with another diet the whole idea is to keep the poison out that's all it is they just get overzealous and then when people have an idea of something that they're doing that they think everybody should do then they start telling everybody they should do it you know some people to tell it did I listen do when I was a little kid it's like what the fucking um the straws in the turtle shit straw chatter oh yeah oh shit despotic straws yeah it was like one motherfucker turtle and I understand it reaching out but now you can't fuck with plastic straws yeah there was someone i retweeted their post I wish I could remember who the fuck said it but they were they were laughing about how you can't buy straws but it's Starbucks they still have those plastic lids I know he every straws made that okay we gotta ask for it I wanna and then you get a paper straw and shake it all slop is just but I understand it but somebody started it and motherfuckers are fuckin running well you know they can make hemp plastic that's biodegradable they don't have to use this same stupid plastic that's what they do everything hips about to change the world about to shut up so natural cannabis I meant think these people told me they gave you one of those books most likely to put you probably to book this got artwork that's really really though the Canada's people do natural cannabis but it's like you know now business people always handedness yeah always but this was like it was all right it was like it was like just little nugs of each strand and then they had where from their different take Fletcher gave me that that was that big-ass book he gave me at the counter yeah it was I saw Tony with one and then IV over there he gave me one and it's dope is shit but it when is the first time I saw something they maybe look like okay this is the direction like everybody's gonna be involved with it dude these two is everybody these twos over here brought me a war case that war chest over there with that championship belt on the top of it that war chest at the bottom that box I said that's all weed man Jesus Christ Jesus Christ I'm gonna open it up it's got LEDs you want to see what looks yeah Joe's

yeah everybody was aside my friends like everybody was like geeked out you doing Joe's podcast you doing Joe's podcast that's awesome that's awesome that's awesome like I can't wait but my friend keeps telling me he says Donnell fuck that do your own you should do your own he's right your friend loves you it's quite obvious it's making a lot of sense I like the fact that no muhfuckas to get Wolf's Wolf's that's a wolf outside yeah Wolf's American Werewolf in London yeah you can um you know the thing about your podcast too is with with technology today you could literally do all of it on a phone like you don't need if you don't feel like if you feel like fucking around for a little bit get your feet wet you could do everything from your phone you get stream from your phone you record from your phone you do everything what about could I do um just just about recorded another maybe app but if I recorded like I'm a voice memo just wears it just to have my voice it has to be on a certain like platformer oh yeah well the voice recorder like on a phone on an iPhone the voice notes I have made a least a dozen podcasts I just use that yeah yeah just with that that's been a dozen podcast a lot of them on planes like me and Tony Hinchcliffe will be on a plane I just have the phone between us we just start talking shit and drinking cocktails and laughing so the more important thing is the conversation yeah yeah it doesn't it doesn't matter I mean this as long as you do your bit like right now we have a real professional set up we have a desk we have microphones Jamie's a real audio engineer he knows exactly what he's doing everything sounds amazing but as long as you put the effort to give people good solid product occasionally you could have one we're just talking on a phone right like they won't be upset it'll actually be kind of cool right like people know these guys are on a plane you can hear the the stewardess comes over normal no it's it's not normal but but you could totally do that too the thing is like if you just started doing that people would love it and then let it just sort of figure itself you know as you as it gets bigger figure its own path but you don't you don't need a big investment to start you just need one of them little zoom recorders I got a song yeah perfect microphone - money - just do it bro just do it I just got to do it and you could do you know here's the thing um I here's a thing with me while I was probably somewhat hesitant I'm like man everybody got a goddamn podcast yes but but the button if you with the right network of people and you're with the right network of people people recognize if you're you're in the network of people with we're talking about you did Theo show you do my show you'll do Joey Diaz a show have you done Joey show you do Joey show everybody does everybody show and everybody yeah all these guys funny people you do their show and then everybody knows oh okay and then it's all in the same group of E and everybody gets a bump everybody gets a bump everyone if as long as everybody is succeeding and everybody's doing well and there's more and more podcast and if I say hey you should see this guy's podcast you see guys on the right m'angil all the black people that are listening right now could you please take a note of what Joe just said for the last minute networking Network all the family it's everything and more importantly everybody gets a bump everybody gets about everybody including me everybody who's even the people that are making more money that make their everything's better for everybody and it feels better it feels better when everybody's doing great man I'm telling I'm with you 100% in it and that's like I wish wanted you for sending it it's not it's really simple yeah it's really simple it's um it's hard when you struggling because when you're struggling you feel isolated and you feel alone you feel like it's you versus everybody else but it's really not and one of the things about comedians is we've we've had this conversation many times we try to figure out what the number is I don't know what the number is but it might be less than a thousand on the whole planet on the whole planet Earth a seven billion people there might be a thousand legit comedians and I'm probably being a real generous when I say that I would say if I run into a dude like you or a you know any other real legit comedian there's a that is a rare human being there's not a whole lot of us if we don't stick together who the fuck will nobody whose farms going off do you gonna sleep oh my god we're in a dream no imagine if we just that alarm went off and I woke up to pee I was like fuck I was dreaming imma do it was the epic podcast yeah man I really I really believe that I really do believe that I but I believe that about all that shit it's it's all it's good for everybody it's good for all if it makes sense as I was said I was making a point not being funny but making a point and I was like black folks that are listening right now listen to this strategy and listen to what he just said listen what he just said it's it has nothing to do with anything other than community all the other shit that's in your head in terms of competitiveness is in your own head when you have that stage that's your stage you're there for 15 minutes or 20 minutes whatever your set is that's yours when everybody else does should be fuel it should inspire you and you should we should support each other because there's not many of us I'll tell you bruh and that's the I'm with you 100% but that is the one of the troubling factors and a lot of communities like the support goes away yeah you know I'm a motherfuckers talk they talk everybody talk but do you know why I really believe this why those away famine mentality famine what do you amen they feel like there's not enough for everybody everybody had this feeling for the longest time with there's not enough for everybody and I think that's a crazy way to think of things there's more than enough for everybody there's 300 million people how many fucking people do you need in your audience like you you should realize if you if you really enjoyed doing stand-up you'd want these people to become fans of stand-up so you'd want to tell them about all these other comedians tell about Joey Diaz tell them about you know fill in the blank Tony Hinchcliffe whoever it is that you think is alert a lemn talent there's a lot out there to see man because I'm telling you certain communities they just don't want to they don't want to tell motherfuckers be just honest on their self and themselves so much they don't want to help they don't want to reach out and it's like you know say like the conversation you're having with me right now it's simple for you because you know those are the type of friends and those type of people you deal with something but you know I mean I do know you mean mother fuck that shit like yeah I look at it like people I hang with Chappelle and these are the guys like we are like I'm went brown some powerful motherfuckers but we're friends first and foremost but everybody don't think like that yeah that's a tough one it is a tough one but it's just a matter of a shift in the way you view things just look at it just try it don't don't let go of your beliefs just try to look at it in another way try to look at another way so and you're what you way better off if you're a team you way better off of this camaraderie like when you do a show we do a show with someone who's a murderer a murderer and they go on in front of you you're way better off if you're laughing you're go on that stage you're way better off if you're loose like you just had a good time laughs but if you're tense like I told you I bombed with Jim Breuer yeah I was backstage freaking out I was like goddamn I got to follow this how the fuck am I gonna but you was younger then I was way younger but I was gonna I was like gonna eat shit I know Big Joe probably wasn't and it was a probably it's hard to get away from whatever your first experience is going to be you know say it's probably your first experience it happened like that like a real bomb like like like oh I could do shit about it yeah like I was supposed to 45 minutes I got off stage at 35 but you went back in the gym I did I had to yeah but that the thing is like Jim and I have always been friends and I've been friends with a lot of people that made me eat shit going on after him it didn't matter that the thing about it is that like and I've even after all these years I feel genuinely genuinely honored to be a part of this group of people yeah cuz we do something that is my favorite thing to watch yes that's a group of people but like you say it's like a limited circle of like yeah there's no always saying but real motherfuckers yes a small circle it's ok motherfuckers right they say who think somebody say somebody name and you like this ok ok they like know you like heard you right you're like heard you but just the real folks and like you say they got a they gotta stay united I'm telling you - couple weeks going on with Dave and he said boy he said comedians it's time to grab our balls cuz now more than ever we're the only people that we have to talk about what's fucked up in the world yes we have to we keep it to ourselves no it's not fair to nobody it's too confusing right now because it's too dangerous to have any controversial ideas people are getting in trouble for little have no balls dawg yeah well you own it you own it yep you own it if you own it you own it yeah you change it you know and if they live normally I'm telling you if you have a like a good heart people know your character if you own it they know what you meant to say they know they know exactly come on man really yeah you know if you own that once someone's asked me why do you think Charlie Sheen never got me to like what is what are you gonna do to him he has already done to himself the guy was on I see good no no you know what you know why I dated me nobody me too because I didn't want him to have another show alright you know think about it yeah if he buddy got me to here to be the headline and he would have found to show someone let's talk that like collectively there was a period of time where Hollywood lost their fucking mind and they were giving out these deals where if you got a certain amount of episodes they signed you up for a hundred episodes and that's what happened with anger management Charlie Sheen show Charlie Sheen made more money off that show that he did it even off three and a Half Men what people don't know that people don't know that he knows that he's only one denisa know yeah he's don't know but it's a crazy story they used to sign shows TVs two hundred million dollar Charlie Sheen experiment they used to sign these shows and they would sign these shows in the anticipation of the success so they did that with him they did it with George Lopez they give you a certain percentage you know it's like I don't know how its structured but apparently the point is they sign up for a giant number of shows not in 13 not 22 they sign you up for a giant number of shows and by doing that somehow or another they you know right after Charlie Sheen had his whole scandal leaving two and a Half Men he went on to have Wake make way more money than ever before that's crazy he said he's got a crazy career man legit movie star gigantic TV star also talks about smoking smoking a lot of crack right was he crack who's talking about her coke was he saying doing yeah doing drugs I think so either there's no crack advocates know people like this nobody's like yo last night was a little weird you got me like y'all had to me you can't say you got to be beers to be glasses why I tend to many crack rocks come on man ah yeah there's a certain darkness to giving into that glass dick once you start going down that road do you know you've already even made a choice you know there's no critical thinking involved there that's debauchery that's the happiness you chose everybody chooses differently happiness I had a friend who did a lot of crack back in New York was weird we'd have to drink like 40 ounces of malt liquor to try to calm him down because he'd be just so jacked up from the crack I had a crackhead friend I was like I gave so many opportunities just to be cool and he crackhead he gave me a crackhead experience it was it was all the McDonald's brought we was waiting for McDonald's do we gave you the money there was a what happened I was like we know you a crack here but don't crack hit us you don't say go outside of our community but like here don't do that bro yeah my friend was brilliant - brilliant brilliant guy but he had just like mental problems and he just need to get high all the time he had never wanted a business escape yeah yeah he never wanted to be alone with his thoughts that's a tough one for a lot of people it was a real one for him because he was brilliant he's a brilliant guy but he was also homeless half the time I knew him you know it was a lot going on Matt with him a lot going on but he was he'd oh my good helpful no he's not too stubborn yeah listen he he was just vanished and disappear and do drugs for a few days then come back and he could do math in his head like you could say to him 99 times 54 times 6 minus 5/3 when he was so low yeah and he was just banging out we just tell you what it is quick $2,000 who tell you and like you'd be there with a calculator like you motherfucker yeah was crazy but he couldn't he couldn't manage his own brain to the point we could stay away from hard drugs and eventually died of an overdose yeah that's usually yeah that's usually how that what goes brah yeah yeah it's like this yeah like not to be muffles come back from that they don't come back from the needle nope it'll come back from it it's hard I mean it is possible we need some help yeah that's one of the reasons why that 12-step shit works we're really given a God or the higher power it's like you you're gonna have to somehow or another think there's something more important than what you're doing otherwise you're never going to stop this shit yeah but those people become like big sex addicts shit they would have fun everything Coffee side right they want some meat is some answer they don't give a fuck give me the ass first pop me whatever it is do no joke that's so fucking funny so true everybody did that no they had a situation a mufflers on coffee yard shit they don't ever get rid of those tendencies they just try to figure out a way to put it
