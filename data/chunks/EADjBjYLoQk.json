changed my life five-four-three-two-one [Music] yes Dan Dodie yes we're live what's up brother how are you man good to see you good to see two men so four people don't know I met Dan way back in 2012 doesn't that seems like a long time ago now does it seems like at least half of my life which is not even close why is that true I mean why is it like five years it was five years ago yeah a lot half years ago well that was back when it was October of 2012 I thought there was only two months left in the world because I thought the Mayan calendar was correct and it was on like a December 21st 2012 is gonna end the world okay and so yeah so you fucked off and with the Montana to vote ride with us yeah we took we took a canoe down the Missouri River that was fucking awesome isn't that wild it's one of my favorite trips ever cold really cold like not fun cool that was yeah that it sucked but once you got moving it was fine yeah you know and I learned about merino wool it was the important that was an important lesson like the first light merino wool like that people don't know if you're ever in a cold area it's so important that you have a base layer of merino wool that shit gets wet and you stay warm even if you sweat in it you stay warm and it doesn't look half as much as the synthetic version yeah at all it's really some people really like synthetics in some weird way like I don't use them or did you know you have I have this I smell terrible you actually don't care I like them both but I just you know working with those guys for so long and first light I got used to it I like I like it but I use synthetics for 10 years before that and I mean I didn't smell good but it really care a lot of mountaineering people like some synthetics because they dry quicker yeah but I said I feel like the one of the best benefits of the wool is that when it is wet it still retains your warmth and I don't mind being a little moist well the synthetic will keep you warm too in their way just it's slightly different value like cotton will not right Kyle not but a synthetic like capilene that Patagonia uses or other things that they also will they won't they won't kill you but yeah the the merino has some other better qualities yeah it's just well the stink thing is huge cuz I fucking smell terrible that was a fun trip man that was actually the first episode of that show that I that I fully kind of shot and directed myself so that was kind of a big stage from is fun I just basically hung out with Kalin in different week what you have when you have Cowan when Cowan has like a captive audience he's the funniest man alive I will never forget these things I won't share them that's good a few scenes from that campfire do you remember the ravine comer I remember cause of you I remember him taking a shit literally ten feet from our campfire is a stick enough and we put a flag in it I took pictures of it I have that shit but we put an aluminum flag on it and stuck it in there I've never touched another man's shit other than his I tried to set up a hunt for myself last year in the breaks and it just ended up didn't happening but it's one my favorite places god it's so lonely out there but so amazing that area is so like it's such a perfect place to introduce Kalin and I to get the world of hunting yeah because it's so wild well it's multifaceted too we have a lot of history there you have the yeah you know it's it's one of those areas where it's a complete wilderness experience because you're on the water right yeah we're not crossing roads like we got dropped off at the end of a road and floated to basically the next row down the river which is a big deal we floated 40 miles down over the course of what was it six days is one of our one of these bucks yeah that one right there that's the buck right there hey buddy heyy fella that's a different time that was in Wisconsin that was one where Wisconsin that video they just put up but um when we did do that man it was uh that was where Lewis and Clark had made some stops Oh expedition yeah and that's where one of the coolest things about doing it with Rinella because you know so much about the history of the United States and the the settling of the United States and also the Nez Perce Indian stories that he would tell us oh yeah people call shit years yeah and that's when I heard the story about the what the real story the original story about the Leonardo DiCaprio movie the revenant like what really happened oh he told Reds to a movie okay yeah he told me that story the actual story about the guy that got left behind and crawled back many many miles what's the guy's name do you remember the actual guy's name but there's so much they made up in the movie it's just kind of brutal yeah it's a freaky movie it was a grizzly bear attack yeah as a real freaky thing the real grizzly bear attacks oh man I bet the real grizzly just kind of swatted that dude once and then just he fell down that it left him alone why do you think that cuz that thing would have torn the pieces it was a giant bear - I just fuck bears man they scare the shit out of me I wonder really the average length of time of a bear attack like how long does it last two seconds 30 seconds well the UM that movie Grizzly Man apparently the audio of him getting killed by the Bears like seven minutes long I listened to that I was terrible no it's not real the one you listen to online is not real oh no shit it's fake yeah yeah the actual audio was never released life is a lie yeah somebody send it to me too but then I looked into it and Werner Herzog and the woman who owns the actual audio they got rid of it they destroyed it they never listened to it and Werner Herzog actually told her to destroy it in the documentary hmm so the one when you hear it online it's just fake and then once you know it's fake and you listen to it you go oh this shit's fake you like you can hear it right I'm not gonna listen to it again thank you I mean sure yeah leave this is really one good place you can find it grizzly man audio do you hear it neig oh oh yeah this isn't real that's one of my top five movies of all time so great was incredible so one of the funniest movies ever as far as unintentional comedy oh my god is it funny well it was it the sheriff Lou Thesz sheriff goes why thought he was retarded here so here he Hale like screams and shit err all the Fox audio bear attack Wow why is it echoing hear the echo yeah that's that was done in the room all these these voices these supposed to be mrs. capito woods yeah DS that audio is unquestionably done in a room somewhere Oh see Eretz resonating it yeah that's all fake horse see now you know those mothers they got us do you think they benefited from creating that probably yeah like some money yeah somebody probably put up some YouTube ads and made some cash alright it's entirely possible or they just did it for fun it sounded like people were having a good time hey guys the guys yelling it sounds like you can almost kind of like here in his yells like holy shit someone's gonna believe this this is so ridiculous yeah but it supposedly lasted seven minutes cuz the bear just what start eating them wait so what's that what is that stat that's not from like the real audio last baaaad yes because the Bears not trying to kill them yeah it's just eating them yeah cuz bears apparently well I've seen bears kill moose in videos and they just start eating them they don't kill right arrest there's no wall them - you wolves do - they just eat right away they start at the back end and start to start eating you they don't they don't bother them of the decency like at least a mountain lion kills you you know cats kill you bears and wolves they just eat you I guess they just don't need to they don't need to incapacitation why well I think it's also a thing with omnivores omnivores I think don't have that instinct to instantly kill that's interesting yeah but that doesn't make sense though my theory sucks because of wolves cuz wolves yeah roams are gone brain Chad yeah so maybe it's uh interesting yeah I don't know I mean they do that because they have to write like that's how they take they take down a running animals yeah of kills they snap at the legs right yeah and then they just it's the easiest softest part of it yeah just start eating on the and I was listening to podcast today about wolves in Idaho what they were talking about how when you go deep into the backcountry where people can't get to or where it's very difficult really rocky terrain the Wolves just running rampant out there they just have so many wolves they're ever seen one in the wild no she put that on your list I actually did see one in Alberta I think but it was at Twilight and it was dog sized and it ran across the road and it was a little too big to be a coyote sure in my mind but I thought I saw a wolf for like two seconds and it was a squirrel so take that with a grain of thought oh I've seen a couple the the most memorable we were we were in a valley in Alaska and it was dusk and you know just two massive mountain ranges on each side and I don't know might have any honest somebody yelled and somebody spotted one across the river and we went looked at it and it was it was man my memories family was either pure white I think was pure white and it just I swear to god has shown I did just like emanated light it was the most like regal beautiful just like perfect perfect and it just sort of trot along I've ever disappeared back in the woods and they're amazing no I think I was thinking about this morning on a hike here I was looking for Mountain Lion tracks but you know the sign at the trailhead says it gives you warning about mountain lions that are out here for sure yeah I never really I don't know the only thing that ever gives me pause in the woods is is it grizzly because you know Steve I we got charged that once and ever since that happened my bear radar is more intense it's just such a freaky animal yeah when you see what a grizzly really is essentially a thousand-pound giant wild dog have you seen those in the wild yourself via grizzly yeah no never seen a grizzly not in the wild I've seen them you know live in a sanctuary and I've seen a lot of oh no I did see a grizzly I saw small grizzly in Alberta last year yeah but it wasn't that big it was like maybe six and a half seven feet we're gonna stand were you pretty close yeah very close it was like 30 or 40 yards from us yeah yeah but it took off pretty quick but it wasn't a grizzly like they had some trail-cam photos of like fucking tankers they were goddamn VW buses this is like a juvenile so it's proud like I said probably six and a half feet or something like that so where I live in Bozeman so it's literally a line right where we are so south of us is the Gallatin Range in the Madison range just full full of Grizzlies yeah but just north of town there's the Bridger range and a couple other ranges too and for whatever reason that is an impasse to the population of bears why is more or less do they have any idea I mean it might be just physicality it might be actually you know Steve Rinella would be the one that I've heard him talk about this he would know that exactly but it's either a physical impasse or it's it's the human the proximity humans of the town and all this but the way that it relates is that you know if I'm gonna go hiking with my little baby boy boy I choose to go north right just just because you know I don't think I would always thought that way and I carry bear spray usually I carry a pistol I don't I probably will in the future just because that guy he was from Bozeman that got attacked last year yeah he got tore up and I was horrific oh yeah this his scalp is hanging off his head while he's making the video was it gnarly and he wasn't hunting he was just hiking he was scouting and he used bear spray and it didn't work it was a sow with her cubs yeah so that's about I don't know 50 miles from where I live it's where he got hit wrong 60 miles something like this close yeah Jesus yeah nothing to mess around with man I think it's awesome that they exist I really I think it's so cool they exist I don't want him to not exist but at the same time I don't want to be near them yeah you know I don't want to encounter them so it's so uh yeah yeah yeah I'm more sensitive to them now I really have a deep deep love for them sharks on the other hand that we could just kill them yeah it's just I don't care what's where people are getting like really touchy feely about sharks because they hear all about these sharks getting slaughtered for shark fin soup like yeah the governor I think of New York caught a shark I'm fishing totally legal and not an endangered fish at all and he got so much hate because people who it's like we were talking before about science that so many people want to argue things online but they don't want to actually like look into like what are the studies that have been done how much do people actually know what is they are now people want to have an opinion they have this like narrow window of information that I'm just gonna run with my opinion say fuck you for killing that shark oh yeah you know it's like people have time necessary to go investigate everything to have an opinion about no you know no teasing issue no but they do have time to tweet about it get mad at the governor was that the governor was it the mayor of New York that that got in trouble for the shark well you didn't get in trouble because what he did was totally legal and they cooked it and mako shark is delicious sharks still the best I've ever had yeah Porto Rico they sure start they served shark everywhere like you go to a food stand they fry shark put it on a stick it's a fish I mean it's an ocean it's an ocean out there it is New York governor sparks anger after killing threatened shark but it's not threatened that's not true why does it say threatened shark that's not a threatened animal thresher shark yeah I don't I don't think that its head threatened right is it fresher did say in the headline Oh threaten oh yeah so it threatened I don't think that's true I do not think that's a threatened animal I'd have to look at all three species of thresher shark is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature because of their declining populations fishing for them is regulated in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration but it is not illegal okay despite its legality UN patrons of the ocean Louisburg said the killing and subsequent photos were abhorrent oh you might be a twat and worked against those trying to conserve dwindling shark numbers um okay yeah all right well maybe he's right I know that some of them are not I don't know man I mean you can't really control what kind of fish you catch when you go fishing and if you catch a fish that's legal and we do the problem with catch and release this is a dirty secret ladies and gentlemen because people do go catch and release fishing and I've released fish before a lot of them die it's it's kind of weird like uh yeah is that a secret still ething I mean never some folks okay yeah yeah not sure you sure oh absolutely I mean think about it I mean it'd be like taking you and I Duncan as under water for five minutes and put in his back or even worse shoving a fucking barb through your face yeah and then joining us yeah that's what we're doing to him we're literally yeah drowning them literally yeah yeah I mean some people use barbless hooks which are better and the inside of a mouth of a fish is very different than our mouth so I mean there's prat right there's best practices to harm the fish as little as possible and I think you know that fly-fishing sure yeah fly fishing with barbless hooks yeah you can most likely you can most of them are going to be fine yeah but a lot of run I it's a weird practice I just don't I don't put in a Mack yeah yeah well it's just yeah I'm not a I'm not a catch and release fisherman I'm not even a huge fisherman I love to eat it I love to go to Alaska catch a buttload of fish come home and eat it for the rest of the year I need to go halibut fishing yes you do yes no no no I love how I've gone fluke fishing I've caught flounder before it's a little baby halibuts but they're delicious but halibut is supposed to be like one of the most delicious fish to catch and then cook like right away oh it's amazing I mean it's uh it's one of those real fleshy whitefish kind of grouper you know grouper mm-hmm and yeah like chunks of hella deep fried like like a well coated and deep fried the thing about how but if you overcook it though it's like chewing on a sock it just gets tough real fast maybe that's troupe of other white flash fish like that too but no it's delicious it's not the most exciting to catch well they're giant doors yeah here yeah you just like hold of his heavy-ass they're so alien looking to two eyes on one side of their head and they flatten out at the bottom of the ocean you know that they're I my grades right really they start swimming up and down eyes on each side and start a part of their maturation processes they flip over we're getting older yeah they're getting old and I literally slides on to the other side oh so but it stays there once it's well yeah it's it's not like I can't go back and forth yeah how fucking weird they're so weird-looking it looks wrong yeah you see two eyes on one side of their head their bodies flattened out and that's full of so much good meat oh yeah man it's like ads have you like my uncle live on Kodiak on we've been going up there since I was a kid and I mean it's you know it's that's as much meat as a deer right I get to two hundred pound halibut which isn't the most common they can be way bigger than that - you're supposed to release the really big ones though right don't they say that I don't know maybe yeah I'm not sure a friend of mine caught one and it was apparently enormous and he was furious because the guide they went fishing with a guide the guide cut the line cuz it was so big do you think he just couldn't get in the boat no no no he said look we gotta let this go because it's a big breeder Oh and that these these big ones are responsible for keeping the populations healthy and because this guy made a living off of fishing he's like it's our responsibility to cut this loose and the guy was like what are you talking about he's like this is like he didn't know that that was gonna be an option yeah and so he's pulling up this thing where you know he described it as like the side of a wall oh yeah the wall of a room it's like it's fucking huge I don't know if it's true hell but but I know other fish you know sometimes the big ones don't eat that well like I just not sure right so it might not have been it's not like he's gonna get that mounted I docked right a 400-pound they say that's true with deer - like I've never eaten a really old deer but they say old deer just do not taste that good it can be it I know I know they can be worse for sure you shoot an old dog that was mo mo Sam oh that's right yeah and he said it was rough how did I change this over a winter but my little brother shot me a deer and gave to me for Christmas and it was the first slightly off tasting animal that I've tasted in men seven years you know not been eating a lot of animals you know over my course of time you know we talked about meteor which I worked on for a long time I don't anymore but a lot of animals and they all tasted exceptionally good and my brother shot this one and I don't know what it was it was cold he he killed it and it got dark and had to track it in early the next more and it did he got shot it no no he hit it well it died fairly close but yeah no it was it was pretty gnarly and I even mean so I made sausage out of it and try to eat that and that was hard to get down really we have out we have a couple pounds of it left still it just wasn't good hmm that's weird well maybe it was a tarsal glands or something like was it in the rut no it was muzzleloader season in December in Minnesota and that's to what we were here I don't know what it was really don't yeah well you hear stories you know I'll tell you what man that was one of the things that really got me into hunting not with just the how cool that trip was and how amazing it was and how bizarre it is to be out there in total silence no cell phone signal you don't hear not we what do we see like maybe three people the whole week we were out there yeah two boats maybe I don't remember seeing them I remember we saw a dudes tent and he had like a little wood stove and I was like Steve we got a stove fuck is this this guy's got a stove inside of his tent he used to stay in warm in his tent we were freezing our dicks off and then we saw another guy who had a deer in his boat he had shot up oh yeah remember that guy yeah as a memorable mule man yeah that what they're gonna say the food was so good once we did shoot that deer and we ate it that night as I could Lord it still it's the best meat ever and pasta there's so much connected to it yeah you know it's not just that it's like you want your restaurant you have a delicious meal it's like no you like you busted your ass for five days humping over mountains finally put a stalk on a deer shot the deer killed it dragged it back to camp cut it up butchered in no we ate it and like and then when Steve took that doe head and buried it underground because what is that Guthrie book big sky yeah right it was in his book yeah yeah I think is good I think that's the name of it I think that's the name of the book okay right sounds right and in that book he talks about cooking a deer head under the ground so he wanted a try yeah we soaked a burlap sack hot river was incredible it was really good who was incredible it was like some sort of exotic smoked pork or something like that but them yeah we ate everything that we ate the liver we ate the heart we we we ate it all it was amazing do you still have a freezer full of meat right now are you siding shot an elk nice in October so yeah and I had shot a deer in November but I ate that deer pretty quick yeah I had a dud of the season last year incision this year for the first time a long time I've been eating more you know local pork and beef and I'm just so sick of it man I guess until this fall again and now when you going back home back home from here yeah I'm going home a week from two weeks from yesterday I have to commercial freezers in the back I can hook you up yeah yeah I'm what turn now no I made it back to you how could you get it back um let me think about it I can I could go back Kugler so good luck Molly get ears to figure something out get you some I have one of those Yeti hoppers at home like it give you that that makes me really proud that like you know I was there the first time you hunted now you're gonna hook me up with me good stuff I live off it now I don't buy meat anymore unless I go to a restaurant it's a very rare that I go to a store like a butcher shop and buy meat unless there's something I'm preparing it's just not as good it's just actually not as good well or I find that it's it's different it tastes like a soft lazy animal it's weird like when you eat a steak like from a butcher shop I mean they taste good they still taste good but it tastes like like this soft almost sick thing like there's a difference chink grass-fed beef that's one of the things that I noticed like way back in the day when I first started learning about grass-fed beef I'm like what is the difference and people explain to you oh there's a difference in the fatty acids and what's what's healthier about it is these animals are not supposed to be eating grain and when they eat grain it's bad for their body and that's why they're so fat the marbling is actually them being incredibly unhealthy in like huh okay so I'm going to try some grass-fed meat it was so expensive and then it was a small tea like they're smaller like the stakes are small and it's a darker meat like and then I remember eating it thinking wow this tastes really different yeah it does like a grass-fed steak tastes different than a grain fed steak they look different when you lay them out side by side oh yeah but then you take those and then you put an elk steak next to it and you go okay that's the real meat and that's what you're supposed to be eating you're supposed to be ting that deep dark red meat that you you eat it you just want to run through a fucking wall it's like it's got energy in it like its feet it makes your body feel different when you eat it so what is it what do you think that is what is that is that a psychological thing do you think that it's actually biological in the meat it is better there's something in there and more for you how do you how do you make sense of that for yourself I have a terrible unscientific theory my own scientific theory is things that run fast are better for you that's why fish is really good for you because it's hard to catch the guy they swim fast deer are great they run fast rabbits are great they run fast cows just sort of wander around yeah you know they're just meandering I like your theory but it makes sense that we have more cows because it's just all right there Corral those bitches well you know my buddy Adam lives in Australia Adam green tree and in Australia they have wild cows where cows at one time we're domestic they broke loose and they've been for many many many generations living wild and they're extremely dangerous yeah especially the bulls like when you watch Cowboys riding bulls and you're like wow this is crazy like yeah that's a fucking yeah big scary animal but again a domestic animal that is not fighting off predators it's not I mean it's just it doesn't want you to fuck with it it's got these giant watermelon testicles and they're just full of piss and vinegar and that we don't eat those people people don't know when you buy meat from a cow you're buying meat from a steer and what a steer is is a bowl they cut his balls off and he's young so his testosterone stops so there's bodies mushy and soft yeah but these Bulls that Adam sees out in the the bush in Australia are super aggressive and very dangerous and one of his friends was torn apart by one gourd like really loudly Denali lived they had a med vacum to safety it tore his guts open and you know he was I only think he was hunting it I think like he was just in the wrong place the wrong time they see you and they just fucking charge means the reason want to have those goddamn giant horns yeah what's the saying that you cut you cut in a male animals balls off and they stop thinking about ass and starts thinking about grass right so I mean it's literal yeah they stop trying to get laid and they just eat they just keep eating yeah and they just the lack of testosterone makes him soft and mushy whereas um campaigns shot a water buffalo in Australia and he said that he had one piece of meat in his mouth for half an hour trying to chew it down while he was practicing archery he goes I'm not exaggerating chewed one piece of meat for a whole half-hour issue what's it say about us though are as humans though I mean you could easily make a analogy there between cows and a wild animal and us I mean nobody's more domesticated than us no these things we domesticate I think we are you know where the domesticate er somehow but I think we're even more domesticated right like if you could eat one of the duck dynasty guys oh man they would cook up good have you slept in them 100 the Machine you know there would be so much flavoring and marbling plus they probably eat a lot of sugar so it's probably like a lot of like sweetness to the meat yeah I'm not advocating well it depends what your tooth is though if you used to eating wild animals and you ate one of the duck dynasty guys would taste like shit that's true right that's true but if you eat McDonald's and ring dings what's your listening thing would you want those little hostess things so chocolate-covered cream filled jammies I might have to get one of those I haven't had one of those disgusting they look great like always gonna enjoy this as soon as you eat it like fuck is wrong with me man no I love just I had some tacos I got to town last night and had to go the first ha courier I saw it was the best we have legit Mexican food in LA the manga does not have Mexico really right not such good Mexican food but Colorado has some really good Mexican food it does it does yeah it the the line of that I think stops at Colorado maybe Wyoming I don't think has it but north of the Montana you're you're in dead zone what you are is amazing though it's worth it you could take a trip for Mexican food because when you are is like I feel like I mean I almost feel like I shouldn't say this on the podcast I don't want anybody move into Bozeman it's already on her all of the list it's everybody I mean it cats out of the bag it's not any you're not spilling the beans here I know but I mean it really is a special place it's the people are so nice yeah they're not dumb either it's not like uneducated no no it's actually that County has the highest percentage of PhDs in America what bozeman really I look it up fact Wow yeah it's a highly educated population but it's also not like Boulder where they like oh my god save the butterfly you know there are no national about their approach to nature it's balanced yeah you can find some you know you can find good yoga you can find your way with stuff but there's also a ranch or right next to you it's really interestingly like dimed virtual yeah it is yeah it's divert some ways not with mostly white yeah no yes I'm moving here from New York and and that is my least favorite thing about about Montana yeah it's not a whole lot of flavor no but there's so many good things about in the the landscape like what you get to see when you're there so stunning and the access to the land is the huge it's a I really do I mean Bozeman from my house in I don't how many in four different directions three different directions you can be at a trail in 15 minutes I it's just it's just endless you know you can get on a trail right side out red cell man I can't talk right outside of Bozeman and you can go if you wanted to for days through the Yellowstone Ecosystem South yeah I just keep going and keep going and keep going I mean it connects you to I mean real big wilderness the kind of the kind that you can meet in Alaska you find it even bigger but I think in the lower 48 yeah it's unparalleled yeah in the lower 48 is about it's about as wild as it gets and that leads me to what I want to bring up to you today because I saw this today where Trump is his is challenging some of the protection of certain national monuments and some public lands today was something that came out like I told you fuckers I knew this was coming there were so many people that were telling me that Trump is going to protect our public lands because his son is a hunter and like listen man that guy worships money yeah there's money to be made in delisting these public look at this Trump order could rollback public land protections from three presidents this is going to have a shitstorm on his hands though may play this so we could hear exactly what he says of America's natural resources and I can tell you the group that's in here right now they're really doing the job right Lisa they're doing a good job I'm going to take care of Alaska - don't worry about and they protect the ability of the people to access and utilize the land which truly belongs to them and belongs to all of us secretary Ryan Zinke is doing an incredible job and he never overlooks the details he's a detailed person soon as he was confirmed we had a snowstorm big one and he was out there on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shoveling the snow all by himself and he's a strong guy he did a good job part the fucker was a very very good job he's surrounded the first 100 days we've taken historic action to eliminate wasteful regulations they're being eliminated like nobody's ever seen before there's never been anything like it sometimes I look at some of the things I'm signing I say maybe people won't like it but I'm doing the right thing what the hell but this is so weird that that's a president but the way communicates did you see when he he just pinned a Purple Heart Jesus he just pinned a Purple Heart on a returned vet a guy who lost his leg just happened last couple days it's the most awkward and the weirdest it is the weirdest single thing I've ever watched on the screen his body language and his what he does its bazaars and I'm John really bizarre what does it say there in terms of like what the actual rollbacks mean and what the the issue is here let's go large in order which trumps on the interior department could lead to the reshaping of 24 national monuments including the Grand Canyon parish ant National Monument Grand staircase-escalante national monument and the Basin range National Monument as well as a host of Pacific Ocean monuments including the world war two valor in the Pacific National Monument though interior secretary Ryan Zink he cast the move as a way to include local voices in the decision to designate monuments the review of the antiquities act was first signed by President Teddy Roosevelt 1906 stands in stark relief to years of bipartisan work at conserving lands Wow the move comes after Western Republican lawmakers including Utah senator Orrin Hatch complained that Obama overused the law to overprotect land how the fuck do you over protect land it kind of protected but don't over protect it boy I don't know man it's just weird I think the worries the worry is going to be that this would be the beginning of a of a larger pattern yet slippery slope yeah well I what I wonder what you know about and what I think most people don't when you talk about this did the vast majority of the people in this country live in these communities and cities and towns and you know even small towns they do they don't understand how much of this land that we live in is just this incredible yeah bizarre experiment in like the people having the the actual American people owning this incredible swath of public land yeah I mean it's it's wild like what you're talking about like you can walk for days and days into that stuff yeah I think they don't that exists necessarily and I think even to me more importantly they don't understand the impact that that actually has on people and what it actually means to be able to be part of something like that it's a really deep important thing and I think that people just you know you get your postcard to wrists and you say oh I love the natural force I love the National Parks and let's drive around and take pictures and that's great that's fine there's a big industry there it's very helpful to the economy and but there's something way deeper to then that brings a lot of people and I would even say culturally something really deep there that we shouldn't be fucking with no just shouldn't be messing with it well it's been there for a hundred years a hundred and ten years it's no Conservation Park yeah absolutely itself has been there way longer and that's you know sort of like the deep time part of that is what really interests me is because you know you step out into that in the right context and you're all of a sudden you know you're you're playing with something way bigger and more powerful and more impactful by just being part of landscape that's yeah you know but you're right yeah the conservation thing is is present and real and the I grew up in Minnesota North Dakota and my my first wilderness trip was in the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota it's this million acre million acre wilderness of lakes that are interconnected by trails you can go out for weeks at a time and canoe across a lake and then carry your boat to the next lake and there's campsites and it's just paradise it's where I fell in love with the idea of wilderness it's actually where I fell in love with my for the first lady I felt moving at the same time I was on a church trip Oh No yeah and but you know so what I you know what I'm say as far as it's shaping people and it's important I mean that's first trip in the wilderness changed my life like and that's oh that's a pretty mild way of saying it it it's shaped Who I am all the way well that gets us to what you're doing now because you you stop working for 0.0 and we talked about on the last podcast that you had done a lot of these wilderness therapy trips yeah where you take like troubled kids they've lost their way and their parents don't know what the fuck to do and you would take them out into the woods and live with you kids four months yeah for long today yeah just crazy to think about like that but makes sense like just the five days that I was out there six days or whatever when I first went to Montana with you guys changed the way I thought about wilderness because I really had never been I mean I kind of been to like wooded areas right you know you're saying but I I maybe I went to Yellowstone when I was a kid but I didn't really remember it it's a different thing and we went to Alaska right and that was to me that's another level I should listen to you on that trip you were like fuck that place we shouldn't go to that place sure it was uncomfortable but I'm glad we went though yeah in retrospect right I mean and I'm glad you went just because of the level of how deep out we are yeah I mean you know that the Missouri Breaks in Montana you're out there but in in this spot and on in southeast Alaska we were really out there you can feel in the air but there's stuff that she wants my fell I fell off of this like six foot drop I slipped and just and luckily I just landed good but I was like man you could fuck yourself up up here yeah and not be able to get out of here like especially if you do a solo trip oh yeah no bueno no told ya yeah I'm addicted of that that feeling yeah that's sort of immense cat it takes you over you are so tiny you are not you know you're not in charge anymore it doesn't care about you now that's the thing like the thing about like Prince of Wales is this solitude this sadness that's beautiful it's really weird it's a weird feeling that you get you just like it there's no denying your lack of significance in this particular environment it doesn't give a fuck about your credit cards no it doesn't careful your cell phone it doesn't care who you know or where you live or what kind of courage it doesn't give a fuck yeah it's just too thin Fang and claw and rain and constant rain yeah and beauty just unbelievable beauty with the like when that's a roller coaster oh yeah I mean you're just in hell and all of a sudden you're on the top of a ridge and the Sun peeks out and a rainbow pops up and the like the Technicolor Piper vivid just like crazy green yeah it's you know what's a sorry about that I've cold that place as a personality yeah right but being in wilderness I've been wilderness spots all over the globe it's what's so fascinating to me is how they all have a different vibe that have a different like life and it is it's it's like I mean sure it looks different but there's a like a felt sense or a feeling you get from plate like the Brooks Range in Alaska is that the northernmost range of mountains and it runs east and west and then above it is the Arctic the Arctic plain and an Arctic Ocean there is something about being up there and especially I think in the summer when the Sun doesn't really go down it is it is it feels like being on a different planet but man I don't know if I have the words to describe it but yeah man I mean and that's what I said I'm addicted to I am and I you know I moved to Montana for professional reasons but then also because it's where I wanted to live and so I get out hiking all the time you know I train I hike with that's kind of how I stay fit but I come I need to figure this out because I come home from that feeling like I just like got started you know I've missed the deep immersion of the woods like working when you were working for mediator and consoling trips or any time that I spent over I think there's something that happens after you know depending on how long like the longest I've stayed out at a time is 40 some days but there's something that happens I don't know a day two days three days five days in where you really just kind of let go of the regular you know I don't know I think it's actually physiological some of it but whatever it could be just psychological too but something shifts you know when you do a real expedition when you do a real thing where you're not your brains not half stuck back and all the other stuff and so yeah I go hiking and I love it you know all the time and we get out in the woods but it just doesn't really do it for me I feel kind of unfulfilled that's interesting so you just got so addicted to being out there completely disconnected that you when you go on the hike you know you could always just make it back to town a couple hours oh yeah it's just like a little I'm trying to think of like an analogy but it would be like a little taste yeah it would be like maybe like a five-minute porn session versus a week-long like lovemaking session that of your dreams right just like a little yellow teaser just not as fun do you do you plan on staying there is that I think so yeah I mean we think about we definitely won't move back east we would either move somewhere out here or stay there it gets cold as fuck in the winter though right it does yeah not not that cold actually like not compared to I grew up in Minnesota it gets really cold for a long time yeah and Montana we're at used to do that but global warming something yeah something it's different this year was pretty mild the year before was really really mild you know like thirty five average temperature really that's it yeah it's not that bad I thought it was like 35 below no you go northern Montana up in the Highline area it'll start to you know more of a deep freeze a lot more wind Bozeman is kind of a nice little protected we should stop talking about Bozeman so people telling you we're gonna get get people into it it's uh well just another fact on that it is the I think the third fastest growing County in the States right now Wow so it makes sense when I was there we went there and took the family there last summer I was like this place is magic so pretty I got a couple of spots though that I'm saving oh yeah don't tell anybody know my gonna um when you were in the Brooks Range did you put like masks on - go to sleep those you know those sleepy masks they say that's the murder but yeah yeah I just use a t-shirt just cover your eyes yeah yeah they say you have to cuz if you just try to like sleep you'll wake up a couple hours later and be all bewildered oh yeah no it's weird it's weird it's one it's cool it's a very it's a perception changing thing to go up there and watch the Sun literally just kind of like you know kiss the horizon and then just keep going yeah I went to Anchorage couple of years ago in the summer we were there in July me and my friend Ari went fishing up there we did some shows up there and it was weird like two o'clock in the morning was light out we're like what the fuck is this like and the people are cool shit that's another place there's something about like those people like Alaska even more extreme because something about those people that they deal with nature in a way that everybody else just doesn't oh yeah well they have yeah all the time yeah weathers gnarly I mean you can't walk out your house for more than ten miles before you have it you know giant massive in front of you yeah peak the oceans right there yeah yeah yeah I mean Anchorage is a weird place too I love it yeah it's really interesting too because you think of it as like a bunch of like Lumberjacks and fishermen and weirdos and like people trying to run from the law or something like that and you get there and there's like hunk free quality there's a bunch of people with gay rights signs people beep in their horns they drove by I'm like oh this is not what you think it is no RAF breweries and yeah really good restaurants like oh okay this is it's not it's not like Hicks I feel like it adds a little bit of flavor the pacific northwest of Seattle of Portland but then then a big dose of weird - yeah a lot of weird a lot extreme I mean these are these are people that are there that's is where they're gonna live and die yeah and you know it's grizzly bears everywhere a lot of Minnesotans and folks from where I grew up there's there's a big connection a lot of people move up to have moved up to Alaska so like I said I grew up going up there fairly regularly in the summer who did you say lives that you know that lives on Kodiak Island my dad's sister Oh her family that's a scary place those bears are fucking jion yeah yeah they are do the biggest brown bears in the world ah they might be I think I've heard that the kamchatka brown bears in Siberia in in Russia across I don't know if that is Siberia but up across the the water there um they might be bigger I could be totally wrong about truth but I saw this video of this guy though remember that show that was on I was called the hunt it was a show that it was interesting because James Hetfield of Metallica was the narrator of it right and people were so angry at him for narrating this thing that they were talking about boycotting Metallica when they played some music festival I never watch I remember you talking about it and then yeah I know what you're talking about and it was about bear hunting yeah yeah who's about brown bear hunting which is a really controversial form of hunting because you don't really eat those things I mean you kind of can yeah but they taste like shit well the coastal ones yeah special they're just eaten rotten fish all the time yeah well like animals taste like what they what they eat which is really yeah I mean makes sense but it seems pretty counterintuitive I dare Trump to try to take away some of those Alaskan wilderness areas man I mean the way the real worry is that he's going to let people drilling them and they're going to destroy something and that's the real worry the real worry is the reason why he's releasing or relaxing some of these regulations is that he wants to let industry get in there and as soon as they start fracking and polluting wells and rivers and it's just it's fucking dangerous man it's just not it's something that if they do fuck it up it could be fucked up for a hundred generations yeah Jim we live in New York City not in the city I used to live in New Rochelle which is right outside the Bronx I lived there for seven years or so and if there if there wasn't the existence of Central Park and I lived in Brooklyn so Prospect Park if those two green places didn't exist while I lived there I would have probably lost my mind or just moved right I feel like these big areas of wilderness we have you know as we will not be okay as humans I mean like individually sure it is it gonna here's my worry my worry is that you know the general American public or the general public doesn't have enough connection or real life experience to know why to care so much and right you know that's a big deal and it's I don't there's a lot of different angles you can take on that there's that there's so much but there's just something that I wouldn't I wouldn't I mean if it really gets intense I'm going to have to basically drop what I'm doing and do everything I can to to stop them from harming these places I don't know well can be done my real concern is not just this what's going on now but the future and then also when you really consider it overpopulation I mean there's seven and a half billion people on the planet now in the most recent census yeah this is that's a half a billion increase over the last I don't know how many years but it hasn't been that many it was six billion just a few years ago I remembered that was a number that they bandied about like a decade or two ago yeah now it's seven and a half like what happens when it gets to be thirty like where we're gonna put these motherfucker what is the carrying capacity the most blabber yeah it's weird we're like rats on a sinking ship yeah we're just scrambling everywhere we're everywhere we're Lucky's gonna it's not another animal like us we're on every fucking patch of land you can find yeah it's weird but we're awesome except these wilderness spots right look at this so this is a current world population is that real how do they know that births today it's based off averages look at the births today you watch the the numbers just roll in oh my god the difference between the births today and the deaths today that's incredible that's why it's moving so fast he would dine slows fuck population growth today so the the average 139 thousand people today forty four million this year oh my god it's weird but that's scary and what's the u.s. 400 million I think were 300 plus Mexicans 326 it says see but that's they're not counting they're not counting all the people it snuck in I just don't think they know like when when they say Los Angeles yeah I say Los Angeles 20 million I'm like okay and what about the Mexicans yeah like kazuo and I'm not anti Mexican any way shape or form ladies and gentlemen don't I'm just looking at this pragmatically yeah there's a fucking shitload of illegal aliens here which I support also how many people are here that any given time that don't live here but are here on vacation or working here for like a week that's good yeah just added people for hundreds of thousands our management I mean yeah probably yeah when you get on the 405 and you head to San Diego and it takes you six hours and you go what is this like what have we done this mass of humans yeah there's so many of us but when you get here and you realize oh you you guys don't have any weather that's what it is yeah but you could also you know go 30 miles outside of City and have that same weather couldn't you yeah pretty much not the people yeah but you know you don't get the same taco stands right yeah I get it I like I love cities man I miss it I miss living in New York City I really do - yeah I wouldn't trade it at this point you know I was younger and single in New York had to get a fun time and moved to Montana have a family now it's kind of perfect for for where I'm at in my life so I don't really need anything else yeah that's the balance right it's like there is no really perfect place it's like there's places that are perfect for certain thing like if you're a comedian Los Angeles is the best place see Los Angeles in New York I prefer Los Angeles there's a lot of clubs there's a lot of comedians like most of the best comedians in the world live here it's a great place for us to network and we work together and stuff like that and if you if you want to be in that business this is probably the best place in the world do it so that's one of the reasons it keeps me around here plus the podcast and all that jazz but for peace of mind it's not the best place no does that actually fuck with you yes yeah yeah then the numbers of humans is just it's untenable you're close to North Korea yeah that's right that's right but if you know one man if a nuke California where are you gonna go you know I mean the whole thing's gonna be a mess yeah might as well you might be better off if it lands on your head that's what I always say about asteroids like you don't want to be that guy in the movie that like is like storing food in his basement and staying up all night to shoot vandals and because people are trying to steal your canned goods that doesn't sound fun not like a hello life no you don't want to live like that and then what happens died of old age died of old age protecting your canned goods yeah fight or flight your entire life fuck that out fuck that just let that rock land right on your fucking head boom I used to stress out a lot about where the perfect place to live was I just gave that up doesn't exist doesn't exist there's places you don't want to be caught dead like Florida I like Florida how dare you I like it I'm apart sir so my wife was raised on Captiva Island which is on the south coast okay like Key West is pretty dope yeah down there it's pretty yeah that's a good place I just want to drink and take naps or fish yeah yeah yeah there's some cool stuff down there but it's just florida's just so fucked up it's they've they've done such damage to Florida with their oxycontin regulations hmm you know one time there were more oxycontin prescriptions in Florida than they were the entire country combined seriously yes I didn't know it was insane well how is this recent as like recent in these in these late oh boy struggles mm-hmm yeah there was a documentary that did not called the oxycontin Express that was on vanguard and these people that went down there they went undercover and saw how easy it is to buy opiates down there and would they have these one-stop shops at these pain management centers we'd go in and say hey Doc my back is killing me doc said you needs pills go right next door so he'd write your prescription you go right next door you get the pills and then boom you're off to the races and they didn't have a database which meant that you could go to dr. Jamie and you say dr. Jamie my back's killing me dr. Jamie gives you a prescription you buy some opium pills or whatever the fuck they are and then you come to me and you go dr. Joe my back is killing me I'm like are they just being sourced there and then sold elsewhere or do we purposely made the regulations lacks there so they could make more money so people were buying them and then bringing them and selling them in Kentucky and up to Ohio the in that that's why they call it the oxycontin Express the highway that led from Florida to the rest of the country it's not the evil yeah it was sick and you know a lot of people lost their lives and a lot of people lost like who they were because of the addiction yeah the numbers were insane like Google the numbers like what war were the numbers of oxycottons or oxycodone I still don't know what the difference is and you see the reports lately showing that the life expectancy or the early death rate of middle-aged white men specifically lately has dropped for the first time in I don't know dozens or because of pain pills yeah all part of it no calling them deaths of despair how their being Jesus written about is literally deaths of despair it's it's yeah Jesus no it's heavy it's real heavy that's a heavy there's been a spate of articles over the last three or four months just that's really diving into Newtons guys it's men here it is doctors in Florida prescribed ten times more oxycodone pills than every other state in the country combined Wow and this is now right what is this article from this was actually from 2011 on NPR when the probably one that came out ah there we go I can get the updated one yeah doesn't matter it's just it's a crazy place that let's just put it that way despair is one of the scariest words right despair yeah and you hear about someone like despair and lonely those are two like really so that's the other word that they're using is is is loneliness has been there now measuring it and loneliness is is as or worse of a health issue in our country than smoking heavily smoking there there's all this there's this new only mrs. loneliness is isn't overpopulation coincided with loneliness this game that what we're thrust further and further closer together and we don't know each other and we're more and more disconnected and yeah and it's literally so there's a whole new I don't know how new but it's called interpersonal neurobiology which is the science of our brain wiring and physiological wiring on how were yeah this is one of the Articles loneliness might be a bigger health risk than smoking or obesity whoa that's dark dude it's dark but you know with the in my life the experience I've had in my life I mean when I read that I'm like of course don't ya duh it makes sense yeah we are disconnected people we are electronically digitally connected in a crazy way but in a human way and it's killing it literally is harming awesome people are dying and it's crazy it's a crazy stuff fascinating like feelings have an effect on your health like the feeling of loneliness the feeling of despair it's not like you could eat your vegetables you can get your exercise in and you if you feel despair and you feel loneliness your body is actually like being harmed by that but there's a real like practical reason for that and that's because we are when we come out as babies we are the most dependent individuals so like our you know what I mean like on your parents on your mother we are completely socially dependent when we're born completely and so you know Abram as Laos hierarchy of needs everything that it's like you know to be okay you have to take care of breathing and water and your basic functions but there's there's been studies recently by these neural biologists that are showing that these social needs are just ads or even like come before some of these physical needs this there's it's it's crazy man and there's literally a book called social by a guy named Matthew Lieberman like you got to check it out and so what they are finding is that there's like two parts of our operating brain and this is you know going to be me paring it down but one is the analytical thinking deciding thing and the other is this social awareness brain which is always like always checking in on how am I in relation to others and it's also the part of the brain that actually we could like the metacognitive part in the part that I can they call it mind-reading but really it's just it's just by us sitting here I can kind of get a sense of how you feel in what you're thinking right just by the the connection that we have and just it's it's part of who we are so when our analytical brain is offline this other one the social one pops on immediately so so what they're theorizing is that that is like the fundamental need for humans in safety and survival is how are we relating to each other as a group but it makes sense if you look I mean to me it makes sense in you know we are social animals we forget that I think but you look at other species of monkeys or wolves or whatever I mean you know there might be a period of time where say a wolf will get kicked out of a pack for a while and he'll go do his thing but it eventually come back to a pack it's not safe for us as humans and animals social animals like these to be isolated it's not and and so there's all these parts of us that just if we're not connected to other people in a in a very direct and true way there's these sort of deep down emotional and physiological fears that come up right and then they're real and that's what the neurobiology is showing which it's really interesting and we can just think about that but they're actually showing it now that if we're not really connected to each other we're going to be freaked out we're not going to be okay and you know I really believe that this really drives a lot of the internal struggle we have and we're really and this is part of you know getting into it that's part of my what I'm trying to bring into the world and my platform now is is just to you know stand up and say hey we need each other and we can do it it's not and for guys specifically right it's such a social stigma of ours to not be real or open or connected or vulnerable with guys and and it's it's cool to see the science coming out because it's I have all this anecdotal evidence of being out the wood in the woods with kids or being in a man's group with guys or running a retreat or whatever this is of how powerful it is to like set down all of our differences and just be there with yeah but now the science is really lighten it up and yeah man lonely I mean we can all think about a loneliness isn't fun it's not doesn't feel good but the other this is crazy too that they're showing that emotional pain lights up the same centers of our brain it's physical pain and that one study showed that an insult to someone had much more painful and long-term effects than slamming somebody with a hammer hitting their hand with the hammer so like our emotional pain literally actually exists in the body like it is actual pain and the reason that it's so uncomfortable to feel our emotions which it is you know I mean I'll just say it is is that it actually hurts like actually hurts I mean and there's like people say things like you broke my heart or I'm dying of heart ache or whatever but that the science is catching up and showing us that this pain is actual it's real and we're not addressing it we're not even aware of it it's really enjoyable that's deep you know it's interesting too because what you're saying about us being disconnected and how unhealthy it is now on unhealthy loneliness is it sort of confirms these ideas that I've always had that the human race itself is not like a group of individuals but a superorganism much like the human body is like the human body look requires all the bacteria and your gut all the skin flora all the different things that compose the actual physical structure of the human body whereas we think of it I think there's some nutty number of how much bacteria how many bacterial cells are in your body versus how many human cells right as if our outnumbers the human cells and it's just that we think of ourselves as I Mike and I put my shoes on and I go to work as I am Mike and but Mike you're a system you're a system of individual organisms that are collectively keeping this whole thing alive and when the imbalance is off like when someone takes an antibiotic and it fucks up their gut flora like literally you've like nuked a part of your civilization right and you know to try to save something like if you had some sort of a surgery and you're worried about an infection which is kind of like an invading army coming in and taking over part of your leg that you haven't operated on yeah it would be like slashing the tires of all of our transport system in the country like that's our gut that's like the first things in in and out right yeah and even has an impact on your your health mentally Oh in terms of like how you feel and your you know depression a lot of that is connected legitimately connect your diet and how that affects your gut flora and it affects the way your body produces serotonin and dopamine and it's bananas man oh yeah no I guess scientists bust the myth that our bodies have more bacteria than human cells decades-old assumption about microbiota revisited ok what's the new data 1 2 1 instead of toe so it's why are as much okay so they used to say it was 10 to 1 but now it's 1 to 1 okay wow that's still crazy man it's still like you're half bacteria I like that analogy though the body is is like a civilization or what let me think about if you're one of your I don't know one important neuron one cell neural cell or something decided just to go rogue and not be in connection with the rest of you right all right I don't that wouldn't work so well right I don't know I don't know what happened your body would probably get rid of it and get it out of there or I don't know maybe so I'm just really reaching here but it's some sort of rogue cell at that point right like yeah answer a cell or something I'd probably be attacked so yeah if you I think that if you take that analogy you know our civilization hears we're hurtin mmm really hurting because we're really not you know we are working together obviously in practical ways a lot of times you know work in commerce and you know the world is functioning but I think on a like a health and fulfillment level we're missing something pretty deeply yeah well also like let's talk about people that are disconnected from actual humans but connected in a cyber way yeah like how many people like really lonely in terms of like physical touch and communication with friends and yeah but they sit in front of their computer all day and they interact with people online which shows you like some of the most unhealthy communities you'll ever encounter are like online message boards and forums where people are just the anonymous and interacting with people without what we're talking about early like one of the reasons why I like to do podcast with a person in the room only on one podcast ever through Skype and that was with John Anthony West because he was living in New York and he's is this really important Egyptologist and I really wanted to talk to him is the only way I could get him to do is do it through Skype so I did one I prefer to sit there with people because I want to look at them I want to feel their energy I want to I feel like you and I do in this conversation you get to understand each other totally no I get it and I think I can hear in your podcast too and I think that you know and again I'm not gonna keep hitting the biology part but there's to me I think that there it means I can sense that there's a something else in me is getting is triggered right if we talk on the phone there is something and it might be this other part of your brain but it's lit up right now right because I can I can spatially you know so you can feel where you are we're I can you know sometimes all that all that yeah and it's it's that sense of connection it's that real I think and I think that is you know really apparent in your podcast is that you yeah you sit here and you really connect to somebody just run with it and I think that's it's a big it's a big thing man I mean I mean I think of like so part of what I do is I help proliferate this idea of men's groups across the country where guys get together for exactly what we're talking about it's just like you know the the intent of them is to get together challenges support each other's growth or personal girls you know and it's just a simple sort of protocol and a simple sort of design or sort of it's there's a structure to it but the whole point is it's remedial in a sense it's that you know our culture in general but guys especially in our culture don't have this this on fettered place to really show up and actually connect with each other right a scary thing I mean it's a it's it's a you know it's until now and still now but hopefully not too long I really like that stigma of not being connected is it's a big deal and and I think that back to the cyber thing that you're saying like we can we can get that hit of serotonin by getting a like on Facebook or Instagram we can get that but that pale I mean I don't even want to make a comparison toward actually sitting sitting down with somebody and actually feeling and and experiencing them yeah it's you can't make a comparison no it's not okay to me I don't yeah it's something different I'm in a tricky position because I I rely on social media to let people know that I have a podcast coming out you know like right before the podcast I was like yes your Twitter so I kept tweeted yeah and then I also like to promote comedy dates until that people know about cool shit that I find but the the interaction is so it's so weird like especially there's like a bunch of different kinds of interaction in stood ones because the conte is people all have blocked pages it's like they're blocking don't look at me and they just say nasty shit to people but they have these blocked pages it's like but I think that that's it's so funny how that seems to be like it's so common but it makes sense it's like they're blocked off and they're attacking people and saying shitty things to people and I'm not even talking about to me I'm talking about like when I go to someone else's page and I read kunti things I always go to that I go let's see if that guy's blocked yup he's blocked how funny like it's super common it's like this weird thing that people are doing with each other what's not real interaction and I feel like the people that are perpetrating it are extremely unhealthy which is why they're saying such nasty vicious shit in the first place it's really really odd they're lonely yeah I mean or in some way or disconnected or disenfranchised or they feel inferior yeah and so they lash out and want other people to feel the way they feel and so one what I feel when you say that like one thing that's missing there is empathy yeah in that in that interact whatever that interaction is yeah it's this removed story that you're making up some some like whatever you want the world you know yeah ejecting your shit out into the world you're not actually slowing down enough to you know you can sit here and give opinions or whatever all day long but you you know that no but to what you said though it is a weird position but I think the way that things are going so we we are using these tools social media to connect us and to get messages out but you know the way that the like the millennial generation is going is that what they value and what they want to spend their money on their meaningful experiences which means you know generally speaking a live in-person event there is a wave of things going back to this so you know adds a tool we need that I mean this is amazing you know this platform is podcast you have that touching so many people or just Twitter whatever it is but then it can be you know used for incredible good to bring people together I think and then and then so what's missing in that in that social media interaction I don't maybe it balances up maybe doesn't I don't really know it's a message in a bottle you just got to make sure it's a good message yeah oh you're not going to you're not you have to like be cognizant Lee aware I think of how other people going to receive it without actually getting that reception back from them you know it's and that's where it gets real weird and you have to like I think apply the same principles that you would and communicating with other people like without actually communicating with without seeing them without getting the social cues without looking them in the eye and we're we're a weird thing man this might not make sense but I'm going to bring it back to connect to the wilderness stuff what we're talking about in this sense of this sort of isolation and loneliness that we have and for me in my life where I learned to connect with others where I really learned to sort of give it up let go be present with people was in the wilderness it was it was doing that job out in the desert with kids mmm out there for 8 to 20 days at a time with these kids where that was my job it was my job to simply be with them and in a way to be with them in a way that was you know obviously what a lot of boundaries and everything but to be really real just to be totally real and honest and straightforward call bullshit when we saw bullshit be empathetic and it was just like this crazy crash course in human connection and it happened to be out in the wilderness but so what I think this is this is a little tie together but for me I started to feel way way way more human being out there in the wilderness like just being out there was quiet being out there where like you know if I sat on a rock I was sitting on a rock and the Sun was on me and all of my senses were engaged you know very aware of my body we were in these groups where we're being practicing being very aware of what we felt and being able to feel and express that and it just felt like you know since then for me it all comes back to to being out in the wilderness but since then all the other things I've engaged in meditation the men's group stuff all the other person even psychedelics things like that all the things that I've experienced all for me tie back to that thing and it it comes down to what I feel is like being totally as much as you can truly present yeah like just just here right right and you can write a Twitter message from that place of being present right that's fine I mean there's there's nothing necessarily wrong or bad about that but but don't check the responses every three minutes for the next six hours like a fucking maniac yeah yeah it's it it's a matter of I guess rationing rationing some of the some of that social media stuff or rationing some of that online interaction with other people I feel like as time has gone on I've gotten much more of my online interaction in like an educational form in terms of like interesting article right science things things that don't involve like social interaction or opinion as much as they involve really fascinating facts yeah like something that I found today they think that North America might have been settled by humans as much as a hundred thousand years earlier than they thought I saw that you see that I did yeah it's insane like that kind of shit freaks me out I love that kind of stuff because that that kind of stuff is just pure curiosity and pure wonder and the imagination goes wild thinking about what it must have been like to be one of these early humans yeah surviving or try trying to survive and they didn't we wouldn't be here and these these Macedon fossils they found them the bones were shattered and there's rocks nearby that do not seem like they were brought anywhere so it was 1992 they were doing highway construction near San Diego and they found these odd-looking bones and then they started doing these studies on them and they found their Mastodon bones and they didn't have the ability to do carbon testing and get a real accurate assessment back then some but now they do and so now when they're checking these bones and the way these bones had been shattered they're pretty sure that they had been shattered purposely like to get to the marrow Wow yeah so that yeah that's a great example of a positive benefit yesterday I I meditated for about 80 minutes or so and then I and I i sat up afterwards and I clicked on my phone and open facebook and the first thing I clicked on was say uh was a video of a woman in slow motion who stuck her ass out the window of a bus and just shat the street and I just I just had to laugh to myself man I'm just like in the zone and I was in this beautiful place and then open watch offices like oh my god it reminded me of Callan's one joke that shitting out of the car at 80 miles an hour yeah YouTube video I think yeah I've definitely seen too many of those videos I've seen too many videos of people getting beat up to too many peopie it's too many videos of people like skateboard accidents where they fucking flip and fall on their head it's hard to not watch it alright are very hard very it's very hard I mean I feel like there's something to be learned in those videos like I almost want to show my kids hey don't try to do flips if you don't know what you're doing and landing your fucking head but you know I mean understanding the consequences and having someone else do it so you can learn from them they've already done it so here learn this is what this is why you don't fuck with a tiger see look the guy got killed by the tiger now you know this is why you don't do this is why you don't do that like there's got to be some educational value in those yeah yeah I'm sure it's all I can reach a little bit it's a little bit anxious I mean we have some pretty strong instincts in us to let's say don't fuck with I know but dumb kids man it's like it's almost like dumb kids are there as educational tools for the survivors it's like you're supposed to see that one kid poke the tiger and get mauled they like shit I can't believe he actually broke into the zoo now Bobby's gone yeah you know like Bobby likes I mean that's the Joseph Campbell story of the hero that it goes all the way back to the one person who sacrificed their life yeah and got killed by the predator in front of the tribe and so that the tribe could survive and that they worshipped that person for doing that yeah yeah the hero goes off learning us and brings it back to the community and everybody's better for it yeah or you watch the hero get mauled well he's a martyr then you escape all the hyenas are eating him one of the things we taught or we worked with kids out in the woods was that we call the natural consequences right which which just means that when you do something something else happens there is a natural reaction and it was used a lot of times in opposition or instead of like a penalty system right so if you do something bad we could we could lay this punishment on top of you like what kind of stuff I mean oh well so for example if if somebody was going to harm themselves or somebody else you got tar pit you jerk yeah you got the e we put out a tarp and your shoes and everything will be taken away from you and you couldn't the tarp like that that was where you had to stay because you can hurt yourself you couldn't hurt anybody else Wow so that was you know and some of that to do with their shoes ate him know what did you put them in your tent or under Tarleton so they had a stay like under tarp is that the idea or if it's raining happened no I mean otherwise it's just it was just basically a timeout you know oh you know you got to stay here can interact with a group here by yourself whatever that's actually not the best example but I'll just use so if you swore you could some programs would you know maybe have a point system you get penalized her cry I yeah yeah I mean that was his name so soon yeah it wasn't really upheld I'm reaching for a good example here what I'm trying to say is that if you do something shitty generally you heard others around you and things things happen and so what we tried to show is that if kids would do something shitty to pay attention and and that they would see the harm they're creating themselves by career by harming other people in society just locking a kid up for you know breaking the law it would be you know maybe if you break a window you in this other way you would go and actually see and experience the the the shit that other people had to do to fix the window and and well you know more a reparative type of justice system rather than I got a penalty to do punitive that's right right so when you did take these kids like what was like the most extreme example someone was like really disturbed because I would imagine there would be like a big sort of like there was a lot of variables like some people would be kind of fucked up and some people would be really fucked up it's probably a spectrum right oh absolutely generally speaking very few where I would say actually fucked up very very very very very few was the case with most of them they were kids in families and then like communities that didn't know how to make space for and deal with them they didn't have mentors they didn't have people to didn't have parents that that gave them the right direction I don't know you know like being a kid is is you're supposed to test bound right it's like that's the part of your development and your ontogeny that's like you are defining your personnel you're defining who you are you need to test the boundaries and you know some of the kids made only two I probably work with at least a thousand maybe more kids altogether maybe that's a stretch a lot right for a lot for a long time and only one I went to bed at night worried I might get my head kicked in just one one kid and maybe one or two other kids that I walked away actually not enjoying being around them almost every other single one it was just like I walked away to do about the one that you worried about getting your head kicked in you know just kind of just kind of sat with it there's really nothing she did it was it just like initially or through the entire experience that was through the whole thing Oh jinzo's through the whole thing I was uncomfortable fuck that yeah what happened to him oh he said no no I had no idea you know there's I mean there's laws and there's things you don't generally get to stay in touch oh right this was actually at a state program so this was a in lieu of a jail sentence they came out so this kid was locked up Wow what did he do I don't remember I don't know probably stole the car or beat somebody up or I don't know it was just super aggressive he wasn't no but he had that he had the I had the feeling that he had no empathy for others pain right he couldn't feel that that's the that's the only time it ever got any interaction with any of those kids ever got you know that that sent chills through me you know that was like and maybe maybe I didn't feel in any practical sense that he was gonna hurt me but I had the sense that if he did he wouldn't care right Wow because there wasn't that connection the same thing we're talking about in a sense like that's a thing get dropped in a group of eight boys or young men and I was so funny like you could you know we worked with therapists with therapists comment all this stuff but all like the fundamental thing I took away from that experience was that in order for these for these guys to grow up and sort of move on and get going in their lives you know what they needed was just somebody like me to just to show what like we're really not complicated right yeah and and so just let them air things out and talk about better ways to do things and sort of get some perspective now you know we maybe talked about this last time but then they'd go home and not necessarily have that support anymore and be back in their old arena where we're you know they're old friends and they're old family dynamic and all that and it end it you know it's hard that's it's a hard way and so I left that whole experience just feeling very strongly that a weekend as a community and society to just wait better with some simple simple changes we can do better raising our boys we just can has done it when you have someone that has no empathy though what can be done to instill empathy and someone who lacks it if anything so I don't know you know if you go on that far end of the spectrum where there's nothing I don't know and I don't know if that's possible but I do know that it's a muscle we can practice empathy is something that right that we can get better at and that we can pay more attention that's fine a fucked up young kid without empathy like how what what sort of motivation do they have to gain empathy if they feel like no one has shown it towards them or I don't know what so that's that's it that's it right then so the motivation that you could you could show is for them to if they could let you caring about them really in if they could really feel cared about and what's incredibly sad but real is that I think some people you know grow up in a their brains develop they develop as humans where they don't have that and so the actual wiring the actual state too hectic to receive that isn't there I think that that is possible to gain and you know there's been what is that a child called it you know have you heard of that book yeah yeah I mean I think it's possible in the much in the less extreme cases I mean in a sense that that's kind of a lot of what I do is help guys become more empathetic and the not just for the benefit of others there's a benefit of themselves the reason why I brought this up there's a podcast on radio lab about Bernie Madoff okay and where this guy contacted Bernie Madoff he sent him letters and then finally Bernie Madoff called them and they did this interview together where the way it works in prison I guess at least the prison where Bernie Madoff is you get 15 minutes to talk on the phone and then you have to wait 15 minutes before you could talk again and then 15 minutes again and so they this is how they did the interview like 15 minutes on 15 minutes on 50 and after a while he sort of gained his trust and he went deep into how this whole deception started and how Bernie Madoff if you don't know the whole story Burning Man off is the guy who had this gigantic Ponzi scheme and stole billions of dollars from people and yeah it's called Ponzi supernova is the Radiolab episode Wow and one of the things that was the most chilling was how little empathy he had towards the people that he ripped off right whose lives had been destroyed his son committed suicide people like literally went from having all this money to being so broke they were like dumpster diving he didn't care he didn't give a fuck yeah I mean he had no empathy and he's a monster it's really it's really interesting to see you like this guy's reaction to Bernie Madoff lack of empathy and realizing somewhere along the line like oh this guy does not care there was one of the things that the investigators had said about him that it didn't seem to bother him at all that he had done this to these people that would what bothered him was that he had gotten caught mm-hmm but it didn't bother him that these people had been devastated what bothered him was like that people had made money weren't giving that money back like he called one guy and told them the guide made like nine billion dollars he was worth nine billion dollars rather it's 7 billion of it had come from Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme he told me how to give that seven billion dollars back got heart attack drowned in his pool yeah which is kind of hilarious because like you can't live with two billion yeah I guess well maybe it's not liquid maybe couldn't give back the seven billion maybe it was impossible as tied up in real estate and Holdings and this and that and the other thing but isn't amazing that one person's reality could I I would love to step into his head for a second I want you to Bernie made up just to see what it felt like I think that'd be very helpful to be able to step into that because just to see I can't picture it yeah just can't picture it well I could also couldn't picture not being able to live with two billion dollars either like what what is it I eighths that that weirdness of the game right is like you score 100 points you want to score a thousand points scored you want to score a million score a million one score billion it's like you never stop and people never they never achieve peace like that's what I always used to say about Bill Gates like why the fuck is Bill Gates still working yeah giddy hear about him being the richest and now he's not I mean he really did sort of find some sort of a balance and now almost all of his work is done towards humanitarian efforts he's you know he donates a lot of money a lot of charities I mean a lot of really good work like post his Microsoft career which is like really kind of unique that a guy sort of found his way found his bet kept a shitload of money yeah don't get me wrong yeah you know apparently he's got some stupid fucking house with a submarine in the Pacific Northwest where like if someone tries to break into his house you fucking escape and a submarine troll like I act by his house one sec did you yeah did they let you the Secret Service fucking swarm you and ask you where you going yeah nobody I couldn't see anybody they're probably only are you allowed to just walk by his house how's that work well it was a private island at least the place that I was at I was just told by the guy I was with we were actually throwing crab pots out of a kayak and I was just told it was his like house I don't his main house might have been one of his houses but we were you know I don't know 50 yards off the shore and I was a private island a private that's when your yeah ballin yeah yeah you're on island you know as an island Tyler Perry you gotta make so shitty movies and TV shows those awful shows Tyler Perry yeah he has a private home he has a problem where I don't know you can't know you know I actually feel uh some sadness for Bernie Madoff really oh yeah man I mean that's I don't know he's as tortured as you know I think it's harder to feel empathy for him but he's as tortured of human is I don't know pick anybody maybe right yeah maybe maybe not I I'm project I don't know that's a fact but I don't know if you if you're hurting that many people are you kidding me like you aren't feeling you don't feel all right yeah you know it's a it's a weird line like when do you feel bad for someone do you feel bad for Jeffrey Dahmer like how did he become that cannibal murderer guy how did how did that happen you know what what causes someone to go from like you have a boy what causes someone to go from your cute little baby boy to being some monster yeah like how does that what is it about people yeah that makes it possible for someone to go even not for to a monster but how about that young boy that you were working with it had no empathy being worried about sleeping near like what happens like the developmental process of a human being is way more fascinating to me as an adult with children that it was when I was a young man when I was a young man and I was single and I didn't have any kids I just thought people were fucked up and some people weren't right people that are fucked up fucked them and death penalty and like kicked her ass and so I've been obsessed with this my all my life really gonna meet absolutely like what what is this process of growing have you ever heard of the novel Siddhartha know by Hermann Hesse HESA I'm not trying to say that but it's a classic novel author from Germany and and it it chronicles the life of a young guy named Siddhartha but the whole book what it is is it goes through his entire life from when he was born until he dies and in it are these like very specific stages of life so he's you know he's like young wandering years and then he needs to work so he goes to a city and he learns from from a trader and then he needs to learn about love so he so he gets with a prostitute but but all in these big stages and that book did something to me at an early age I just got obsessed with this process of maturing and there's a there's a term for called ontogeny which is the the process of an organism's growth over their lifespan it's just this natural sort of rocketry then ontogeny of a tree is it is a you know a seed that drops and then it sprouts and then it roots and then it grows and then it dies and that and it is yeah it's been under the session of mine and you know getting thrown into that work of working with kids and yeah it's it's uh I'm so fascinated by it and I don't have obviously any you know solid here's how it goes but but I've been looking into it from you know a long time and I just I think that anyway back to the book the I used to read that book out loud in these groups of kids I was working with sit around fire at night and I'd read a knob you know be out there for days I never had to read a novel out loud and uh you know it's just something poetic not about just the words but about watching the life someone's life unfold as a whole story and watching them you know yeah I don't know grow up and it's just it's this weird fascination I have and specifically because it all come and keep saying it comes back to that time in the woods but I only worked with males with boys and it wasn't I didn't choose to do that I felt like do a lot of girls do the same sort of therapy yeah yeah I think but they must go with women to is probably a problem with men going out there with girls they'll do mixed leadership groups like a male and a female even for both boys and girls but yeah there's always a girl with the girls but yeah man I just got obsessed with this what what how do we grow up what does it look like what does it feel like how come it's not happening because that's a big part of what I felt as I looked around is that I think that a lot of adult physically adult men walk around with parts of themselves that are still there six to 18 right you know like there's there's this human maturation processes human journey that we all have available to us that I you know I think we're too busy a lot of times to let it actually flow and happen well I think that true that's true but I also think that there's a maturation process that comes from overcoming obstacles a lot of people just don't encounter they don't encounter difficulty so they don't learn about themselves that's part of it but I think that a lot of times even if they do encounter difficulty they don't let themselves actually feel they don't let themselves experience it right like everybody has shitty things happen to them but you can keep that shitty thing at a distance from you right you don't even like kind of address it you can sort of I don't know act out against it but unless you actually feel you know I mean think about and this gets into things like trauma and resilience and how people are able to move on from hardship right and and a lot of the research there's a psychiatrist called Bessel van der Koch never heard of him no fascinating dude he's a he started working with the VA in Boston and worked with returned vets from from Vietnam and then did this whole lifetime of study about trauma and how it comes into humans and how you can move through it and I can heal it and all this stuff and it it just it basically comes down to being able like to be more resilient to be able to get over things so say death in the family or an attack or an assault or whatever whatever that trauma could be that if you don't allow the body and the your system to actually go through feel and process what's going on you lock it up you lock it up you like it and it it doesn't I mean it's almost like it gets implanted in you somewhere and then it's just like this fester Fester's and it's the cool thing is is that the you know the science now is when the very specifics of this it's not just I mean it's still theory right but it's so I feel like I got off what we were talking about there but yeah I feel like like you said being able to overcome things of course absolutely and part of that is just to me again speaking more from a male perspective here but part of that and I think a lot of what our culture says is okay is let's horse our way through this right let's force a let's push harder let's let's conquer our fears on our feelings that's let's not address it let's just push right run through the wall really or take antidepressants whether well right so that's it that's the thing and there's this other whole way to get through hardship which is by actually surrendering to it and letting you're in this like brilliant system that we have as humans to process it and get through it right right and that's that's a way to wholeness and health in some ways I think they're both important like yeah you need to be able to you know ignore the pain and power your way up that mountain or or save somebody that's getting hurt or whatever and then there's this other part I think it needs to be in balance which is accepting what's happening and getting through I yeah just a way to accept what's happening and let your body do what anything well also think there's an extreme lack of discipline that a lot of people have and that discipline a lot of it comes from overcoming difficult obstacles and understanding the work that's required to get things done making these little leaps and bounds making these improvements in your life getting better at things I think those things are really critical to the human mind yeah I think the mind has desires and one of the big desires is it has a desire for improvement and is desire to achieve goals and there's a lot of people that these goals are laid out by other people these goals are like graduating from third grade graduating from fourth grade a lot of shit that you don't want to do so these goals are meaningless to you so you never feel like you've accomplished anything that you actually want to do and next thing you know what you're a 35 year old man working for an insurance company you don't want to be there yeah don't have any real part of you that you've nurtured you've just sort of plugged you into these other weird shapes and conformed to them and then you just want to go fucking crazy and probably bitched about it all the way along probably yeah you probably complained and you're annoying and you're a whiny little twat and you're out there just have clogging up the freeway be fitted people and giving them the finger I mean that's a lot of humans that you run into that's a lot of it's a lot of this life so yeah and that points directly to what you know I do and what I'm building is is that so you take eight of those guys and you set up a system you say alright in this space right here fuck all that we're going to be actually honest and say what we're feeling but maybe can't even really access so like all that frustration all that shit or whatever it could be anything that's so hard for people to do right like what what kind of techniques do you employ to get someone like say if you got some guy who's closed off and he's been bullshitting his way through life and then all sudden here he is this 35 year old guy that's really troubled it's in a room with you how do you get that guy to open on safety and say I'm leading by example and being vulnerable by example and when somebody's it's part of this connection like sitting down with somebody that if you after one of these last retreats that when the guys came up to me said safety is the new ayahuasca which is maybe a strange thing to say but he said he'd been all over the world doing drugs trying to find growth trying to find himself and we went went to this retreat and all we did was sit down and say okay our intention all we're doing what we actually are doing here is just making this you're not going to be you're going to be supported you're not going to be laughed at like like it's a safe space to do it and then you just you dive in and lead by example and that example like plugs others right into it like it's this amazing like symbiotic thing that happens so right and and people just sometimes break open sometimes crack slowly open but you know all of a sudden so maybe after 35 years of only being other people's program you get in touch with what you actually feel what you actually want and who actually ours just like this fucking it's like holy shit I think for a lot of people it's really difficult to try to do what you actually want to because you've spent so much time rewarding yourself with material items for these little edge accomplishments that you've become in debt yeah and you really can't escape the system I mean that's it's totally a real problem with people they have a car that they're leasing they have a house that they're renting or that even worse that they bought and then they they're stuck and then they don't know what the fuck they do they have to keep this insurance company job yeah and it's just rotting them out from the inside totally yeah I mean there's like a whole society built on on trying to keep you not who you are right since I think you know but so what we're finding which is really amazing is that if you stay on that surface level if you stay on that sort of I don't know like so-so trying to improve yourself it goes so far but it's kind of like an iceberg thing right so like if your goal is to make more money right and and here's your goal and you're going toward it and you I don't know listen to podcasts or you do all this stuff and you try to figure out how to do it how do i how do I do it all right and you keep hitting the wall you keep getting sort of thrown down and you don't really understand that underneath meanwhile is this massive sort of like pent up shit and if you address that massive pent up shit then all of a sudden getting to that goal is a whole different story it's a whole different story it's a it's a it's like always trimming that like if you need to get rid of a tree in your yard but all you do is every day you chop the leaves off the leaves off but if you address that the roots the deeper stuff and you know and again there's a stigma against that especially for dudes right so there's like guys don't want to go to therapy guys don't want to get into woo woo hippy spiritual shit or they do and they're annoying sure right they don't want to get into it right exactly and I mean I don't know I know if I pull this off or not but I feel fluent in in like you know bro culture and flow you know like I've gone down that spiritual route too and we recognize when the spiritual route is legitimate and when the spiritual route is like a ruse as well like sometimes even the spiritual route it's just something that someone has plugged themself into to try to find some meaning exactly meanwhile it's not authentic exactly so how are you doing this if you don't mind me interrupting like what you when you so you're you're planning on taking guys like say say if I'm that 35 year old guy that works an insurance company for example and I'm just fucked up but I just know I'm going crazy man I need to do something hey this seems interesting to me that wilderness therapy what does it mean Dan Dodie what does that mean how do I get involved in this and how do you how do you get me out of this rut oh man yeah so three things we're offering right now and the first is is the wilderness route which is a like a six-day expedition and you can sign up pay some money and go in the woods and change your life like pretty quiet mountains we'll go fishing well and all along I'll set up this sense of safety in this community and this sense of brotherhood and how many guys to go with you know 10 or 12 for that just you and these 10 people a couple of the leaders in my couple leaders all right because you have to deal with interpersonal disputes and all the nonsense you're going to have to she's likely encounter right yeah and so I'm working with some guides to just take care of the logistical stuff so that I can manage the group the group stuff more that's one offering that's that's that's a that's kind of our capstone offering we're doing weekend retreats and we've been doing these for the last six months and they've been just catching on fire about 30 guys at a time in a lodge been doing them in the Berkshires so out in the woods a couple hours from New York City 30 guys there and just set up sort of an intense weekend experience of practicing the stuff and we'll hike and do trail work and all that stuff but more importantly do with the the self you know diving into yourself with in the presence of other guys which is just you know I've done therapy I've been in therapy I'm not a therapist but when it's been very helpful like I before if you work with a good therapist that really is really good I couldn't recommend more but there's something about this these men's retreats which I totally understand sound unattractive to a lot of guys I just sounds like a lot of butt fucking yeah of course of course that that is that is your that is the big first sort of response right woods huh yeah tell me more well I can be open in the woods yeah what we made at one of our advertising videos for it and it just starts out that a guy stands up and says yeah I heard about a men's retreat and I thought the first thing I thought was this is going to be fucking awful and so I get it but yet I think we're getting further enough along where the guys that are going through this are literally coming back with the most positive feedback that I could I couldn't write the shit like like changing their lives and just like literally because it's you know back to that thing we're offering a place for them to accept a part of themselves that's been offline for a long time it's a big fucking deal it's really yeah it's also probably also a big fucking deal to just separate from the high for a little bit and just be outside of cellphone range and be in the woods and just take a big deep breath of fresh air and look around at the wilderness and just realize that this is this is reality as well and you've been plugged into this civilization reality this is this city this urban environment which is entirely unnatural and has only been a real thing for the past couple hundred years we literally didn't exist for the gigantic swath of humanity that that existed before that yeah I think that it waffles are the right word there oh really I think it does a couple deep things it lights up this this this neurobiology that that of us has social animals I think it goes back to more of a tribal sense of living - it's not all of a sudden you you went from being isolated and lonely to heaven 30 dudes who would honestly fucking do anything for you in that moment then I got a buddy a good buddy as a returned Special Forces operator and he sits in my men's group in Bozeman with me and really struggled with coming home and then found our group and within a month his life was back on track like just killing it man just like kicking ass and you know I mean there is a connection between and I wouldn't say the general military but the Special Forces you know you read books and hear about the aspect of Brotherhood and how they're there for each other you know this is definitely a very different venue but the I think the bond and connection that that is created out of it is and this is you know from from his mouth to is it's he went you know I don't know how many years several years in the Special Forces living within close connection to guys got thrown home was all son isolated and they came into our group and just had this this uh closeness again and it just BAM just like back to back to killing it Wow yeah yeah it's it's I mean I very aware I mean it's I've been scared to start speaking about this for years man I mean it's very uh to me even I look at advertising for similar man's program something like that it just so turned off right it seems weird it doesn't think people need resets he needs some sort of reason and we've talked about this before about we've both experienced those resets through psychedelics yeah or or through these awning trips you know in these wilderness trips like but I think people get caught up in the momentum of their daily existence and all the requirements of that daily existence and they become overwhelming you know like we were talking about like though your lease that you have on your car or your mortgage that you have in your house and the credit card bills that keep coming in your student loans you need to eventually get to blah it's a fucking overwhelming grind yeah and sometimes people need something that removes them entirely from it for a certain amount of time that allows you just the fresh air not not just literal flesh air but the metaphorical fresh air of all allowing you to just separate from the all these weird influences and all this weird energy and momentum the momentum of you the life you've created or that's been created for you that you're sort of trapped in yeah yeah man I'm I'd fit so that reset thing I mean I I think I want a warning is that if you start getting a reset and I mean from my own experience I need it pretty regularly you know so the actually the biggest goal of this everyman the organization I founded is to our goal is to get a million guys in man's groups because that is the same and it happens so this last retreat had 30 guys show up about 20 of them wanted to immediately get into a weekly group to to basically continually and regularly experience the same thing it's like a hit you know there's a thing too about men in this culture where there's not a lot of sympathy towards men that are struggling it seems like there's this thought that men are the patriarchy and we're dominating the world and we're almost like subhuman we're responsible for all these issues so men with issues like Oh cry me a fucking River what about women with issues what about trans people with issues what about gay people with issues what about black oh Jesus Christ like a regular white guy with issues like your issues are bullshit okay but it doesn't matter you are you are you can't change the fact you're a white guy so if you're a white guy with problems nobody gives a fuck can't they see that it all connects though no they don't see that on they don't why cuz I makes everybody else unhappy to what talk man they don't because it's not convenient for their narrative the narratives that you're responsible for all the problems in the world even though you're just Dan Doty from Bozeman Montana yeah no I get it but it's it's so I mean that's one of the most powerful so the podcast that I'm launching is a self-improvement podcast for guys but instead of going to experts and saying hey you know what's the best morning routine that you can do designing a routine or whatever I'm talking to regular guys and asking them to share you know more vulnerable than they would normally would because that's what happens in these scenarios is that we learn from each other just as simple human fucking beings just like you know like one guy might share that he's having trouble with his son for example with his kid he doesn't not it and you know like no matter what I don't care like a bunch of other guys will say like holy shit I thought I was the only one feeling right you know and it's just all of a sudden you and it's back this isolation thing you think that you're well think we're fucking special right we all think that we're so unique and the actual if we actually took the time to connect with one another we'd be like oh wow we have a lot like and just that just that is enough to drastically change somebody's day and what's motivating you to venture off because you were working for 0.08 and make ya meat-eater and Anthony Bourdain's show and all these different shows what's motivating you to step away from that and start doing this this is what I've always wanted to do and this is what I've been what compels you I want to help guys yeah yeah I just I and I know that I can you know even if it's just one guy whatever it is but working out there with these kids and seeing all this it just it just left me with the the deepest deepest satisfaction fulfillment satisfaction but also a sense of purpose it's like and then I tell you what man I had I had a boy I had a son last year and when he came out and there was something inside me said if you don't do if you don't act on what you know you can bring if fuck you fuck it like this is your kid like like there is I don't know I'm also you know I was born a but fairly sensitive I could feel I was born a sensitive kid right I could feel other people's pain and when I'm you know working with these kids and now these men I mean I don't know I want I want good for people right I want good for you I'm good for my family and I want good for I I don't know I feel connected and I want to do what I cannot and it's a noble purpose I'm just curious about like what I mean you you have a very promising career in a lucrative career with 0.0 so for you to leave that it has to be like a really compelling sort of a pole yeah I mean that job in that career was in a May the wild ride and in some ways felt like a you know a temporary sidebar from what I'm really meant to do you know I've been other than writing for a long time and yeah I think that whatever this thing is that I'm doing it it shows me somehow or I don't maybe that's I don't know if that's true or not but I know how long can you ignore the thing inside you that screams at you that says you have to do this you have to do this or you want to do this yeah well you shouldn't yeah you definitely shouldn't yeah I mean it's obviously beneficial and it's obviously something you're compelled to do and it's obviously something that you feel like is very fulfilling so why ignore it so when you start this podcast it's out its out doubt what's called it's called the everyman podcast - everyman podcast yeah EVR ymin what about checks oh fuck off fuck off chicks you got your own you got Oprah okay I know I mean that's a good question I don't think it's uh why why'd you spell it that way could you cash it out of people well because the full one was like a lot of money or wasn't available the way it was just a practicality thing okay yeah evie e ry ma n was not even a ry so e v ry folks Eve ery man podcast how many episodes do you have out to now and then yeah - right are you doing them every week like how are you doing it I'm
