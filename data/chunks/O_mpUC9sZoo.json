hello freak bitches like going to a curry restaurant one of my buddies is Roy Choi you haven't talked to him forever but we used to live next he did he's a chef mmm-maybe pat him on the podcast and he took us he did he does the Kogi taco truck yeah no no you did you think Eddie Huang nope he came in with Eddie Wang but Roy Choi is a very famous chef one of the most famous famous chefs in LA right now episode was this type in Roy Choi Joe Rogan I promise you I watched it and I was like so he was with Eddie yeah no no he was no I'm certain well I fight that Google's right nope I'm a hundreds in certain Eddie Wong came in one time with the guy that was in that movie of the interview I'm I'm going to go to the match on this one and you're wrong so Bert Kreischer is going deep and he's taking chances with his predictions he's challenging young Jaime on the air boy I think we got a little too high before this show we got a little ridiculous Roy Choi misspelled it Roy Choi for Joe Rogan experience with Brian Stann hmm what no that's definitely not it says you're it says Roy Choi I promise you well Brian Stann was definitely by himself kids right can someone please just tweet the fucking answer to me excite me I thought I and not too far to fuck to do that okay but I promise you as I am I know he's wrong but I'm my god damn right Roy Choi fucking Jaime the Roy Choi created the taco truck Craig yeah he's good friends with Anthony Bourdain and sorry maybe you're spelling it wrong racist whoa dare you so cast upon him a moniker that cannot be shaken so anyway I don't even know where I was going with this point these four whined it's getting hot in here all sorts of different types of alcohol we were probably out of wine but I don't know where my point with this going oh he took her he took me and my wife too he took me and my wife too to Koreatown to go eat Korean barbeque because he wanted to teach us real Korean barbecue like what they not the kind that we believe it is and it was interesting we went in there and no one's spoken no not only were there any white people no one spoke English at work there and so we actually were complete and total tourists in our own town and just sat and watched him order and and he just was like don't worry and it was really fascinating experience would I want that place to ever go away never in a million fucking years I want those places to last as long as it son of a bitch champagne mother fucker brought out champagne somebody damn is this because you're wrong this but uh but like I believe in that I don't but I'm but then again on the same liberal side of the fence because I am maybe I'm a libertarian or whatever I am I'm a liberal I'm a conservative liberal you're conservative liberal yeah what do you liberal about like gay right every rights all rights all human rights all female gay rights transgender you name it I don't want you to feel like shit if I can help that that's my job as a comic my only goal is to make people laugh why would I ever want anyone to feel bad about their day that's not my mo beautiful and what do you conservative about like blacks know the right to tell that joke to you yes because that's what I'm conservative as well is that conservative anymore yes it is because it still conservative conservative value to be able to express yourself in a way that it'd be offensive did you see that right that recent ruling young Jaime pull this up it's kind of interesting the court ruled against this idea that there should be laws against come down brothers about to release the Kraken he's gonna open this cork and Brian is terrified burp it like he's never been the gun range hit me in the eye before oh there you're partying with the wrong people son why should i mix it into that wine and make a fine rose a Zinfandel or some shit a wine cooler that's like a watermelon lime cooler James Bartles and Jaymes strawberry right and strawberry I'm not drinking drink during the day take one of the gin hey uh listen I'm hammered we're all stoned - you said you might take it on the chin after giving a story about a man massaging nobody I'm really like down in the Internet not backing me up with this Roy thing and I started he's right I'm pretty sure right he's right on with all the time is that racist it's just a gong we get away with the gong before anybody gets mad no it's Roy Choi sorry son I'm looking at all the Eddie Wong episodes he was in here he wasn't in here sweetie it's okay I've worked here building and I pretty much remember every single one you would it would have to be super old-school like to the point where I don't remember it anymore last time you were on the show we drove home together or the time before and you talked about your friend so it must have been within the last three months then I only know I've done Bourdain show and he's done your podcast and he didn't either for me so I remember going like like a per day and I get it why wouldn't you go on with Bourdain one of the greatest people on television for chefs but I was like podcast was like I was like I was like and I get why you do Joe but like throw me a bone Roy like we were he's a good guy he's a great guy but his uh no I don't wanna get removed from the podcast Eddie Wong and Shane Smith I guarantee let's maybe another Asian guy in here with them was it was uh was the dude from great he was from that show the show off was a he played who was it off the boat great fresh off the boat okay house but now I know what I'm doing tonight it's no big deal dude you can be wrong I think you're wrong don't attach your whole life to this it's just too hard to win in life some certain losses they're gonna come your way and you got a regroup and you got to pick up the cases paces the pieces and move on with life Burke I'm a big fan of your podcast and you are of your pot you know person i watch all of them Joe Rogan how could you ever say that that Joe Rogan's wasn't saying anything either so yeah maybe Joe found it I don't even think anybody named Roy has been on the pot he came out with David show yep he did David was been on a few times maybe he came to one the Icehouse chronicles was it a nice house chronic no I'm going through this was it on David's show I did David show once there's access it was 592 with David shows the one episode I wasn't here oh shit could have been the one episode with Jamie was on 563 that can't be that sure wasn't gave it shows podcast that Wendy Joe Rogan was on that podcast so could have been I think that's makes more sense number 592 horrible podcasting no it's not I have a hard time believing we've actually done 750 podcast I was all 592 769 760 969 you've done 769 podcast indeed preposterous it's great man I like what you did and I don't know I think I've maybe told you this one night fucked up I'm I'm very I'm envious in the sense that what you've done only only that I could not do it begin it now what you did is you kind of took you kind of took the Renaissance to yourself and you allowed people that think differently than you to come to you and talk to you and you got to kind of like soak in their information like a sponge has a stand-up man that is like that's the fucking that's what we all should be doing instead of just sitting around and going what does this guy think about airplane what is it you know what I mean you really kind of broaden the spectrum of what you want to talk about on stage and I remember here in Chris Rock say that he got invited to Cornell Wallace's house for Sunday dinners and right before he did his most monumental hour and he was like you know it was really cool I didn't say anything I just would sit and listen to all these great glad Wallace or West Cornel West my dad hey Burt Roy Choi was at an episode of getting dug with high with horatio sanz hiroshi oh and may have often been confused yes yes you are it happens let it go okay just embrace the loss take it on the chin move forward soldier on sir it's no big deal with Burt wanted minute are you ready for me to debunk a scientist hoping here we go my crop moment dear scientists is spent your whole life figuring this out I just shot you down so I build a time travel me and Brian our time travel consists of a bottle of champagne a lighter and a joint right McKenna's pretend that that's the time machine right all right we invent the time machine god oh my god we right now we can travel back to that moment three days ago we can try to travel back to this moment or three days from now I can say
