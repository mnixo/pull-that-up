in New York we were talking I was doing like the 8th and you were doing a 10 or something like that oh but it probably one of Thursday oh you probably did something was happening we're going it close to each other's long yeah maybe maybe 15 years ago yeah oh yeah okay I've been there in a while I work I've been New York in a while I stopped going New York Caroline's a weird one done Caroline it's like touristy all tours and foreigners right in Times Square right yeah yeah yeah it doesn't feel like you're doing stand-up in New York feels feels weird oh yeah it feels like what people want New York to be but they're from somewhere else yeah good percentage of them are wanna Malo great great club oh yeah it's just you know it's different than the cellar or you know Dangerfield's is my favorite Joey Diaz was just down there and he said he did Dangerfield's like five six nights I never did Dangerfield nobody does Dangerfield know it's half full all the time it's amazing that they still around yeah they're still around somebody's got to be selling coke all the time to keep that place like that but the name alone bro probably brings people in but it's an iconic place man yeah New York I say I've been back to saying Letterman gone I don't go do his show anymore I haven't been to Caroline's in their mouth years four years but you do a lot of clubs we were talking about another 40 40 some clubs Wow you know what he clubs a year you know my agents come to my house in January and they tell me all the time I got that year they tell you what date we go over we go over every one all right June 15th is you gonna be in so y'all make the money we gonna get yeah okay let's go that's a goal so we do 47 club as a man is it too much work but 52 weeks in a year yeah that's crazy I gotta have some time off what about me yeah worry about this money but when you have time off all you do is complain about not being on the road complaining about people telling me what to eat what to drink oh my goodness yeah man you keep the wolf off your back that's right so I give him yet I give me a little tease the real problem is that travel though that's all it is too much air travel over and over and over again and then we were freaking out about eight thirty sevens and you were explaining to us that yeah mostly they use them in overseas and some South African countries they when they ending in Asian country they use them well they had like two planes that just get lost right one from pilot Lex Friedman is a software engineer and uh he specializes in AI is a professor at MIT and he was explaining to me basically the software glitch was making it nosedive yeah yeah yeah that's not that's not something I would want to hear huh need to get my seat well you if you're a software engineer you have to you would have to up the pilot or copilot to let them know like hey someone has to obviously they all know what they're doing in the cockpit but does someone know what to do if the computers going down it's a really good question do they have any training in how to reboot computers or is there a bypass or a workaround for the computers in Lex does artificial intelligence that's mostly what he does he works on like cars autonomous cars and planes and stuff and he was talking about as these things get more and more updated he just glitches happened it happens all the time with your phone right you get a new bug and Twitter just crash on you all the time and they release an update but if you're on a fucking plane you what are you doing yeah and how do you react what's it Wow you'd have to go through a flight simulation and scary there's a bug in the plane here we go run over all that software before they put it on a plane you know they had um the plane that crashed flows the last plane crash that was where in Africa I don't know it was to ensure that one was was one Russia no no see yeah no I think it was in Africa anyway those pilots are trained to the hand they to the hilt they train those pilots but they don't know themselves some of the guys who's training to people it's what the heck's going on it was a pilot that was off work that was on the plane just before this plane crash same plane they had trouble before and he came out of his seat and went up to the cockpit and cockpit and and saved the plane looking down the aisle watching that guy walk into them ya know you'll see no one day protect that uh they put the food cart in front of the yeah yeah heart-stopping anybody now but then they got a bolt on the door yeah those all those doors the other car but the pilot is in the bathroom taking a boo-boo yeah they don't have their own pilots bathroom they blocked the area full cart there see I've seen that mini tab that's a weird movie don't you have like a dedicated thing for it why is the food cart yeah the thing you don't you have like a should have a gate leap that right they should have another door just like they got on the cockpit yeah they should have like some like a like you know they do all those metal gates in front doors windows click clamp it down well they knew that didn't work out they had to riot in 66 and they tow all them down oh the gates I was watching them guide you to the little bit that fucking flew open yeah what could you have someone from bum-rush in the cockpit those flight attendants are not gonna stop oh no he'll well they should probably prepare planes with a flight attendant who has training like that in the future like a female or male that's too much money too much money too much money to it security the pilot is locked in the bathroom the other pilot and the stewardess is locked in the in the booth when it was flat a plane so you ain't getting in there anyway I guess yeah unless when the party come at the bathroom well then he's not when he open the door but they got other guys the stewardess gotta come out he gotta go in it's too complicated now getting to people this sitting now I'm gonna know what's happening you ain't gonna jump up I also let it burn that'sthat's chaos on a plane if you start seeing all that that you're talking about Wow don't you think turbulence is chaos I was on a plane once - who's almost got into a fight lady stop serving them one guy was Paul was putting his luggage in a spot above another dudes head and the guy said that's for my stuff and he said no whoever gets there first is the one who gets it he's like bullshit he's like grabbing his I'm sorry sir take that crap buddy eat that I was a crazy tough guy huh one tough I didn't know I went um oh the plane is full now yeah he one seat next to me open he gonna put his stuff up get my stuff trying to find my my earphones put yourself up there before you just come in there's a place for you above my head I'm in my bag you don't think that's mine yeah yeah because you were going through your bag to fight this stuff up people just look for an opportunity to be a dick yeah I think planes are the closest that people get to walking that emulates road rage we have a line yes it's the closest thing like when people get up and they get up too soon and then like they're pushing forward already you're like come on yeah yeah everybody get up in the line some people like not push through yeah I was at the gas station just now and uh you know how they have the big oil tankers they have to bring the gas to the gas station they were blocking they were blocking in where people needed to go to park and the guy who was uh there was telling me that some lady was just there and she was mad at him because he pulled in a few minutes after she parked to get gas in her car and he was saying that uh she was like you're blocking me and he's like lady I got me they're gonna block you in or I'm blocking the street I can't block the full street with all the traffic and then by the time she was ready to go she finally was like nudging her way out of the gas station and the guy was trying to help her and she's like don't help me I don't need your help all right and she's like and he said I'm sorry is gonna be a minute she's like I don't got a minute and then I asked I was like what kind of car is he driving he was like he was like a Range Rover new a new Ranger I'm like oh she's got plenty of one guy put his seat back before the plane took off you know you put me get comfortable here to see some crazy hey buddy hey you cannot put your seat back before the plane get up in the air gets wise on dude somebody's like I got the back of the chair on some occasion but I've been doing this for 20 30 years I don't give a fuck what you've been doing you cannot do it today passengers to passengers that's what was one passenger plane cop yeah cop yeah there's a there's videos of that all the time though I remember I saw one UH one of them out here leaving like coming into or leaving Burbank and it was like two guys who either the plane just landed or that you were just about to take off got into a full fistfight over I mind you as a Southwest flight over a seat that didn't belong anyone you know because over there that Airport they're probably going from Burbank to Vegas and they dude it was like hey I'm taking a seat no no that's mine and then next thing you know it's it's a it's a fight in between the aisle it is crazy that they serve you booze on the plane you can get drunk at the airport the alcohol is a drug and that drug is everywhere this client is lying it's a hundred percent so toe jam and bringing any alcohol to security know them in the house the kid we gonna use alcohol yeah it's hilarious and they're poor that stuff brother didn't get my dick they all know me on the plane so they give me a bottle to go this the witness will wrap it up in a towel like I'm gonna sneak out here with this big-ass bottle may I get it you know you know they don't want like liquid bombs or some shit they don't want you bringing some oh yeah right I got it oh yeah it's true I wish that wasn't something you ever had to think about but if it happens once every few years it's enough that you gotta think about

that's and it tolls hidden among never seen nothing like this oh and it's like dead what did I did fell asleep I think you're thinking of a different fight now Oh thinking of Vitor yeah that's the that's the front kick to the face one that's like a legendary kick the other one who's Chael Sonnen the Chael Sonnen one he kicked him and he dropped him then he need him to the body and took him out with punches unbelievable like this he can work dead foot how do you feel about your son's impression of you it's really good he doesn't think it sounds like him at all he doesn't it's yeah you know something well here I only know it because this is how you talks to me all the time he'll just be like mmm JB know what you would you what you do in a day you got work you go sit back and talk to all them people you'd be perfect for ASMR we should just make that type of it's not like him him just breathing at the airport coming from I think I was in st. Louis or something like that and so I'm behind his lady anybody Lambeth two three people in front of her and I'm behind her so I'm back then we make him a little noise she was like oh oh Latino woman Spanish woman and she looked back and she went back back to looking for with ninfea I said she said you make a lot of noise you make a lot of noise sir remember making any noise that's you do when you got in the car today you got in the car you I got express myself its noises and the noises and questions those are those are it like the moment you get in the car Najeeb you see what happen how how far we gotta go to get to joke yeah mmm we're driving 30 miles an hour he's like think you going go fast don't you think going a little quick on it on the freeway I'm like worth more on the freeways 60 mile I'm going slow right now but now his what his voice is just like one of many I've come across because I do voice over and all that stuff so it's one of those things where I'm lucky enough to have that one in my back pocket because sometimes I'll throw it out there and people that be like I don't know how people do it John Witherspoon presents interesting that's it yeah we practice on it yeah man with it it's gotta be nice though seeing him get into show business getting the stand up I came from Lemke's so I hope you be successful I'm gonna try my best to be successful he's too busy counting his coins to worry about you're on your own good luck cute but I mean he's you know he's supportive but he's one of those guys were cuz I didn't want to do entertainment at all when I was younger I wanted I want to do art and when I was drawing I used to go to college and then I didn't have to turn art into a career so one of my friends like why don't you try acting you're always wasting time in class making us laugh and I was like oh that's interesting idea so I started like doing commercial acts and won that but uh I have friends who are comics like I don't usually bring up he's my dad like it's something that just randomly happens usually like and when that comes across they're like oh that's crazy so you got like a well of information in the sense of being a good comic and writing and this and they're like not that I don't but it's just asking him questions about stuff like that is the funniest stuff cuz he's just been like like you just said it's very flat out and just kind of like yeah yeah JD uh be funny how much more can you tell a guy though really yeah just yeah you just got to get your own yeah people ask me do you go to the clubs and so help him right he doesn't I featured for him and he doesn't watch my set like I just go up and I do my I do my time and not coming to the cream room I'm like hey you ready to go and he's like oh yeah didi uh they sounded like they were laughing so sound like you did pointers or anything huh you ever give him any pointers a tips metabee funny I'm the one on the opposite spectrum giving him tips about like how he can how he can leverage like his you know his notoriety in this day and age on the internet that's my thing so it's one of those things were like if I have a question about stand up I'll ask but he doesn't you know yeah you should definitely have a very active social media yeah I helped him right so see um good yeah who's on me all the time here's the thing literally creating his social media was just a fluke cuz one day like five or six or seven years ago someone trended that he passed away and because of that we had to create social media for him so when that happened he's calling me and I'm getting calls from random people who know him and also my cousin's like I family call me crying like oh okay here's everything okay and he called me he's like didi you gotta help me uh some some wrong on the internet he's calling me so we created him a Twitter that day and then through Twitter I told him I'm like well just tell people you're around and we tweeted out like hey y'all this is the real John Witherspoon bla bla bla don't listen to those phonies making up them rumors because it was it was worldwide trending or whatever like hashtag r.i.p pops or something and then off of that is twitter gained like 25k and of like an hour and then later on down the road he got into Instagram kind of randomly where he just uh he had an Instagram didn't really post and then I think you did you did just a random thing where he was raining yeah I talked to I talked to Megan and and what's the name oh he was me he was making like a joke about like Bill Cosby and whatnot and he was like being a mess around with him that does stuff bill and whatever but other social media platforms randomly found it reposted it and now he's like he went from like 6k to like 120 but well let's try to keep in the loop it's a great way to avoid doing morning radio you don't like doing I give it I got to get up Friday morning I get to as I get the Kansas City at 10 o'clock that night Thursday tomorrow night and then I had to get a Friday morning I don't know the time or anything like that yet but I probably do three or four radio station yeah so I'm talking about we did we ticketed they drive you and you so sleepy yeah yeah I go getting over here then take a nap later and then what kind of wrecked when the first show is you got to do to show yeah so it's it it it's not fun and I'm you know I'm slowing down but if you build up your social media you can cut that part of it out early you know so you have like relationships some of those radio stations where you like them oh yeah I want to come in and do it that's cool if you want to do it but to have to do it you have to do it is have to do it it's not for your sleep it's just it's not good for your brain you can host like a story or like on like 90 or if you go post an Instagram video saying like hey I'm gonna be here this weekend yeah you get you don't have to do that get up in the morning stuff but they want to see me yeah these radio DJs right doesn't want to see pops they want to see pops oh man let you coming in needed some money that's why I'm a comic um what we're gonna tack on some I need money definitely explain that cuz I did have a question when I first started doing stand-up and I was like hey Dad from from a motivational standpoint say dad what got you understand it what is it that like motivated you to want to do it he looked at me and say motivate me I was broke because I was broken someone told me I was funny so I went to California and got on stage and I just started making dollars that was like so then what are you doing here you don't even like this I mean it's a Monday you know just love to make people laugh to you when you let out that money sometime sometimes on the way home see if I had a good week so some of them clubs pay a lot of damn money he paid over $37,000 for six weeks six nights for every four six chosen a weekend and I don't count the money but I've when I do one-nighters you know they have to pay you half of the money up front and getting give you money just before you go onstage so I've some I might have fourteen fifteen thousand dollars in my pocket

back that's a great show yeah I wanted the best cartoon I met the dude who created he was friends of my friend Todd yeah smart dude yeah Jesus yeah that's another one that you're on that you had like that he like fell into that's the funny part cuz because remember what the thing is I went in for that show to play one of the one of the leads or whatever it didn't happen but I remember cuz he's you know he's friends with Aaron and whatnot Aaron just called him in to do a like a one day roll remember we need your character to to just do the pilot I tried man I don't feel like doing oh Jesus I'm a homeless man so some bad I got into I thought it was cool yeah you want the job as yours good so he went in to do like a like a guest star role and then they were like dang he's funnier than than what we were thinking so we so they gave him a role that he was the series right you did three seasons we you did too did a third one that it hasn't aired yet and I use see what I did Hollywood shuffle I hate I played a man who had lost everything he was hungry so I'm sitting out there and Robert Townsend didn't have any money for wardrobe so I went at the second-hand store good wheeled and bought coveralls and old shirt and I had a t-shirt that I tore and put a pen to put it back up so that was I thought that was clever so this happened 20 years ago I kept that outfit in my garage for 20 years and I used it on black Jesus same thing I wore no Hollywood shuffle shuffle was it hokey what's the name Hollywood shuffle that's do you yeah but then they said yes so then they took so then he wore it they they did their thing and then they were like well this thing stinks so we'll just recreate it for you they did everything over it got the same outfit that I had my little wine there okay whatever happened at Robert Townsend why is he up to he's he's a director now just directing different movies not a different movie and commercials and things he's do stand-up - oh yeah we just on tour with him we worked all the big polices I remember his specials yeah he always had those HBO comedy special yeah oh yeah and Wayans did um yeah yeah did him yeah Robert Townes he's telling rhyme I saw a picture no my phone I don't know how I don't know it's probably a new jacket he does that at home he'll say hey I don't live with it I'm growing I'm married and I said I live on my own my wife he'll call me and say JD you've seen my my camera I move my camera and I don't know where it is I was like I don't live with you you know and my brother who lives with him still so it's one of those things I'm like what do I ask Alex he's around or someone who's maybe is at the house more off he's like not feel like you might be the one who do might know buddy cuz I've seen you around here I know you come around come take my base take your stuff I get know my cameras I buy camera and put it over there cuz I know where that goes over there I come back in over there I have no idea where that now because I put it over that's cuz you and Mom and Alex and whoever else what roams through the house we'll move things around all the time I don't there I'm not there to move things but I know what I know where I put things in and then when I come back is not there but but the thing is why do you call me when I'm never there mom will take his stuff mom will go shoot her little her stuff cuz she like produces those little independent movies so she'll when she grabs your cameras that's where they moved to but did you feel pressure doing stand-up because this is you know actually I didn't want to do it never really cuz I got into acting and I thought that was far enough I was like I'm my dad or does that I don't want to I don't want to jump into the rest of that stuff and it acting was just kind of like on a whim and then stand-up was like a dare a friend of mine was like we should because we back in the day not too long ago maybe early 2011 or 12 it's not back in the day but me and my boys were hanging out one night in our 20s and we just went we had come from a club and we drove past the Laugh Factory and I was like I was like you guys want to watch comedy Kyle and I was like 24 or something I was like I used to know that I was like the owner knows me from when I was a baby if he's there maybe you see yeah yeah Jamie Masada but when I watch your baby that's and that's introduction to it every time I'm there whatever I'm in was whenever shows that's his introduction for me he'll be like maybe like hey buddy I want you to meet John Johnny Witherspoon son I used to carry him when he was baby but uh we bring him on stage yeah we went there we went there randomly one night and we went there randomly one night and I remember the door guy I was like hey is Jamie here and he's like Jamie who like as if I didn't know him I was back of that I was like uh you know the owner and he's like tell him JD Witherspoon's here I didn't think anything I don't use my name like that but then he like comes down he's like buddy what are you doing here this and that you're doing comedy I'm like no no me and my friends just we just wanna watch a show he's like yeah come come in let's get him get him a bottle of wine all that stuff and we're just hanging out but then later like you know through the night he was talking he was like he was like so you're trying to do comedy like your dad I was like oh good I don't wanna I don't care to do that I'm fine and my friends were with me it's like come on he's like he's like you should try it he's probably funny maybe even funnier than him buddy and I and I was like I don't know but then later on that same week he was like if you ever want to come by he said swing by through the open mic or whatever and my boy Henry whatever yeah Henry Henry was like hey we should do that man that'd be kind of funny you know maybe we be comedians I was like nah I don't think so and then one night we just said I think I think I had someone's email from the Laugh Factory and hit him up it was like hey me and my buddy gonna come by maybe we can do the mic and then they're like yeah sure well throw you up this net and my buddy Henry he's the one who pressure me into it we practiced our jokes on camera at home to see how that would look it was the weirdest thing it's so weird we because I was I was like getting into like creating content and I was going to film school and I was making like my YouTube videos I was doing like sketch comedy on YouTube and then I like we shot like a little thing we watched it back I was like I guess and then we went to the mic that night and we went I did it I was at the back end of the the lineup so I actually had a decent crowd it was like cuz you know it starts off there's nobody there it's just comics and then by the time it was my turn it was like close to the 8 o'clock show so it was like 35 40 people I had 3 for my 3-minute set clean and I did it and they did all right they let people laughed and I was like I'll cast cool random you know and I didn't think much of it Henry Bob yeah nobody but it was just one of those things where after that no the camp the camera cameras over there you could if you gotta go but ya know so we win a trip well that's all fun I got a bit about how when you just get old you just don't care you just don't care about what you say he doesn't give a fuck no not at all but also like that's part of who he is like yeah as part of his business is not giving a fuck yeah pretty much yeah that that's I mean he's he's the funniest dude I personally know that's that's how that's how I categorize it you know oh that's it's I would think that like if that was my dad I would feel a lot of pressure I think it's pressure if i from the beginning always wanted to stand up you know kind of like a Michael Jordan thing I never like it was it was all a majority of the stuff I do now is very like just happenstance it's like oh I just fell into this and I'm gonna at it so I'll just keep doing it why not you know comes to things like YouTube and like I know you do unboxing videos and getting really yeah yeah you can kind of do that now if you're a if you're an interesting person ya don't really need much no no definitely not the internet no if dad came along today you just didn't exist and all suddenly exist didn't have this giant body of work and you just put a camera on your day like this is my dad your dad can be fuckin for ya know oh yeah if he was like a guy it works at the post office he's a regular guy film this guy proposed oh you were telling your friends like my dad is the funniest fucking guy alive and then you put a camera on him he would blow up yeah yeah it's it's it's interesting and whatnot I never really think of because people always ask me when I was growing up they'd be like how is it that your dad how do you feel I used to get the whole time the kids would be your dad's whoever blah blah blah famous this Neph Friday the Wayans brothers and I'm just like yeah but you know to me he's just my dad like he's just he's just goofball normal like to you guy I get it to you guys you see somebody who's an entertainer and what now I'm like he's just he's always like that how fun is he shoved his special because it isn't like oh he does funnier stuff he does weirder stuff I find that special and get it out oh I mean we could post it it's definitely or I could sell it and nowadays he can hit up me I'm sure his people can hit up Netflix like we have a we have a body of work yeah people would watch it that's the thing yeah play you talked him into doing a new special gotta get this something you got I'll have to talk him into coming back here and hitting the gym he does but he the thing the main thing is the the consumption you know it's you all right let's cut back on drinking and then continue exercise and you'll see the change I thought I tried to tell him do a drink every other day dude he's interested now it doesn't does it sounds like he's 100% interested in drinking orange oranges and joy he's 100% enjoying debt money and drinking my wine drinking Bob Wow yeah that's time he's back near man but uh they live in his life and join it yeah but that's that's how I got into comedy and then I just kept doing it in my friend was like yeah and I'm good I would say I'd started in 2012 but I I want to say I haven't I didn't continue in the beginning so consistently I did like Mike's for the first two years and then I started getting booked on shows and then I kind of got lazy it was one of those things where everything I was doing like I would weigh my options if something was more of an opportunity I would do that over trying to get better at stand-up but now I've been consistent for like 3 years 3 to 4 years just like grinding at it because I've made strides doing things and acting and and and creating content on the internet so now I kind of have I guess a little bit of a cushion to just go and get good now you know because I've been working so it you're doing other stuff yeah I don't have to totally rely well it's it's one of those things where
