you're gonna get a get in line oh yeah I have to get line I'll do whatever I have to do are you I'll probably get the bug and then just want it badly I like it man I do blowing away in line for like an hour know and a half an hour oh all right I was like let's see stands out if we just think about how long does it take how long is this line disorder if you order to ship it to you yeah but you get the same day when you wanted them immediately but will it will hold me over is that Samsung Galaxy s3 I want to see it man yeah I've heard good things yeah I'll pull it out let you touch I did have somebody at a show I want to touch it uh take take a picture with it and the screen look beautiful it's insane and you know what else you can do it can take a blast of photos I can take our really 10 photos in a row the high speed yeah it does some weird thing where you can you know jump up in the air and it'll capture like 10 different pictures it's amazing like if the deer that I got my backyard went to the bathroom they were going full-on running fast back and forth like for no reason like what are these guys doing we just run around them your house is surrounded by crazy deer yeah but there this is like the way they feel comfortable because my dogs can't get listen then nice animals who cares you bet you ever said lucky they're lucky that it's not illegal shoot them yeah will you shoot them there's a problem there's a problem with deer it's not a problem in my neighborhood because nobody drives fast you know it's a pretty quiet area but if you if you have this many deer near a main road it becomes a real problem yeah people all over the world crashing a deer I mean it's just a fucking really common way that people get injured and cars get fucked up fucked up ruined it from deer that big think of that how big that deer was and if that hit the windshield us break your fucking face man and if the things still alive and kicking and glass is flying your eyeballs and it's a motorcycle yeah you you literally have to kill those things you have to kill them and there's PETA people don't want to admit this but there's one of two options okay you either assume your position at the top of the food chain and deal with the problem or you bring something else in and you know at the top of the food chain yeah cuz that's the only way you're gonna have to deal with this issue what are they a everywhere so you either eat it or you bring in predators that's all you can do because you're either gonna shoot it or you got to bring in mountain lions and wolves so they proposed that we just let deer just explode in population yeah well they you know look they don't want people hunting right they don't want people hunting but I don't know what kind of ideas they have that to stop the population growth because if you don't manage that shit and this is something that you know when I was a young man I thought that like deer hunting like wow why would you ever want to kill a deer I didn't even think about the irony of wanting a cheeseburger and and not you know and wondering why anybody would go and kill a deer like it didn't even make sense to me but as you get older and you understand that you have to do something about the population if you don't do something about the population they're like rats that's how every there's gonna be a disease there's gonna be problems because every population needs to be put in check the cycle has to be the reason why the world so fucked up right now is because there's nothing that eats us that's like the main reason we can just dominate we can just run around all willy-nilly and nothing puts us in check and if that was the case with deer we would be fucked we would go 20 miles an hour everywhere they'll be jumping in front of your car everywhere you went the only good thing is we'd never go hungry you just pull over pull out a gun boom blow one of those stupid fucking things in the head start a fire you could eat you would never starve to death but there'd be deer everywhere and you wouldn't get anywhere and people would die on the highway every day yeah cuz you just hit one of those fucking dummies kick through your skull they fucking fuck you up how the fuck your deer jerky I love it that's good I have a box of it oh really yeah again I buy venison jerky and elk jerky yeah I feel like a man when I'm on mountain men I'm living or happen you our youtube-channel fearsome feeling fierce as fuck all right cut deers living in my yard bro I'm like a wild person okay or a wild person you gotta be careful about wild don't I respect that shit then keep it in line people that think that you shouldn't kill deer are ridiculous you're ridiculous have to do something with them you're ridiculous are you dangerous okay it's stupid it's not like they're gonna live forever if you don't shoot them and by the way killing deer is a thousand times better than running some ridiculous factory chicken farm stuff and everything into a fucking box where it can't move or just think about veal you know think about how they raise veal and how many pig farms or pigs are stuffed right next to each other and deers are just running around man just run it around I'd like to do the bow hunting do they actually need a lot of bow hunting it's cool but I don't think I can actually and I'm not good at stomaching the I'll show you something I really won't like really yeah yeah or this show called pig man and I've been obsessed with it from at the time I saw them first kill a pig with a knife yeah the dogs hold a pig down and they stab it in the throat with a knife that's yet show it's a hunting show it's about pigs in rural Texas yeah pigs in Texas are fucking huge problem and wild pigs are like literally like destroying millions of acres there's millions and millions of wild pigs it's ridiculous infestation to the point where they're shooting them out of helicopters yeah and that's one of the things that did on pig man this guy gets out a fucking helicopter and shoots like 200 pigs in a day well this is the disturbin that was disturbing but the most recent episode was way more mastered disturbing he's going he goes hunting in Argentina and he's trying to get pigs like these big giant pigs and there's no pigs around so he shoots off Fox he shoots a fox with a bow and arrow and the thing screams this horrible sound and it was really fucked up man it was RIT was really weird to watch because he nails this thing and it just lets out this horrible horrible screech and then you realize he's not gonna eat that right you're not eating that Fox like he just shot that Fox because he could shoot that Fox yeah I was like oh what for the pelts or something Jesus Christ what do we don't we live it in the fur trapping days you know you don't really a fur trapper I mean I guess it's worth some money but you just shot that thing because you wanted to shoot a fox yeah right when I lived in Colorado man foxes are cool as fuck so they're badass they're kind of cool man there's a what's it called coyotes that run around the the like Griffith Park the coyotes are different coyotes are creeps coyotes are my big dangerous creeps they are they're dangerous creeps but foxes are not dangerous to people at all coyotes will attack children but foxes won't foxes are come in pack very clever they do coming back and they come in packs down from they come down from the hillside and you'll all sudden like every few weeks you know I hear that that have like a maniacal high-pitched barking and dangerous bro yeah they're always in my front yard make it in there there they like play with my dog through the window like my dog will bark and then that coyote will come up and just like yeah that's stupid what I say about them is that the only reason I don't kill us is because they don't think they can get away with it that's all it is and they'll kill anything else around us including your children they will attack your children it's having a bunch of times I've seen I've seen a dog running like trotting a coyote excuse me trotting down fountain with a dog in its mouth oh yeah oh yeah yeah that's what they eat late at night they snatch them right off of people's leashes uh-huh people go walking around in like nice neighborhoods like Brentwood that go walking around with a dog on a leash and a coyote will come and snatch that motherfucker off and run and they're rats out here man the rats just walk on my power lines and you just going from house to house he just eats all the rats well that some guy they had a lockdown some house and quarantine it because some people caught some horrible rat disease from that hoarder show yeah they're cleaning up people's houses and you know these people had a rat infestation in their house so they talked and this disease apparently it kills like 20 to 50 percent of the people who get it and it's incurable there's no cure for it so these people are catching this horrible incurable disease from cleaning up people's shit houses Jesus rats everywhere and infestations I used to see those rats on the power lines and as when I worked in like a big corporate building and so I talked to the they had the guys would would come into the offices in the case and like set traps into this stuff so I was like hey I you know I'm terrified of the fucking rats what can I do about rats and he was like well you know he's tell me the options and he was like he gave me these uh he's like gel pad like sticky gel like it's like a it's like a big rectangular thing and you just place it he's like they'll be running and then they'll just get stuck in that and then they just rot and then they'll just die so I was like all right so I got I was so scared of them that I said fuck it I put it up on the roof he's like put like a little peanut butter and it'll just come right there cool I lay them out I come out the next day they are from the roof they're down on the floor now flipped over and shit on it's like the rats pick them up flip them over and shit all over them like fuck your trap oh really yeah and they just they were just kicked over it might rat shit all over there I had a really bad mouse problem when I was in college and like was so bad where the mice were just like like I'll take a blanket off my couch and mice would scurry out and go yeah when you have like in ancient infrastructure that's been infested like New York City's infrastructure it's really almost no way to eradicate them unless you would clean every person out of the city and then just kill everything alive in the city otherwise and even then you're probably gonna miss a few they're gonna be in crack somewhere hiding those tinterval cuts there's more Bratz I think than there are people in New York City yeah so we had one of those traps but my mouse like I was like what one day I was like what's that noise in my kitchen and I heard like like like just a shuffling noise and there's like just blood and there's a mouse there that was like biting his leg off and I didn't know what to do so I grabbed like one of those scoops that you forgot the broom and I threw it outside and I was like I don't care what's so I don't know what happened to I just never went into my backyard anymore she's crushed rats are yeah when you get a any wherever there's rats you just got to get the fuck out of there this is you can't win you're not gonna win you need to set up shop in a place that doesn't have rats like that oh the monoxide apps yeah the same house makes sense Jesus Christ what a shitty house yeah you got attacked by rodents and poisoned brain yeah - speaking of poison brain this new Sports Illustrated I know you're a football fan did you read this shit on Jim McMahon no I know he's he's not doing well I'm not doing well man Jim when I was a kid I was not a football fan but I knew who the fuck Jim McMahon was yeah he was a super famous football player yes bandanas needs to wear yeah yeah the Super Bowl shuffle well he apparently has dementia and he his girlfriend takes pictures of them together because one day she's worried he's gonna forget who she is because she sees it slowly slipping away like he'll be he'll kiss her goodbye and then he'll be downstairs just standing and frozen because he can't remember what he was gonna do I think football's on the verge of changing dramatically how the fuck can you that's they were talking to him he was on the sports show and they were talking about it and he said leather helmets might be the rule like go back to leather helmets and have no head contact at all yeah he said but that's not gonna work I mean it's like who's gonna accept that yeah I know I saw the oh my god on real sports on HBO oh yeah all those old players that come in on a king but they depth in that but they have this this guy I feel bad that I forgot his name he played for the Saints and he got ALS at like 34 35 and basically they said this is the first ever time we've ever seen that this traumatic just a head door that they're the severe head trauma repeatedly might be a cause of ALS we've never had we've never shown evidence that something could lead to ALS what is a low stand for it's a it's a long it's a medical term that I can't pronounce exactly but it's it's you know it destroys your muscles and the only thing it doesn't destroy as it eats away your muscles is your brain so you're totally aware of how you're physically just brave apperent evaporating and like they show he played in the in the first game after Katrina you know New Orleans was just devastated right and they the super the Superdome was used to house the city's residents who didn't have a place to go and they never know of they were gonna even be able to rebuild it they rebuilt it you know got it all cleaned up and then they had their first game since Katrina and it was like a big deal and he blocked a punt that just like sent the place into it's like one of the craziest you see the the clip of it's like it's super emotional place goes nuts they're so excited to have their team back and so he was that guy and he retired he played like eight or nine years in the league and was like you know retired and looking forward to the rest of his life how old was he when he retired he retired I think like thirty 31 years ago and then you know finally retired 31 uh he was just you know had his run like he wasn't you know he was a special teams player like he had a good a good career and then but that seems like there's plenty of years left in your athletic career um a lot of a lot of you know NFL guys are three four years and is it because of physical just don't make the cut yeah like a lot of times you'll see guys that they were like big contributors and then you know they're waived by this team picked up by this team and all sudden they're they're you know twenty nine even and they're like they're no team wants them anymore like they're it's so crazy yes you wear out you wear out I mean that it's so I can you know those collisions men and they asked him during the thing they're like how many times were you knocked out during your career he was like twice you know where I was like blackout knocked out and then how many times did you have like your bell rung you know where you're just like holy shit he was like hundreds hundreds of time practice those counters count to practice counts everything counts then we see you know junior say oh yeah I mean it's what do you do though do you tell people they got a stop playing foot I would not want my kids to play football tell you that I would be reluctant I know that like the one thing that the only way I mean the thing that most people agree on is that the proper technique is is not being taught from a young age now people are no longer like you look at old footage of football yeah they're different caliber athletes and stuff and they're not like the monsters but like it was techn it was more technical tackling people would you taught when you know you you lower you bend your knees you put your shoulder basically somebody's chest you wrap up you tackle those are the the tackles that rarely do you see that result in like some devastating head trauma right but now it's and this is now like meaning the last 15-20 years it is like you see helmets being lowered crown of the head into the other person's helmet just head blows people are fucking you know throwing shoulders helmets and and forearms into people's heads and then you see them like just their cook looks like they were just in a car accident man like they're just they can't handle it doesn't matter what type of helmet you wear yeah there's there's only so much punishment your your brain can take and I think that there's very few things in life that hit you as hard as a football player does I just think that those dudes when you look at a 300-pound guy running at you full clip and charging into your body why another guy hits you over this way and you collide together and then the guy goes unconscious like is there any other time in life where you see a man completely armored up just get knocked unconscious oh my god and there they have helmets on they have big armored padding on their shoulders and they get knocked the fuck out and the the real problem now their look they're more on top of it because they have to be but the real problem is you look at like 80s and 90s the guys who are now 40 to 50 yeah you're seeing a lot of like depression dementia dementia and you're seeing Alzheimer's and and all these different debilitating things take place those guys would get knocked out or you know they would get like a severe concussion and it would just be like you need to go play right away now like there wasn't like now there's like you know they're finally doing like if you even have a sign of this you're gonna be out for this amount of time you have to have tests because those guys played with like full concussion syndromes crotch means that like their brain just went theirs just shook inside their skull and now they're fucking playing again you know it's so crazy that they didn't even know it's like they that just shows you how recent not just the science of brain trauma is where they really kind of understand what causes like real problems but also the did the idea of this has a sport so recent in in the human medical veneno encyclopedia a far as like things that happen to people how often did they have to like judge a or or look at a very specific group like people who do this one thing who all come down with traumatic brain injury like what the fuck is going on what is this one profession you know it's not like being a welder does that but being it's a football player thing but this whole idea of a football player is like a hundred years old I mean it's new that's super new yeah so we did in the medical history of like things that you shouldn't do that are fucked up for you and this sort of hasn't really been fully fully entered but neither as fighting man I mean fighting like in as far as like people have known about punch-drunk boxers forever I mean that's always been you know the boxers stuck around to law and that the horrible stories and the the Lisp so the words that are you know stumbling slurring out of their mouth it's it's terrible to watch that stuff but we've we've known about that forever but we're gonna start to see that probably from MMA fighters if they're they're not looked after Stefan is well I mean they're they're they're taking shots to the head as well it's all about knowing when to fucking get out yeah it's all about use as much you know intelligence as you can risk as much as you need to but no more and then get out when you feel like it's slipping away yeah and you got a treat you've got a treat any real like head trauma a concussion mm-hmm like a really serious event like it's not something to just be like oh that happens like it's really really serious well I've heard of dudes get knocked out in training and then go to a fight and then get just hit with like a small shot in the fight and they go unconscious cuz they were really like walking around like halfway knocked out already yeah sure like Marvin Eastman fought Travis looter and Travis Lutter hit him on the end of the punch it was like it was really weird it didn't what it looked like like he just shut off like he hit him in his whole body and I was like that doesn't even make any sense then he talked to the people that trained with him they said he got knocked out twice in camp for that fight which is just fucking crazy and he was probably right back like the day after fucking taking shots yeah when I wonder if they're ever gonna be able to fix that and wonder if there's ever gonna be anything that can repair because the thing about brain conditions I think from impact is that they're degenerative and that just led these boxers actually they say that something happened to them ten years ago and they start to feel the effects ten years later mm-hmm well I think you know because it's it's so unnatural either to get like the trauma experience like that that's the one occurrence they have for their life they don't have that they don't go through that hundreds of times you know you have somebody you know everyone knows somebody are you in a car accident oh fuck and it fucked me up and you know that's that one time that happened and I had headaches you know for fucking years and I went to this type of therapist and I got this type of treatment once not like oh I've this is the kind of thing that happens to me every six weeks I get fucking just laid out and fucking pass out because somebody devastated my head well a lot of pic amps that didn't know any better they thought that that would toughen guys up so guys were getting knocked out in training all the time cuz they would go full clip and training that was like really common in a lot of camps you know I don't want to name names but yeah people they don't don't treat brain trauma with as much respect as they should yeah they did a lot of things fucked up I you know they used to not believe that you should give like football players water when they're like an August Jenny like to toughen you up like during practice yeah I feel like two and a half hours with no water it's like 98 degrees outside they thought that was like the smart thing to do they did a lot of stupid shit man they did a lot of stupid shit there's a lot of people out there that got their brains ruined because people didn't understand and now now but but now it comes down to this now we know now what do we do right it's because it seems like you can fight in MMA and get out of it without brain trauma I don't know if that's the case with football I really don't there's some guys that clearly have made it out okay but there's there's guys I think there's going to be this wave this wave of guys you're gonna see where it's it's not just every once in a while you hear the news of somebody it's gonna be just dozens of people that have severe you know brain injuries from football that's how they should get rid of the helmets yeah that's what they're saying it's been yes that is looked it's a very bright suggestion and people think it's silly though like what are you talking about that's even more dangerous it's actually not man that was it's also one of the arguments about MMA that they should switch to bare knuckles because you can't punch people as hard the other problem is you cut people a lot easier with your knuckles then they use a lot of a lot of fights would be stopped because it cuts elbows and knuckles cut people the most yeah but you can punch them on a lot harder if you got a little gloves on if you got padding on I mean the the helmet is used in football as a weapon well it's just like when you talk about the the you know the gloves that are dipped your hand wrapped yeah it's a weapon it's a fucking solid weapon yeah and it's protected by all these Pat's and embrace it against your you know your neck and everything and you're running full into somebody yeah so silly sport man it's as a human being I mean look it's super impressing if you and if that's how you make your living you know eight god bless you you know I'm saying god bless yeah but if you've got another option man you might want to not slam your body into dudes as hard as you can because it seems like that shit's bad for you I mean it's pretty there's definitely good argument against it cuz like a fight Oleg Anderson Silva can go through whole fights and not get touched me just fucks guys up and doesn't even get hit and you look at it and go well if you're super talented and super technical you know you can fight and not take that much damage you guys are all in Anderson's fights only the Chael Sonnen fight does he ever take like a bunch of punches and he's still have to find at the end of that and brain why'd you think he's alright yeah he's fine he's fine he's 100% fine there's nothing wrong with him but he's also he's delicious he's dishing out way more punches yeah there's a more delicious punches delicious take anything he's just fucking people up so hard yeah he he's I got a totally different confidence level than them he's on a totally different like striking speed wavelength he just put beatings on dudes man and so because of that he's not like taking much damage yeah but then you see some other dudes that he's fighting you know some guys he's fucking up and you go man how many more fights like this can this guy have yeah and every fighter has to sort of decide on their own they have to reach this sort of she's tough without thing to come to man yeah there's time to dip out yeah especially if that's how you make a living how you gonna pay your bills and the not to mention you know the the the rush they get of being like in the game you know yeah being part of like prize fights you know and you're fucking in an arena and people are screaming when you enter they're like that's a that's a rush you can't compare to anything you do in your regular fucking life yeah there's nothing like there's nothing like that that's a hard thing if I can put down it would be super hard to find something that can come even close you'd have to be like a fighter pilot or some shit yeah they say that that's like a lot of people are saying that's what say ow like you know he played in the NFL for like 16 years which is pretty much unheard of especially like I was like a linebacker and that like he just was hunt like he was depressed about not getting the that rush anymore you know being like in the in the games in the well so he I consider a little brain dump yeah yeah definitely yeah that's the thing man they say that brain damage they say once it fucks with your pituitary your brain stops producing the right amount of testosterone you get depressed from that you know you get there's a lot of different factors that can lead to like some pretty severe depression because rein trauma you know it's one of the arguments against testosterone replacement for four fighters actually yeah is the traumatic brain injury argument I don't I don't totally completely understand it but I think they're saying is if you get hit in the head enough like James Toney was an example of it you get hit in the head enough and your body's not gonna produce testosterone the same way yeah but then I've heard other doctors say and this kind of makes sense to me well hey man if you can't produce testosterone anymore because you got hit in the head so many times like maybe you should stop getting hit in the head that's a great yeah it's a great lesson you know it seems like that's the things just stop first yeah like yeah but forget about like trying to do anything to supplement your testosterone you gotta stop getting hit in the head cuz then your brains gonna stop working it's just like yeah many times can you hit your car with a hammer before the engine breaks it's like ye enough you know there's a there's great footage of James Tony sparring like a few years back and he's like he's pretty out of shape in it and he talks shit don't you hire time that's boring and he's like he's winded but he's just like bitch at ya like these guys well he's so technically talented James Tony his shoulder rolls and this ability to try to figure out where you're punching and block you and cover you he's a brilliant boxer yeah if you go back to the early days like when he knocked out Michael Dunn James Toney is a goddamn animal man he he's a power punch out tough dude and he became a slick ass boxer he just didn't have the same motivation to training that like some other guys did yeah like if he trained like Roy Jones jr. train oh my god yeah and what a fight that was him and Roy Jones jr. that was a fucking great fight yeah if he would have trained late like Roy Jones yeah that was too bad it's too bad he never sort of recovered from that did they fight again did they ever fight again I don't know if he fought twice I don't know I don't think they did why do I feel like why don't I feel like they didn't but James Toney was one of the only like major guys that ever tried to get into MMA oh yeah he did yeah yeah I fell Randy Couture how did that go didn't go so good whoo Randy Couture just grabbed him and threw him on the ground really wrangled him well yeah was it like a 10-second thing uh yeah was it was a joke Jesus he took him down with a low a low single got him an ankle pick I guess they were trying to plant it they were trying to plan the second fight no really yeah but I think James Toney might be a heavyweight now big boy yeah well they say that T yeah he said he they might do they say Tony's like 240 pounds and Roy Jones you know is still fighting but he fights it like cruiserweight sometimes or light heavyweights until he's not gonna drop down I've been watching Roy Jones fight - it's depressing as shit I know it's not it's not like the old days it's not just like the old days getting knocked out a lot yeah yeah I've seen him knocked out a couple of times you know he's a good analyst he's actually a good analyst yeah I don't know why he doesn't just fuckin you know yeah he needs money man apparently if you listen to the internet they say that he's another one of those dudes who didn't pay his taxes Jesus man yeah he owes millions of dollars well you know someone tells you you don't have to pay or someone's a shitty it is financial adviser or you think you got everything covered and you know that's this is never gonna go away a lot of those guys don't have good accountants man I know kind of pay your money you got to pay I don't think we should pay as much as we pay but I think you gotta fucking pay you gotta pay I get I get a little pissed off when I found out about a guy that's been living on high on the hog and it was millions of dollars in taxes yeah you know cuz like we should all contribute we should would this mean you know this Obama argument that everybody's upset at him because I said you know if you run a small business you didn't build that you didn't build the infrastructure he didn't listen that's what he meant like you didn't build the streets and everybody was upset by that but in a lot of ways that is true I mean we do need to pay everybody needs to pay a little bit of something it's just there should be some sort of an accounting should be able to find out how you're spending the money shouldn't be so goddamn wide open we have to give you money and then you do with it if you especially if you're a guy like him feel like how much money did that guy give them Roy Jones over the years in taxes millions and millions and millions of dollars millions well he should have liked the ad if it gets a certain number that you should be able say oh this is what we did with your money we went over and we use all your millions to set up a base in Kosovo you actually set up a base over there that'd be really cool and people would be excited to know that shit what did I really would if you think about like what Roy Jones spent either stretch of highway axis it's not done that's gonna be your shit yeah this is the Tommy Segura stretch of the highway it's not done yet if you look at um you know a guy like Roy Jones how much do you think he made it was it had to be I want to say a hundred million let's say that's not that that's probably accurate probably around there so it out of a hundred million dollars let's get super crazy and say you have to pay 48 percent because that's like the highest you can pay right without tax shelters and all that stuff that I'm sure a smart person would figure out or a good accountant so let's say he paid 48 million dollars let's just go nutty and be you can use that as a number it's crazy 48 million supports and all army somewhere yeah that's like what did he what country did they over this row with your shit that's your shit Roy Roy every night a virgin here with that body shot that's your jets and missiles and shit of yours Roy goddamnit really this is twice in one podcast that's powerful Duncan Trussell it doesn't obviously watch our podcast fucker I'm day and Duncan you just got sent to voicemail son I tell your listeners to come see me this weekend you

he's like right there you're right there if you just push a little right now you're you're professional comedian yeah like you can do that you and you have a built-in audience like you'd be crazy not to do it you really would he would totally be crazy not to do it cuz you can do it you get laughs you have some funny shit man that fucking I don't want to say the joke is it gives it away that one Joe I love that joke that's a great joke man if you just have you know chopping away at it and and and did it all the time and you could you go on tour you can do we could promote your shows like

like sort of a platform come here during the week everybody fucks around everybody goes and does their shit on the weekend yeah it'd be awesome but this you know this using the podcast to you know to work as like a promotional platform for stand-up comedy shows yeah greatest fucking thing ever it's awesome people really get to know you tommy bond they do it's not like you sit on a Tonight Show couch in my podcast is the most fun that I that I have doing anything it's cool it you do yours with your wife and you actually still like each other we love it man we love each other it's we have the most fun you guys are a lot of fun it's the best poop podcast I've ever heard it's not just poop guys no but you were a guest you were guest recently yeah and we got to get you to I would love to I would love to I'm doing Duncan's tomorrow but I'll do yours one day next week okay actually I'm trying to get a rich role who's the the vegan activist spiel was saying he got to get like vegans yeah just so we get this but he's an athlete and I got mac danzig also which is on Thursday who was another vegan and I had a friend of mine he's a vegan lunch today how about that so big this is in response to like vegans who's saying we need to get someone to do a counterpoint or Rob wolf because Rob wolf I had the paleo diet guide paleo author of the Paleo solution coffee bacon and eggs said that's a chef Rebecca oh my god I want to blow you looks like you I'm eating kale shakes every day trying to stay healthy and this guy says coffee bacon and eggs and I tried it I'm telling you it's not he's not correct they you have this heavy feeling of like it's that's what the coffee's supposed to counteract but it can't fuck with kale shakes these kid the my morning kale shake is just it's either that for me or hemp shakes that's all I drink in the morning and I have lots of energy like plenty of energy during the day I think we I think we have to be careful about how much stupid shit we put in our bodies and I would rather have no like put nothing in there than stupid shit not that bacon and eggs is necessarily stupid shit delicious it's delicious and I think your body processes fat and all that stuff it can process all those things it's all-natural but it's not as it doesn't give you the same like clean feeling as like starting off with a vegetable shake yeah so I'm gonna have this guy I'm gonna talk to heads cool that's cool you know he'll because he wanted to express himself he wanted to explain what the fuck is wrong with all these crazy meat-eaters we had we had Brett we had read ban on and we also if you guys go to your mom's house podcast if you check out mine we also had Yoshi on and health a story of when he ate Joey's banana bread and it's fucking now Yoshi has a bunch of crazy stories how about when he accidentally I put acid in his eyeball that story - yeah it's been tense he was at a friend's house in the Duta and eyedropper and he didn't know there was acid in the eyedropper and you needed to clean his eyes so yeah he was Japan yeah was in Japan but look eight drops of acid in his eyes which is like it's unheard of somebody told me the other day that that Joey Diaz did that to Jay more like like at a party like tricked him and saying that that was acid and Jerry Moore was like freaking out like that's some other comic told me this on one of it's churn a long time ago yeah like a long time ago yeah you're gonna start another cans I don't know if at Jay Mohr is gonna be mad at you again wait so supposedly the story goes that Jay Mohr was really freaking out he was he was fucking with him though yeah Joe Diaz was fucking with him the whole time it was an asset but like Jay Mohr was freaking out because he was like was that really was that really like well that's like what we were talking about the I don't remember what the phobia is where he either that people I really wish I could remember the word because I looked up the word that I thought it was that's not Aleph Renia Aleph Renea is that really no isn't that what I said already but that's about the someone's crazy and you're around and kind of thing yeah did that thing you know I mean it kind of makes sense that if someone starts treating you like you're crazy yeah that makes sense in your life you start to maybe a debt like you start to act in the behavior that they are conditioning you to act in you know I mean is my ex-girlfriend is that crazy your penis inside of them totally so it doesn't feel good anymore I can blame everything on them and then what else is to move get fat that's a good move that's how you get rid of them so anyway I'm gonna offer the vegan point of view because I think I shit on vegans enough and there's a lot of people why can't people just eat me and if you want to eat a little vegan like I consider vegan like I'm eating Italian tonight yeah they don't though that's what's fascinating about it it's a little if-- style choice it's a-you know you're making a decision that you don't want to do anything that's gonna harm the environment you don't want to do anything that's gonna make your footprint larger it's kind of I mean I I see the point I just interested someone's gonna kill the animals the that you have to kill them oh that's you're gonna start sterilizing them at birth and then who the fuck are you to play doctor yeah you could just chop off a deer's balls you gotta kill them I'm gonna bring Fogo de Chao that day I'm just gonna eat this little shit you saw the veg and so you can don't do that one of the smell of burning meat is to like a person so a super hardcore vegan probably nah it's them sure you know they're not supposed to have honey why not cuz bees are slave I'll fuck on that man I got 10 minutes on vegans in my new oh you didn't knew our oh it might be 10 minutes that's great it's just so so much silliness yeah it's almost like being a Mormon the only vegans like right up there with being a Mormon it's like at the end of it you're like wait wait wait what bees bees bees are slaves it seems so extreme men and I saw guys who like trying to encourage someone from to be vegan hey don't worry about that man don't let honey stop you from being a vegan I mean hey I don't I don't use it but don't let that stop you oh I don't use it oh yeah I'm super ultra perfect vegan man I don't know honey that honey man means like bees have souls behind ya like why put him to work why fuck your mother why why steal their work man I mean how is that any different in which you accused Carlos Mencia of doing that he's just taking the honey from these beans that shot your fucking stupid face is that hole yeah it's stupid like a fox hole you're telling me that we can't figure out honey delicious yeah honey is awesome we don't have to make it these dumb cunt insects thank you can we steal it from them yeah the way we steal it from them is with smoke these fucking stupid assholes and then they blow smoke on them then you scoop them up with a kitty litter shovel and you put them in a box and you close the stupid box and they buzz around for a little while and then you take all their fucking honey and you hack off those little babies that are growing in there you get the fuck out of here this little embryos that are in there cut all that shit out that's not necessary she can't me to that honey spot this bear likes is the hive there's all the embryos and the honey all together and the same thing I think so I don't know cuz I was over there fascinating when I was a kid and I would find a bee hive on the ground did you do that and like opened them up how weird was that when you see them in the hole oh shuttle and the little fucking pop they mean they're just like the alien they're just really tight yeah they're miniature aliens yeah especially if you watch them fuck up other insects especially wasps yeah there's a crazy documentary where it details this one wasp attack where they came and killed these honeybees and was an enormous wasp they were way bigger than the honeybees and it just comes in and just starts cutting the heads off the honeybees and these this one swarm this like thousand fucking honeybee colony was killed by like 30 of these wasps and it is fucking tough to watch man these things just like what would we do if these things were our signs oh man you wouldn't do jack shit I had wasp I got it walking into a wasp nest one time like amber one was and they just fucking it stayed in my arm like I was fucking it stabbing yeah and they the thing about bees too I found out that the Queen has a stinger you know the Queen Bee has a stinger but she only uses it to kill Queens oh really yeah they use it to kill virgin Queens when you when you find a new queen like when someone's getting together and putting together a new queen you got to Jack that bitch she'll come to take your spot because it can only be like one queen the nest so they don't use it just on on Queens when they're out they'll fuck up queen embryos they'll fuck up what are they what are they called what does it feed is what is the term for an insect fetus is it it's not an embryo brother right no whatever the fuck it is the the infant thing inside though the honeycomb they stab them in the side and that's how they know when they've been attacked by another queen like she knows there's a hooker in that box she's gonna go so just stabs it with her ass so that's what their stingers for their stingers not a stinger that injects venom it's just a sore yeah sore - kill the babies we're so lucky there little man we're so lucky they're little they were huge evil fucking cunts yeah fuck bees we need to figure out a way to get honey through little robots little tiny ass robot bees we should make drones that look like bees that make honey and how about we make drones and just look like bees except they're way stronger and harder and they come in and - fuck all the bees in front of their boyfriends you imagine it'd be like robot ease with giant robe be dicks like dogs like a cement wall and just we would have to have shotguns and fly swatters everywhere just yeah big mace fly swatters that if they did stab you it just like goes through your back be fucked yeah yeah size of a one the size of a softball would kill you oh yeah just fuck your dam yeah yeah I mean imagine dissing value from the fucking eat you alive oh shit man make babies in your body that's a movie I want to see that movie Tommy pons you're the best

think that crests there yeah the crest theater is really nice theater well we'll find out and then next week is the week after that is Toronto I'm at Massey Hall and I understand that there's some ridiculous scalping going on and that people are telling me that the tickets are like 300 bucks I have something weird the other day about the one of your shows that was canceled yeah and they charged like a ridiculous amount of money exter for some reason and then when they took it when they when the show got canceled they debit and that they didn't get the whole amount back really where'd you hear this fuck they told me this somebody in Columbus Ohio it was one of the guys from so there's like a cancellation fee or something yeah even though it wasn't there they didn't cancel right then you can't write and they say and it was like something like hey this guy's like add a lot of money I need to find out what the that might be not correct or correct I don't know we'll have to find out but anyway folks listen thank you very much for everything you guys are the fucking coolest human beings we've ever come in contact with you know we talk about it all the time I mean Aubrey talks about it when he deals with customers at on it and we talk about it when when we do these comedy shows whoo we're luckiest fuck man and just whatever we're sending out there the fact that you guys are picking it up in such a positive way and responding in such a positive way I mean there's no way to say this without sounding super corny but it's enriched the fuck out of all of our lives it's made us feel like we're really connected to something that can really help and change the way people feel and don't don't think we think that is in any small way I just don't think that we ever take it for granted it's a I don't it's a weird thing to talk about it because it's the whole it'sit's a very strange situation to find yourself in when you know we just started doing this podcast just fucking around and you know thinking we're just gonna talk shit and put on the Internet and maybe people with giggle and then having people come up to me like everywhere I go telling me now I've lost 50 pounds I started doing jujitsu it changed my life started reading the war of our so I didn't shoot myself we hear that all the time that's the scary one it's one of the scary ones and you know people that said they they don't have anybody like us near them and it's not that they don't think like us they think just like us they they're their free thinkers they're open-minded they're trying to be nice to people it's just sometimes we are defined by our environment but no long you fucks now we're all connected by this crazy thing and this podcast is a big part of it for us and we know that it's
